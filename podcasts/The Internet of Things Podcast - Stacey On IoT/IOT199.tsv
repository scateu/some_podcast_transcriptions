EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:15,264	| IOT199 |	Are you looking for an iot platform
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:17,056	| IOT199 |	Figure out why Kenmore and dealing
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:18,592	| IOT199 |	Pharaoh
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:21,920	| IOT199 |	Avero customers have experienced as much as an 80% reduction
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:22,944	| IOT199 |	In time to Market
EDL	00:01:23,456	00:01:25,504	| IOT199 |	99% pure support calls
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:27,296	| IOT199 |	And a 10x higher activation
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:31,648	| IOT199 |	Plus they can we use 90% of their work from one project to the neck
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:33,952	| IOT199 |	To learn more visit a pharaoh
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:34,976	| IOT199 |	. IO
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:36,256	| IOT199 |	That's a f
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:37,792	| IOT199 |	Ero.
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:38,304	| IOT199 |	IO
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:40,352	| IOT199 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:42,144	| IOT199 |	Let's get this started with
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:44,960	| IOT199 |	CES we're going to mop up the last bits of
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:46,752	| IOT199 |	CES trends that we saw in
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:48,032	| IOT199 |	Tested
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:48,800	| IOT199 |	Play with it
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:50,848	| IOT199 |	Lord only knows what else so
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:52,128	| IOT199 |	Kevin you came back
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:55,968	| IOT199 |	With CES play so we're just going to apologize right now for any
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:58,016	| IOT199 |	Any weirdness in Kevin's Voice or demeanor
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:01:59,808	| IOT199 |	Yeah
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:03,392	| IOT199 |	Kevin is on Sudafed for like the fifth day in a row so
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:05,440	| IOT199 |	We'll see how this goes
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:06,720	| IOT199 |	So something
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:07,488	| IOT199 |	Cuz I wanted to
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:09,024	| IOT199 |	I wanted a mop up some Gadget
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:11,584	| IOT199 |	It's cuz I covered them in various
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:12,352	| IOT199 |	Articles
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:14,144	| IOT199 |	Possibly in the CES
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:14,912	| IOT199 |	Episode
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,448	| IOT199 |	But there are a couple things that I thought were
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,008	| IOT199 |	One is Schlage
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:20,544	| IOT199 |	Does sponsor or voicemail
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,336	| IOT199 |	They introduced a Wi-Fi
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:23,872	| IOT199 |	And
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:26,432	| IOT199 |	You know I think that's a big deal it's part of a
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,456	| IOT199 |	Bigger trend
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:30,784	| IOT199 |	Towards adding Wi-Fi to as many things as possible
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:33,088	| IOT199 |	That we saw at CES basically people don't want to have a
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:34,624	| IOT199 |	So they're like
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:36,416	| IOT199 |	Hey can we do this with Wi-Fi or
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:37,440	| IOT199 |	Which makes
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:40,512	| IOT199 |	Bluetooth matches getting better so we're seeing
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:42,560	| IOT199 |	More low-powered sensors and such
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,072	| IOT199 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:46,912	| IOT199 |	The endless leads to something we've been talking about recently and that prior shows
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:48,448	| IOT199 |	Zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:48,960	| IOT199 |	I mean
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:53,056	| IOT199 |	They're just slowly fading away from at least on the consumer side
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:57,920	| IOT199 |	It seems it like you said people don't want to hug you don't even know what the benefit is
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:00,992	| IOT199 |	Which mainly is Automation and there are
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,784	| IOT199 |	Non-hub automation methods so
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,832	| IOT199 |	I don't know
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:07,136	| IOT199 |	Pino's Disick B&C way folks say just
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,672	| IOT199 |	I think it'll be part of the pursuit
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,976	| IOT199 |	I mean Amazon did put zigbee in the air
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,512	| IOT199 |	Plus
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:14,048	| IOT199 |	And I don't think it'll take that out
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,584	| IOT199 |	But yeah I don't think
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:16,864	| IOT199 |	I think if you're just
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,632	| IOT199 |	Casually trying to
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,936	| IOT199 |	Connect sump light switches to your
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:21,472	| IOT199 |	Amazon Echo or
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:24,288	| IOT199 |	No door locks are video cameras you're going to try for all wife
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,312	| IOT199 |	World
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:32,224	| IOT199 |	Write in a treehouse of my take on that on the CBS fam
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:37,088	| IOT199 |	It was like not even part of the conversation I'm curious since we split up most days did you hear Company stock
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,136	| IOT199 |	Only the zootopia lion
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,672	| IOT199 |	Switch text back..
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,440	| IOT199 |	Which is
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:42,208	| IOT199 |	There
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:42,976	| IOT199 |	Ziggy Ansah
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,256	| IOT199 |	Thread combination
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,280	| IOT199 |	Thanks so this is a
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:50,144	| IOT199 |	Deeply nerdy Wireless protocol for folks red was actually created by Nest way back in
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,168	| IOT199 |	The day and
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,192	| IOT199 |	With a bunch of other
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,240	| IOT199 |	And it is
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,032	| IOT199 |	Basically it uses the CB radio
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:58,080	| IOT199 |	Also 802
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,384	| IOT199 |	15.4
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:02,176	| IOT199 |	I hope tomorrow is like
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:04,224	| IOT199 |	So it's the same underlying radio
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:07,296	| IOT199 |	But it has software on top that lets it do things like
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,576	| IOT199 |	Go directly to the internet
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:09,856	| IOT199 |	IPv6 enabled
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:12,672	| IOT199 |	Smash therapy
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,440	| IOT199 |	Low power
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:16,000	| IOT199 |	So the idea is your zigbee stuff could actually be
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:17,536	| IOT199 |	Updated
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,303	| IOT199 |	Possibly.
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,071	| IOT199 |	Banana chips
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,095	| IOT199 |	Set to
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:20,863	| IOT199 |	Work with
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:21,375	| IOT199 |	With thread
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:22,655	| IOT199 |	And vice versa
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:27,007	| IOT199 |	Doesn't interrupt ability after they're also trying to bring it over Wi-Fi
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,287	| IOT199 |	Which again
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,335	| IOT199 |	So
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,359	| IOT199 |	Will see that would be
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:31,871	| IOT199 |	Thread over wife
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:32,895	| IOT199 |	Not
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,199	| IOT199 |	It feels
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:37,759	| IOT199 |	It feels like that ship may have sailed but
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,527	| IOT199 |	They said they'll be
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,551	| IOT199 |	Products and 22
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:40,575	| IOT199 |	23rd work
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,343	| IOT199 |	With DOT.
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:44,671	| IOT199 |	You know I look for products in the other standards news there's
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:45,439	| IOT199 |	Open connect
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:45,951	| IOT199 |	Ulta beauty Foundation
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:48,767	| IOT199 |	And they have their iotivity standard
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:49,535	| IOT199 |	This was
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:50,559	| IOT199 |	It was Intel's effort
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:54,143	| IOT199 |	They kind of subsumed all these Qualcomm alljoyn engineers
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,191	| IOT199 |	And basically I thought we'd hear from them at sea
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,519	| IOT199 |	But we didn't so I didn't know what to say to you guys
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,799	| IOT199 |	Is on the standard side
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,335	| IOT199 |	I'm feeling a big
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:06,943	| IOT199 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:07,455	| IOT199 |	You know
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:09,247	| IOT199 |	Boc F gas
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:13,855	| IOT199 |	Say that their products out there there's nothing that's not a Gateway really
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:18,207	| IOT199 |	You know maybe in 2019 we're going to see stuff but I really am not going to hold my
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,743	| IOT199 |	My breath on this y'all so
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:20,767	| IOT199 |	Your standards are
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,559	| IOT199 |	Pretty much going to be Madame a witch
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,607	| IOT199 |	We call Amazon's ecosystem
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:25,631	| IOT199 |	Or Google
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,935	| IOT199 |	And
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:29,471	| IOT199 |	And homekit in Wi-Fi and blue
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:32,031	| IOT199 |	So those are kind of diff
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:33,055	| IOT199 |	Layers
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,847	| IOT199 |	For most people
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,615	| IOT199 |	Those are kind of going to
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:36,639	| IOT199 |	Work with
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:38,687	| IOT199 |	So
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,199	| IOT199 |	That's
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:41,759	| IOT199 |	Is that the bad news that's just how the smart
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,319	| IOT199 |	And that is where we are
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,879	| IOT199 |	So back to his wife I like
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,671	| IOT199 |	Loxo Schlage introduces Wi-Fi lock
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,975	| IOT199 |	Wi-Fi is a huge power suck
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:51,487	| IOT199 |	So
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:55,071	| IOT199 |	That's why we hadn't seen a lot of Wi-Fi locks up until this moment
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,863	| IOT199 |	Company called Hampton
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,143	| IOT199 |	Arabian
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,935	| IOT199 |	Break Stuff they had a Wi-Fi locked
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,959	| IOT199 |	They have solar power in it
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:02,751	| IOT199 |	Help offset the battery drain
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,799	| IOT199 |	If you get the Schlage Wifi lock
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:06,335	| IOT199 |	Depending on temperature depending on
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,103	| IOT199 |	Number two
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:07,871	| IOT199 |	Packers like how often you
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,663	| IOT199 |	Open your door and use this
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:12,991	| IOT199 |	You're probably looking at maybe a 2-month lifespan
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:13,759	| IOT199 |	Inn on the batteries
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:16,831	| IOT199 |	Yeah that's a lot of batteries but it is
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,367	| IOT199 |	Is Wi-Fi
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,647	| IOT199 |	The Sleep books actually
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,927	| IOT199 |	They told me they thought it could last forever
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:21,695	| IOT199 |	At four months
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,231	| IOT199 |	I feel that's really
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,023	| IOT199 |	But maybe I'm just
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:26,559	| IOT199 |	I haven't tested it
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,351	| IOT199 |	The alarm test so
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:29,887	| IOT199 |	Want to see
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:32,447	| IOT199 |	So it's taking middle-ground and say it's 3 months
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,727	| IOT199 |	My Z-Wave lock
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:35,519	| IOT199 |	Usually 6
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:39,359	| IOT199 |	Easley the grant that I needed some I need a hub for that
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:39,871	| IOT199 |	So
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,943	| IOT199 |	Tentative get on the Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,223	| IOT199 |	Communicate with everything but
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:46,527	| IOT199 |	I don't know I don't know the people want to change their
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:52,415	| IOT199 |	Front door batteries every 3 months or 2 to 4 months or whatever it's going to be but we'll have to see him in the Proctors
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,207	| IOT199 |	In use for x amount of months
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:56,255	| IOT199 |	To be honest yes and it will vary
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:58,047	| IOT199 |	I mean weather drain your battery
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,399	| IOT199 |	If you got a hard lock to close and shut you know that my
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,167	| IOT199 |	Have some issues
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:04,959	| IOT199 |	You know any other thing I noticed
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:06,239	| IOT199 |	With my zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,519	| IOT199 |	Blocks they actually if
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:11,103	| IOT199 |	If you didn't connect them to the hub their batteries drained a lot faster
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,895	| IOT199 |	Because they were constantly trying
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:14,687	| IOT199 |	Connect to something so
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:21,087	| IOT199 |	Emma switch the locks would kind of be reversed in that the bolt that goes from the door where the lock is into the
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:21,855	| IOT199 |	Frame of the door
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:24,159	| IOT199 |	It actually came through the frame into the door
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,695	| IOT199 |	Because then you can actually wire it
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,719	| IOT199 |	Oh that's a really in
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:30,559	| IOT199 |	Yeah I don't know if it says secure
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:32,607	| IOT199 |	I can't see why it would be
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,375	| IOT199 |	Alright we'll see if
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:38,495	| IOT199 |	Hey if you work in the lock industry and have thoughts on that give us a call I mean that would be a
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:45,407	| IOT199 |	Something you have to build in that would be kind of a pain to Retro retrofit project old door frame out
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:48,735	| IOT199 |	Although it's a yes I talked to the mowing guys and they're changing the way they do
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:51,039	| IOT199 |	Plumbing a new houses so
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:51,807	| IOT199 |	Because these like
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,855	| IOT199 |	They're talking about like having connectivity in
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:56,927	| IOT199 |	The shower so that means you got to have electricity in with your showers
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:58,207	| IOT199 |	So what they're doing
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,231	| IOT199 |	Instead of putting a
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,999	| IOT199 |	Electricity right by
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,279	| IOT199 |	Behind the shower wall
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:02,047	| IOT199 |	Pudding
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,071	| IOT199 |	They're basically
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:03,839	| IOT199 |	Putting it
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,375	| IOT199 |	In a junction box where all the
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,399	| IOT199 |	The pipes for the shower
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,471	| IOT199 |	And that's where they're trying to add the elec
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:09,983	| IOT199 |	Atrocity
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,031	| IOT199 |	And I thought that was kind of an interesting thing
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,311	| IOT199 |	Now if you're doing a bathroom
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,871	| IOT199 |	Which is probably when you put the stuff in
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,407	| IOT199 |	You could do that fairly easy
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,199	| IOT199 |	So it's kind of an interesting
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:21,247	| IOT199 |	I think about how the Smart Home
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:23,039	| IOT199 |	Like these connectivity Alamo
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:23,807	| IOT199 |	Interchange
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:24,575	| IOT199 |	Design of Art
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,855	| IOT199 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,135	| IOT199 |	Another thing that
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,927	| IOT199 |	I feel like we should talk about because it's
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:30,463	| IOT199 |	Pretty freaking awesome
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,487	| IOT199 |	Is Chamberlain
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:33,023	| IOT199 |	They did a deal with Amazon
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:35,839	| IOT199 |	So now you can use the Amazon key
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,375	| IOT199 |	Key Program Ashley it's not now.
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,399	| IOT199 |	It'll be later this year
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| IOT199 |	The first half
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,959	| IOT199 |	This year what will happen is
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:43,519	| IOT199 |	If you sign up as a Prime member for the Amazon
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,287	| IOT199 |	Key Program
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,567	| IOT199 |	You can actually
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,847	| IOT199 |	Have the
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,639	| IOT199 |	Amazon delivery person open York
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:51,967	| IOT199 |	Garage door if you have a Chamberlain MyQ compatible garage door
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:55,551	| IOT199 |	And that is so much better in my opinion because
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,831	| IOT199 |	Nobody's actually Ortega
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:09:00,415	| IOT199 |	In your house as soon as your door from the house into the garage is locked in.
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:01,951	| IOT199 |	Yes
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:05,023	| IOT199 |	And I'm like super excited about this one because I live in
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:06,815	| IOT199 |	Texas where we have huge homes in
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:08,863	| IOT199 |	Lots of people in Costco so
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:10,143	| IOT199 |	A lot of people actually have her
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:12,191	| IOT199 |	Refrigerators or freezers in there
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:12,959	| IOT199 |	Garage
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:17,567	| IOT199 |	And so imagine being able to do grocery delivery into someone's garage as opposed to leaving it on
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:21,663	| IOT199 |	Porch if only amazon-owned
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,967	| IOT199 |	Although here I will tell you guys
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:27,295	| IOT199 |	That we get our groceries delivered on the rare occasion or sometimes
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,087	| IOT199 |	But they always take everything in a
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,391	| IOT199 |	Which is terrible if you have bananas
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,671	| IOT199 |	Cuz then they come out Brown
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,951	| IOT199 |	That is it so if you're going to
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:34,975	| IOT199 |	You're going to buy like four
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:36,511	| IOT199 |	The grocery store
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:37,535	| IOT199 |	You should not buy bananas
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,863	| IOT199 |	That is not a smartphone
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,399	| IOT199 |	Pro tip that is just a general
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:43,679	| IOT199 |	Privileged
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,007	| IOT199 |	That's a produce tip
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,031	| IOT199 |	A produce tip
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:48,799	| IOT199 |	Thank you
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:51,103	| IOT199 |	So I thought that program was really
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:53,407	| IOT199 |	Interesting there no fees for the consumer for
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:57,759	| IOT199 |	For that it does open up like you could deliver a lot more interesting things
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:59,039	| IOT199 |	Like you could order a larger TV
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:02,623	| IOT199 |	Computer I have no idea what I would order
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:03,903	| IOT199 |	But I like it
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:06,719	| IOT199 |	And I think it's probably something I would sign up for
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,767	| IOT199 |	Where is Amazon key I would not touch that with a
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,303	| IOT199 |	12 foot pole
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:13,375	| IOT199 |	I am right there with you even though I'm home most of the time I still don't
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,143	| IOT199 |	Amazon
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:16,191	| IOT199 |	Yes oh I should tell you that
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:16,959	| IOT199 |	Y'all
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:19,007	| IOT199 |	It is going to only go live in 37 C
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,055	| IOT199 |	Austin is one of them
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,823	| IOT199 |	I don't know about Harleys
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:27,455	| IOT199 |	I'm thinking not cuz we're not really a city classified as a village
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,479	| IOT199 |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:31,807	| IOT199 |	The village of Harleysville is what greets you on the side when you
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,087	| IOT199 |	Drive to miles
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:35,647	| IOT199 |	Strep throat
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:39,999	| IOT199 |	The other thing that I was excited about it CES was a lot of health and wearables
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,815	| IOT199 |	Some of it felt like digital snake
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:45,631	| IOT199 |	Best Buy
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:48,447	| IOT199 |	We'll have an algorithm then it will help you pick your
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:52,031	| IOT199 |	Best foods for your metabolism or we have an algorithm in it will help
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:52,799	| IOT199 |	Help you
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:53,567	| IOT199 |	I don't know
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,847	| IOT199 |	Use your brain better
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,127	| IOT199 |	So those
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,151	| IOT199 |	Agreed with a lot of
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:58,943	| IOT199 |	But
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,967	| IOT199 |	I will say that
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:03,807	| IOT199 |	I felt like we actually saw some really interesting devices that took
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:05,599	| IOT199 |	Like the last generation
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:06,367	| IOT199 |	Snuff devices
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:08,927	| IOT199 |	Where you're like oh I'm going to give you information about
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,695	| IOT199 |	But your steps
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:11,231	| IOT199 |	And took that into like
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:12,767	| IOT199 |	Dunkin give you actual actual
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:13,791	| IOT199 |	Information about your
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:20,703	| IOT199 |	Yeah there was quite a few of those some of the snake oil things I've actually having fun taking pictures of people trying them
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:27,103	| IOT199 |	People accept out in special massage chairs and wearing like a thing on their head that would massage their brain man was
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:28,127	| IOT199 |	Pine, Co
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:31,711	| IOT199 |	But there's definitely been some advancements useful advancements in this area
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:35,039	| IOT199 |	And I think podcast
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,831	| IOT199 |	Pryor when we're at CVS
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:39,391	| IOT199 |	Thinking about next gen tie products
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:41,695	| IOT199 |	Why things came out with their moves
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:46,047	| IOT199 |	ECG watch $429 which adds the same ucg type
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:48,095	| IOT199 |	Functionality that the Apple watch 4 has
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,887	| IOT199 |	Obviously too much lower price
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:50,655	| IOT199 |	And
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:54,495	| IOT199 |	You know I thought I thought price-point the addition of that to their existing line
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,775	| IOT199 |	Was rather smart on their part
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:56,799	| IOT199 |	Yes
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:59,103	| IOT199 |	And we also had some
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:11:59,615	| IOT199 |	Smart
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:00,895	| IOT199 |	Blind
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:05,503	| IOT199 |	News I mention this because every that is like one of the number one request once you get your license
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,575	| IOT199 |	I would like to make
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:09,599	| IOT199 |	My blind smarter
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:11,647	| IOT199 |	And there's been a bunch of Kickstarter efforts
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,159	| IOT199 |	Really have
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:14,207	| IOT199 |	There's also a
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,487	| IOT199 |	Company called mysmartblinds
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,535	| IOT199 |	It's about $150
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,047	| IOT199 |	For that
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,327	| IOT199 |	Retrofit
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:22,911	| IOT199 |	On your existing wooden slat blinds so it's kind of expensive
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:23,679	| IOT199 |	But I ran into
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:25,215	| IOT199 |	Access
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,775	| IOT199 |	In this company actually
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:30,335	| IOT199 |	She has like a little motorized thing that you attach
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,615	| IOT199 |	Hatched here existing
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,639	| IOT199 |	Chords
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:34,175	| IOT199 |	Has to be a continuous loop
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:35,199	| IOT199 |	Court that's the one thing
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,479	| IOT199 |	It's kind of a pain
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:39,039	| IOT199 |	But if you have that you attach this connected device
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:39,807	| IOT199 |	What the motor in it
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:41,599	| IOT199 |	He'll actually raise and lower your blinds for
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:44,415	| IOT199 |	It's $250
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,439	| IOT199 |	It's available now in Amazon
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,719	| IOT199 |	And
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,487	| IOT199 |	I thought that was
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:48,767	| IOT199 |	Pretty neat but
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:49,535	| IOT199 |	At the same time
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:50,815	| IOT199 |	Ikea
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,839	| IOT199 |	Announced smart
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:54,143	| IOT199 |	This is about
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,679	| IOT199 |	Time I went to Ikea like
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,703	| IOT199 |	Gosh last
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,519	| IOT199 |	I think it was last brainless summer
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:00,543	| IOT199 |	I don't remember
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:02,335	| IOT199 |	It was months ago I remember you telling me
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:02,847	| IOT199 |	So long
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,383	| IOT199 |	Hand
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,407	| IOT199 |	They showed me this
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:06,687	| IOT199 |	And they were
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:08,735	| IOT199 |	And they were going to be
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:09,759	| IOT199 |	So cheap
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:11,295	| IOT199 |	Kevin do you remember how much they cost
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:17,183	| IOT199 |	I think they start at $113 and go to Lake 180 or so depending on the width
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,975	| IOT199 |	So that's a little more than they
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:19,999	| IOT199 |	Lacoste at the time
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:23,327	| IOT199 |	But that's fine cuz still those are really real
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:24,863	| IOT199 |	And these are all
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,887	| IOT199 |	These are a whole set of shape
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,935	| IOT199 |	This is not a right
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:31,519	| IOT199 |	Right and the retrofit would not work for me because I
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:33,567	| IOT199 |	Considered it but I buy cellular
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,615	| IOT199 |	Shades with no cord
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,639	| IOT199 |	So there's no
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:38,943	| IOT199 |	When I can retrofit there's nothing to
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:40,735	| IOT199 |	Winder online if I had a motor there
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:43,551	| IOT199 |	I may go look at the I can try
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,063	| IOT199 |	For the shades
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,343	| IOT199 |	There you go
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:48,927	| IOT199 |	So yeah so smart blind World finally opening up
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,951	| IOT199 |	Woohoo
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:54,815	| IOT199 |	I mean I know this is a silly thing to get excited about but I guarantee you a lot of people are going to be excited
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:57,119	| IOT199 |	I don't think it's silly because most of the
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:59,167	| IOT199 |	Smart blinds to date
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:02,495	| IOT199 |	You're literally you're starting it for $300 a window
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:03,263	| IOT199 |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,287	| IOT199 |	Yeah it's very expensive
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:06,335	| IOT199 |	And if you want to go like
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:09,151	| IOT199 |	Crazy higher-end shades are you have a lot of fiber
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:10,431	| IOT199 |	Then you're looking at like
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,735	| IOT199 |	I'll tell you guys I have these like
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:13,759	| IOT199 |	10 x 14
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:14,527	| IOT199 |	Cheap windows
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:16,575	| IOT199 |	My shades basanti Shades I have Earth
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,623	| IOT199 |	$10,000 a window
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,159	| IOT199 |	I mean it is
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:22,207	| IOT199 |	TQ
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,487	| IOT199 |	Yeah and
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,511	| IOT199 |	I had to spend
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,279	| IOT199 |	An extra Lake
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:28,095	| IOT199 |	Six hundred bucks to get a retrofit
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:30,143	| IOT199 |	Play the special proprietary Radio 2
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,423	| IOT199 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,447	| IOT199 |	Converter
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:35,519	| IOT199 |	That is not my favorite to buy some he did actually announced a
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,311	| IOT199 |	Cubs it does there
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,079	| IOT199 |	Proprietary
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:38,591	| IOT199 |	WiFi camera
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,127	| IOT199 |	So now that it's
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:44,223	| IOT199 |	And I'm assuming he's require the tradfri Hub
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:44,991	| IOT199 |	They do require
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:48,063	| IOT199 |	Expensive
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:48,831	| IOT199 |	No not that one
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:50,111	| IOT199 |	I got one of everything
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,135	| IOT199 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,695	| IOT199 |	Other cesa
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:56,767	| IOT199 |	You know anything else that stuck out at you or you were like
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:15:03,935	| IOT199 |	You know I hate to be maybe it's cuz of my medicine me I hate to be the downer but I can wait from CES
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,471	| IOT199 |	Just kind of
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:06,751	| IOT199 |	Attitude
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:09,311	| IOT199 |	Any other cool gadgets and you mentioned a bunch
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:11,359	| IOT199 |	Instagram
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:13,663	| IOT199 |	Talk about them in the last show but you know
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:20,575	| IOT199 |	I don't maybe my expectations are too high this smart home is still not smart I'm wondering in this is what I wanted to say
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:22,367	| IOT199 |	CTS where is the predictive
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,415	| IOT199 |	Learning and
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:26,207	| IOT199 |	Machine learning and AI
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:26,975	| IOT199 |	Big Data
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,743	| IOT199 |	We can
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:33,119	| IOT199 |	Using devices for years several years now and all this data is collected on how we use the
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,911	| IOT199 |	Protocol Smart Home
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:38,751	| IOT199 |	But we still basically have voice control and program yourself automation
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:44,895	| IOT199 |	Why doesn't the home say hey I notice you turn your lights on within 5
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:48,735	| IOT199 |	It's still very manual and I don't understand that
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:55,647	| IOT199 |	I don't either I mean I don't know about you but I signed up for the Amazon hunches which is the closest we're getting to that so far but
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,927	| IOT199 |	I haven't actually gotten
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:58,719	| IOT199 |	There are no
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:01,791	| IOT199 |	I have a hunch it's not that exciting
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:03,327	| IOT199 |	Well maybe but you know
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:05,887	| IOT199 |	Oh I should mention briefly
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:07,679	| IOT199 |	Digital assistants in cars was
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,191	| IOT199 |	Totally a thing
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:09,983	| IOT199 |	So
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:11,007	| IOT199 |	Send I thought of that
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:13,823	| IOT199 |	Because I still haven't been invited to try out the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:14,847	| IOT199 |	Car think so
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:18,943	| IOT199 |	And related to what I was talking about and digital assistants
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:19,967	| IOT199 |	Google did
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:20,735	| IOT199 |	Announce
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:23,551	| IOT199 |	Through its partner Hard Rock Orlando valet
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,855	| IOT199 |	4 inch touch screen smart clock
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,135	| IOT199 |	It's $79
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:33,279	| IOT199 |	It's like the other smart displays obviously smaller microphone no camera for his touch screen as I said speaker
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:34,815	| IOT199 |	And
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:38,911	| IOT199 |	It will actually this is kind of what I'm hoping to see for
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:43,007	| IOT199 |	It will suggest alarm times based on your morning and evening routines
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:44,543	| IOT199 |	And my hope is
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:50,431	| IOT199 |	Since Google knows the events on your calendar like if you got an early meeting or something and traffic is bad and already knows that
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,967	| IOT199 |	Can tell you that
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:55,807	| IOT199 |	Practically maybe we'll start using that data to suggest
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:57,087	| IOT199 |	Alarm times and such
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:59,135	| IOT199 |	Sure wake you up early
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:01,951	| IOT199 |	Yeah see that's now that's a smart home
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,743	| IOT199 |	Example that's the stuff
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:05,279	| IOT199 |	I want to see and
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:07,071	| IOT199 |	That was like the only real
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,863	| IOT199 |	Glen said that that I got it for you
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,911	| IOT199 |	Yeah maybe next year
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,447	| IOT199 |	I didn't actually say that every year
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:14,239	| IOT199 |	I was disappointed by the
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:15,007	| IOT199 |	The lack of like soup
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:17,055	| IOT199 |	Check everyone is very focused on
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,359	| IOT199 |	5G or Smart Home
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,127	| IOT199 |	Connect with Google
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,407	| IOT199 |	Madam
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:23,199	| IOT199 |	In that to me was like
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:26,015	| IOT199 |	There was just an extension of last year
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:27,295	| IOT199 |	Yeah I felt like
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:29,343	| IOT199 |	I didn't see anything cool with like
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:31,903	| IOT199 |	I don't know designs for better battery life
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,671	| IOT199 |	The things that I
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,183	| IOT199 |	Look for that are
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,975	| IOT199 |	Blow me out of the
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:37,791	| IOT199 |	The water like oh this actually could change the way we build products
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:40,351	| IOT199 |	I didn't see any of that I usually see some
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,375	| IOT199 |	But I did see
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:43,679	| IOT199 |	So in 2017 I saw a device like
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,959	| IOT199 |	I thought it was a meme space
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:45,471	| IOT199 |	Projector
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:46,495	| IOT199 |	You can interact with
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:49,055	| IOT199 |	It was from basa basa actually product
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:51,615	| IOT199 |	So that was kind of
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:53,919	| IOT199 |	But sadly no one else seems to be using
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:54,943	| IOT199 |	Sing its own kind of like
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,455	| IOT199 |	Oh
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:57,759	| IOT199 |	Oh well
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:03,903	| IOT199 |	Let's talk about let's talk about security which no one talked about
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:04,927	| IOT199 |	Yes I didn't get a lot of
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,439	| IOT199 |	Security and privacy
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:07,999	| IOT199 |	Personally I don't know
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:08,511	| IOT199 |	Nope
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,583	| IOT199 |	This is actually more on
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:12,351	| IOT199 |	The Enterprise
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,655	| IOT199 |	Industrial site but it's chilling nonetheless
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:16,959	| IOT199 |	Gemalto found that nearly half of work
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,983	| IOT199 |	Organization state
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:21,567	| IOT199 |	Actually can't tell if they're iot devices were breached
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:22,591	| IOT199 |	So this is
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,871	| IOT199 |	This is a call for
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,639	| IOT199 |	Auditing
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,919	| IOT199 |	You guys which is it
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:26,431	| IOT199 |	Erie Airport
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,711	| IOT199 |	To have his party
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,479	| IOT199 |	If your security rep
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:34,367	| IOT199 |	So gemalto surveyed 950 it and business decision-makers for this
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,135	| IOT199 |	Report that they made
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,927	| IOT199 |	So most organization
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:37,695	| IOT199 |	Consider iot
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:39,231	| IOT199 |	Security to be a priori
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:43,839	| IOT199 |	Nearly two-thirds so that's 57% of survey
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,375	| IOT199 |	Ben said their organizations
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:47,679	| IOT199 |	Have adopted a security by Design approach
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,703	| IOT199 |	Search for creating their own iot
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:49,983	| IOT199 |	And
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:53,055	| IOT199 |	Fewer than that so 46% said they thought that
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,591	| IOT199 |	Securities the main consideration
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:55,103	| IOT199 |	Customers
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,175	| IOT199 |	I can go with that
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:00,991	| IOT199 |	Even consumers choose based on price
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,015	| IOT199 |	Enterprises
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,039	| IOT199 |	Their security
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:05,087	| IOT199 |	Concerned so I'm not sure
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,111	| IOT199 |	Who these people they in
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,391	| IOT199 |	Radar
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:07,903	| IOT199 |	So if it's
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,183	| IOT199 |	Consumer
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:09,951	| IOT199 |	If they're selling to
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,231	| IOT199 |	Consumer marketer in Enterprise
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,535	| IOT199 |	Other services found
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:17,119	| IOT199 |	Upwards of 80% of Enterprise users iot security is their biggest
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,911	| IOT199 |	Barrier to adoption
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:23,263	| IOT199 |	So security is typically right up there
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,287	| IOT199 |	No question
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:28,383	| IOT199 |	But less than 14% of the survey respondents iotv
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,151	| IOT199 |	Kids are going towards
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:30,943	| IOT199 |	So
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:31,455	| IOT199 |	That's
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:32,991	| IOT199 |	That's not green
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:35,295	| IOT199 |	And less than 2/3
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:38,879	| IOT199 |	Only 59% says their organization and Crips all the day today
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:40,415	| IOT199 |	The capture or store Vio
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:43,231	| IOT199 |	That one jumped out of me that kind of
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:43,999	| IOT199 |	Shock Me
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:44,511	| IOT199 |	Yeso
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:47,583	| IOT199 |	I'm a little concerned everybody should be storing their stuff in it
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,655	| IOT199 |	Everybody should actually be doing
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,447	| IOT199 |	Security by Design
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:56,799	| IOT199 |	And you know everybody needs to have auditability so they understand
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:58,079	| IOT199 |	Like when
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,871	| IOT199 |	Things happened that they should know about
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:06,783	| IOT199 |	This is it expensive it's hard but if you're going to actually put centers on everything and start Gathering the data that you need in
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:07,551	| IOT199 |	And storing it
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:09,087	| IOT199 |	You have to protect that data
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:11,391	| IOT199 |	I find it interesting that if
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:13,951	| IOT199 |	Security is like a number one priority
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,743	| IOT199 |	One of the easiest ways to
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:19,839	| IOT199 |	Check the data is to encrypted and yet companies are investing the time and effort to encrypt
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:25,215	| IOT199 |	Okay there we go
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:25,727	| IOT199 |	And
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:27,263	| IOT199 |	I don't know what else to say
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:28,543	| IOT199 |	But
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:30,335	| IOT199 |	For the more advanced people who are like
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:32,383	| IOT199 |	Encryption is not enough
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,663	| IOT199 |	Take it a step further
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,687	| IOT199 |	The IEEE
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:35,455	| IOT199 |	Has a solution
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:37,503	| IOT199 |	And boy howdy
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:38,783	| IOT199 |	It is quite the same
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,551	| IOT199 |	Solution
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,063	| IOT199 |	So
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,367	| IOT199 |	It is quite the name as well
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:45,439	| IOT199 |	It is so they're calling this
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:47,487	| IOT199 |	A reconfigurable secure
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:49,279	| IOT199 |	Security framework for iot
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:50,559	| IOT199 |	The acronym is
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,839	| IOT199 |	Res iot
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,887	| IOT199 |	The idea is you
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:56,447	| IOT199 |	You put a software-based security agent
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:58,751	| IOT199 |	On a wireless router a base station
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:20:59,519	| IOT199 |	Or a gateway
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:01,567	| IOT199 |	Spice so you put this on
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,615	| IOT199 |	Somewhere in your organization
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,151	| IOT199 |	You can talk to this
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:06,687	| IOT199 |	And it
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:08,223	| IOT199 |	Basically lets
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:11,295	| IOT199 |	That's kind of is a gateway security Gateway yes
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:13,343	| IOT199 |	The GateKeeper
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:15,135	| IOT199 |	It makes sense
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:18,464	| IOT199 |	Community can protect everything from the router on down this way
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:19,232	| IOT199 |	Gear
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:21,792	| IOT199 |	In much better shape what I don't understand
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:22,816	| IOT199 |	And this comes from
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:24,864	| IOT199 |	My other hat when I read about Chromebooks
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:27,936	| IOT199 |	Chromebooks are secure because every Chromebook
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:31,008	| IOT199 |	Has a TPM or trusted platform module
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,288	| IOT199 |	Which is a piece of hardware
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:33,056	| IOT199 |	And that
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:35,360	| IOT199 |	Checks up on boot up every time to make sure that the
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:37,408	| IOT199 |	The system firmware has not been tampered with
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,176	| IOT199 |	If it is
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:43,808	| IOT199 |	Totally useless to that point because it's been infected whatever
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:45,344	| IOT199 |	I don't understand why
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:47,392	| IOT199 |	Routers or some type of
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:49,952	| IOT199 |	Gatekeeping devices haven't used
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:53,280	| IOT199 |	This type of approach from a hardware standpoint other than cost
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,048	| IOT199 |	It just makes sense
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:55,584	| IOT199 |	Yeah
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:57,376	| IOT199 |	I mean in it could
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,144	| IOT199 |	I mean they say it
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,680	| IOT199 |	Require changes in Ark
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:02,240	| IOT199 |	Catchers and it doesn't but it does require
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,776	| IOT199 |	Maybe a smarter router or
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,312	| IOT199 |	Gateway and that's not something that people
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:06,080	| IOT199 |	Think about
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:08,896	| IOT199 |	And then the other thing is when you start thinking about that
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:14,784	| IOT199 |	You're bringing your it system in your sensor system which is usually an operational technology system that's been air-gapped
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,552	| IOT199 |	You bringing those
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:17,856	| IOT199 |	And that can be
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:19,136	| IOT199 |	Disturbing so this is America
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,416	| IOT199 |	Architecture we see actually
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:21,696	| IOT199 |	Industrial
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:24,512	| IOT199 |	So they have their sensor networks that are
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,024	| IOT199 |	The OT
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:26,816	| IOT199 |	Talk to
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:27,584	| IOT199 |	A dedicated game
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,376	| IOT199 |	That Gateway
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:31,168	| IOT199 |	Handle security and all the in
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:32,448	| IOT199 |	Information flowing up
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:32,960	| IOT199 |	From
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:33,984	| IOT199 |	At the machinery
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:36,800	| IOT199 |	And then the it infrastructure
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:39,104	| IOT199 |	Connects down to it and you can't actually
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:40,640	| IOT199 |	It's designs for you
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:42,432	| IOT199 |	You can't have the it stuff
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:43,456	| IOT199 |	Talk down to the Cent
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:45,504	| IOT199 |	The design of a car
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:46,784	| IOT199 |	Car should be right so your
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:47,552	| IOT199 |	Canvassing
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,576	| IOT199 |	Ethernet never actually
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:51,136	| IOT199 |	That has been
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,672	| IOT199 |	Proven unsafe as in
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,696	| IOT199 |	Charlie Miller Jeep
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:55,232	| IOT199 |	But
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:55,744	| IOT199 |	That's the idea
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,024	| IOT199 |	And you know
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,304	| IOT199 |	Depending on how you do it you're actually
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,376	| IOT199 |	So take a look at this will link to
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:04,192	| IOT199 |	The story about this it's definitely interesting it's deaf
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,472	| IOT199 |	Currently a nice way
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:07,520	| IOT199 |	To you know maybe retrofit
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:08,544	| IOT199 |	Security into
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:12,640	| IOT199 |	Your organization although you should still be encrypting in auditing and
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,408	| IOT199 |	Other things
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:14,432	| IOT199 |	Speaking of sex
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:16,224	| IOT199 |	Security Trend Micro released
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:16,736	| IOT199 |	Report
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:18,528	| IOT199 |	Tell me about RFK
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:20,064	| IOT199 |	Taxo this is radio frequency hack
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,344	| IOT199 |	And
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:24,160	| IOT199 |	It is scary as all get-out so the report's findings
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,184	| IOT199 |	I found
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,464	| IOT199 |	Problems
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:29,536	| IOT199 |	In cranes drills mining Machinery in other industrial device
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:32,096	| IOT199 |	Produced by the 7 most commonly.
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,656	| IOT199 |	They are huge point

EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:37,984	| IOT199 |	This is because they are connected there
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:39,520	| IOT199 |	Expensive to replace in there

EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,944	| IOT199 |	So This research is saying that
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:47,712	| IOT199 |	That they have
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,992	| IOT199 |	No rolling code
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:49,504	| IOT199 |	No crypto
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:51,552	| IOT199 |	And no software
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,320	| IOT199 |	Protection
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,344	| IOT199 |	So you can have all kinds of
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,392	| IOT199 |	Previous
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:55,904	| IOT199 |	Show again

EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:59,232	| IOT199 |	Over-the-air updates
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:02,816	| IOT199 |	It's no thinking about cashing an industrial system
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:04,352	| IOT199 |	I think we're going to actually need some dude
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:05,888	| IOT199 |	Parameters around that to me
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:07,680	| IOT199 |	Dispatching
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:08,704	| IOT199 |	Is not the same
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,472	| IOT199 |	In
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,752	| IOT199 |	Factory or a mine
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,800	| IOT199 |	As it is in an IT organization
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:13,824	| IOT199 |	But still
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:16,640	| IOT199 |	We got to fix it snow treat an IT organization in the race to do that
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:18,176	| IOT199 |	Yes but
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:19,200	| IOT199 |	But it is easier
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:20,224	| IOT199 |	You can lose billions
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:22,016	| IOT199 |	Shut your factory
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,552	| IOT199 |	By accident during a
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:26,368	| IOT199 |	I mean it's a pain when your
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,136	| IOT199 |	Computers go down
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:27,648	| IOT199 |	Don't get me wrong
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:30,464	| IOT199 |	Okay as anyone can tell you like
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:31,488	| IOT199 |	Flying in the
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:33,024	| IOT199 |	Turkish Airlines
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:33,536	| IOT199 |	Peter's go down
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:37,120	| IOT199 |	Okay so let's move on
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:39,424	| IOT199 |	Security and scary things and talk about
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:40,448	| IOT199 |	Fun things like
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:40,960	| IOT199 |	Kevin
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:43,008	| IOT199 |	Your Supermarket is implementing robot
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,568	| IOT199 |	Yeah but you could be scary but
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:49,408	| IOT199 |	The supermarket is adding big googly eyes to this robot suit looks dirty
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,176	| IOT199 |	Approachable
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:53,248	| IOT199 |	The chain of supermarkets is called Giant
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:56,320	| IOT199 |	Giant supermarkets which is based in Pennsylvania
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:59,904	| IOT199 |	200 stores not just in Pennsylvania but
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:00,928	| IOT199 |	They are
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:06,048	| IOT199 |	Implementing robots in their stores or Technologies
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:09,632	| IOT199 |	It's rather tall it doesn't look like a robot it kind of looks like a
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:10,656	| IOT199 |	Oh I don't know about
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:16,032	| IOT199 |	Stalk on a base that just kind of Roads around that's why they put the face on that so it doesn't look
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:16,800	| IOT199 |	Weird
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:18,592	| IOT199 |	And have a lidar in it
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:23,712	| IOT199 |	Took a nap and never get the store it's got hi-res three-d depth cameras for navigation and
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,736	| IOT199 |	Data acquisition
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:28,576	| IOT199 |	Basically this thing can run for 12 hours on a charge and what
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:29,856	| IOT199 |	Does in the store
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:30,880	| IOT199 |	Is it
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,648	| IOT199 |	Looks
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,416	| IOT199 |	4
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:34,720	| IOT199 |	Tripping slip hazards on the floor
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:35,744	| IOT199 |	Which could be
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:38,304	| IOT199 |	You know anywhere that and they don't want me baby
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,072	| IOT199 |	Hurt themselves
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:40,096	| IOT199 |	Ricky Nelson
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:46,496	| IOT199 |	Yeah we're lawsuit yeah but he can also read unit tags and recognize if things are out of stock on the shelf and then
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:50,848	| IOT199 |	An alert employees when those items are available in the stockroom for restocking
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:53,152	| IOT199 |	But doesn't have arms that's not going to restock for you unfortunately
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,944	| IOT199 |	And it also can
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:57,248	| IOT199 |	Scan the prices and make sure
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,784	| IOT199 |	By checking the prices against
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:02,368	| IOT199 |	What's on the shelter's what's in the register database if the prices are accurate
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:05,696	| IOT199 |	So can actually let people know hey we need to update this tag
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:07,232	| IOT199 |	It doesn't seem to be really
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:09,280	| IOT199 |	Taking the place of Annie
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:12,352	| IOT199 |	People which I think is a good thing but it seems
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:17,728	| IOT199 |	Are useful way to gather data and compare data to make sure the shopping experiences
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:19,520	| IOT199 |	Best as it can be so
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:22,592	| IOT199 |	I am looking forward I will take photos or video this thing when I see it
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:24,384	| IOT199 |	And Chase it down
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:26,176	| IOT199 |	Chase
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,200	| IOT199 |	Oh okay
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:28,480	| IOT199 |	Okay
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:30,272	| IOT199 |	And next up is
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:33,088	| IOT199 |	Hey Kevin is there money in creating cuss
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:34,880	| IOT199 |	Custom Madame Isabelle's
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:36,928	| IOT199 |	I wouldn't think so
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:43,328	| IOT199 |	But then I just read this article on axial saying that the New York Times is planning to make
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:44,352	| IOT199 |	Money building
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:45,888	| IOT199 |	Madame a skills
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:46,912	| IOT199 |	And
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:49,216	| IOT199 |	I'm surprised that they're getting into this
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:50,496	| IOT199 |	Basically
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:53,824	| IOT199 |	Time is going to create custom skills for advertisers
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:54,592	| IOT199 |	Enceladus
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:56,128	| IOT199 |	Is there a white label service
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:57,920	| IOT199 |	And they're not making any money
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:27:01,248	| IOT199 |	After they create the skills there's no like Kickback on the ads or not. It's just
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:03,552	| IOT199 |	Wheedle it you take it and go
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:09,184	| IOT199 |	I'm really surprised they've 175 people dedicated to this
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,464	| IOT199 |	And
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:15,072	| IOT199 |	They're expecting it'll take about three months per skill to make a custom skill and
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:16,608	| IOT199 |	I guess I don't know what they're charging for it but
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:19,424	| IOT199 |	I'm just shocked it's so it's like an ad agency
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:20,960	| IOT199 |	Kind of service
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:26,080	| IOT199 |	It is but did you expect the time or somebody to do is I did not they try and
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:30,432	| IOT199 |	Once
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,968	| IOT199 |	Right now so you got it you got it
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:32,992	| IOT199 |	Make money where you can
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:33,760	| IOT199 |	Damn
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:37,600	| IOT199 |	Show me self
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,392	| IOT199 |	Let's talk about this
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:45,280	| IOT199 |	Hack that you found to protect my private conversations from my Google home or my Amazon Echo
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:47,328	| IOT199 |	Yet we for the number of
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:52,448	| IOT199 |	Stories in people with bowel concerns about how these microphones are always listening somehow
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:56,032	| IOT199 |	Every once in awhile the private conversations aren't so private and
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:58,080	| IOT199 |	Are two people that created the
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:00,896	| IOT199 |	How to hack basic cuz that's what it is
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,664	| IOT199 |	This hack
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,968	| IOT199 |	Under the name project alias
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:08,064	| IOT199 |	And what project Alias does or will do it's not ready for prime time yet
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:11,392	| IOT199 |	It will literally create white noise
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:13,184	| IOT199 |	For the speaker
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:16,000	| IOT199 |	Until you say the the keyword
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,792	| IOT199 |	And because of this
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:19,328	| IOT199 |	It will not
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:21,120	| IOT199 |	Hear your private conversations
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:24,704	| IOT199 |	Innocent a white noise what kind of balance battery during the gate that out
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:26,496	| IOT199 |	I think it's brilliant
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:27,520	| IOT199 |	Yeah I think
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:28,544	| IOT199 |	We honestly
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:31,360	| IOT199 |	These two companies were talking about Amazon or Google
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,640	| IOT199 |	She really buy it
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:33,408	| IOT199 |	Because
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:35,968	| IOT199 |	Mission implemented themselves at the device level
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:37,504	| IOT199 |	Well so what's interesting is
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:41,088	| IOT199 |	Cuz I'm less concerned about Amazon or Google hearing my stuff all the time
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:42,368	| IOT199 |	I'm more concerned
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,648	| IOT199 |	About someone
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:45,696	| IOT199 |	Hacking my microphones in those device
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:47,744	| IOT199 |	If that makes sense
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:49,792	| IOT199 |	So this way
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:50,816	| IOT199 |	That's
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:52,608	| IOT199 |	Correct
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:53,632	| IOT199 |	Yeah I'd be all about that
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:54,912	| IOT199 |	So what
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:55,680	| IOT199 |	It's not out yet
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,448	| IOT199 |	That's so
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:57,728	| IOT199 |	We should just go check it out
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:59,264	| IOT199 |	What is Project alias
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:00,544	| IOT199 |	Project alias
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:01,056	| IOT199 |	All right welding
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:02,336	| IOT199 |	Okay
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:03,872	| IOT199 |	We got a little acquisition news
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:05,664	| IOT199 |	For everybody in the lighting world
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:07,968	| IOT199 |	Let you guys know how much I love my Lutron gear
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:08,736	| IOT199 |	Yay
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:10,016	| IOT199 |	They
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:10,784	| IOT199 |	Do not advertise
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:11,808	| IOT199 |	I just left them
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:13,856	| IOT199 |	And they acquired an outdoor lighting
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:15,648	| IOT199 |	Limelight
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,160	| IOT199 |	B
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:17,696	| IOT199 |	Purse price wasn't
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:18,464	| IOT199 |	Disclose
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:22,560	| IOT199 |	But we should be able to love my hope is like we should get awesome outdoor lighting
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:24,096	| IOT199 |	Tied into the existing
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:26,144	| IOT199 |	Lighting controls offer by Lutron
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:27,424	| IOT199 |	And Wallah
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:29,984	| IOT199 |	We have integrated lighting Oliver home
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:32,288	| IOT199 |	Amazeballs
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,336	| IOT199 |	Is it
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,104	| IOT199 |	It's just a tiny
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:35,872	| IOT199 |	Little thing but
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,640	| IOT199 |	Worth noting
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:37,152	| IOT199 |	And
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:39,712	| IOT199 |	That's probably sufficient for the news this week
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:40,992	| IOT199 |	Sure there's
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:42,528	| IOT199 |	We didn't ever because
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:44,064	| IOT199 |	Good Lord so much news
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:45,856	| IOT199 |	But that's the stuff we cared about
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:48,672	| IOT199 |	So let's take a moment to go to our voicemail

EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:20,160	| IOT199 |	Let's hear it
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:20,928	| IOT199 |	Hello this is bread
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,208	| IOT199 |	Commuter
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:23,488	| IOT199 |	I have a friend
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:26,304	| IOT199 |	To son is in a wheelchair
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:28,096	| IOT199 |	And
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,656	| IOT199 |	And when he gets
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:31,936	| IOT199 |	Home from
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:32,704	| IOT199 |	The
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:33,216	| IOT199 |	School
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,008	| IOT199 |	On the bus
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:37,056	| IOT199 |	Did like to be alerted
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:38,848	| IOT199 |	Dipping the car
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:40,384	| IOT199 |	Lakeville
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:41,408	| IOT199 |	Here I come
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:43,456	| IOT199 |	I love to put something on the
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:46,016	| IOT199 |	Wheelchair that is either Wi-Fi or
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:48,320	| IOT199 |	Bluetooth enabled or something that would
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:49,344	| IOT199 |	Alert them
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:51,136	| IOT199 |	Their child
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:52,672	| IOT199 |	When the bus is arrived.
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:53,440	| IOT199 |	The child survived
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:55,744	| IOT199 |	So that they can meet him
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:56,768	| IOT199 |	Andorno's Italy
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:31:00,608	| IOT199 |	So you have any ideas he's asleep
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,376	| IOT199 |	Tile
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:02,400	| IOT199 |	And
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:03,680	| IOT199 |	A few other option
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:05,216	| IOT199 |	Just didn't seem dope
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:06,752	| IOT199 |	Alert remotely
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,776	| IOT199 |	Inn at the distance
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:08,544	| IOT199 |	That we wanted
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:09,056	| IOT199 |	Thanks
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:10,592	| IOT199 |	I want like it's used
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:11,616	| IOT199 |	Case it's very practical
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:14,688	| IOT199 |	I love those practical use case
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:15,712	| IOT199 |	So much
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:17,248	| IOT199 |	And we have a really easy solution
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:19,552	| IOT199 |	It is going to cost in Escanaba
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:21,600	| IOT199 |	Scription cost but it is the Samsung
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:23,648	| IOT199 |	SmartThings LTE tracker
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:26,464	| IOT199 |	Yes this was announced
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:30,560	| IOT199 |	Couple months ago we saw it on the FCC database before they even announced it
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:34,656	| IOT199 |	Samsung site
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:37,472	| IOT199 |	It's 9999 for the tracker
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:39,008	| IOT199 |	It has GPS
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:40,288	| IOT199 |	LTE
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:42,080	| IOT199 |	It's water-resistant so I think it's
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:43,104	| IOT199 |	Perfect for
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,384	| IOT199 |	Attaching to
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:49,248	| IOT199 |	The wheelchair or any similar device that somebody wants to track for people
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:52,832	| IOT199 |	It does have a subscription that you mention Stacey but for the first year
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:54,624	| IOT199 |	That's actually included
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:56,416	| IOT199 |	So the cellular service is included
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:58,208	| IOT199 |	First 12 months
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:02,560	| IOT199 |	After that it's $5 a month or $50 per year
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:05,120	| IOT199 |	You know this is a very important use case I think
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:07,168	| IOT199 |	It's probably worth the cost in this case for
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:08,704	| IOT199 |	Rap
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:10,240	| IOT199 |	Margarita
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:14,592	| IOT199 |	I don't believe you need a SmartThings Hub with this because
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:20,992	| IOT199 |	Does require the SmartThings app and that indicates to me that you can get push notifications when the Wii
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:24,576	| IOT199 |	Wheelchair new gets into the geo-fenced home area Etc
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:25,344	| IOT199 |	An
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:28,928	| IOT199 |	There's no Hub needed there so I think you're fine with just this
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:32,512	| IOT199 |	Tracker and the app I don't know if your friend's son has a phone
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:34,560	| IOT199 |	But if they do have
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:35,328	| IOT199 |	A phone
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:37,120	| IOT199 |	Then you can use if
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:38,144	| IOT199 |	So ifttt
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:41,216	| IOT199 |	And basically load the app on the phone
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:42,752	| IOT199 |	And then create an apple
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:46,336	| IOT199 |	That basically win the phone gets within Wi-Fi range
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:48,384	| IOT199 |	Home it will
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:49,408	| IOT199 |	Send a notification
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:49,920	| IOT199 |	Vacation Center
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:51,968	| IOT199 |	To someone
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:53,504	| IOT199 |	So this is an option that is
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:54,272	| IOT199 |	Completely free
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:56,576	| IOT199 |	It's going to have some downsides such as
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:57,088	| IOT199 |	Latency
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:59,392	| IOT199 |	It may also be a little weird depending on
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:01,696	| IOT199 |	The wifi radius so
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:02,464	| IOT199 |	It may
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:05,024	| IOT199 |	Trigger a little early or maybe a little late
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:06,304	| IOT199 |	And if there's no Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:09,120	| IOT199 |	The phone doesn't have the Wi-Fi network turned on that's not going to work
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:10,656	| IOT199 |	So that is an option
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:13,984	| IOT199 |	That way and
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:14,496	| IOT199 |	And you also have
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:16,800	| IOT199 |	Right there's no fee involved.
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:18,592	| IOT199 |	All right
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:19,872	| IOT199 |	So
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:22,944	| IOT199 |	That concludes this portion of the show
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:24,224	| IOT199 |	Stay tuned
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:25,760	| IOT199 |	Fergie toes you're a loser
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,552	| IOT199 |	Is the chief digital officer of ABB
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:29,088	| IOT199 |	They make everything from
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:30,624	| IOT199 |	Plastic zip ties to
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:31,648	| IOT199 |	Industrial robot
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:32,928	| IOT199 |	So this is
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:34,720	| IOT199 |	A ginormous Company 290
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:37,024	| IOT199 |	We did not get into
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:39,072	| IOT199 |	I can talk to this man 4 hours
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:40,864	| IOT199 |	But we focused on
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:42,400	| IOT199 |	His Maslow's
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:43,424	| IOT199 |	Hierarchy
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:44,704	| IOT199 |	Iot needs
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:45,472	| IOT199 |	And
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:46,496	| IOT199 |	Business models
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:48,032	| IOT199 |	That might arise from
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:49,824	| IOT199 |	Basically usage-based
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:51,104	| IOT199 |	Pricing for
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:51,616	| IOT199 |	Industrial
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:53,664	| IOT199 |	So stay tuned for that
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:59,552	| IOT199 |	Everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:01,856	| IOT199 |	This week sponsor is database provider
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:04,928	| IOT199 |	Are command I have aloe vera
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:05,952	| IOT199 |	Who is here
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:07,232	| IOT199 |	Compare Cobb to talk to us
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:09,280	| IOT199 |	About their age
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:12,608	| IOT199 |	Summa question I see a lot of people asking
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:13,376	| IOT199 |	Is
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:14,912	| IOT199 |	What should their iot Edge
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:18,240	| IOT199 |	You guys have actually built to database
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,008	| IOT199 |	The edge
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:20,288	| IOT199 |	LC Tri Edge
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:22,336	| IOT199 |	So do you have any recommendations
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:23,104	| IOT199 |	To share with our audio
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:25,920	| IOT199 |	Depends on what is needed by the business
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:27,200	| IOT199 |	Sanlitun
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:30,528	| IOT199 |	Things to decide on so we try to help by making it a business
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:34,880	| IOT199 |	For example user can store all the data at the edge and
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:38,720	| IOT199 |	Send nothing of that to the cloud or if I decide that's going to send everything
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:44,352	| IOT199 |	The clouds just or just the date of the thingy that the edge and almost kind of fractured his claws
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:45,376	| IOT199 |	In some cases
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:47,168	| IOT199 |	Just do what they actually need is to come
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:48,960	| IOT199 |	Control the data in real-time
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:49,728	| IOT199 |	And dolcenero
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:51,264	| IOT199 |	Strongly recommend
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:52,288	| IOT199 |	Tasha Smith
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,312	| IOT199 |	Process to the edge
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:56,640	| IOT199 |	Especially on the decision-making that you're trying to run
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:57,920	| IOT199 |	Okay so
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,968	| IOT199 |	I'm deciding between the edge in the cloud
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:01,504	| IOT199 |	What are some of the things I need to
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,272	| IOT199 |	To take him to come
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:03,040	| IOT199 |	Consideration
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,320	| IOT199 |	Well you have to consider
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:05,344	| IOT199 |	First acknowledge
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:09,440	| IOT199 |	Both the edge in the cloud VR different roles
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:10,976	| IOT199 |	That used different.
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:12,000	| IOT199 |	Acknowledges and if
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:12,768	| IOT199 |	Protocols
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:13,536	| IOT199 |	That's pretty much
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:15,328	| IOT199 |	The market has been discussing ass
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:16,096	| IOT199 |	The Clash
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:18,912	| IOT199 |	Between racial technology and information technology
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:20,960	| IOT199 |	Make sure that you are.
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:24,032	| IOT199 |	Technologies that support different protocols
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:26,336	| IOT199 |	Especialista our standards already in place
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:30,944	| IOT199 |	Saw some other things that I think it's very important to consider like for example whatever database
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:31,712	| IOT199 |	Alaska
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:34,272	| IOT199 |	Assisted on the edge this database needs to be able
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:40,672	| IOT199 |	Go to provide you with flexible schema mainly because of the
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:44,000	| IOT199 |	All kind of different types and in many cases
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:45,024	| IOT199 |	Is the closer
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:46,560	| IOT199 |	Just able to handle the data
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:49,376	| IOT199 |	Producing native format the better for you
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:53,984	| IOT199 |	Application here is really being able to store data like for a simple Time series

EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:09,856	| IOT199 |	What's worth talking about your is
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:12,672	| IOT199 |	Nosql database
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:16,512	| IOT199 |	And we definitely just I know SQL database is the best candidate for an adjective
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:19,072	| IOT199 |	And some of the things that I think of
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:20,352	| IOT199 |	As being really important
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:21,120	| IOT199 |	For the edge
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:21,888	| IOT199 |	Would be
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:22,656	| IOT199 |	Security
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:23,680	| IOT199 |	How do you guys
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:24,192	| IOT199 |	Help with that
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:27,520	| IOT199 |	That's a very good point if you decide if you're going to have to
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:32,384	| IOT199 |	Transfer some of your decision-making to the edge you definitely going to have to talk to have to persist data locally
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,944	| IOT199 |	For example.
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:35,712	| IOT199 |	Historical data
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:38,528	| IOT199 |	This immediately leads to the need for encryption
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:40,576	| IOT199 |	That's absolutely mandatory if your select
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:43,136	| IOT199 |	Sister theater on the edge
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:46,464	| IOT199 |	How many ways I was teased about combining the real time information
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:51,328	| IOT199 |	Let's be produced by machines and equipments that you're controlling their be measured by its digital sensor
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:53,376	| IOT199 |	What's so-called operational technology
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:56,960	| IOT199 |	Or the corporate it Department that has
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:37:02,336	| IOT199 |	Decentralized fuel of all its systems with information like historical date of orders cost and dementor
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:04,384	| IOT199 |	We considered making sure that this information flows
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:06,176	| IOT199 |	States with managed
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:08,224	| IOT199 |	Project
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:11,808	| IOT199 |	So where can we find out more about faircom address

EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:29,216	| IOT199 |	Podcast
EDL	00:37:29,216	00:37:31,264	| IOT199 |	This is your house Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:32,288	| IOT199 |	And today's guest
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:34,592	| IOT199 |	Is ghetto Jared who is this
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:35,616	| IOT199 |	Chief digital officer
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:36,896	| IOT199 |	Officer at ABB
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:38,944	| IOT199 |	So how are you doing
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,480	| IOT199 |	I'm doing
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:40,992	| IOT199 |	Thank you very much
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:42,528	| IOT199 |	Okay
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:44,320	| IOT199 |	Just impress everyone
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:45,344	| IOT199 |	I think you should tell us
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:46,880	| IOT199 |	What ABB
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:48,416	| IOT199 |	Is and does
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:50,464	| IOT199 |	ABB is one of the
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:52,256	| IOT199 |	Industrial companies remake
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:56,352	| IOT199 |	Technologies that helps to turn electricity into motion
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:57,632	| IOT199 |	So we make robots
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:37:58,656	| IOT199 |	Motors
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:01,728	| IOT199 |	Control system circuit breakers
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:02,496	| IOT199 |	We are
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:05,568	| IOT199 |	34 billion dollar company
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:07,104	| IOT199 |	48000 employees
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:09,920	| IOT199 |	And we have been around for a little bit over on
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:14,784	| IOT199 |	Exactly this is one of those companies that you will never hear
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:16,064	| IOT199 |	In your day-to-day life
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:17,600	| IOT199 |	But they are everywhere and
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:19,648	| IOT199 |	So
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:21,184	| IOT199 |	They're doing amazing stuff
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:22,208	| IOT199 |	With the internet estate
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:24,000	| IOT199 |	So let's just Orient
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:26,304	| IOT199 |	Ask the chief digital officer
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:28,096	| IOT199 |	How do you think about the internet
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:34,752	| IOT199 |	Really a sumac
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:37,824	| IOT199 |	There's a consumer Internet of Things where we talked about
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:44,224	| IOT199 |	Colored light bulbs and home alarm systems and all kinds of connected speakers and devices like that
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:47,296	| IOT199 |	Dustrial internet of things which is the other part of this equation
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:48,832	| IOT199 |	We're talking about
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:53,184	| IOT199 |	Devices that are connected but they're operating inside of chemical plants and facts
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:55,232	| IOT199 |	Inside of mine
EDL	00:38:55,232	00:38:56,768	| IOT199 |	Oil and gas field
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:58,560	| IOT199 |	So as a chief
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:01,120	| IOT199 |	It's afraid I'm trying to inject
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:03,680	| IOT199 |	Digital Technologies in every product
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:04,704	| IOT199 |	Conservative
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:05,472	| IOT199 |	That is a
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:06,496	| IOT199 |	Call order
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:08,544	| IOT199 |	And I know that we have spoken
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:09,824	| IOT199 |	About your maslov
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:10,592	| IOT199 |	Hierarchy
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:13,152	| IOT199 |	Of iot
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:15,968	| IOT199 |	Because I think it's a good way that companies can
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:16,480	| IOT199 |	Can look it up
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:18,272	| IOT199 |	Assess where they are
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:20,064	| IOT199 |	Signatureny
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:22,112	| IOT199 |	The basically making more efficient use of their
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:24,160	| IOT199 |	People their processes
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:24,928	| IOT199 |	Resources
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:30,048	| IOT199 |	I'd love to do that explain a little bit why I came up
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:34,144	| IOT199 |	It's because the internet
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:37,728	| IOT199 |	There's use cases that are different industries that are different
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:40,800	| IOT199 |	Technology stocks everything from the very
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:44,896	| IOT199 |	Small light sensors communicating analytic software
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,688	| IOT199 |	In the Gateway at the yard Jordan
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:47,200	| IOT199 |	Cloud
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:50,272	| IOT199 |	Machine learning drone technology
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:53,088	| IOT199 |	Too much to get your head wrapped around
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:40:00,000	| IOT199 |	Companies and customers you're doing with the Internet of Things
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:04,096	| IOT199 |	All the sudden
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:05,120	| IOT199 |	Like mouthwash
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:07,936	| IOT199 |	Iraq
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:09,472	| IOT199 |	How do you say Stephens
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:15,872	| IOT199 |	Community
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:16,896	| IOT199 |	Classify
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:17,664	| IOT199 |	Aldi's
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:22,528	| IOT199 |	Hundreds of thousands of individual application
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:23,552	| IOT199 |	Really only about
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:25,856	| IOT199 |	Five different capabilities AR level
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:26,368	| IOT199 |	Dorney Park
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:33,792	| IOT199 |	Whole bunch of application but nothing more than
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:39,936	| IOT199 |	This thing we're going to put a little chip on it it's going to be able to talk we communicate and it tells us how it's doing
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:40,448	| IOT199 |	Why do we care
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:42,496	| IOT199 |	Mantra
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:45,568	| IOT199 |	Because you can then at least go from taipei
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:46,848	| IOT199 |	Maintenance schedule
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:50,688	| IOT199 |	Commission-based
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:55,296	| IOT199 |	Quite beneficial because there's a lot of equipment in construction
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,576	| IOT199 |	Deployed and of course
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:41:00,672	| IOT199 |	Maintaining it properly is important
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:01,952	| IOT199 |	That's the base of the mount Lafayette
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:03,488	| IOT199 |	If you can read
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:05,280	| IOT199 |	You can probably also
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:07,584	| IOT199 |	Meaning you can change value
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:11,168	| IOT199 |	In that system you can write
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:13,472	| IOT199 |	Naked
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:14,240	| IOT199 |	The robot
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:15,264	| IOT199 |	You can make it
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:16,800	| IOT199 |	Do new things
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:17,568	| IOT199 |	As a result
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:22,688	| IOT199 |	You can go beyond monitoring and you can label a class of application but I call often
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:24,224	| IOT199 |	You can make things on
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:25,504	| IOT199 |	Faster
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:29,344	| IOT199 |	Consume less energy be more reliable
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:34,720	| IOT199 |	And of course this all depends on what the customer wants
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:37,024	| IOT199 |	Memphis Behavioral
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:37,792	| IOT199 |	As a supplier
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:44,192	| IOT199 |	Because you can say to your customer would you like me to optimize this device for you
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:48,800	| IOT199 |	During its operation to better serve your needs
EDL	00:41:53,407	00:41:55,455	| IOT199 |	Devastation that's mostly where we are today
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:58,271	| IOT199 |	Exactly right
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:41:58,783	| IOT199 |	Probably
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:00,831	| IOT199 |	60 70%
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:03,647	| IOT199 |	NVM
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:11,583	| IOT199 |	And it's very safe to just read as big as opposed to actually
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:12,863	| IOT199 |	Got it
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:15,679	| IOT199 |	So now let's keep moving
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:16,703	| IOT199 |	Where can we ask
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:17,471	| IOT199 |	Aspire to be
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:22,335	| IOT199 |	Stacy the world
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:27,199	| IOT199 |	Nice because you can put two versions
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:31,807	| IOT199 |	People that make
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:34,111	| IOT199 |	Look up music
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:34,879	| IOT199 |	Motors
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:37,439	| IOT199 |	Transformer
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:43,327	| IOT199 |	We put all this time and effort in R&D and we have no idea which features are customers really do
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:44,351	| IOT199 |	Because we have no feedback
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:46,399	| IOT199 |	Or at least we didn't until now
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:50,239	| IOT199 |	Feedback loops that lets us monitor the characteristics of the device
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:54,591	| IOT199 |	Also tells us which button people do push and which dial people
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:56,895	| IOT199 |	When you get all this data back
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:43:01,759	| IOT199 |	Can you know which features they're using you know which components inside of your machine wear out
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:06,111	| IOT199 |	Fastest all this wealth of data so you can now for the first time
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:07,647	| IOT199 |	Make your products better
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:08,671	| IOT199 |	Baseball music
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:15,071	| IOT199 |	And I think that's really cool
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:16,351	| IOT199 |	Byproduct of just having fun
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:18,143	| IOT199 |	And what do you call that
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:19,167	| IOT199 |	I call that product
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:24,031	| IOT199 |	2.0 I called the idea that this was
EDL	00:43:25,055	00:43:29,151	| IOT199 |	Product 2.0 because this is a product which actually based on this
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:30,431	| IOT199 |	Digital feedback loop
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:31,711	| IOT199 |	You keep improving
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:32,735	| IOT199 |	You keep it already
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:34,271	| IOT199 |	You keep making it better.
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:36,319	| IOT199 |	So I think that's important
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:40,159	| IOT199 |	Holding on because I think that changes the way a lot of
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,183	| IOT199 |	Business works
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:42,463	| IOT199 |	So we'll come back to what it was
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:43,999	| IOT199 |	Support
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:45,279	| IOT199 |	Nate
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:46,303	| IOT199 |	Product 2.0
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:47,071	| IOT199 |	But let's
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:48,095	| IOT199 |	Keep moving up your higher
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:52,703	| IOT199 |	Okay so now we're ready for a level four
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:44:00,639	| IOT199 |	Welcome people save all the smartphone getting expensive
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:01,407	| IOT199 |	Well
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:02,431	| IOT199 |	Yes or no
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:05,503	| IOT199 |	Inexpensive
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:08,575	| IOT199 |	Your smartphone means that you no longer have to buy any
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:15,231	| IOT199 |	Pocket camera for that you don't need to buy an alarm clock or that you don't need to have a
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:15,999	| IOT199 |	What's happened is
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:19,071	| IOT199 |	Those who become after those are features
EDL	00:44:19,071	00:44:21,119	| IOT199 |	But you can add this is about
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:22,911	| IOT199 |	Converge
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:24,703	| IOT199 |	And of course if you have
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:27,263	| IOT199 |	A piece of machinery and intelligence
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:31,103	| IOT199 |	You can do new things like a witch
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:35,711	| IOT199 |	It's like every other circuit breaker except that it has a computer inside and now it can do things like
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:37,247	| IOT199 |	Measure the power quality
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:38,271	| IOT199 |	Coming into the plant
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:39,807	| IOT199 |	Pecan shed
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:44,159	| IOT199 |	If you want to participate in demand response for you're getting paid
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:46,207	| IOT199 |	Powerful
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:48,255	| IOT199 |	And those extra features
EDL	00:44:48,255	00:44:50,815	| IOT199 |	Apps you can download onto the circus
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:56,191	| IOT199 |	Computer inside
EDL	00:44:56,191	00:44:57,215	| IOT199 |	The last one is really the
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:59,007	| IOT199 |	Changing of the business model
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:45:01,823	| IOT199 |	If I'm not connected I have these downloadable apps
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:05,407	| IOT199 |	To pay for this product would you like to pay for it
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:10,015	| IOT199 |	He's done with me or would you like to go
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:10,783	| IOT199 |	2
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:18,207	| IOT199 |	Trifold in the maintenance the remote monitoring the remote optimization
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:23,839	| IOT199 |	Staying up last month and at the end of that product
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:26,655	| IOT199 |	Like me to charge you based on usage because
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:32,799	| IOT199 |	Utilization
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:33,567	| IOT199 |	I know how
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:35,871	| IOT199 |	Spanish you like
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:40,735	| IOT199 |	I can work out a system whereby you pay me the more you use it and if you don't give it a thought you think of that
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:44,831	| IOT199 |	Of course the dialogue
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:47,391	| IOT199 |	Conversation between the maker of that product
EDL	00:45:47,903	00:45:50,719	| IOT199 |	Customer that products
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:51,999	| IOT199 |	But those are very
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:56,351	| IOT199 |	Industrial
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:45:58,143	| IOT199 |	Economy hasn't haven't had before
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:45:59,423	| IOT199 |	I agree
EDL	00:45:59,423	00:46:01,471	| IOT199 |	And we will talk about that
EDL	00:46:01,471	00:46:03,007	| IOT199 |	Let's go back to this idea of product
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:05,823	| IOT199 |	Because in our previous conversation
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:06,591	| IOT199 |	And you mentioned that
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:08,383	| IOT199 |	Tesla is a good example of this
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:10,175	| IOT199 |	What's the matter with this idea that
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:12,223	| IOT199 |	The car is continually being
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:13,503	| IOT199 |	Updated with software
EDL	00:46:13,503	00:46:14,271	| IOT199 |	And
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:16,575	| IOT199 |	It changes it usually ideally gets better over
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:22,975	| IOT199 |	So with that that's fundamentally
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:24,255	| IOT199 |	Is a different business
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:24,767	| IOT199 |	As for a lot of come
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:27,327	| IOT199 |	So if you're going to go from
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:28,351	| IOT199 |	Making a robot
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:29,375	| IOT199 |	I thought you said one
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:30,911	| IOT199 |	Maybe you offer a service
EDL	00:46:30,911	00:46:31,679	| IOT199 |	Contractor maintenance
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:33,215	| IOT199 |	Contract for 5 years
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:34,495	| IOT199 |	To making a robot
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:35,519	| IOT199 |	Is going to
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:37,823	| IOT199 |	Constantly get better and have a continuing relation
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:38,847	| IOT199 |	Customer
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:40,127	| IOT199 |	That feels like it changes
EDL	00:46:40,127	00:46:41,151	| IOT199 |	Cell cycle
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:44,479	| IOT199 |	Warranty obligations that changes your
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:45,759	| IOT199 |	Cost of operating
EDL	00:46:46,271	00:46:47,295	| IOT199 |	Producing a product
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:48,575	| IOT199 |	Breakdown
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:51,391	| IOT199 |	Relationship
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:53,439	| IOT199 |	One of those things that is both
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:55,999	| IOT199 |	Potentially
EDL	00:46:55,999	00:46:59,583	| IOT199 |	Changed as a result if you have a product
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:05,983	| IOT199 |	And in many cases the members should you have a complex system business where you make something that required integration
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:07,775	| IOT199 |	Deployment
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:12,383	| IOT199 |	They would have to cater you typically work with a channel system integrator people that store your product
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:23,903	| IOT199 |	Past the point of sale is both an opportunity for the makers of the things she perceived as a
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:25,439	| IOT199 |	Weather Channel
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:26,207	| IOT199 |	So you may
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:30,047	| IOT199 |	Put your Channel
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:33,119	| IOT199 |	Because they feel like you might use this
EDL	00:47:33,119	00:47:38,751	| IOT199 |	To perceive to be bringing
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:41,055	| IOT199 |	I'll install that if he
EDL	00:47:41,055	00:47:42,847	| IOT199 |	And the maker of the robot
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:49,247	| IOT199 |	You may not know where that's going because that's being done by a system integrator or some kind of engineering company
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:51,551	| IOT199 |	Connection changes
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:54,111	| IOT199 |	Relationship
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:47:59,231	| IOT199 |	Because they see value in 10 Connected for the company that makes
EDL	00:48:06,143	00:48:10,495	| IOT199 |	Have to do that just like in the world of Automotive it's best to have its own dealers or have that
EDL	00:48:11,775	00:48:15,359	| IOT199 |	It is essentially altering the relationship that would exist
EDL	00:48:15,359	00:48:21,503	| IOT199 |	Continue by dealer
EDL	00:48:22,271	00:48:25,855	| IOT199 |	So you're talking about the company making it as well
EDL	00:48:26,367	00:48:27,903	| IOT199 |	Clearly
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:29,695	| IOT199 |	Where the R&D
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:30,719	| IOT199 |	Shock the Moon
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:36,351	| IOT199 |	From Hardware increasing video software
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:40,447	| IOT199 |	Change for companies with traditional have relied on Material Science innovation
EDL	00:48:41,727	00:48:42,751	| IOT199 |	Better Dentistry
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:44,543	| IOT199 |	Understanding those deep
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:45,567	| IOT199 |	Physical properties
EDL	00:48:45,567	00:48:46,847	| IOT199 |	Ways to make the product better
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:48,127	| IOT199 |	Janelle being able to do a lot of
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:52,479	| IOT199 |	And that's a huge shift and kind of people that were looking to hire
EDL	00:48:53,247	00:48:55,551	| IOT199 |	Materials engineering Stihl
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:56,319	| IOT199 |	Ladders
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:57,087	| IOT199 |	And so
EDL	00:48:57,087	00:49:00,415	| IOT199 |	But you can affect the outcome of something
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:01,695	| IOT199 |	Why does it
EDL	00:49:01,695	00:49:02,719	| IOT199 |	In software
EDL	00:49:02,719	00:49:03,487	| IOT199 |	Where
EDL	00:49:03,487	00:49:07,071	| IOT199 |	Course Material Science may give you that Quantum Leap for that Improvement
EDL	00:49:07,071	00:49:08,351	| IOT199 |	But that laugh
EDL	00:49:08,351	00:49:10,399	| IOT199 |	Extra bit can usually be done
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:17,055	| IOT199 |	Of the various components
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:21,663	| IOT199 |	And I am curious because you guys deal with heavy Industrial
EDL	00:49:22,175	00:49:23,199	| IOT199 |	And what if he
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:24,991	| IOT199 |	I'm not going to call it an epiphany
EDL	00:49:24,991	00:49:26,527	| IOT199 |	Because it wasn't quite so bright
EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:27,295	| IOT199 |	Is bad but
EDL	00:49:27,295	00:49:29,855	| IOT199 |	Talking to somebody a John Deere about
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:30,879	| IOT199 |	The right to repair issue
EDL	00:49:31,391	00:49:32,415	| IOT199 |	And that is basically
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:35,743	| IOT199 |	Machines
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:36,511	| IOT199 |	Bear
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:37,791	| IOT199 |	Forcing farmers
EDL	00:49:37,791	00:49:39,839	| IOT199 |	To rely on the dealers to
EDL	00:49:39,839	00:49:40,607	| IOT199 |	Repair
EDL	00:49:40,607	00:49:42,655	| IOT199 |	A lot of people are very
EDL	00:49:42,655	00:49:44,191	| IOT199 |	Upset by this and I get it
EDL	00:49:44,191	00:49:45,215	| IOT199 |	First century
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:47,007	| IOT199 |	People have bought a Prada
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:48,543	| IOT199 |	Repaired at them
EDL	00:49:48,543	00:49:49,823	| IOT199 |	Selves in bed response
EDL	00:49:49,823	00:49:50,591	| IOT199 |	Before and after
EDL	00:49:51,359	00:49:52,383	| IOT199 |	As we start putting
EDL	00:49:52,895	00:49:53,663	| IOT199 |	Software in it
EDL	00:49:53,663	00:49:55,199	| IOT199 |	The number of people who have that
EDL	00:49:55,199	00:49:55,711	| IOT199 |	Joseph
EDL	00:49:56,735	00:49:57,759	| IOT199 |	But it also
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:49:59,295	| IOT199 |	Creates the snoo
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:50:02,367	| IOT199 |	Relationship that some people don't seem to be willing to
EDL	00:50:02,367	00:50:06,975	| IOT199 |	To give up and this ties to you know John Deere this might be the people who used to fix
EDL	00:50:07,487	00:50:08,511	| IOT199 |	Your robots
EDL	00:50:08,511	00:50:09,535	| IOT199 |	At various
EDL	00:50:09,535	00:50:12,095	| IOT199 |	Factories that may not have access to as much as
EDL	00:50:12,095	00:50:13,375	| IOT199 |	The things that might be causing the
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:13,887	| IOT199 |	The problems anyway
EDL	00:50:14,399	00:50:15,679	| IOT199 |	And even in a smart home
EDL	00:50:16,191	00:50:16,703	| IOT199 |	I'm starting to
EDL	00:50:17,215	00:50:20,031	| IOT199 |	Relegate some things over to software I'm losing the ability
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:21,311	| IOT199 |	Tweaker cam
EDL	00:50:21,311	00:50:23,615	| IOT199 |	I think it's kind of a natural
EDL	00:50:23,615	00:50:27,711	| IOT199 |	Abstraction that happens when you get things over to software but I'm curious
EDL	00:50:27,711	00:50:28,223	| IOT199 |	Collier
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:31,295	| IOT199 |	Talking to your customer base or how you're thinking about
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:36,671	| IOT199 |	Good question
EDL	00:50:36,671	00:50:39,487	| IOT199 |	One example of that so you know
EDL	00:50:39,487	00:50:40,767	| IOT199 |	This thing is huge debate
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:42,303	| IOT199 |	Privacy
EDL	00:50:42,815	00:50:44,607	| IOT199 |	I see a data who owns potato
EDL	00:50:44,607	00:50:45,887	| IOT199 |	There's a similar
EDL	00:50:45,887	00:50:48,703	| IOT199 |	Type of debate happening on the industrial side up
EDL	00:50:48,703	00:50:50,495	| IOT199 |	The business side of this equation when it's really busy
EDL	00:50:55,359	00:50:57,151	| IOT199 |	Property and data ownership
EDL	00:50:57,151	00:50:58,431	| IOT199 |	Who owns what data
EDL	00:50:58,431	00:50:59,967	| IOT199 |	And of course as all these devices
EDL	00:51:01,503	00:51:05,599	| IOT199 |	We do get data back and one of the ways that we've tried to have that debate
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:07,903	| IOT199 |	Clarify
EDL	00:51:07,903	00:51:08,927	| IOT199 |	The different types of
EDL	00:51:08,927	00:51:10,463	| IOT199 |	The data are so we have
EDL	00:51:10,463	00:51:13,279	| IOT199 |	Identity data who you are we have
EDL	00:51:13,279	00:51:16,607	| IOT199 |	Essentially Telemetry data which is the individual value that you
EDL	00:51:16,607	00:51:21,727	| IOT199 |	Machine by sending back their temperature energy consumption
EDL	00:51:21,727	00:51:23,263	| IOT199 |	Inside
EDL	00:51:23,263	00:51:27,103	| IOT199 |	Which is you take all of that and you turn it into
EDL	00:51:27,103	00:51:28,383	| IOT199 |	Friends and prediction
EDL	00:51:28,383	00:51:32,223	| IOT199 |	And clearly the most sensitive of all of this Susie identity data
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:33,247	| IOT199 |	Married to the Dilemma
EDL	00:51:33,759	00:51:34,527	| IOT199 |	Why
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:40,671	| IOT199 |	The weather like in healthcare in u.s. government has embraced something called Healthcare information
EDL	00:51:40,671	00:51:46,303	| IOT199 |	Essentially mandates that identity data be stored separately from Telemetry data or measurement
EDL	00:51:47,327	00:51:50,143	| IOT199 |	Potentially a good used to be made
EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:51,167	| IOT199 |	Public public
EDL	00:51:51,167	00:51:56,031	| IOT199 |	Healthcare data because if we analyzed it better we might be able to determine
EDL	00:51:56,031	00:52:02,431	| IOT199 |	But we can understand why people wouldn't want that individual disease information to be tied back to them especially if it could
EDL	00:52:02,431	00:52:03,967	| IOT199 |	Check insurance rates
EDL	00:52:08,319	00:52:09,087	| IOT199 |	To be made
EDL	00:52:09,087	00:52:10,367	| IOT199 |	In the separation of
EDL	00:52:10,367	00:52:11,647	| IOT199 |	Data
EDL	00:52:11,647	00:52:13,695	| IOT199 |	Only part of this equation
EDL	00:52:13,695	00:52:20,095	| IOT199 |	Being able to fix things and repair things I do think it's more more devices haven't better software than taking that into
EDL	00:52:20,095	00:52:23,423	| IOT199 |	Prepare yourself is increasingly difficult
EDL	00:52:23,935	00:52:25,215	| IOT199 |	What you do find is that
EDL	00:52:25,215	00:52:27,519	| IOT199 |	Increasingly people want to make things work together
EDL	00:52:27,519	00:52:33,663	| IOT199 |	That's very similar to be knowledge of your smart home
EDL	00:52:34,175	00:52:34,943	| IOT199 |	Speaker
EDL	00:52:34,943	00:52:39,551	| IOT199 |	How do I do that and that's the same that's happening in industry it's not that they want to think about the light bulb
EDL	00:52:39,551	00:52:43,647	| IOT199 |	Speaker
EDL	00:52:43,647	00:52:45,183	| IOT199 |	Driver Motors
EDL	00:52:46,719	00:52:51,327	| IOT199 |	And there's a strong interest in driving towards greater standardization
EDL	00:52:51,327	00:52:53,631	| IOT199 |	And this is where the industrial world has been
EDL	00:52:53,631	00:52:57,727	| IOT199 |	Low because we have seen a great convergence away from
EDL	00:52:57,727	00:53:01,823	| IOT199 |	Token ring and sddi and all these things 2 words pretty much Wi-Fi ethernet
EDL	00:53:02,335	00:53:03,871	| IOT199 |	IP
EDL	00:53:05,151	00:53:05,919	| IOT199 |	Let's talk about business
EDL	00:53:06,687	00:53:07,455	| IOT199 |	So one of the things
EDL	00:53:09,247	00:53:10,783	| IOT199 |	Charging based on use
EDL	00:53:10,783	00:53:11,807	| IOT199 |	And I think that is
EDL	00:53:12,319	00:53:13,087	| IOT199 |	Incredibly fast
EDL	00:53:13,855	00:53:16,159	| IOT199 |	And I started out my career covering
EDL	00:53:16,159	00:53:16,671	| IOT199 |	Cloud compute
EDL	00:53:17,183	00:53:19,231	| IOT199 |	And that the big Trend there was moving your
EDL	00:53:19,743	00:53:21,791	| IOT199 |	Capital expenditures in your it
EDL	00:53:21,791	00:53:22,815	| IOT199 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:53:22,815	00:53:23,583	| IOT199 |	To an operating X
EDL	00:53:24,095	00:53:24,863	| IOT199 |	Nature
EDL	00:53:24,863	00:53:25,375	| IOT199 |	Payout
EDL	00:53:25,887	00:53:26,399	| IOT199 |	No as needed
EDL	00:53:26,911	00:53:27,679	| IOT199 |	Amazon
EDL	00:53:27,679	00:53:29,471	| IOT199 |	Microsoft whomever and
EDL	00:53:29,471	00:53:30,239	| IOT199 |	When I think about
EDL	00:53:30,751	00:53:31,775	| IOT199 |	It sounds
EDL	00:53:31,775	00:53:32,543	| IOT199 |	Awesome
EDL	00:53:32,543	00:53:33,823	| IOT199 |	But it also
EDL	00:53:33,823	00:53:35,103	| IOT199 |	Changes the wave
EDL	00:53:35,103	00:53:36,127	| IOT199 |	Businesses are built
EDL	00:53:36,639	00:53:39,199	| IOT199 |	The creation of wealth it's always been about
EDL	00:53:39,199	00:53:39,711	| IOT199 |	Building up
EDL	00:53:40,223	00:53:40,991	| IOT199 |	Your infrastructure
EDL	00:53:40,991	00:53:41,759	| IOT199 |	Historically
EDL	00:53:41,759	00:53:43,039	| IOT199 |	Right and owning saying
EDL	00:53:43,039	00:53:46,623	| IOT199 |	And then taking advantage of those so like owning your own car than you
EDL	00:53:47,391	00:53:48,671	| IOT199 |	Hire it out to people if you were
EDL	00:53:48,671	00:53:49,439	| IOT199 |	Want to make money
EDL	00:53:49,439	00:53:50,463	| IOT199 |	If you're thinking about your
EDL	00:53:50,463	00:53:50,975	| IOT199 |	The car is at
EDL	00:53:51,487	00:53:52,255	| IOT199 |	You pay for it
EDL	00:53:52,255	00:53:53,791	| IOT199 |	You still never owned it
EDL	00:53:53,791	00:53:55,583	| IOT199 |	And I think that's a very big shift work
EDL	00:53:56,351	00:53:57,887	| IOT199 |	Going I'm curious about your
EDL	00:53:57,887	00:53:58,655	| IOT199 |	Thoughts
EDL	00:53:58,655	00:53:59,935	| IOT199 |	How to change the business mod
EDL	00:54:00,447	00:54:01,471	| IOT199 |	How does that change
EDL	00:54:02,495	00:54:03,775	| IOT199 |	Ideas of wealth in
EDL	00:54:03,775	00:54:04,543	| IOT199 |	Halloween
EDL	00:54:04,543	00:54:05,823	| IOT199 |	Can actually build wealth up
EDL	00:54:12,735	00:54:14,527	| IOT199 |	So you mention cloud computing
EDL	00:54:14,527	00:54:20,927	| IOT199 |	An interesting analogy but I think we're
EDL	00:54:20,927	00:54:24,511	| IOT199 |	Gets a bit more problematic because it's a little bit
EDL	00:54:24,511	00:54:25,791	| IOT199 |	Expected
EDL	00:54:27,071	00:54:30,911	| IOT199 |	The nice thing about cloud computing is of course you can move the computer
EDL	00:54:30,911	00:54:37,055	| IOT199 |	Centralized Batman as long as the work is getting done and good response you don't need to know
EDL	00:54:39,103	00:54:40,127	| IOT199 |	And the reason why
EDL	00:54:40,127	00:54:46,015	| IOT199 |	What's economically is that an Enterprise was using a server at 30% of its capacity
EDL	00:54:46,527	00:54:49,087	| IOT199 |	The cloud provider says I will host
EDL	00:54:49,087	00:54:51,135	| IOT199 |	Computing loads for you
EDL	00:54:51,135	00:54:53,183	| IOT199 |	Daikin double up Triple up those
EDL	00:54:53,183	00:54:55,743	| IOT199 |	Get loan from multiple customers
EDL	00:54:55,743	00:54:56,767	| IOT199 |	Use less
EDL	00:54:56,767	00:54:58,047	| IOT199 |	Total Hardware
EDL	00:54:58,047	00:55:04,447	| IOT199 |	Tree companies using service at 30% cloud provider might be able to get away with
EDL	00:55:04,447	00:55:04,959	| IOT199 |	With all those
EDL	00:55:07,519	00:55:12,895	| IOT199 |	If you have a factory that's only use that 30% of its capacity it's really hard to rent out your factory
EDL	00:55:12,895	00:55:18,015	| IOT199 |	We have to do when we're thinking about pay-per-use models for industrial
EDL	00:55:18,015	00:55:18,783	| IOT199 |	Is
EDL	00:55:18,783	00:55:19,551	| IOT199 |	Somebody somewhere
EDL	00:55:21,343	00:55:23,903	| IOT199 |	But Nina has to be the company that makes beer
EDL	00:55:23,903	00:55:26,207	| IOT199 |	And this is where there's a very interesting
EDL	00:55:26,207	00:55:29,279	| IOT199 |	Economy for companies that want to own
EDL	00:55:29,279	00:55:30,559	| IOT199 |	Long life
EDL	00:55:31,071	00:55:33,631	| IOT199 |	Understand
EDL	00:55:33,631	00:55:39,775	| IOT199 |	If we wanted to rent out those Transformers to customers based on a pay-per-use Model if we ended up
EDL	00:55:39,775	00:55:40,799	| IOT199 |	Providing that
EDL	00:55:40,799	00:55:42,847	| IOT199 |	Former but we retain title to the app
EDL	00:55:44,639	00:55:48,479	| IOT199 |	If the customer doesn't start using it
EDL	00:55:48,991	00:55:50,783	| IOT199 |	It becomes very expensive capital
EDL	00:55:50,783	00:55:53,599	| IOT199 |	Activity
EDL	00:55:53,599	00:55:54,879	| IOT199 |	There are other company
EDL	00:55:54,879	00:55:58,975	| IOT199 |	Very happy
EDL	00:55:58,975	00:56:02,815	| IOT199 |	Pension fund know they have long-term liabilities they need to pay out
EDL	00:56:02,815	00:56:04,095	| IOT199 |	So they're looking for
EDL	00:56:04,095	00:56:06,399	| IOT199 |	Big infrastructure things that are very
EDL	00:56:06,399	00:56:07,423	| IOT199 |	Very stable
EDL	00:56:10,751	00:56:13,567	| IOT199 |	Utilization of the times that we need data
EDL	00:56:13,567	00:56:17,407	| IOT199 |	Interesting question around who owns an asset
EDL	00:56:17,407	00:56:19,455	| IOT199 |	Who is able to use the app
EDL	00:56:19,455	00:56:22,527	| IOT199 |	Who makes better
EDL	00:56:23,039	00:56:25,087	| IOT199 |	So tonight
EDL	00:56:25,087	00:56:27,391	| IOT199 |	We ended up staying connected
EDL	00:56:27,391	00:56:29,695	| IOT199 |	With a digital read that when we die
EDL	00:56:29,695	00:56:31,487	| IOT199 |	Which as we know where it is
EDL	00:56:31,487	00:56:33,535	| IOT199 |	I was getting used and who owns it
EDL	00:56:33,535	00:56:34,815	| IOT199 |	Everybody can
EDL	00:56:34,815	00:56:36,863	| IOT199 |	Eventually get the benefit of that
EDL	00:56:37,375	00:56:39,167	| IOT199 |	Wow I think you just blew my mind
EDL	00:56:39,679	00:56:40,447	| IOT199 |	I love it
EDL	00:56:40,447	00:56:41,215	| IOT199 |	Okay
EDL	00:56:41,215	00:56:43,007	| IOT199 |	Let's go then to the next obvious question
EDL	00:56:43,519	00:56:44,287	| IOT199 |	I will probably
EDL	00:56:44,287	00:56:46,079	| IOT199 |	And here before everyone else is just
EDL	00:56:46,079	00:56:47,871	| IOT199 |	Play this too much to think about here
EDL	00:56:47,871	00:56:48,895	| IOT199 |	What are the things
EDL	00:56:48,895	00:56:49,663	| IOT199 |	Yes we need to
EDL	00:56:49,663	00:56:51,199	| IOT199 |	To make this sort of vision
EDL	00:56:51,199	00:56:53,759	| IOT199 |	Possible because we are still you talked
EDL	00:56:53,759	00:56:54,271	| IOT199 |	About standard
EDL	00:56:54,783	00:56:56,575	| IOT199 |	We talked about different business model
EDL	00:56:56,575	00:56:58,111	| IOT199 |	I'm thinking about things
EDL	00:56:58,111	00:57:00,159	| IOT199 |	But hey we probably need some sort of assurance
EDL	00:57:00,671	00:57:02,463	| IOT199 |	Security those kind of things so
EDL	00:57:02,463	00:57:03,487	| IOT199 |	What are the technology
EDL	00:57:04,255	00:57:06,303	| IOT199 |	That we need to move up this nurse loves
EDL	00:57:07,583	00:57:09,631	| IOT199 |	So yes it starts with conductivity
EDL	00:57:09,631	00:57:12,447	| IOT199 |	Of course if we can't connect to the device then it doesn't work
EDL	00:57:12,447	00:57:15,007	| IOT199 |	What the good thing is
EDL	00:57:15,007	00:57:18,079	| IOT199 |	Ethernet to Wi-Fi Bluetooth
EDL	00:57:18,079	00:57:20,639	| IOT199 |	3G 4G 5G coming
EDL	00:57:20,639	00:57:26,783	| IOT199 |	Activities in increasing be solved
EDL	00:57:28,575	00:57:33,183	| IOT199 |	Earlier we'd have an additional things like time-sensitive networking
EDL	00:57:33,183	00:57:35,231	| IOT199 |	You end up with
EDL	00:57:35,231	00:57:38,303	| IOT199 |	OPC UA and other ways of standardizing the data
EDL	00:57:38,303	00:57:41,119	| IOT199 |	Change as well that's good
EDL	00:57:41,119	00:57:41,887	| IOT199 |	We definitely need
EDL	00:57:41,887	00:57:45,727	| IOT199 |	Both cloud and on-premise or fog computing
EDL	00:57:45,727	00:57:48,799	| IOT199 |	Some people think that it's all going to go to the cloud but the problem is
EDL	00:57:48,799	00:57:49,567	| IOT199 |	As we have
EDL	00:57:49,567	00:57:51,871	| IOT199 |	Huge amount of data
EDL	00:57:51,871	00:57:53,151	| IOT199 |	Latency YouTube
EDL	00:57:53,663	00:57:55,967	| IOT199 |	And we have sort of health and safety limits
EDL	00:57:55,967	00:57:56,479	| IOT199 |	Which means
EDL	00:57:57,503	00:57:58,783	| IOT199 |	Take all of those loops
EDL	00:57:58,783	00:58:01,343	| IOT199 |	Stop control and automation all the way back to the cloud
EDL	00:58:03,391	00:58:09,791	| IOT199 |	Are there we need Fantastic Tools to be able to analyze machine learning
EDL	00:58:09,791	00:58:13,631	| IOT199 |	Fantastic visualization tool
EDL	00:58:13,631	00:58:15,679	| IOT199 |	See and make sense of all of this data
EDL	00:58:16,191	00:58:18,495	| IOT199 |	Augmented reality
EDL	00:58:18,495	00:58:23,615	| IOT199 |	Visualization tools made the cameras enabled on drones
EDL	00:58:23,615	00:58:28,991	| IOT199 |	Stock us technologies that need to be assembled not to mention of course that you mentioned earlier in fiber
EDL	00:58:28,991	00:58:30,015	| IOT199 |	To make all of this effect
EDL	00:58:30,527	00:58:31,551	| IOT199 |	And it's
EDL	00:58:31,551	00:58:33,087	| IOT199 |	Almost like the moon shot
EDL	00:58:33,087	00:58:34,623	| IOT199 |	Hibachi it's a bit like
EDL	00:58:34,623	00:58:35,647	| IOT199 |	We have to get
EDL	00:58:35,647	00:58:36,671	| IOT199 |	Everything
EDL	00:58:36,671	00:58:37,951	| IOT199 |	Well aligned working
EDL	00:58:37,951	00:58:38,975	| IOT199 |	Very well
EDL	00:58:38,975	00:58:41,535	| IOT199 |	Ultimately benefits from you
EDL	00:58:41,535	00:58:44,351	| IOT199 |	And to be able to make it foolproof and plug and pray and
EDL	00:58:44,351	00:58:46,143	| IOT199 |	Do you think we'll be able to do that
EDL	00:58:48,447	00:58:54,591	| IOT199 |	I think we will be able to do it and I think we'll do that by eating the elephant
EDL	00:59:01,247	00:59:01,759	| IOT199 |	Walmart
