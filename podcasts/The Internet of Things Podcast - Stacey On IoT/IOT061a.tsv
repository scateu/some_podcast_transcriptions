EDL	00:00:06,656	00:00:12,800	| IOT061a |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast either host Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:13,312	00:00:14,592	| IOT061a |	If this is your co-host
EDL	00:00:14,592	00:00:15,616	| IOT061a |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:15,616	00:00:21,248	| IOT061a |	And today we have a great show for you today we're going to talk about Google home Atari and iot
EDL	00:00:21,248	00:00:23,808	| IOT061a |	Possibly some new Wi-Fi low-power effort
EDL	00:00:25,344	00:00:26,368	| IOT061a |	A bit about
EDL	00:00:26,368	00:00:27,648	| IOT061a |	Smart home hubs
EDL	00:00:27,648	00:00:28,416	| IOT061a |	Plus
EDL	00:00:28,416	00:00:32,256	| IOT061a |	I have a great guest for you it's Chris Herbert who is the CEO of tracker
EDL	00:00:32,256	00:00:35,072	| IOT061a |	Who's going to talk about a brand new indoor positioning system
EDL	00:00:35,072	00:00:35,840	| IOT061a |	Which
EDL	00:00:35,840	00:00:36,352	| IOT061a |	I love
EDL	00:00:36,864	00:00:38,144	| IOT061a |	We love presents
EDL	00:00:40,960	00:00:45,824	| IOT061a |	Alright so let's get started with the Google home the information
EDL	00:00:45,824	00:00:48,896	| IOT061a |	Which man are they just like rocking it hard or what
EDL	00:00:49,920	00:00:54,784	| IOT061a |	They typically do they they have really good sources and they get some good scoops
EDL	00:00:54,784	00:00:55,808	| IOT061a |	They do so
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:00:57,344	| IOT061a |	They are reporting that
EDL	00:00:57,856	00:00:59,648	| IOT061a |	The chip inside
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:03,232	| IOT061a |	Google home and Google home is the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:04,256	| IOT061a |	Like product
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:06,048	| IOT061a |	That is not actually at the market
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:08,096	| IOT061a |	People are calling it
EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:09,632	| IOT061a |	Air freshener
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:12,192	| IOT061a |	That you can look like an air freshener
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:15,776	| IOT061a |	So this has the same chip inside
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:16,800	| IOT061a |	As the
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:19,104	| IOT061a |	Kevin
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:23,968	| IOT061a |	Chromecast is what the information says they have a dispute with a person with direct knowledge of the plan
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:27,552	| IOT061a |	Notes I work for Google I have no direct knowledge of the plan
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:31,392	| IOT061a |	But this is what they were told that the guts of Home in the same as the Chromecast
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:34,464	| IOT061a |	I can't say that I'm surprised because
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:39,328	| IOT061a |	When the Google home personal assistant product was announced at the Google IO Keynote
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:43,424	| IOT061a |	They said it was built on Chromecast technology so that kind of
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:48,544	| IOT061a |	Let me to believe it be similar and I don't know that it's a bad thing cuz the Google Chromecast
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:49,312	| IOT061a |	Is
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:55,200	| IOT061a |	Relatively popular relatively inexpensive I think it's about 30-35 bucks you can usually find it on sale
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:56,736	| IOT061a |	Great to stream mirror
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:02:03,136	| IOT061a |	Cast audio to video around the house and so on so I guess our people staycity thing people are getting talking about this
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:06,464	| IOT061a |	Because they're thinking the cost of Google home will be low like a Chromecast
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:10,560	| IOT061a |	I think people are just excited about Google home in any Speck of information
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,584	| IOT061a |	Gets them something
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:12,096	| IOT061a |	But
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,376	| IOT061a |	I will say
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:15,168	| IOT061a |	Having a wide
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:16,960	| IOT061a |	Birth of products
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:20,032	| IOT061a |	Use the same silicon means you can buy in Greater bulk
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,312	| IOT061a |	And every time you're buying
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,080	| IOT061a |	Chips
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:22,848	| IOT061a |	Focus better
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:24,640	| IOT061a |	Total or your ear
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,664	| IOT061a |	Your cost per unit
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:28,224	| IOT061a |	So can I looked at the
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:30,272	| IOT061a |	Purported ship inside
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:31,808	| IOT061a |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,600	| IOT061a |	Which of these are based
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:35,648	| IOT061a |	Teardowns in the end of 2015
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:37,696	| IOT061a |	From ifixit.com
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:38,208	| IOT061a |	Yes
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,000	| IOT061a |	Lovely people
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,792	| IOT061a |	And so
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:46,144	| IOT061a |	So just give me a little chippy but bear with us we're getting chippy we are
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:49,728	| IOT061a |	The Amazon Echo for its brains
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:50,752	| IOT061a |	Uses
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:54,080	| IOT061a |	I was actually kind of surprised it's a lower power TI omap
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,616	| IOT061a |	DaVinci price
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,640	| IOT061a |	It's a DaVinci process
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:58,176	| IOT061a |	Correct correct
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:03,040	| IOT061a |	I think this particular chip debuted in 2010 its head berries variation since then
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:08,160	| IOT061a |	But this is not like a super high-end chip like you have in a high-end smartphone for example its
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:10,976	| IOT061a |	It does the job obviously cuz it's a good product
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:13,792	| IOT061a |	But this is not an expensive chip it's not a
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:15,072	| IOT061a |	Super powerful chip
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:19,680	| IOT061a |	I think we looked we dug around for cost and I think we found under thirty bucks for the chip
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,704	| IOT061a |	Write in
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:23,520	| IOT061a |	I can guarantee you that Amazon snot
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,616	| IOT061a |	Although you don't it doesn't have to drive a screen
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,664	| IOT061a |	Which means it can be
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,200	| IOT061a |	Lower performance
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,480	| IOT061a |	But with the
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:35,552	| IOT061a |	Google chip in there using the Marvell Armada
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,088	| IOT061a |	It looks like that
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:37,856	| IOT061a |	Mini Plus
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:38,880	| IOT061a |	SOC
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:41,952	| IOT061a |	And that actually it does have to dry the screen
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:42,464	| IOT061a |	Inure
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:43,744	| IOT061a |	Television
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:47,840	| IOT061a |	It cast output video content at 1080p s
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:50,656	| IOT061a |	So that's that's a little bit more
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:52,704	| IOT061a |	But that ship only costs what does that cause
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:57,056	| IOT061a |	That one I haven't seen a cost to be honest
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:59,104	| IOT061a |	So yeah I'm not sure how much.
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,384	| IOT061a |	Prospect
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:00,896	| IOT061a |	More than
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,688	| IOT061a |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,480	| IOT061a |	You know just for me
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,272	| IOT061a |	Performance perspective
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:09,600	| IOT061a |	Looking at this it looks like maybe
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:13,952	| IOT061a |	The Marvell Armada can deliver a little bit more gigahertz
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:14,464	| IOT061a |	Performance
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:19,071	| IOT061a |	It's also we're sourcing this from a non-tech
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,095	| IOT061a |	Because those guys
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:21,631	| IOT061a |	They're freaking out
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:23,167	| IOT061a |	They know their stuff absolutely
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,703	| IOT061a |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,983	| IOT061a |	The fountain actually went to work for Apple
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,823	| IOT061a |	I guess at the end of the day
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:30,335	| IOT061a |	You can't
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:36,991	| IOT061a |	Figure out what the cost of an item to be based solely on the bill of materials but it does give you a good indication of what
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,807	| IOT061a |	You know what it may cost them in the company could choose to
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:41,855	| IOT061a |	Pretty something at a loss and so on and so forth but
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,647	| IOT061a |	So I guess if
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:47,487	| IOT061a |	Again people probably trying to figure out how much Google home is going to cost we don't know
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:48,511	| IOT061a |	But you know I
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:50,559	| IOT061a |	Could it be as much as an Amazon Echo it could be
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:51,839	| IOT061a |	But
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:54,399	| IOT061a |	I don't think I'd be higher by any means
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:57,983	| IOT061a |	But it also gives you a sense of what these devices are designed to do
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,823	| IOT061a |	In a relatively low power processors
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,871	| IOT061a |	In there as the Braves
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:05,663	| IOT061a |	Shows how much of the
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,943	| IOT061a |	Computing brain power is actually
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:08,735	| IOT061a |	Cloud
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:13,087	| IOT061a |	Not a surprise but sometimes if you see like a crazy high power chip in there you'd be like
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:16,415	| IOT061a |	They're going to run some stuff inside
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:19,231	| IOT061a |	The reason this matters is things like smart home hubs
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:23,583	| IOT061a |	You want them to be able to actually do something still even when they're not connected
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,351	| IOT061a |	The internet
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:30,751	| IOT061a |	Very much so very much so and with these personal assistant products the natural language processing is actually done in the cloud
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:33,567	| IOT061a |	Finger point about where the processing is done
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:36,383	| IOT061a |	They don't need to know the latest and greatest
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,919	| IOT061a |	Mobile chip in these things
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:39,967	| IOT061a |	Bright and we don't see a lot of memory
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:46,111	| IOT061a |	I think there's four gig in the in the Echo Basin letter down for example
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:49,183	| IOT061a |	A conversion chips but nothing like
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:49,695	| IOT061a |	Super excited
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,511	| IOT061a |	Just keep that in mind guys
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:55,583	| IOT061a |	Little context for your day on the
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:57,375	| IOT061a |	The information's little story
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,423	| IOT061a |	I don't say little in a mean way
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,959	| IOT061a |	Just the story that wrote about this
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:03,007	| IOT061a |	Well they call that Google home Little secret
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,799	| IOT061a |	So that's where the little comes around
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:09,151	| IOT061a |	That's really little secret but I did click on my headliner
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:12,991	| IOT061a |	What is the great headline but I was kind of shook my head in life
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:20,671	| IOT061a |	All right so other chip news
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,439	| IOT061a |	Qualcomm
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:27,071	| IOT061a |	I was going to say comdex I'm just I'm not on my game today guys at computex
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:28,095	| IOT061a |	In Taipei
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:31,679	| IOT061a |	In Taipei introduced the Snapdragon wear 1100
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,703	| IOT061a |	SOC
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:34,495	| IOT061a |	Less smart wearables I like that
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:43,967	| IOT061a |	Well that was my head like that was actually my show noticed I called it less smart because they actually introduced the snap
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:46,783	| IOT061a |	Dragonwear 2100 back at Mobile World Congress
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:50,111	| IOT061a |	And that was going to you know get better battery life and
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:52,415	| IOT061a |	You bring more Smart Start device isn't someone
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,695	| IOT061a |	The 1100
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,975	| IOT061a |	As you can gather from the
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:56,511	| IOT061a |	Numerical naming
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,279	| IOT061a |	Is
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,815	| IOT061a |	Lower spec
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,607	| IOT061a |	Chip and it's basically for
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:03,935	| IOT061a |	Things like kid tracking and other
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:07,775	| IOT061a |	Type of wearables that don't require a ton of processing power so
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:10,079	| IOT061a |	We can still do everything and
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:12,895	| IOT061a |	It's just not going to be as a performer that would guess
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:16,991	| IOT061a |	Yeah it's got LTE built-in + 3G Bluetooth Wi-Fi
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,015	| IOT061a |	And
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:21,855	| IOT061a |	Haswell in application processor for linux-based applique
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,367	| IOT061a |	Patience so
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:23,391	| IOT061a |	That's
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:26,207	| IOT061a |	That's actually pretty good
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:29,535	| IOT061a |	I think it's really worth noting that as The Internet of Things
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:36,703	| IOT061a |	Expanse chip companies are really having to work their butts off to create these different skews
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:38,751	| IOT061a |	Which were seeing their good at that
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,775	| IOT061a |	But they're also
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:43,615	| IOT061a |	As they do this they're having to change their distribution model
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,639	| IOT061a |	To deal with
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:47,199	| IOT061a |	So many more potential customers
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:50,015	| IOT061a |	Beforehand a company like Qualcomm had baby
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:51,807	| IOT061a |	Maybe a couple dozen
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:55,391	| IOT061a |	Less than a hundred customers cuz they were just selling chips for phones right
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,183	| IOT061a |	So
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,463	| IOT061a |	This is a big
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:01,023	| IOT061a |	Not this individual thing but this is part of a whole
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:03,071	| IOT061a |	Pixie change for all these cuz
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,863	| IOT061a |	These chip makers who are like
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:11,007	| IOT061a |	Oh man now I got to support so many more customers they're turning to like distribution Distributors like arrow and others
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:16,127	| IOT061a |	And they're also like oh my God now I don't have something I can sell like a billion chips
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:20,223	| IOT061a |	Right it's a far broader distribution of
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:21,503	| IOT061a |	Taipan
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,783	| IOT061a |	Customers you said
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:26,623	| IOT061a |	And even their companies coming out of woodwork now just building phone building
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:31,743	| IOT061a |	Wearable devices virtual reality things I mean in Qualcomm
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:38,143	| IOT061a |	Did they have to know they got to focus on all these different form-factors where they didn't have to as much before they got to worry about chip size and
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,423	| IOT061a |	Brightmoor. Battery life
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,983	| IOT061a |	Not that they didn't before
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:42,751	| IOT061a |	But
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:48,639	| IOT061a |	The variance in all these is it's just you know it's good for them it's good business for them but it also is a challenge for them
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:49,663	| IOT061a |	Exactly
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,967	| IOT061a |	Other
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,991	| IOT061a |	What else what else
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:53,759	| IOT061a |	Should we talk about
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,039	| IOT061a |	We should talk about Jabo
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:09:01,183	| IOT061a |	We should talk cuz everybody's talking about dry bone and everybody's saying lots of different things about you
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:03,743	| IOT061a |	So fun Friday Fortune reported
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:06,303	| IOT061a |	Jawbone with exiting the speaker business
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,071	| IOT061a |	Jawbone
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,119	| IOT061a |	You know you guys may not be aware of it
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:10,655	| IOT061a |	Probably are makes the
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:14,751	| IOT061a |	Chipmunks oh my God what is it called the marmara
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:18,591	| IOT061a |	Okay
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:22,687	| IOT061a |	Makes that so they were talking about exiting that
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:28,831	| IOT061a |	This week Tech Insider reported that jaw bone had halted there
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,111	| IOT061a |	Band Productions
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:32,415	| IOT061a |	And sold off their name trackers to a third party
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,183	| IOT061a |	Reseller
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:33,695	| IOT061a |	But
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:35,743	| IOT061a |	Payback in
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:36,511	| IOT061a |	Good night
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,047	| IOT061a |	So
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:40,607	| IOT061a |	What we do know is back in November they laid off
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,631	| IOT061a |	Chunk of their staff
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,399	| IOT061a |	There
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:45,983	| IOT061a |	Neck-and-neck with Fitbit or probably less neck-and-neck now which
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,263	| IOT061a |	Indicate something
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:52,127	| IOT061a |	And business is just getting super super complicated
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,663	| IOT061a |	In there
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,431	| IOT061a |	Statement
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:58,271	| IOT061a |	I'm saying that hey don't know we're still producing up Fitness bands
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:00,831	| IOT061a |	They did indicate that they were willing to go to
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,623	| IOT061a |	Clinical
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:03,647	| IOT061a |	Quality bands
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,463	| IOT061a |	I thought that was kind of
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,255	| IOT061a |	That's very telling
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:08,767	| IOT061a |	Fairy Tail
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:12,863	| IOT061a |	Yeah I could fit it really has been owning this wearable
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,143	| IOT061a |	Mail tracking Market
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,167	| IOT061a |	Of weight
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:17,215	| IOT061a |	Based on reports of
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:20,287	| IOT061a |	Market share sales etc mean we really don't know we don't have to
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,311	| IOT061a |	All the exact
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,079	| IOT061a |	Details but
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,615	| IOT061a |	That's what the reports have been
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,663	| IOT061a |	And we all know that
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:30,271	| IOT061a |	Okay the next step for wearables is not just consumer-grade but actual clinical grade
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:33,599	| IOT061a |	That requires you to get FDA approval that's a whole convoluted process
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:36,671	| IOT061a |	But that's what's next and I think
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:42,559	| IOT061a |	Again these are all these rumors but I suspect they are true in that job was trying to get ahead of the Curve
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,839	| IOT061a |	Build upon what it
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:46,655	| IOT061a |	Learn through the consumer wearable Market
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:50,495	| IOT061a |	And jump into the clinical Market as soon as possible it's kind of beat everybody to the punch
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,287	| IOT061a |	Except I can't be
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:52,799	| IOT061a |	Certain
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:57,663	| IOT061a |	That's a very good point there they're not the first to jump into that market
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:59,455	| IOT061a |	And this is probably why
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:02,015	| IOT061a |	Also recent news Nokia but why things
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:05,087	| IOT061a |	And I have to make a quick correction
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:07,135	| IOT061a |	Did not say that
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:07,647	| IOT061a |	It was doing the clinic
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,951	| IOT061a |	What's the verge
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:15,839	| IOT061a |	Reporting that jaw bone with still make wearable devices and it's creating quote a clinical grade health-tracking related
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:16,863	| IOT061a |	The heart monitor
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,423	| IOT061a |	So
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,703	| IOT061a |	Jawbone
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:22,239	| IOT061a |	Basically the only thing
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,519	| IOT061a |	You said officially here
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:24,287	| IOT061a |	Is that
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,335	| IOT061a |	The brand is not going to
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:28,895	| IOT061a |	So 30
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:32,735	| IOT061a |	So there's a lot of if he's as someone who wears a jaw bone
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,503	| IOT061a |	Tracker
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:37,087	| IOT061a |	I would be really sad to see
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:42,975	| IOT061a |	The software go away although I did notice that very recently my permissions changed drastically
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:46,815	| IOT061a |	And I was curious what that meant I thought maybe it meant that they were
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,839	| IOT061a |	Either going to add
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:50,399	| IOT061a |	About your new features or that they sold it or something
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:54,239	| IOT061a |	Can can you export your data out of the jaw bone
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:54,751	| IOT061a |	System
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:12:01,919	| IOT061a |	Yes vote has been very open job has been kind of fun because in the reason why I went with it is because it works with so many
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:02,687	| IOT061a |	Other connected
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,223	| IOT061a |	Home systems
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:05,503	| IOT061a |	So
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:07,551	| IOT061a |	An infant Deadspin
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:14,719	| IOT061a |	I hope that we could still have jaw bones although I'm a little concerned about
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:16,255	| IOT061a |	Buying another job phone so
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:18,815	| IOT061a |	Baby don't do that
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:22,655	| IOT061a |	Yeah I don't know that I would do that right now
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,679	| IOT061a |	I guess it's the best thing ever
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:25,215	| IOT061a |	Let's see what they do
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:25,983	| IOT061a |	Hold on
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:28,031	| IOT061a |	Alright other cool news
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,799	| IOT061a |	Is
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:33,151	| IOT061a |	I don't know this cool it's a cool cuz it's about it is cool it's cool for multiple days
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:38,527	| IOT061a |	So basically Atari has teamed up with sick Fox which is the low power
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:44,415	| IOT061a |	Wider in neck networking standard they use in France they're building at work at San Francisco
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:46,719	| IOT061a |	How to make iot devices for the Smart Home
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:49,535	| IOT061a |	And this kind of came out of left field
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:52,095	| IOT061a |	Yeah it came out of nowhere I'll other
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:54,399	| IOT061a |	I'm a little confused cuz there's a
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,959	| IOT061a |	House for lease on the Atari website that
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:13:01,055	| IOT061a |	Dated May 5th but this really didn't come out until May 29th
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:01,567	| IOT061a |	So
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,151	| IOT061a |	Yeah and the date in the Press phases May 31st
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:06,943	| IOT061a |	Yasso
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:08,223	| IOT061a |	I kind of was like
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:11,807	| IOT061a |	Think there might be a little bit of an issue there with the date so we're going to call this
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:16,671	| IOT061a |	I feel like we would have noticed it before now if it were
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:17,439	| IOT061a |	So
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:19,231	| IOT061a |	There's not a lot of information
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:19,743	| IOT061a |	In this world
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:23,583	| IOT061a |	It's it's basically like Hey we're going to make some
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:24,095	| IOT061a |	Connected
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:26,911	| IOT061a |	I will say sigfox
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,679	| IOT061a |	The standard
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,471	| IOT061a |	Super low data rate
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,519	| IOT061a |	We're talking like
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:39,199	| IOT061a |	This is this is this is the IRT Network that they say I
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,991	| IOT061a |	I think it has over 7 million devices on it
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,807	| IOT061a |	Yes but those devices are things like
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:44,319	| IOT061a |	Tyco smoke detector
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,367	| IOT061a |	Well that's okay
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:49,695	| IOT061a |	Yes it is I'm just I'm just trying it like so these are
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,231	| IOT061a |	Wicked awesome
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,511	| IOT061a |	Massive
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:55,583	| IOT061a |	Data consuming kind of things
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,351	| IOT061a |	Price likely
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,143	| IOT061a |	I'm thinking
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:58,911	| IOT061a |	Sensors
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:00,959	| IOT061a |	You know
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,775	| IOT061a |	Again we don't know maybe M2M types.
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:07,615	| IOT061a |	In the sigfox network requires
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:09,407	| IOT061a |	A separate infrastructure so
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:16,319	| IOT061a |	The other thing to think about what this is if they are working solely with cefoxitin and that may not be the case
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:17,343	| IOT061a |	They can always put Wi-Fi into the
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,927	| IOT061a |	If it was sick Fox
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:26,303	| IOT061a |	The devices will only work in a limited number of places where sick fox has it Network
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:28,351	| IOT061a |	18 countries right now I believe
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,143	| IOT061a |	I don't know
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:33,727	| IOT061a |	So not terrible just
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,007	| IOT061a |	Worth
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:38,591	| IOT061a |	They did a luta what they're going to bring with what Ataris going to be
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:42,431	| IOT061a |	Building and bring them to 6 Fox network and I'm just going to read this right out of the press release
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:46,527	| IOT061a |	The initial product line will include categories such as home pets
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,319	| IOT061a |	Lifestyle and safety
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:50,111	| IOT061a |	I know that's very nebulous but
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:52,671	| IOT061a |	It speaks to I think presents
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,951	| IOT061a |	Your pet tracking
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:56,255	| IOT061a |	Safety again maybe
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:15:00,351	| IOT061a |	Yeah could be a pack my smoke detector I don't know
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:01,375	| IOT061a |	So
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:03,423	| IOT061a |	You will have to see what they're going to do but
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:05,215	| IOT061a |	Still kind of thought it was because it was Atari
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:06,239	| IOT061a |	Yes
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:13,151	| IOT061a |	Which of course ran to the website and yes yes yes they did
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:13,919	| IOT061a |	Sold
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:16,479	| IOT061a |	Few times since the video game crash
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:17,759	| IOT061a |	In the early 80s but yeah
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,039	| IOT061a |	Still around
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,599	| IOT061a |	That's that's
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:22,367	| IOT061a |	It will it will see what
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:23,391	| IOT061a |	What comes of that
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:27,999	| IOT061a |	Other bit of news also, super geeky but keep your eye on this because
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:31,071	| IOT061a |	I don't know I am excited by Wi-Fi
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,375	| IOT061a |	The IEEE is looking at
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:36,447	| IOT061a |	Proposing a wake-up receiver
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:39,775	| IOT061a |	Standard for 802. 11 which is the
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:41,311	| IOT061a |	The Wi-Fi stand
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,103	| IOT061a |	So what this is basically
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:45,407	| IOT061a |	Only low-power you let your
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:47,711	| IOT061a |	Wi-Fi stuff would actually go to sleep
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:50,527	| IOT061a |	When it needs to wake up
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:52,063	| IOT061a |	Data packet to the
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:53,599	| IOT061a |	The flow that says go
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,367	| IOT061a |	Wake up
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,391	| IOT061a |	And that it would wake up
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:57,439	| IOT061a |	And everything could be active
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:01,023	| IOT061a |	Send transmit whatever data needed and then come back
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:03,327	| IOT061a |	That's not how Wi-Fi works
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,655	| IOT061a |	I think that's actually how
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,167	| IOT061a |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:09,727	| IOT061a |	They have a
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:10,239	| IOT061a |	Wake up
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,031	| IOT061a |	But
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,311	| IOT061a |	Either way
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:16,895	| IOT061a |	This is something apparently that's been in the works for a long time
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:21,759	| IOT061a |	Sidelines by the Wi-Fi Halo effort
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:24,575	| IOT061a |	And those are basically in the
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,599	| IOT061a |	Those are in the
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,391	| IOT061a |	In a different Spectrum band
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:33,791	| IOT061a |	It's 900 megahertz and those efforts are all about giving you better coverage and places where the
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:37,119	| IOT061a |	Current 2.4 and 5 gigahertz radios just can't
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,887	| IOT061a |	Riesling
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,167	| IOT061a |	Checking stuff
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:39,679	| IOT061a |	In your basement
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:41,983	| IOT061a |	If they do say they are low power but
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:42,495	| IOT061a |	They don't have this
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:44,799	| IOT061a |	Yeah I know
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:51,199	| IOT061a |	The obvious benefit here is this would save power and actually I I have a device that I wish I'd had this now
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,967	| IOT061a |	One of my
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:52,735	| IOT061a |	Smart watches
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:56,319	| IOT061a |	Has Wi-Fi so that way when I'm out of Bluetooth range from my phone
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:59,647	| IOT061a |	I can still get notifications and open apps and do things
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:03,487	| IOT061a |	It just connects over Wi-Fi to do that so it's a very limited
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:09,375	| IOT061a |	Time them using Wi-Fi and if that Wi-Fi radio is on all the time and actively saying give me today to give me data
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:11,423	| IOT061a |	You know it's wasting juice so
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:14,751	| IOT061a |	Another place this would be great as a lot of the water
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:17,567	| IOT061a |	There's not a lot of leak sensors with Wi-Fi
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:23,199	| IOT061a |	Another's the battery life
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:25,503	| IOT061a |	But something like this where it wakes up
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,271	| IOT061a |	You know
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:28,575	| IOT061a |	Once a day
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:29,343	| IOT061a |	Am I wet
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,111	| IOT061a |	Okay
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,391	| IOT061a |	This would only work for
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:35,743	| IOT061a |	Like rushing it in your house you
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,023	| IOT061a |	I don't know how
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:42,143	| IOT061a |	Speaking of water leak
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:44,191	| IOT061a |	I should mention this because
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:47,775	| IOT061a |	It happened after we recorded the podcast but it's actually big news
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,287	| IOT061a |	Belkin
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:49,823	| IOT061a |	Has
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:54,687	| IOT061a |	Teamed up with open or which is a plumbing supply company to create a brand new company called
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:55,455	| IOT061a |	Spin
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:57,503	| IOT061a |	What is doing Leak Detection sensors
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:00,831	| IOT061a |	Spinlaunch last week with 40 million dollars in it
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,903	| IOT061a |	Phy in
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:10,815	| IOT061a |	I just thought I wrote about it the newsletter but I thought it was worth talking about of the podcast because the idea here is
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:15,935	| IOT061a |	Is not that you'd have sensors around your home but you'd install something like underneath your sink faucet
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:22,335	| IOT061a |	Or if you're a builder you can actually install it on the water main when you're building the house the line into the house and you could install
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,615	| IOT061a |	Automatic shut-off valve
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:24,895	| IOT061a |	And
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,175	| IOT061a |	Sensors with
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:33,343	| IOT061a |	Detect leaks based on the amount of water flowing through your house basically the same sort of thing they do
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,879	| IOT061a |	Do it on the electricity side with
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:35,903	| IOT061a |	Proteinuria
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,183	| IOT061a |	Curb
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:39,487	| IOT061a |	Monitoring of flow
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:44,351	| IOT061a |	This is kind of really promising because I've never had a leak in a place where it had a leak sensor
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,655	| IOT061a |	I was like yes please
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:50,495	| IOT061a |	Yeah I know it makes sense that it monitoring
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:52,799	| IOT061a |	The actual water as opposed to just
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:53,823	| IOT061a |	A specific
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:58,943	| IOT061a |	Spot where you might be looking for a week even though the league might be three feet away and the sensor doesn't see the lead so
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,455	| IOT061a |	Make sense
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:01,247	| IOT061a |	Now this isn't out yet
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:02,783	| IOT061a |	Just creative company
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:04,319	| IOT061a |	It has 40 million in funding
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:07,135	| IOT061a |	I'm Keen to see what happen
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:09,183	| IOT061a |	Prince here I hope to try this out
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:09,695	| IOT061a |	Because again
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:11,999	| IOT061a |	Weeks super expensive
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:17,887	| IOT061a |	I love the fact that they're going after not just kind of consumers but also like insurance companies and
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:20,191	| IOT061a |	Know what are they called builders
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:23,007	| IOT061a |	Steelers
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,287	| IOT061a |	So
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:25,567	| IOT061a |	That's just
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:27,103	| IOT061a |	Kind of cool information
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:31,199	| IOT061a |	As long as I can turn it off when I fill my pool in the Memorial Day weekend
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:31,967	| IOT061a |	Wow
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:34,527	| IOT061a |	You don't have to turn it off it just would check that
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,295	| IOT061a |	Timothy Lake weather
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:37,343	| IOT061a |	And you be like no that is not a leak
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:38,623	| IOT061a |	That is not a week false alarm
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:40,671	| IOT061a |	Is it a little baby pool
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,655	| IOT061a |	It's only if it's 2500 gallons is not
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,423	| IOT061a |	Not like
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:52,703	| IOT061a |	30000 gallon
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:53,727	| IOT061a |	Trulia
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:59,871	| IOT061a |	Never get there.
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:00,895	| IOT061a |	Anyone
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:02,943	| IOT061a |	Though I can't imagine
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,087	| IOT061a |	Prof. Xs
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:12,159	| IOT061a |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,439	| IOT061a |	Okay
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:15,487	| IOT061a |	So final story for us this way
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:17,535	| IOT061a |	Which is The Wirecutter
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:19,839	| IOT061a |	This is actually we should have put it in last week
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,375	| IOT061a |	Ranking
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:23,679	| IOT061a |	Smart home hubs
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:27,519	| IOT061a |	And it shows as their number one pick
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:30,079	| IOT061a |	I'm cringing cuz I know people going to cringe when they hear it
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:33,151	| IOT061a |	Samsung SmartThings platform
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:34,943	| IOT061a |	Which
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,223	| IOT061a |	No
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:43,391	| IOT061a |	But you you're saying no I'm saying I don't know cuz I have not used it I've only use my wink and in terms of that and the wink was
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,927	| IOT061a |	Is there also great pic
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:46,975	| IOT061a |	I'm not as good but also great
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:52,863	| IOT061a |	But we've heard and we reported on some of the Samsung Smart Home issues in the past between security issues and
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:56,447	| IOT061a |	Developer mentality and mindset and so on and so forth
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,727	| IOT061a |	Love the mind
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,519	| IOT061a |	Right now they're having
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:01,567	| IOT061a |	Problems even before they had their problems
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,591	| IOT061a |	They were having reliability
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,407	| IOT061a |	I would say if you want to follow this
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:06,431	| IOT061a |	And get one
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,223	| IOT061a |	You know I love playing with
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:09,759	| IOT061a |	I would never give this
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:12,575	| IOT061a |	To somebody who's not willing to put in the hours
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,343	| IOT061a |	Gotcha
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:18,208	| IOT061a |	It's gotten better like maybe 85% of the time it does what it's supposed to do when it's supposed to do it
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:22,816	| IOT061a |	But like they have this monitoring service with Scout that you actually pay for
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:24,864	| IOT061a |	Don't do that
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:27,168	| IOT061a |	No because you need more reliability
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:27,680	| IOT061a |	They're just not
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:36,384	| IOT061a |	They actually do cover a bunch of other devices that they tested and get pros and cons so it's probably well worth reading the article I think
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,920	| IOT061a |	Yes because they talked about the
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:39,712	| IOT061a |	The caseta smart home plug
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:41,760	| IOT061a |	And how you can try that with
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:42,784	| IOT061a |	Homekit
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:44,064	| IOT061a |	Then move it you know in.
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:44,832	| IOT061a |	Beyond lighting
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:46,624	| IOT061a |	What's a Barbie on lighting
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,928	| IOT061a |	There's insteon which is our favorite
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,976	| IOT061a |	Lowe's Iris Smart Home
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:52,768	| IOT061a |	Cuddelink staple
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:53,792	| IOT061a |	Disconnect hub
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:55,840	| IOT061a |	That was that was originally the runner-up pick
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,376	| IOT061a |	But
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,400	| IOT061a |	Since it's going to be
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:00,704	| IOT061a |	Possibly discontinuing that
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,984	| IOT061a |	Didn't choose it as a renter up
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,800	| IOT061a |	Which fits with what I thought I loved
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:09,152	| IOT061a |	I thought it was actually one of my favorites that's the one I would give to people

EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,840	| IOT061a |	Three times and I was like
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:06,400	| IOT061a |	I've reached the point where it
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:07,936	| IOT061a |	It cost more to like replace it
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:11,520	| IOT061a |	So let's talk about
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:12,032	| IOT061a |	Kind of

EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:38,400	| IOT061a |	Reason to start
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:40,704	| IOT061a |	The ocean was by

EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,928	| IOT061a |	At least I don't think I'm
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:08,096	| IOT061a |	You have to manually memorize where
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:09,888	| IOT061a |	What if we could get the task
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,680	| IOT061a |	Where I can fire
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:13,984	| IOT061a |	So we don't have to
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:16,288	| IOT061a |	Right so that your

EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:36,768	| IOT061a |	Which of the dongle that lasted about 1-day battery life
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,072	| IOT061a |	$70
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:43,680	| IOT061a |	And then in 2012
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:46,752	| IOT061a |	Release
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:51,360	| IOT061a |	And a tracking device
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:52,384	| IOT061a |	Not really
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:55,712	| IOT061a |	It help desk is mainstream Dan
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,992	| IOT061a |	Continue.
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:00,832	| IOT061a |	Bravo
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:06,464	| IOT061a |	And it also our new product
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,072	| IOT061a |	We are going to talk about that but
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:13,632	| IOT061a |	I'd like to think about cuz this is
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:15,424	| IOT061a |	This to me is a crazy stat
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:17,472	| IOT061a |	One that you started the so early
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:20,032	| IOT061a |	Into that your first iteration cost
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:24,128	| IOT061a |	60 to $70 and you had to charge it every night and people still wanted to buy it
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:26,176	| IOT061a |	That's nuts
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:30,016	| IOT061a |	Dykes in the in the process
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:33,600	| IOT061a |	From moving from that to where you are now
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:37,184	| IOT061a |	I'm assuming things like hey there's now Bluetooth low energy
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:38,976	| IOT061a |	There's also
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,512	| IOT061a |	Superchips
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,816	| IOT061a |	Let's think about how the world is changed
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:44,096	| IOT061a |	Made it easier for
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,400	| IOT061a |	Yeah I mean a lot
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:50,496	| IOT061a |	And continuous change dramatically
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:51,008	| IOT061a |	Is that
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,824	| IOT061a |	Bee Company
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:59,968	| IOT061a |	Watching a launch with a cheerful energy
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:02,272	| IOT061a |	I thought that was
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:04,832	| IOT061a |	And
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:10,720	| IOT061a |	And it was only able to talk
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:12,768	| IOT061a |	On BlackBerry and
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:16,352	| IOT061a |	So now
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,888	| IOT061a |	Eating with the adoption of
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:22,496	| IOT061a |	IOS enable
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:28,384	| IOT061a |	Really
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:30,176	| IOT061a |	And I think that's
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,296	| IOT061a |	People with it.
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:39,648	| IOT061a |	And iPhone 4S.
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:41,184	| IOT061a |	And
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:42,464	| IOT061a |	You are able to get
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:49,632	| IOT061a |	Smaller and cheaper because all the Silicon manufacturer
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:51,424	| IOT061a |	Everyone keeps on Staring.
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:58,336	| IOT061a |	And billion devices are 50 billion devices
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:02,432	| IOT061a |	Now going to be I believe 18 billion devices by 2020
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:07,552	| IOT061a |	18 billion / 25
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:11,648	| IOT061a |	Especially
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,416	| IOT061a |	Nordic really
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:14,976	| IOT061a |	Stop reaching out to
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:16,768	| IOT061a |	Startups in a plane
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:17,792	| IOT061a |	Get to Market quickly
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:20,864	| IOT061a |	Really bruh
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:22,912	| IOT061a |	Sheknives I think the entire
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:27,008	| IOT061a |	Industry for all these different years
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:29,056	| IOT061a |	Smart tracking devices
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:32,128	| IOT061a |	Panda
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,736	| IOT061a |	Adoption of
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:41,344	| IOT061a |	Mm
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:43,392	| IOT061a |	Xidan Fitbit started
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:44,160	| IOT061a |	Stopping 7
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:50,304	| IOT061a |	I'm trying to think I think the first one was another Market until like 20
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:54,912	| IOT061a |	I want to check that
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:59,264	| IOT061a |	Fact check
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:04,640	| IOT061a |	Turn around
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:06,176	| IOT061a |	Wednesday
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:11,552	| IOT061a |	There will be 28.
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:13,856	| IOT061a |	That's their latest and greatest forecast
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,392	| IOT061a |	And I think the
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:22,048	| IOT061a |	Tire industry
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:26,400	| IOT061a |	Dalian
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:27,680	| IOT061a |	And
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,960	| IOT061a |	What do you think about
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:33,568	| IOT061a |	We probably have a
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:34,080	| IOT061a |	Read
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,384	| IOT061a |	10 billion
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:42,016	| IOT061a |	That is super exciting I can't wait
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:42,784	| IOT061a |	And you guys
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:45,600	| IOT061a |	Can I taking it to the next level in
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:48,928	| IOT061a |	Cuz you got this project
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:51,744	| IOT061a |	Actually you got two things that all up tees for people
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:55,072	| IOT061a |	Listen to the whole thing because we're going to talk about

EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:00,448	| IOT061a |	Which is the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:01,472	| IOT061a |	And how
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:03,264	| IOT061a |	You guys are thinking about that
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,032	| IOT061a |	So
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:04,800	| IOT061a |	Let's take
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,848	| IOT061a |	Location in the home
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:08,896	| IOT061a |	You guys call it project Atlas
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:10,688	| IOT061a |	This is huge I
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:13,504	| IOT061a |	I'm constantly walking into rooms
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:16,832	| IOT061a |	Why doesn't my house know where I am if I'm not carrying my
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:20,160	| IOT061a |	So what are you guys kind of doing with project

EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,248	| IOT061a |	So it's
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:50,272	| IOT061a |	Anteroom
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:51,296	| IOT061a |	Items
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:53,088	| IOT061a |	And then it sends up their server
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:56,160	| IOT061a |	With the item and
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:59,232	| IOT061a |	The room until then on your app

EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:14,336	| IOT061a |	Idea
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:16,384	| IOT061a |	There's water app tracking
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:23,808	| IOT061a |	Already
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:27,648	| IOT061a |	I think that
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:28,928	| IOT061a |	We've really been able to
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:32,768	| IOT061a |	Consumers

EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:42,496	| IOT061a |	Champion
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:44,288	| IOT061a |	To say how excited I am about this
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:45,312	| IOT061a |	Because
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:46,592	| IOT061a |	I don't have an attic
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:50,176	| IOT061a |	The way we've designed our house so I have a lot of storage closets
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:52,224	| IOT061a |	And I have the garage

EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:23,200	| IOT061a |	Because
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:26,016	| IOT061a |	You
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:30,112	| IOT061a |	Computers
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:31,648	| IOT061a |	And I believe that
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:32,672	| IOT061a |	All your items
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:33,184	| IOT061a |	Will be tracked
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:36,256	| IOT061a |	Brown Deer Christmas decorations
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:38,304	| IOT061a |	Tear your jacket
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,584	| IOT061a |	Backpacks

EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:41,632	| IOT061a |	Everything will be
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,144	| IOT061a |	Chalkable
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:46,496	| IOT061a |	And so I think it's a really important Evolution for
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:48,288	| IOT061a |	Smart tracking
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:48,800	| IOT061a |	Space
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:51,104	| IOT061a |	To just go from
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:53,152	| IOT061a |	Hey let's find something after
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:58,784	| IOT061a |	2 + and you
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:01,344	| IOT061a |	You want to just keep track of your stuff for your family
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:06,720	| IOT061a |	A lot of families have one person in the family whose like knows where it is
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:11,840	| IOT061a |	My family is my wife she knows where everything is located
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:16,960	| IOT061a |	And so I was thinking.
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:17,728	| IOT061a |	Attractive
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:18,496	| IOT061a |	Everything
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,008	| IOT061a |	In the house
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:20,288	| IOT061a |	Ketchup
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:24,896	| IOT061a |	I am also that person and constantly like
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:25,408	| IOT061a |	I don't know
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:26,432	| IOT061a |	I really don't know
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:31,040	| IOT061a |	Backpack
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:32,064	| IOT061a |	And you really don't want
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:35,648	| IOT061a |	Let's think about that
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:39,232	| IOT061a |	The Trackers right now the trackr Bravo cost $30
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:41,536	| IOT061a |	How much is the Atlas plug
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:42,816	| IOT061a |	Concept
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:46,400	| IOT061a |	So we have for $99
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:51,264	| IOT061a |	Two-bedroom
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:52,032	| IOT061a |	Bedroom home
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:55,104	| IOT061a |	There's a big question here
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:57,152	| IOT061a |	There's other companies
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:58,176	| IOT061a |	What's the do this
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:01,504	| IOT061a |	Zulily is wine I've tried out there they
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,528	| IOT061a |	Garden outlet
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:03,552	| IOT061a |	It tracks
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:07,904	| IOT061a |	Miso its presence detection based on my phone is supposed to track
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:08,416	| IOT061a |	Nothing
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:15,328	| IOT061a |	When I think about building a service that are truly compelling service that fits with the iot
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:17,120	| IOT061a |	If I say
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:18,400	| IOT061a |	Hey this is tracker
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,936	| IOT061a |	They're building an indoor
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:21,216	| IOT061a |	You know inventory system
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:26,336	| IOT061a |	And is there a what have you thought about
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:31,200	| IOT061a |	Ways to open the supper create this platform and how would you kind of do it given
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:37,088	| IOT061a |	Hey there's a lot of competition just in the tracking Market but there's also kind of indoor location map
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:39,136	| IOT061a |	Petition
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:46,048	| IOT061a |	Probably want to open ASAP is that were costly looking for like
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:47,584	| IOT061a |	Each Creek Softball bags
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:50,656	| IOT061a |	Another company check
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:52,704	| IOT061a |	Theron traffic purses
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:54,240	| IOT061a |	And then I think
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:56,032	| IOT061a |	New Atlas device
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:57,312	| IOT061a |	Ennui

EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:00,384	| IOT061a |	Programs that we can have
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:01,664	| IOT061a |	It works
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,688	| IOT061a |	Future platform
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:05,760	| IOT061a |	Drum bearing stood in what SmartThings
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:08,832	| IOT061a |	I'm interested in to see the future
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:10,112	| IOT061a |	I don't think
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:12,160	| IOT061a |	Really really early days
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:15,744	| IOT061a |	A lot of these other

EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:43,968	| IOT061a |	Your phone book
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:47,296	| IOT061a |	Some people would describe this is like the end of
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:48,064	| IOT061a |	Community
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:51,392	| IOT061a |	People song Let it Roll
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:53,184	| IOT061a |	I did want to ask you
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:54,208	| IOT061a |	Because
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:59,840	| IOT061a |	Tile which is one of your big competitors recently gave figures
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:01,888	| IOT061a |	About 40 million
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:07,008	| IOT061a |	For this day is selling $40 worth of tiles in the next year
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:09,312	| IOT061a |	Which is a lot of $25
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:10,336	| IOT061a |	Trackers
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:14,176	| IOT061a |	Okay see your Damien trackers really difficult for me
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:20,064	| IOT061a |	I'd love to
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:22,624	| IOT061a |	Where where do you stack up against
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:24,672	| IOT061a |	What does that say about the market for this thing
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:27,488	| IOT061a |	I think that is really starting
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:35,680	| IOT061a |	Any
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:37,984	| IOT061a |	Is
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:41,312	| IOT061a |	I mean
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:43,872	| IOT061a |	Contracted number
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:44,896	| IOT061a |	I mean I think
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:50,272	| IOT061a |	Over 1.5 million devices
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:51,552	| IOT061a |	Dan's
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:52,576	| IOT061a |	Yeah that's a lot
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:54,880	| IOT061a |	To the market
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:56,416	| IOT061a |	However
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:57,952	| IOT061a |	There's three
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:00,768	| IOT061a |	Do they have a whole lot of
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:01,536	| IOT061a |	Stop the track
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:06,656	| IOT061a |	Right so we're just scratching the surface
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:08,192	| IOT061a |	Next right now
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:11,776	| IOT061a |	Thanks what we're trying to do is
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:27,904	| IOT061a |	I think that you just see more of
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:28,416	| IOT061a |	Braiding
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:33,792	| IOT061a |	Yahoo
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:37,632	| IOT061a |	We have other software applications
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:43,008	| IOT061a |	Are tracking technology and siblings
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:43,776	| IOT061a |	I think that
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:47,360	| IOT061a |	To finish off
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:48,896	| IOT061a |	What are some of the
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:51,968	| IOT061a |	Most interesting or surprising use cases that you have
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:54,784	| IOT061a |	There I mean there's definitely
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:56,576	| IOT061a |	People that are trapped
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:41:00,672	| IOT061a |	Weird things like that we have like peoples are tracking the bunch of
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:04,512	| IOT061a |	I didn't know this was a thing but
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:06,048	| IOT061a |	They actually hibernate
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:11,424	| IOT061a |	Table like going dinner corn and hibernate and not move
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:16,032	| IOT061a |	And that was kind of surprising for us
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:16,800	| IOT061a |	Another
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:26,016	| IOT061a |	Measurements over time
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:27,040	| IOT061a |	Dan
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:28,064	| IOT061a |	Would you
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:34,464	| IOT061a |	Take a note
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:35,744	| IOT061a |	I get moved
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:36,768	| IOT061a |	And then the Stars
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:43,936	| IOT061a |	Tracking devices underneath the ground to go next
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:47,264	| IOT061a |	And then where
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:48,800	| IOT061a |	Really excited about
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:50,336	| IOT061a |	Something stop
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:53,663	| IOT061a |	Like don't know there
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:42:00,063	| IOT061a |	And I get another entire city
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:00,831	| IOT061a |	Everything
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:06,207	| IOT061a |	I think we're seeing some cool use cases
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:08,767	| IOT061a |	Excited
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:09,279	| IOT061a |	Cases
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:17,727	| IOT061a |	Desert Sands
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:19,775	| IOT061a |	Coffee mug
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:21,311	| IOT061a |	Every single day in office
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:23,359	| IOT061a |	And I think
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:25,919	| IOT061a |	Smaller items
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:30,527	| IOT061a |	I'm really
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:34,111	| IOT061a |	What kind of change
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:35,903	| IOT061a |	Interact with other items
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:38,463	| IOT061a |	And try to remember
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:41,279	| IOT061a |	I'm thinking about it you stick one on each kid in the school
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:43,071	| IOT061a |	And then you know where they are
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:44,607	| IOT061a |	Related to the school
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:45,119	| IOT061a |	Which is
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:47,935	| IOT061a |	Actually done in a lot of places with like
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:48,703	| IOT061a |	Badging in
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:50,495	| IOT061a |	Schools have kids badge
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:52,031	| IOT061a |	It's also kind of a little
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:54,847	| IOT061a |	I don't know
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:03,551	| IOT061a |	Scary
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:04,319	| IOT061a |	Significant
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:09,183	| IOT061a |	Right now because we don't want
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:10,463	| IOT061a |	So unique
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:10,975	| IOT061a |	Jellycat
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:17,887	| IOT061a |	Yes we want
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:18,655	| IOT061a |	Sure that works
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:23,775	| IOT061a |	Grateful.
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:25,311	| IOT061a |	2 weeks
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:28,127	| IOT061a |	I think
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:31,199	| IOT061a |	Live tracking
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:33,759	| IOT061a |	People talking
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:34,271	| IOT061a |	Entirely
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:42,975	| IOT061a |	Thank you so much for coming on the show today
