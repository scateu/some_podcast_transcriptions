EDL	00:00:15,360	00:00:16,896	| IOT080 |	This week
EDL	00:00:16,896	00:00:18,432	| IOT080 |	Awesome stuff for you
EDL	00:00:18,432	00:00:24,832	| IOT080 |	We've got Amazon's new streaming music program we've got something about what the heck
EDL	00:00:24,832	00:00:31,232	| IOT080 |	It's happening with cameras coming out
EDL	00:00:31,232	00:00:33,792	| IOT080 |	I was just building an Internet of Things net worth
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:39,936	| IOT080 |	And this week's guest is Eric has cilia of AGCO the company is transforming
EDL	00:00:40,960	00:00:41,984	| IOT080 |	Intuit services
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:44,032	| IOT080 |	All because of the internet
EDL	00:00:44,800	00:00:45,568	| IOT080 |	All right
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:46,336	| IOT080 |	Kevin
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:49,664	| IOT080 |	Let's get started with Amazon streaming music service
EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:50,176	| IOT080 |	Wechat
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:52,480	| IOT080 |	Roughly $8 a month for
EDL	00:00:52,480	00:00:54,784	| IOT080 |	Anybody if you're an Amazon Prime member
EDL	00:00:55,296	00:00:57,344	| IOT080 |	And $4 a month if you happen to have him
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:00:59,392	| IOT080 |	What do you think
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:04,512	| IOT080 |	Well it's it's interesting and we knew it was coming well we'd heard it was, I guess I should say
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:06,816	| IOT080 |	The interesting aspect is the 399 a month
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:09,888	| IOT080 |	Just have Amazon music catalog
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:15,264	| IOT080 |	Available on your Amazon Echo devices I still don't know if a lot of people are going to
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:16,800	| IOT080 |	Take Amazon up on that
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:19,104	| IOT080 |	Prime Membership
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:23,712	| IOT080 |	Store subscription fee for this is as you said 799 a month
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:26,784	| IOT080 |	Interesting way you can pay $79 for the year
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:31,136	| IOT080 |	And have the unlimited music if you're a Prime member on all of your devices
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:32,928	| IOT080 |	And then for all you non-prime folks
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:34,720	| IOT080 |	10 bucks a month just like everybody else
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:37,536	| IOT080 |	I think you'll get a lot of prime people here
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:40,352	| IOT080 |	I think $8 a month is going to be a peeling
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:45,728	| IOT080 |	There is a family plan coming soon that I was interested in cuz that's what I have with apple music
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:48,544	| IOT080 |	It's going to be 1499 a month
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:49,824	| IOT080 |	No matter what I say
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:51,104	| IOT080 |	Even if your Prime so
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:52,640	| IOT080 |	I'm a little less interested now so
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:59,296	| IOT080 |	I'm not going to do the echo only thing that just doesn't make sense to me because I use so many mobile devices but that's again
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,088	| IOT080 |	So what do you think
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:04,672	| IOT080 |	Well do in comparison I'm paying
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:07,744	| IOT080 |	1499 a month for the Spotify family plan
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:10,304	| IOT080 |	And is it 999
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:12,096	| IOT080 |	I meant or 599 a month
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:12,864	| IOT080 |	Score
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:19,008	| IOT080 |	Normal people Spotify
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,056	| IOT080 |	So I thought it was the same for Spotify
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:21,824	| IOT080 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:22,592	| IOT080 |	Yes it is
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:25,408	| IOT080 |	That my brain was getting confused cuz I
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:27,456	| IOT080 |	When I upgraded I was like
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:28,224	| IOT080 |	$5
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:28,992	| IOT080 |	$5 a month
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,136	| IOT080 |	Where on the music
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:35,904	| IOT080 |	Okay
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:36,416	| IOT080 |	So
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:37,696	| IOT080 |	I think
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:44,352	| IOT080 |	I guess I could cut back on in just have one Spotify account and then one Amazon Echo
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:46,144	| IOT080 |	Accountant that would be a Buckler
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:47,424	| IOT080 |	And my daughter could listen
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:49,216	| IOT080 |	Are the echo
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:51,008	| IOT080 |	You know to her music
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:52,544	| IOT080 |	Which is kind of where she lives
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:55,360	| IOT080 |	But now that I have Spotify on my mobile devices
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,128	| IOT080 |	But
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:58,944	| IOT080 |	Right now I have my echo set to have
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:04,320	| IOT080 |	Spotify as the default in If I Stay
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,600	| IOT080 |	Play this on Spotify
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:08,416	| IOT080 |	And that is not worth a dollar extra month
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:14,304	| IOT080 |	So I think I would stick with Spotify for the time being I will try this out because
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,072	| IOT080 |	Cuz what if there
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,608	| IOT080 |	Selectionism
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:23,008	| IOT080 |	And that's what it always comes down to I think my side from price for these types of services what's the catalog you how much music
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:23,776	| IOT080 |	Is there
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:29,152	| IOT080 |	I believe Amazon has three of the four major labels in their catalog so they may not have
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:31,200	| IOT080 |	Why does many songs or albums
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:34,272	| IOT080 |	Artist as the others but it's got to be darn close
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:35,808	| IOT080 |	The Beatles
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:42,208	| IOT080 |	I know it's important for you
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:44,000	| IOT080 |	Streaming everywhere song
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:46,048	| IOT080 |	Everybody's Got The Beatles at this point I think
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:53,984	| IOT080 |	Did you also have if you're interested in this kind of thing did you also have this new side-by-side feature
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,264	| IOT080 |	Which takes
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,544	| IOT080 |	Artist commentary
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:59,360	| IOT080 |	I'm sorry commentary from the tracks in the catalog and
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:04,224	| IOT080 |	View insights as to the music I don't know that's going to be a huge
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,016	| IOT080 |	Draw either
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,040	| IOT080 |	I don't know
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,064	| IOT080 |	It's kind of like
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:09,856	| IOT080 |	Emitra service right
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,904	| IOT080 |	And then let's make it
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,440	| IOT080 |	A little more affordable
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,720	| IOT080 |	And also have
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:17,280	| IOT080 |	Way to get it just on our devices for a few bucks extra
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,327	| IOT080 |	It's a smart play by then but
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,863	| IOT080 |	I don't know I just
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:24,447	| IOT080 |	Maybe it's me I don't know I don't know how much girls are going to get out of there
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:25,983	| IOT080 |	Fair enough
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:28,031	| IOT080 |	Cuddle with you
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,335	| IOT080 |	But
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:33,151	| IOT080 |	People who act like the ideas
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:35,711	| IOT080 |	People who are normal buying these services
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:39,551	| IOT080 |	It's possible that instead of a service like Spotify they're really going after a service like Apple
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,111	| IOT080 |	Their music service
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,391	| IOT080 |	Which
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,439	| IOT080 |	Feels like a little bit more
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,207	| IOT080 |	Porthole
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:49,791	| IOT080 |	And maybe this is a good way to augment that collection for people who are like
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:05:01,823	| IOT080 |	Colossians say you're right there. Maybe it is a different target audience because I'm sure there's overlap yes but
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:03,359	| IOT080 |	You think about
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:08,223	| IOT080 |	How many millions of echo devices are out there and how many cortical normals
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:09,247	| IOT080 |	Handsome
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:11,551	| IOT080 |	Yeah maybe these people aren't current music
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:12,319	| IOT080 |	Scribers at all
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,111	| IOT080 |	Yeah but
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:16,159	| IOT080 |	One taught the other thing I would say
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,951	| IOT080 |	I really
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,719	| IOT080 |	Excited
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,487	| IOT080 |	No I hope
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:21,535	| IOT080 |	Because baby there
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,607	| IOT080 |	But I really hope it is a Time
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,887	| IOT080 |	Keeps offering
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,167	| IOT080 |	The Computing Services
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:28,703	| IOT080 |	Cuz I think that's going to be really
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:30,495	| IOT080 |	Agreed important
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:37,663	| IOT080 |	Especially if you think about what happened with like Amazon not selling Chromecast
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:41,503	| IOT080 |	And given that they're going to be in an all-out war with all these other
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,527	| IOT080 |	Services
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:44,575	| IOT080 |	Like the new Google home comes with
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,879	| IOT080 |	Six months of access to like
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:47,647	| IOT080 |	YouTube
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,159	| IOT080 |	Red
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:52,511	| IOT080 |	If you're doing something like that and you know
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,535	| IOT080 |	Music from
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:54,815	| IOT080 |	Scott service
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:55,839	| IOT080 |	Sorry that it right
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,655	| IOT080 |	This is crazy
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:00,703	| IOT080 |	It's good people of music
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:01,727	| IOT080 |	All right
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,519	| IOT080 |	Movie Ride Along
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:05,055	| IOT080 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,359	| IOT080 |	Ramah in the standard
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,943	| IOT080 |	We never have drama there
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,991	| IOT080 |	No
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,039	| IOT080 |	Only thing standard upstanders is drama
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:20,671	| IOT080 |	Okay so what happened with this the open connectivity Foundation or OCS
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:21,951	| IOT080 |	Has
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,487	| IOT080 |	That is merging
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,279	| IOT080 |	With the Ultimate Alliance
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,327	| IOT080 |	Actually it's not merging with you
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:29,375	| IOT080 |	Emerging the standards
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:31,679	| IOT080 |	Iotivity and alljoyn
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:34,239	| IOT080 |	Alliance actually voted
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:36,543	| IOT080 |	Just Dance
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,335	| IOT080 |	People yelled at me saying it wasn't
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:39,615	| IOT080 |	It was
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,663	| IOT080 |	This is not a merger of equals
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:44,991	| IOT080 |	You guys this is a merger of all joined into iota
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,295	| IOT080 |	Did it actually reason
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,135	| IOT080 |	The first one being
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:53,951	| IOT080 |	What happened to it's already in devices
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,255	| IOT080 |	The answer is
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,303	| IOT080 |	Ic3 will be back
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:58,815	| IOT080 |	What's compatible
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:04,447	| IOT080 |	Townsite is right now Ayo to be isn't much it's a little bit of hoses backwards
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,215	| IOT080 |	Compatible
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:07,263	| IOT080 |	Like their work out the backwards compatibility
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:10,847	| IOT080 |	There isn't a lot of like production value code out there to make
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,151	| IOT080 |	So
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:15,711	| IOT080 |	Forgot
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:17,503	| IOT080 |	We should stay with you standard to
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,807	| IOT080 |	Yeah that's a good question
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:26,975	| IOT080 |	That is too surprising for me. I need a lot more coffee for that
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:28,767	| IOT080 |	Got it
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:31,327	| IOT080 |	Okay so these standards are device
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,631	| IOT080 |	Discovery and interoperability standards
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:35,167	| IOT080 |	So what they're going to do
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,935	| IOT080 |	Is
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:36,703	| IOT080 |	Like
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,727	| IOT080 |	If your light bulb
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,311	| IOT080 |	H&M
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:41,823	| IOT080 |	I can do that
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:46,431	| IOT080 |	For televisions it might be here the messages I can display
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:48,223	| IOT080 |	Here's what you can do to me
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:49,759	| IOT080 |	That's kind of idea
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:53,343	| IOT080 |	Is this protocol let statements in the home talk to you
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,879	| IOT080 |	Each other and figure out
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:55,647	| IOT080 |	How to say
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:06,911	| IOT080 |	Puns aside in and that's probably why we don't hear too much about them like you don't hear about
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:10,239	| IOT080 |	Join product or this is Aniya tivity supported products
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,519	| IOT080 |	It's really big glue
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:14,079	| IOT080 |	That kind of makes these products work together
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,359	| IOT080 |	Which Southern on
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,663	| IOT080 |	Product specific
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,175	| IOT080 |	Feature
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:21,247	| IOT080 |	Seventies are like behind-the-scenes kind of protocols I think
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,039	| IOT080 |	Yes you were behind
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:29,439	| IOT080 |	Well I'm sure each of these people would be like like love to be the Wi-Fi if they're era
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:33,791	| IOT080 |	Call ideas just to make everything
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:37,119	| IOT080 |	Competitors to them is Ashley Google
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:37,887	| IOT080 |	Weave
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,935	| IOT080 |	What we're seeing here is
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,079	| IOT080 |	Or the merger of those standards is
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:49,407	| IOT080 |	We have existing alljoyn products
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:51,967	| IOT080 |	In the market they might be they will be backwards
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,479	| IOT080 |	Compatible
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:53,759	| IOT080 |	With
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,807	| IOT080 |	Coming of age.
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,087	| IOT080 |	Right now
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:59,135	| IOT080 |	It looks like I'll be stuff
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:01,183	| IOT080 |	It's really far off
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:03,743	| IOT080 |	Some people are telling me it's as far out as 2018
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:06,815	| IOT080 |	I have too many guys are like those here today
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:09,631	| IOT080 |	But that's kind of equivalent out where the code bases
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:11,423	| IOT080 |	And right now the code base is not
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:12,959	| IOT080 |	Production
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:13,727	| IOT080 |	It's already
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:16,543	| IOT080 |	Anaya tivity I think is newer
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,591	| IOT080 |	And then they all join
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:22,431	| IOT080 |	Framework because just last year with the announcement
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:28,319	| IOT080 |	They started musically if you want to
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,367	| IOT080 |	Mistreated by Poco
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:33,695	| IOT080 |	And then back in 2013 Qualcomm design
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:39,583	| IOT080 |	It in like a couple other companies are like we are going to
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,351	| IOT080 |	Christian standard
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,375	| IOT080 |	And then
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,935	| IOT080 |	There's licensing issues
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,751	| IOT080 |	2015 Impalas
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:50,335	| IOT080 |	Hey let's creator
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:54,175	| IOT080 |	Because that's what standards do
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:57,759	| IOT080 |	Then
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:01,087	| IOT080 |	They came out and enjoy
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:02,111	| IOT080 |	Push pins
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:04,415	| IOT080 |	And like Microsoft when she joined all terrain
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,719	| IOT080 |	This looks good
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,767	| IOT080 |	So all these companies kind of
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,535	| IOT080 |	1 /
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:13,375	| IOT080 |	And they decided that everything was going to work together a couple months ago
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,935	| IOT080 |	Honestly the death of Saul
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,215	| IOT080 |	Alliance was really
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:21,055	| IOT080 |	Written that when they all decided that everything should work together
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:23,359	| IOT080 |	Cuz you just don't need that kind of
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,383	| IOT080 |	You don't need to stand this
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,175	| IOT080 |	The same Tuesday
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,759	| IOT080 |	That's where we are
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,551	| IOT080 |	Is a sad day
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:34,367	| IOT080 |	Because right now I feel like we had a working standard but
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,743	| IOT080 |	Better marketing
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:40,511	| IOT080 |	Standard
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,023	| IOT080 |	While
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:42,559	| IOT080 |	Google superhero
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:44,351	| IOT080 |	I got weed
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:51,263	| IOT080 |	The funny thing is from new and users consumers I don't know
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,543	| IOT080 |	Even know what
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:58,175	| IOT080 |	Standards are used for the devices to talk to each other
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:00,735	| IOT080 |	That's the you know as all this churn
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,783	| IOT080 |	We're all sitting here going just make it work
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:06,367	| IOT080 |	Yeah cuz I mean how long has it been since we
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:09,439	| IOT080 |	Talking about this Markovich
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:13,791	| IOT080 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,327	| IOT080 |	That's the standard Smith
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,095	| IOT080 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,631	| IOT080 |	Cameras
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:23,263	| IOT080 |	Kevin you want to tell us about the Netgear Arlo Pro
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:28,383	| IOT080 |	Oh yes I do so I didn't know this was coming you may have
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,407	| IOT080 |	But
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:33,503	| IOT080 |	Netgear has the Arlo Pro Wireless home security cameras
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:35,039	| IOT080 |	This is a camera that
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:39,135	| IOT080 |	You don't need to worry about connecting to existing power lines are in like that
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:41,951	| IOT080 |	You just stick it and go
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:44,511	| IOT080 |	Believe it is to
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:47,071	| IOT080 |	4999 does that sound right
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,863	| IOT080 |	$250
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:51,423	| IOT080 |	Base station and one camera
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:56,031	| IOT080 |	190
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:57,055	| IOT080 |	420
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:12:00,127	| IOT080 |	You can go hog-wild and spend a lot of money here
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:01,919	| IOT080 |	So this is
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:04,735	| IOT080 |	Did the station as well
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:11,903	| IOT080 |	It does have a base station in what I'm actually currently trying to look up on me really slow internet is whether or not the new or
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:15,743	| IOT080 |	Orbi mesh routers from Netgear
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:18,047	| IOT080 |	And so if you have the Arlo
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,583	| IOT080 |	The old lady
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,887	| IOT080 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:23,935	| IOT080 |	The answer is
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:30,335	| IOT080 |	Orbi will not replace your Arlo base station
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:30,847	| IOT080 |	Bay station
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,919	| IOT080 |	Yes this is a new base station
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,991	| IOT080 |	All right well that's it that's it
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:41,087	| IOT080 |	Plug in my router
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,487	| IOT080 |	But I will save my Arlo cameras
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:50,815	| IOT080 |	I'm using the the older version that has
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:52,095	| IOT080 |	Irreplaceable
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,375	| IOT080 |	Batteries disc
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,143	| IOT080 |	When is
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:54,911	| IOT080 |	USPS
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,287	| IOT080 |	So you're spending Less on batteries
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,847	| IOT080 |	Complaint for the original
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,151	| IOT080 |	Singer sew fun
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,687	| IOT080 |	Good cameras you like
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,711	| IOT080 |	I mean honestly
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,503	| IOT080 |	Super magnet on the back
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,295	| IOT080 |	It's so great for like attaching it to things
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,855	| IOT080 |	Toss it in the air
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:17,951	| IOT080 |	I have this ability here
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,487	| IOT080 |	It's great
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:20,767	| IOT080 |	Even though there's a
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,303	| IOT080 |	So just
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,839	| IOT080 |	This looks like a more powerful
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:26,143	| IOT080 |	Uso
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:29,215	| IOT080 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:31,519	| IOT080 |	Quick Charge rechargeable battery so less time
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:34,847	| IOT080 |	Last downtime of not monitoring something when you had to recharge the batteries
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:37,919	| IOT080 |	Miniature two-way audio which is nice and the
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:42,527	| IOT080 |	Night vision and ultra-wide 130° field of view and
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:44,831	| IOT080 |	Like you said you can stick this thing anywhere
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:46,111	| IOT080 |	Start on something more
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:47,135	| IOT080 |	It's magnetic and boom
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:54,047	| IOT080 |	Yeah currently actually right now because I have glass doors at my home in my August doorbell or not
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:56,351	| IOT080 |	I replaced them trying to get a better
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:59,679	| IOT080 |	Version of its I have replaced it with newer Hardware in
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,191	| IOT080 |	So far
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,799	| IOT080 |	Are you guys
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,823	| IOT080 |	Yeah you have to
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:06,591	| IOT080 |	Please.
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:09,151	| IOT080 |	I'm using the voice before
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:09,919	| IOT080 |	We're back in town
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,479	| IOT080 |	Recording that before we left town
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,015	| IOT080 |	We were like oh
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:18,879	| IOT080 |	Where can you have a package so we just stuck in Arlo like
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,647	| IOT080 |	Right there
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,439	| IOT080 |	Magnetically
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:24,511	| IOT080 |	I have facing the door in
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:26,559	| IOT080 |	You know we got the motion sensor when
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:28,095	| IOT080 |	Someone came to the door and we're good to go
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:31,935	| IOT080 |	And for those of you guys who are like
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,983	| IOT080 |	Still there batteries in the sting
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:35,263	| IOT080 |	Talk about
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:37,055	| IOT080 |	Wireless charging which is
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:40,383	| IOT080 |	Not what we hoped it would be but is apparently getting better
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,687	| IOT080 |	Do you know why it's not where we had hoped it be
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:46,015	| IOT080 |	Standard you know
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:51,135	| IOT080 |	Don't want to seem but yeah it's standard different standards between
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:54,207	| IOT080 |	Reasons
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:54,975	| IOT080 |	Powermat
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:59,583	| IOT080 |	Consolidation over the past few years which is good
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:05,983	| IOT080 |	This point again people don't care what standard is used so long as they can use whatever it is they want to use
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:08,031	| IOT080 |	Seems like
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:10,591	| IOT080 |	A lot more devices now are adopting
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:13,407	| IOT080 |	The chi standard which has been around for quite a while
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:19,039	| IOT080 |	And or devices that support multiple standards again people don't care
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:23,135	| IOT080 |	They're just like I can use a wireless charging pad with this okay that's good for me
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:26,207	| IOT080 |	So that's really what's been happening over the past couple years so
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:28,255	| IOT080 |	While wireless charging has
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:31,071	| IOT080 |	Grown in terms of adoption and in fact
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,375	| IOT080 |	It was up 40% in
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:39,519	| IOT080 |	2016 according to IHS it could have been more as what I just said and I agree it could have been me
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,847	| IOT080 |	Figured out the standards earlier
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:46,431	| IOT080 |	Yeah it is important for people for like what she
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:50,527	| IOT080 |	Actually spelled with a q i many of you guys made
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:53,599	| IOT080 |	I did not
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:56,671	| IOT080 |	It is a bummer in
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:16:00,511	| IOT080 |	Haven't you tried a couple of these wireless charging things out
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,863	| IOT080 |	I don't charge it
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:05,887	| IOT080 |	Quickly
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:10,239	| IOT080 |	What do you think it's like
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,007	| IOT080 |	So
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:17,407	| IOT080 |	I would say just a year or two ago I would say that would be an accurate statement the difference between
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:19,711	| IOT080 |	Wireless charging times War
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:21,503	| IOT080 |	Very noticeable
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:25,087	| IOT080 |	These days we got fast wireless charging and again
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:28,159	| IOT080 |	Special chips needed for that special
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:34,303	| IOT080 |	Charging pads and so on but perfect example is my Galaxy S7 that I got back in May
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:39,423	| IOT080 |	I was able to find a Samsung fast charge wireless charging pad
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:44,031	| IOT080 |	Which will charge devices wirelessly at they standard
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,055	| IOT080 |	Slower rate
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:50,175	| IOT080 |	But the Galaxy S7 presidential causes Sports fast wireless charging
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,455	| IOT080 |	And it's darn near
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:52,991	| IOT080 |	Close
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,527	| IOT080 |	To a regular wire charge
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:57,087	| IOT080 |	Let me just add a car
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:59,647	| IOT080 |	I didn't want to go to there but know this phone has not
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:02,207	| IOT080 |	If it doesn't show it was nice knowing you off
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:07,071	| IOT080 |	But I I want to add a caveat there because don't forget in the wireless charging
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,095	| IOT080 |	Marketplace
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,119	| IOT080 |	We've also had
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:12,191	| IOT080 |	Quick charging Qualcomm quick charge
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:14,495	| IOT080 |	1 2 and 3. Oh now where you can
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:18,079	| IOT080 |	You don't plug in a fast charge wire
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:22,431	| IOT080 |	Plug and you can get like half of your battery back in as little as
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:24,479	| IOT080 |	15 20 30 minutes
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:27,039	| IOT080 |	Wiregrass wireless charging is not that fast
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:30,623	| IOT080 |	But it's as fast as standard wired charging if that makes sense
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,927	| IOT080 |	Got it
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,719	| IOT080 |	It is
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:37,023	| IOT080 |	But it does need to be touching the pad
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:41,119	| IOT080 |	It's good for like your mobile devices
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:44,447	| IOT080 |	I'm still waiting for a great wireless charging options
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,215	| IOT080 |	Fuller Lake
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:49,567	| IOT080 |	Sensors are things I mean like if you're going to invest in the Smart Home
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,335	| IOT080 |	You're going to invest in
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:52,127	| IOT080 |	1
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,407	| IOT080 |	Is double-sided tape
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:55,455	| IOT080 |	Justice everywhere
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:55,967	| IOT080 |	2
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:57,503	| IOT080 |	Is batteries
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:59,551	| IOT080 |	And you're going to be going through batteries like
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:04,159	| IOT080 |	Toddler is what
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,695	| IOT080 |	So
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:07,231	| IOT080 |	And you're going to also have
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:10,815	| IOT080 |	My recommendation is a screwdriver that can open all of your sensor back
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,863	| IOT080 |	So you're not running up and down
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:20,799	| IOT080 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,823	| IOT080 |	We should we should Market
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:23,871	| IOT080 |	Speak it for the show
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,943	| IOT080 |	Myiot breaking cases
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,455	| IOT080 |	Watch bands
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:31,551	| IOT080 |	Before you give up move on one thing that has not happened in this market
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:35,391	| IOT080 |	It would answer your or address your concerns and questions and that is
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:39,999	| IOT080 |	Having wireless charging pads built into furniture and other objects
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,279	| IOT080 |	Where is
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:43,071	| IOT080 |	Like I have a lot of
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:45,631	| IOT080 |	Devices that sit on a little table we know or whatever
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:48,191	| IOT080 |	They can't recharge their butt
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:50,495	| IOT080 |	If the wireless charging pads are there
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:53,567	| IOT080 |	All the time
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:58,175	| IOT080 |	And that's been a talk of me for several years now and I'm yet I really haven't seen much
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:04,575	| IOT080 |	Much play in that except for I give credit to Starbucks which put in a corset with the Powermat standard but
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:06,879	| IOT080 |	Starbucks wireless charging
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,183	| IOT080 |	Pads built into their
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:10,719	| IOT080 |	Little
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:12,511	| IOT080 |	Tables where you sit and have your coffee
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:16,351	| IOT080 |	I'm so you can have your phone recharge me just put it down there in your drink their coffee
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:19,935	| IOT080 |	That's about the only place I've actually seen that out in the wild
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:21,727	| IOT080 |	Wireless charging built into furniture
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:25,567	| IOT080 |	I believe one of the major hotel chains
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:26,335	| IOT080 |	Is investigating
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:29,407	| IOT080 |	Using wireless charging in table
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:33,247	| IOT080 |	The lack of Standards is released I need them because furniture
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:34,783	| IOT080 |	I mean think about
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:40,927	| IOT080 |	They remember how you used to go into every hotel room and there was a.
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,975	| IOT080 |	For your iPhone that is now lick
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:46,303	| IOT080 |	Or iterations at 8
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,863	| IOT080 |	30 pin connector
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:51,167	| IOT080 |	I mean Furniture should laugh
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,727	| IOT080 |	I mean I think having a little ballet
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:56,287	| IOT080 |	You know that you can get a charging that that you
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,567	| IOT080 |	That probably makes more sense
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:19:59,359	| IOT080 |	In all on
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:08,319	| IOT080 |	Because you'll know that wireless charging furniture sets a big time when it comes in
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:10,367	| IOT080 |	Ikea offers pizza and we're not there
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:11,391	| IOT080 |	There you go
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:12,927	| IOT080 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:19,071	| IOT080 |	Ml12 big news which is Comcast is doing its own low-power wide area network
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:21,375	| IOT080 |	Basically Comcast Building
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:22,911	| IOT080 |	An Internet of Things Network
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:27,007	| IOT080 |	Sometime last week I took a nap
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:29,311	| IOT080 |	Which is the maker of
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:30,847	| IOT080 |	Laura
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:34,431	| IOT080 |	Pandora is a radio standard for these low-power wide area Networks
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:37,759	| IOT080 |	And it Comcast said it would
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:40,063	| IOT080 |	Goldish Network out across 30 markets
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:41,599	| IOT080 |	Nextlink
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:46,207	| IOT080 |	80 months which is crazy because
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,743	| IOT080 |	Comcast has such a
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:48,511	| IOT080 |	Bigfoot prints
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:54,911	| IOT080 |	It's it's almost like how could they not do this right this isn't going to take a ton of bandwidth mean
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:58,495	| IOT080 |	Because Lora data rates are
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:01,311	| IOT080 |	50 kbps or glass of Minnesota
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:02,079	| IOT080 |	4
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:03,615	| IOT080 |	Iot MTM
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:06,943	| IOT080 |	Kind of communication so when you can
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:09,759	| IOT080 |	Leverage your big footprint with us why wouldn't you
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:12,063	| IOT080 |	Exactly
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:14,111	| IOT080 |	And either relatively cheap chips
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:16,416	| IOT080 |	They can work over a large
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:19,744	| IOT080 |	They are really interesting for like sensors
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:24,352	| IOT080 |	So you can see Comcast taking its Xfinity home which this is not part of the exit
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:28,704	| IOT080 |	He experienced it has medicine goes Network
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:30,240	| IOT080 |	You can see it
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:35,104	| IOT080 |	Why that took small business and Enterprise customers they're actually really hurting for these kind of
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:37,152	| IOT080 |	DIY or cheaper solution
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:38,944	| IOT080 |	4
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:39,968	| IOT080 |	Security in that sort of thing
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:42,272	| IOT080 |	To make sad
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:47,392	| IOT080 |	Inessence wireless network
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:52,768	| IOT080 |	Feel like we can talk about Comcast wireless network or like the last decade
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:58,912	| IOT080 |	There's a couple questions
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:00,960	| IOT080 |	Competes with standards like sigfox
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:01,728	| IOT080 |	Which is building
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:04,032	| IOT080 |	It says it's building a hundred
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:06,336	| IOT080 |	Cities in the US
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:09,152	| IOT080 |	Which is a lot in so far
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:10,432	| IOT080 |	It hasn't quite done that
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:18,368	| IOT080 |	Stop near me
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:19,392	| IOT080 |	Standard form
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,160	| IOT080 |	Will power wins
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,184	| IOT080 |	And
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:24,256	| IOT080 |	Nobody knows where that is proprietary
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:27,584	| IOT080 |	To pray time with you then
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:29,632	| IOT080 |	Comcast is really
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:31,424	| IOT080 |	You know pushing the envelope here
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:33,216	| IOT080 |	Especially in the US
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:34,496	| IOT080 |	Because in
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:35,776	| IOT080 |	Europe
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:39,104	| IOT080 |	In Singapore a lot of the major carriers
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:43,712	| IOT080 |	But here in the US with AT&T and Verizon
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:44,992	| IOT080 |	Laura Webb
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:46,784	| IOT080 |	They're looking at doing
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:51,392	| IOT080 |	Low-power wide area network based on the GSM standard so there
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:55,488	| IOT080 |	Cat 1M I can never even remember this
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:58,304	| IOT080 |	Basically cellular-based
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:00,096	| IOT080 |	Openstack
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:07,008	| IOT080 |	So I don't know exciting news we'll see Comcast does it feel like it's all it's going to it's
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,800	| IOT080 |	Could have asked
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:10,848	| IOT080 |	Hazit Market rollout nodejs
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:12,128	| IOT080 |	Contingent Upon a Child
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:12,640	| IOT080 |	Successful
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:16,992	| IOT080 |	But it's kind of nice to see come here
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,040	| IOT080 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:19,552	| IOT080 |	I agree
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,624	| IOT080 |	All right so I think that
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:28,768	| IOT080 |	Good for the show if you want to date you were going to have a little advertisement and then we're going to have
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,304	| IOT080 |	Church hymns
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:34,144	| IOT080 |	Who is with an agriculture company called AGCO
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:39,008	| IOT080 |	And he's going to talk a little bit about the interview is actually about how to trance
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:40,032	| IOT080 |	On your business
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:40,800	| IOT080 |	Selling products
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:42,336	| IOT080 |	Selling services
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,616	| IOT080 |	So it's worth a listen
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:51,552	| IOT080 |	Taking a break for the podcast for a few moments for a word from our sponsor this week sponsors arm and I have
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:54,624	| IOT080 |	Tom Williamson the GM of the wireless business at arm
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:56,160	| IOT080 |	I'm here to talk to us today
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:56,928	| IOT080 |	Soap
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:57,696	| IOT080 |	Paul
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:24:04,096	| IOT080 |	You're telling me that 18 months ago I'm launched a wireless IP radio division can you tell me a
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:05,120	| IOT080 |	A little bit more about this
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:06,400	| IOT080 |	Show that's right
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,216	| IOT080 |	18 months ago
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:13,824	| IOT080 |	Launched a new product offering cocodia which is
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:16,128	| IOT080 |	Radio IP rather than Price is Right
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:18,944	| IOT080 |	Which one now offering to arcilla campanas
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:22,272	| IOT080 |	And that allows them to add the connectivity that I need
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:26,624	| IOT080 |	Be able to address the rapid growth that was sitting in iot devices
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,416	| IOT080 |	What is your first radio.
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:33,280	| IOT080 |	The first product we launched with Bluetooth low energy
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:35,584	| IOT080 |	Beyond the initial version was the
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:41,728	| IOT080 |	4.2 standard but upcoming soon as the new version of Bluetooth Bluetooth 5 which introduces
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:44,288	| IOT080 |	New features that are really going to be important
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:45,312	| IOT080 |	For The Internet of Things
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:48,384	| IOT080 |	Key features that we going to see
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:50,432	| IOT080 |	Increase title right so
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:54,016	| IOT080 |	That's going to make the transfers between devices like
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:55,808	| IOT080 |	Your Fitbit 21
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:58,624	| IOT080 |	PetSmart Timothy wanted to getting that data to and from the phone
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:24:59,648	| IOT080 |	Fosta
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,952	| IOT080 |	And still win sorry live energy
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:03,488	| IOT080 |	I don't say things that I
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:09,888	| IOT080 |	Perhaps more mundane but really important for us to get secure connected endpoints into iot like firmware
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,680	| IOT080 |	Will happen very quickly
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:12,448	| IOT080 |	Clean swell
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:13,216	| IOT080 |	The other Kingdom
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:14,752	| IOT080 |	Featureless coming is where
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:16,544	| IOT080 |	Adding a longer range feature
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:19,872	| IOT080 |	The technology which means that devices will be able to cover
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:23,968	| IOT080 |	At the entire home rather than just those personal devices around you
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:27,552	| IOT080 |	I thought something that will be a supporting in the near future
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:28,832	| IOT080 |	Why would I want to
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:29,600	| IOT080 |	ARM version
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:30,880	| IOT080 |	Of a radio
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,392	| IOT080 |	As opposed to someone
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:34,976	| IOT080 |	VIP that we develop for radio is
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:38,560	| IOT080 |	Reddit really pushing the boundaries of low power consumption say
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:40,864	| IOT080 |	All radios operate at below 1 volt
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:47,520	| IOT080 |	Allows them to run off a pretty broad range of pass Plies and drive down the energy consumption flat devices
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:53,664	| IOT080 |	Korean consumer that means longer battery life by up 40% in products that use our radio technology
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:59,040	| IOT080 |	In addition to the low-power the other feature that were able to bring it along with the prices
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:04,672	| IOT080 |	Completely secure endpoint solution so you can securely about data from these
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,952	| IOT080 |	Embedded devices into
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:11,328	| IOT080 |	McLeod this guy to be more news about not coming up at the arm techcon conference at the end of this month
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,864	| IOT080 |	Awesome and as a consumer
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:15,424	| IOT080 |	I am excited about Bluetooth 5
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,192	| IOT080 |	What should I expect
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:21,824	| IOT080 |	24-hour toys mystery when these new features come out as to how people are going to use them I think
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:27,968	| IOT080 |	What you probably start C is a little more around the small time 6 please
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:31,808	| IOT080 |	Smart financing tablet apps
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:36,416	| IOT080 |	Devices that the need for these Bridges and gateways and I think I could bring
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:38,208	| IOT080 |	Even more Lifehouse NC
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:44,608	| IOT080 |	Into the home environment tell me how can I find out more about the products
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,888	| IOT080 |	Radio IP products
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:52,288	| IOT080 |	You just got to Omnicom Foods Kodiak
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:58,432	| IOT080 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacy Higginbotham
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:01,760	| IOT080 |	Am I guess today is Eric Henson
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:04,320	| IOT080 |	Who is SVP of global cross cycle
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:07,904	| IOT080 |	And Advanced Technology Solutions for a company called egg
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,696	| IOT080 |	Hi Eric
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:12,000	| IOT080 |	Great thanks for having me on the show
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:15,328	| IOT080 |	Man I am so excited to have you here because I can
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:15,840	| IOT080 |	About Farm
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,632	| IOT080 |	It is actually
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:18,912	| IOT080 |	I don't I don't know what is
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:21,728	| IOT080 |	So let's get started Adco
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:25,056	| IOT080 |	You should probably tell us what it does because it is not a household
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:30,688	| IOT080 |	Yeah Edco is the largest pure-play farm equipment company in the world
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:36,320	| IOT080 |	So let's get people excited about bringing we've had guests on the show talk about Precision Acura
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:39,136	| IOT080 |	Culture talk to me about the future of
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:39,904	| IOT080 |	Farming
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:40,672	| IOT080 |	And
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:42,208	| IOT080 |	Why you guys are
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:42,976	| IOT080 |	Are doing this
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:46,048	| IOT080 |	Yeah it's actually an exciting time
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:48,352	| IOT080 |	When you look forward at the future of farming
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:52,960	| IOT080 |	The world only needs the farmers all around the world to double their productivity
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:54,752	| IOT080 |	There's no more land
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:57,056	| IOT080 |	And yet there's going to be more miles
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:57,568	| IOT080 |	The feed
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,616	| IOT080 |	You combine that with the fact that
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,408	| IOT080 |	Diets are maturing around the world
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:02,688	| IOT080 |	More and more people are
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,968	| IOT080 |	Adding more meat
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:06,272	| IOT080 |	To their diet at the multiplier and amount of
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:07,040	| IOT080 |	Food that needs to be done
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:10,624	| IOT080 |	Is just more bile energy
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:11,648	| IOT080 |	Demand sources
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:16,512	| IOT080 |	So that could be biofuel internship ethanol or soy diesel
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:19,840	| IOT080 |	And somehow the world's Farmers need to grow twice as much food
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:20,608	| IOT080 |	Nginx
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:22,656	| IOT080 |	20 years or so as they do today
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,424	| IOT080 |	With no more land
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:27,520	| IOT080 |	And and also managing the resources like water and fertilizer
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:28,544	| IOT080 |	Pesticide
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:29,568	| IOT080 |	Things like that
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:33,408	| IOT080 |	The farmers have to farm differently in the future than they are today
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:35,456	| IOT080 |	Farmers needing to be more
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:38,016	| IOT080 |	Proficient both because we've got more people
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:41,600	| IOT080 |	Because we want to use our resources more effectively and also because farmers
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:45,440	| IOT080 |	At certain points in time are kind of living on the edge in terms of profit
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:48,512	| IOT080 |	How much more efficient
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:49,536	| IOT080 |	Can we actually make
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:54,400	| IOT080 |	Yeah there's a few ways to look at that if we simplify it down
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,680	| IOT080 |	Kernel is
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:58,752	| IOT080 |	Seed has the inherent lipstick corn as an example
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,800	| IOT080 |	Eternal love
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:01,824	| IOT080 |	Corn if you
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:03,360	| IOT080 |	You take a look at them
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:05,408	| IOT080 |	Traits that are inherited it today
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:07,200	| IOT080 |	Any places that ideal condition
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:08,224	| IOT080 |	It can grow to
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:10,016	| IOT080 |	600 bushel yield
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:10,784	| IOT080 |	Africa
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:14,368	| IOT080 |	Whereas the average yield across the United
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:16,672	| IOT080 |	States is only about a hundred and seventy-five bush
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:17,440	| IOT080 |	Icebreaker
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:22,560	| IOT080 |	So not every single seeing every single Farm is going to be grown in the app to Absolute optimal condition
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:26,144	| IOT080 |	But there's still a tremendous amount of upside potential
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:29,728	| IOT080 |	On the farms to be able to farm more effectively
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:30,752	| IOT080 |	To raise the real
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:33,824	| IOT080 |	Certainly 20 25 30
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:34,848	| IOT080 |	Percent is
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,872	| IOT080 |	Within reason
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,384	| IOT080 |	In the short-term
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:43,040	| IOT080 |	And you guys started out with adding connectivity over the last decade to tractors and
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:44,832	| IOT080 |	Other farming equipment
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:47,904	| IOT080 |	And also I believe some sensors
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:53,280	| IOT080 |	So what makes today different like what brings connectivity to the next level
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:53,792	| IOT080 |	Precision
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:59,424	| IOT080 |	Guess you using a great turn Precision agriculture if you think about
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,704	| IOT080 |	What we talked about
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:01,984	| IOT080 |	There's no more land
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:04,032	| IOT080 |	And yet we need to somehow grow twice
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:04,800	| IOT080 |	As much as we do today
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,592	| IOT080 |	So we have to farm different
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:10,176	| IOT080 |	And in the phrasing around that is called Precision agriculture
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:12,224	| IOT080 |	It's intended to mean that
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:15,552	| IOT080 |	We need to be more precise with the way we use input
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:16,832	| IOT080 |	Seeds
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:19,392	| IOT080 |	Water fertilizer pesticide herbicide
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:20,928	| IOT080 |	And machinery
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,464	| IOT080 |	To be able to get
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:25,024	| IOT080 |	It's a different outcome a higher yield
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:25,792	| IOT080 |	And
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:26,816	| IOT080 |	The more efficient cost structure
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,864	| IOT080 |	A key element of that
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:30,400	| IOT080 |	More recently is
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:31,424	| IOT080 |	Connectivity
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,984	| IOT080 |	The Advent of
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:37,312	| IOT080 |	Telematics which allows us to be able to
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:39,616	| IOT080 |	Send the information from the machine
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:40,896	| IOT080 |	Boston machine
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:45,760	| IOT080 |	And remotely monitor how a machine like a tractor or combine or
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:47,808	| IOT080 |	Sprayer is operating or
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:49,088	| IOT080 |	Performing or how it
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:49,856	| IOT080 |	Set
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:50,624	| IOT080 |	Or Howard drivers
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:56,512	| IOT080 |	By remotely monitoring that machine we can then help the farmer with insights to say
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:59,072	| IOT080 |	Hey change how you're using that machine
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:30:59,840	| IOT080 |	Change how your settings
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:02,912	| IOT080 |	Change how you using one machine with another
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:05,728	| IOT080 |	Maybe a sprayers waiting for the water truck to show up to it
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:06,240	| IOT080 |	To refill it
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,776	| IOT080 |	Those are all
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:08,800	| IOT080 |	Solutions that we
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:09,312	| IOT080 |	We can provide
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:12,640	| IOT080 |	Now that this remote monitoring is available
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:15,200	| IOT080 |	And then you're adding
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:15,712	| IOT080 |	Sensors
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:19,296	| IOT080 |	So once you have the capability to know where you are
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:20,576	| IOT080 |	And the ability to
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:23,136	| IOT080 |	Transmit that information off board
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:28,512	| IOT080 |	Then two things happen one is you want to be able to learn more and more about what's going on
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:30,048	| IOT080 |	In the machine and around the machine
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:31,840	| IOT080 |	So that's where sensors come in
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:36,192	| IOT080 |	And second thing that you want to do is to be able to
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:37,216	| IOT080 |	Convert
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:39,008	| IOT080 |	All of that raw data
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:40,288	| IOT080 |	Into an insight
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:43,104	| IOT080 |	Okay so we're moving from notification
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:43,616	| IOT080 |	Action
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:49,504	| IOT080 |	That's right and it's just the kind of level set for those that aren't
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:51,552	| IOT080 |	Treme with the Baseline of where we are today
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:53,600	| IOT080 |	A lot of talk about driverless cars
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,136	| IOT080 |	In fact
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:58,208	| IOT080 |	Most of large equipment has the capability to be
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:00,512	| IOT080 |	Operated without steering it
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:02,816	| IOT080 |	So auto-steer within the field
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:05,632	| IOT080 |	So the farmer will typically come into the field
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,656	| IOT080 |	And let's say they're planting
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:09,216	| IOT080 |	They come into the field
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:11,008	| IOT080 |	They would set up there
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:15,104	| IOT080 |	GPS line their guidance line of the line that they want to start on
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:19,200	| IOT080 |	And then they took the steering wheel up out of the way in the machine operator
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:20,224	| IOT080 |	Allen Stone
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:22,016	| IOT080 |	Driving to the field on that line
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:25,344	| IOT080 |	You turn the machine around and then it will plant
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:28,416	| IOT080 |	And exactly parallel line to the first one
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:30,208	| IOT080 |	Offset by the width of the planter
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:35,328	| IOT080 |	Not only the steering itself on a on a perfectly straight line or or curved line depending on what you
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:39,168	| IOT080 |	But it's also having the ability to change the last
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:41,216	| IOT080 |	Change the speed at which it's running
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:43,520	| IOT080 |	And change what's happening on the planter
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:44,800	| IOT080 |	Change the rate at which it
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:47,616	| IOT080 |	The Planters planting season
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:49,920	| IOT080 |	Planting more in the high fertility areas
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:50,944	| IOT080 |	Lesson love
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:54,016	| IOT080 |	Those are just some examples of
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:57,600	| IOT080 |	Functions that are already highly automated on the machine
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:59,136	| IOT080 |	After your Stills in the cab
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:00,672	| IOT080 |	These things are happening
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:01,440	| IOT080 |	In an automated way
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:05,536	| IOT080 |	Soac is a seven and a half billion dollar
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:08,096	| IOT080 |	And you guys have been working on
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:11,168	| IOT080 |	Bringing the internet of things to your business for
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:12,704	| IOT080 |	Sounds like over a decade
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:15,008	| IOT080 |	Why did you guys get started
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:16,032	| IOT080 |	Addington
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:19,616	| IOT080 |	We felt this is one of the
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:21,664	| IOT080 |	The best ways to help farmers
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:23,968	| IOT080 |	Become more productive when you look at the
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:26,784	| IOT080 |	Technology that has recently become available on GPS
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:28,576	| IOT080 |	And then on telematics device
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:30,368	| IOT080 |	And then managing data
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,648	| IOT080 |	We thought
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:35,232	| IOT080 |	It would be a great opportunity to harness those capabilities
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:37,280	| IOT080 |	To be able about the world
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:38,304	| IOT080 |	Far more effectively
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:41,376	| IOT080 |	As part of the seven and a half billion dollars in Revenue
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:44,448	| IOT080 |	What percentage of it is
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:46,752	| IOT080 |	Based on connected services
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:48,544	| IOT080 |	Vs may be connected
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:52,384	| IOT080 |	Revenue generated from Services Estill
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:54,432	| IOT080 |	It's in the early stages
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:55,456	| IOT080 |	We're just transitioning
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:56,224	| IOT080 |	From
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:57,760	| IOT080 |	Selling the technology
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:34:00,064	| IOT080 |	To accompany this now poker
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:01,600	| IOT080 |	Gaston delivering services
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:03,136	| IOT080 |	Around that technology
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:05,184	| IOT080 |	Advising Farmers on how to change
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:05,952	| IOT080 |	Practices
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:08,768	| IOT080 |	But the
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,560	| IOT080 |	Scope it covers is
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,096	| IOT080 |	Most of what act
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:12,864	| IOT080 |	Cassell's
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:14,144	| IOT080 |	So do you sell
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:15,424	| IOT080 |	The connectivity itself
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:17,472	| IOT080 |	Or do you sell the inside
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,264	| IOT080 |	How do you guys sell
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:21,056	| IOT080 |	Precision AG
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:22,848	| IOT080 |	Yeah we're transitioning
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:24,640	| IOT080 |	To a company that sells
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:26,688	| IOT080 |	Subscription Service package
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:28,736	| IOT080 |	So what's the machine
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:30,528	| IOT080 |	And many
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:32,320	| IOT080 |	A customer can just buy the machine if they like to
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:36,672	| IOT080 |	But we're moving to a company then that will sell the machine Plus
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:38,464	| IOT080 |	Service packages around those machine
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:40,512	| IOT080 |	That can be based on
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:43,328	| IOT080 |	For example focusing on up time let's say
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:44,608	| IOT080 |	To be
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:45,632	| IOT080 |	Looking at
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:50,240	| IOT080 |	Indicators off the machine to be predicting when components will fail before they will fail
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:52,288	| IOT080 |	Or more precisely
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,056	| IOT080 |	Schedule maintenance
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:55,616	| IOT080 |	Around exactly when the machine needs
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:56,128	| IOT080 |	To maintain
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:57,920	| IOT080 |	Flex one category
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,968	| IOT080 |	Second categories machine optimization
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:02,016	| IOT080 |	Helping helping cell service pack
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:04,576	| IOT080 |	Optimizing how machine is used
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:07,648	| IOT080 |	Any category is helping with Farm up
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:08,416	| IOT080 |	Sensation
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:10,208	| IOT080 |	But we're going to be selling
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:11,488	| IOT080 |	Service packages to
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:14,304	| IOT080 |	Give insights to the farmer on
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:15,328	| IOT080 |	Different elements
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:16,096	| IOT080 |	Father Fermin
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:16,608	| IOT080 |	Today
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:17,888	| IOT080 |	Versus
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:18,400	| IOT080 |	How they could be
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:20,960	| IOT080 |	It could be and how
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:23,008	| IOT080 |	When is free application to
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,800	| IOT080 |	To attack weeds
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,824	| IOT080 |	Recommending
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:26,848	| IOT080 |	The timing of that
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:29,152	| IOT080 |	There's a number of different farming recommendation
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:30,432	| IOT080 |	I can also come out of
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:32,736	| IOT080 |	Inside the farm
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:33,248	| IOT080 |	Are using Wireless
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:37,600	| IOT080 |	Probably a decade ago we had this huge
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:38,368	| IOT080 |	Shift tonight
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:41,952	| IOT080 |	We're instead of companies buying their own servers they bought come
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:44,000	| IOT080 |	And it shifted
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:47,328	| IOT080 |	They're compute cost basically from a capex to an object
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:49,120	| IOT080 |	Situation financing
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:51,168	| IOT080 |	And if I look at
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:52,448	| IOT080 |	What's happening
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:53,472	| IOT080 |	In farming
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:56,288	| IOT080 |	And this kind of idea of providing Solutions inside
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:59,616	| IOT080 |	Do you see that same sort of shift
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:04,480	| IOT080 |	Possibly happening for agriculture or will there still always be massive
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:05,760	| IOT080 |	Expenditures that
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:12,672	| IOT080 |	Yeah I think there's going to be quite a Continuum there's going to be a certain segment of the market that I think over the course of
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:14,976	| IOT080 |	Time will evolve to the point where
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:17,792	| IOT080 |	Ultimately they will pay for
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:19,328	| IOT080 |	The outcome so it could be
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:21,120	| IOT080 |	Grain harvesting
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:24,960	| IOT080 |	Or seeds planted or Acres planted or something like that
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:25,984	| IOT080 |	And that
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:26,496	| IOT080 |	Someone else
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,544	| IOT080 |	Potentially AGCO would be
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:30,080	| IOT080 |	Managing
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:31,104	| IOT080 |	Not only the
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:32,640	| IOT080 |	Equipment within how they quit
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:34,176	| IOT080 |	Let's maintain our equipment operated
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:38,016	| IOT080 |	And I'm guaranteeing a certain outcome to the farmer
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:42,112	| IOT080 |	You see this happening in mining operations there more Bass
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:42,880	| IOT080 |	Navel
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:43,648	| IOT080 |	Charge the cusp
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:46,720	| IOT080 |	Play the quantity of War removed
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:48,512	| IOT080 |	Is the closest thing the machine
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:50,304	| IOT080 |	Get there
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:51,584	| IOT080 |	Much like
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:53,376	| IOT080 |	The technology Journey that
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:54,400	| IOT080 |	Technology doesn't show up
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,680	| IOT080 |	All at once it comes in steps
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:57,984	| IOT080 |	So we've been building the technology Journey
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:00,800	| IOT080 |	Now we're building the services Journey
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:01,824	| IOT080 |	MCU
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:07,968	| IOT080 |	Fill out these pieces one step at a time you get the customer comfortable and digesting the value that makes sense for their far
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:08,992	| IOT080 |	Piece by piece
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:10,528	| IOT080 |	Each one has their own
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:12,064	| IOT080 |	Coyote and wolf
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:13,344	| IOT080 |	Pieces are most valuable to them
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:15,648	| IOT080 |	And then over the course of time
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:16,928	| IOT080 |	You fill in the puzzle piece
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:17,440	| IOT080 |	Until
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:21,280	| IOT080 |	You know these leave users ultimately say you know what I'd rather
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:24,096	| IOT080 |	Focus on the other elements of my operation and
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:25,888	| IOT080 |	And let you manage
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:28,704	| IOT080 |	The machine and optimizing how that machine works I'm going to
EDL	00:37:29,216	00:37:30,240	| IOT080 |	Optimize The Other Woman
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:32,800	| IOT080 |	So a lot of the
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:33,824	| IOT080 |	Adoption of
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:35,360	| IOT080 |	The cloud computing model
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:39,200	| IOT080 |	Is Opex vs capex was taken
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:44,064	| IOT080 |	In the tech World by startups in kind of Greenfield operations because
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:45,600	| IOT080 |	Either there
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:48,672	| IOT080 |	Venture capitalist Preston to do that just made more sense based on their
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:49,952	| IOT080 |	Models
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:50,720	| IOT080 |	Or
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,536	| IOT080 |	They had no existing infrastructure even Creek
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:54,560	| IOT080 |	Oceans
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:57,120	| IOT080 |	So farming does not feel like
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:59,680	| IOT080 |	It has a similar level of
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:01,472	| IOT080 |	Churn and startups I could be wrong
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:07,360	| IOT080 |	It feels like a much more old-school industry so I'm curious how
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:09,408	| IOT080 |	You guys will push this sort of shift
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:10,176	| IOT080 |	In the farm
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:10,944	| IOT080 |	Industry
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:16,576	| IOT080 |	Persol one Farmers not the same as the next Dairy Farmers a little bit different than what they need and their appetite for
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:18,880	| IOT080 |	Change in their comfort with technology
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:20,928	| IOT080 |	We're trying to end up with a few different
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:22,208	| IOT080 |	Solutions for different groups
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:22,720	| IOT080 |	Customers
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:24,000	| IOT080 |	But
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:26,816	| IOT080 |	In general if you got to take a step back and
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:27,328	| IOT080 |	Simplify
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:29,632	| IOT080 |	What we would say is that
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:30,912	| IOT080 |	We're going to need to
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:33,472	| IOT080 |	Look at those customers that are most
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:35,264	| IOT080 |	What's a business-minded
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:39,104	| IOT080 |	And most comfortable with technology and end
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:42,176	| IOT080 |	Payoffs of value think of it in terms of an Roi
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:44,736	| IOT080 |	And work with them first to generate
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:46,528	| IOT080 |	A success story
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:50,624	| IOT080 |	Now not only do we need to work with our customers we also have to work with our dealers
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:53,952	| IOT080 |	Because most of our equipment comes to our customers through it
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:55,232	| IOT080 |	Channel of independent dealers
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:56,512	| IOT080 |	Hello and they hate
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:39:02,400	| IOT080 |	Well if there's a mixture there's well isn't there there's a mixture of those early adopters who
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:03,424	| IOT080 |	Embrace
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:05,728	| IOT080 |	This conversation about
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:06,752	| IOT080 |	I working
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:09,056	| IOT080 |	Not only with technology but with
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:15,456	| IOT080 |	Changing a relationship with a customer instead of selling them a machine and then waiting a while until the phone
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:16,224	| IOT080 |	Calls music
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:18,016	| IOT080 |	I need to know
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:19,808	| IOT080 |	24 hours
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:22,624	| IOT080 |	Remotely monitoring that customer and that machine
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:23,648	| IOT080 |	To be able to help the cusp
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:24,416	| IOT080 |	Make the most of it
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:26,720	| IOT080 |	Does a shift in the relationship
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:32,608	| IOT080 |	Doesn't that imply like if you have it you if you're delivering a service I feel like a middleman is a terrible thing to have
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:33,888	| IOT080 |	So when it makes sense
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:36,704	| IOT080 |	Look into providing that monitoring
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:38,752	| IOT080 |	Bring yourself as the company providing this Hardware
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:41,056	| IOT080 |	This is a tough transition
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:45,152	| IOT080 |	Yeah if there's going to be a mixture
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:47,712	| IOT080 |	Where we're going to do some of these
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:48,992	| IOT080 |	Services
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:50,784	| IOT080 |	Especially the data analytics
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:53,600	| IOT080 |	Some of them will be done Central look like they're done
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:54,112	| IOT080 |	Sexually
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:56,672	| IOT080 |	Interact with the customers directly from a
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:40:00,256	| IOT080 |	Some of them will be done centrally just because there's an economy is
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:01,024	| IOT080 |	Scale
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:06,400	| IOT080 |	Of analyzing large amounts of data storing large amounts of data and song we don't want every dealer trying to figure that out themselves
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:09,472	| IOT080 |	But we will deploy back to the customers through the dealer
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:12,544	| IOT080 |	So because the customer relationship is there and
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:15,616	| IOT080 |	Especially if it's around machine repair or machine maintenance
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:17,152	| IOT080 |	That's going to be done by the dealer
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:20,224	| IOT080 |	So the dealer will Lemay and the
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:25,600	| IOT080 |	Inside back to the dealer and say there's a repair opportunity coming up or maintenance opportunity coming up
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:27,648	| IOT080 |	But then the dealer will call the cops
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:29,184	| IOT080 |	Marceau look to the customer
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:30,464	| IOT080 |	From the dealer
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:32,256	| IOT080 |	In a third kind are going to be some
EDL	00:40:32,768	00:40:33,792	| IOT080 |	More local
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:34,816	| IOT080 |	Dealer generators
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:35,328	| IOT080 |	Solutions
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:37,632	| IOT080 |	Where the deal is going to be looking at
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:41,216	| IOT080 |	Specific issues with their customer base in their local geography
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:42,752	| IOT080 |	And coming up with some of their own optimist
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:44,800	| IOT080 |	And that will be directed
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:45,568	| IOT080 |	Between the dealer in Augusta
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:48,128	| IOT080 |	It'll show up in all three forms
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:50,944	| IOT080 |	I depending on the kind of work that's needed in
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:54,784	| IOT080 |	And this is a hard thing to do as a business
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:57,344	| IOT080 |	This is to transition from selling a physical product
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:58,880	| IOT080 |	2
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:00,928	| IOT080 |	Selling a service especially because
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:03,744	| IOT080 |	Your service is going to be wrapped around a physical
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:04,256	| IOT080 |	Co-product
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:09,120	| IOT080 |	So how do you guys think about managing your costs in your supply chain
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:10,656	| IOT080 |	Kind of
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:13,216	| IOT080 |	Adjust for the the way the income is
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:17,568	| IOT080 |	Yeah one of the things I say here is that
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:20,128	| IOT080 |	Diffuse strategy as a
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:20,896	| IOT080 |	Feud
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:24,480	| IOT080 |	We're not the only ones going after this idea trying to help farmers become more productive
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:30,368	| IOT080 |	One of the tenants of the few strategy that makes a difference is that
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:31,392	| IOT080 |	We have a
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:35,488	| IOT080 |	We're intending to be the most open architecture approach of anybody in the industry
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:37,024	| IOT080 |	Car that is
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:40,352	| IOT080 |	What the customer sees but then the other half that is the
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:41,376	| IOT080 |	The back-office side
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:43,680	| IOT080 |	We're not going to do all this ourselves
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:47,264	| IOT080 |	In order to deliver the competency and create the company
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:49,824	| IOT080 |	We're partnering up with a few different
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:51,104	| IOT080 |	Companies
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:52,895	| IOT080 |	To be able to
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:54,431	| IOT080 |	Leverage their strong EX
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:56,991	| IOT080 |	And given area and come to the market
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:42:01,343	| IOT080 |	With a package that looks like it's one package but was actually
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:02,879	| IOT080 |	Created by
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:04,159	| IOT080 |	A few different groups working
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:08,511	| IOT080 |	That helped spread some of this cost burden over a broader base
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:09,791	| IOT080 |	And it reduces
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:11,839	| IOT080 |	The inefficiency of trying to
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:13,119	| IOT080 |	Invent all of this on our own
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:16,703	| IOT080 |	Got it so can you give me an example of what that is
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:17,727	| IOT080 |	What that looks like
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:21,567	| IOT080 |	Will one of the examples would be our guidance
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:25,919	| IOT080 |	The guidance is the GPS receiver is made up of a GPS receiver
EDL	00:42:26,943	00:42:27,967	| IOT080 |	The signal from the satellite
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:31,039	| IOT080 |	And then a navigation controller in the middle and then
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:33,599	| IOT080 |	It actually makes action on
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:34,879	| IOT080 |	The steering signal
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:36,159	| IOT080 |	2
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:36,927	| IOT080 |	Steer the machine
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:41,023	| IOT080 |	Well historically you needed to buy all of that from one provider
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:43,071	| IOT080 |	And so the customer would be
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:43,839	| IOT080 |	Lockton
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:46,143	| IOT080 |	Two provider AR provider beer providers
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:49,215	| IOT080 |	But we've done is we've come up
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:53,055	| IOT080 |	With a system that we've launched in the market this past year
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:54,591	| IOT080 |	That is
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:55,615	| IOT080 |	Agnostic
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:57,407	| IOT080 |	Guidance and what we mean by that is
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:58,175	| IOT080 |	The customer can choose
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:00,479	| IOT080 |	It's an open guidance platform
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:03,039	| IOT080 |	We've partnered up with a few different guidance
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:03,551	| IOT080 |	Companies
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:05,343	| IOT080 |	And we buy
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:06,367	| IOT080 |	Their receiver
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:09,951	| IOT080 |	And so we we've got multiple choice
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:13,535	| IOT080 |	For the customer to make based on what their farming situation is on the
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:16,351	| IOT080 |	Coverage in their geography what are the machines they have on the farm
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:17,631	| IOT080 |	What makes more sense for them
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:21,471	| IOT080 |	And we write the software code in the middle of navigation
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:22,239	| IOT080 |	Control software
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:24,543	| IOT080 |	And and make it look like
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:27,359	| IOT080 |	1 Echo System regardless of what the input was
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:30,175	| IOT080 |	And how do you guys from a
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:31,967	| IOT080 |	Just purely from a business perspective
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:35,295	| IOT080 |	How are you guys measuring success
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:36,319	| IOT080 |	As you guys switch from
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:38,111	| IOT080 |	Hardware
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:38,879	| IOT080 |	Services
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:40,927	| IOT080 |	Old school to New School
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:43,487	| IOT080 |	You know there's a few different measures
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:47,071	| IOT080 |	But we need this to be a profitable business with an echo
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:49,119	| IOT080 |	Insofar shareholders we've got
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:52,191	| IOT080 |	Goals on revenue and and margin and growth rate
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:54,495	| IOT080 |	So I'm on one handed
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:55,519	| IOT080 |	It's like any other business
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:57,567	| IOT080 |	Degenerated song
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:43:58,335	| IOT080 |	Prophet Andrew
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:43:59,871	| IOT080 |	On the other hand it's
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:00,639	| IOT080 |	It's a significant
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:03,199	| IOT080 |	Transition
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:05,503	| IOT080 |	Phase within the industry and with an egg called
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:07,551	| IOT080 |	So we're measuring other things in addition to that
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:10,879	| IOT080 |	Like percent of machines sold with service contracts
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:13,183	| IOT080 |	Adoption rates on different
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:14,719	| IOT080 |	Regions of the world
EDL	00:44:14,719	00:44:15,999	| IOT080 |	Different machine forms
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:17,791	| IOT080 |	Different levels of the
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:20,607	| IOT080 |	And then
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:23,423	| IOT080 |	Activation rates of how many of those service package
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:24,191	| IOT080 |	Jahzare
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:25,727	| IOT080 |	Are activated and renewed
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:28,287	| IOT080 |	And then satisfaction on the back end so
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:32,127	| IOT080 |	When you're in a transition phase you have to
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:33,663	| IOT080 |	Focused on additional
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:35,967	| IOT080 |	Factors beyond just the financial
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:36,479	| IOT080 |	Performance
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:38,271	| IOT080 |	Because you need to cause the
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:38,783	| IOT080 |	Phase transition
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:41,087	| IOT080 |	And that's why we're looking
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:42,111	| IOT080 |	Some of those other measures
EDL	00:44:42,111	00:44:42,879	| IOT080 |	To make sure that work
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:46,207	| IOT080 |	Treating activity change the behavior change
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:49,023	| IOT080 |	And I own the company as well as with our dealers
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:54,399	| IOT080 |	Such that the customers make we make sure that the customer seen the value out of the service package
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:57,215	| IOT080 |	Yeah I guess you guys have to worry about chernow
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:44:58,239	| IOT080 |	That's right
