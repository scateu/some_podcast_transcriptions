EDL	00:00:17,152	00:00:18,944	| IOT031 |	And today we are going to talk about
EDL	00:00:19,456	00:00:20,224	| IOT031 |	A lot of things
EDL	00:00:20,224	00:00:21,760	| IOT031 |	Including our SmartThings
EDL	00:00:22,272	00:00:23,552	| IOT031 |	Review part 1
EDL	00:00:24,064	00:00:25,088	| IOT031 |	We're going to talk about
EDL	00:00:25,600	00:00:28,928	| IOT031 |	Creating a checklist for your smart home when you move
EDL	00:00:30,208	00:00:33,024	| IOT031 |	Verizon and its new booze for
EDL	00:00:33,024	00:00:33,792	| IOT031 |	I don't know
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:35,584	| IOT031 |	Building a business on the Internet of Things
EDL	00:00:37,120	00:00:37,888	| IOT031 |	Yeah that sounds great
EDL	00:00:38,400	00:00:39,168	| IOT031 |	Good luck with that
EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:43,008	| IOT031 |	They've already made almost half a billion dollars so far at this
EDL	00:00:43,520	00:00:45,312	| IOT031 |	Year that's pretty impressive
EDL	00:00:45,312	00:00:47,104	| IOT031 |	I'm excited because they really haven't
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:50,432	| IOT031 |	Big leaps into the space yet so that's good
EDL	00:00:50,432	00:00:52,224	| IOT031 |	Yes but they decided it was not good enough
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:53,504	| IOT031 |	So
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:54,272	| IOT031 |	I'll tell you more about what their
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:55,552	| IOT031 |	But first
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:59,392	| IOT031 |	I know you guys are eager to hear about my experience with SmartThings
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:02,464	| IOT031 |	Which I am sad to say so far
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:04,256	| IOT031 |	Has not been awesome
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:05,024	| IOT031 |	What wire
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:07,072	| IOT031 |	Yeah
EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:13,472	| IOT031 |	This this is already considering to me I don't have the details yet because as I said on the show in the past
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:15,520	| IOT031 |	If wink kind of goes away
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:21,664	| IOT031 |	My number one hugged and system goes away and SmartThings is going to be my
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:22,176	| IOT031 |	Backup plan
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:24,992	| IOT031 |	Prepare to to Tinker
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:28,576	| IOT031 |	I believe is one of the reviewers said
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:29,088	| IOT031 |	So
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:30,368	| IOT031 |	Here's the deal
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:36,000	| IOT031 |	SmartThings had sent me a review unit early on in October I was in Harry Potter
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:36,768	| IOT031 |	World
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:39,328	| IOT031 |	At Universal Studios hugging minions and having a
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:40,608	| IOT031 |	Jolly good time
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:42,656	| IOT031 |	Which by the way
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:44,704	| IOT031 |	They have these awesome ones
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:45,984	| IOT031 |	At Harry Potter World
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:50,336	| IOT031 |	Proprietary technology
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:53,408	| IOT031 |	But I think they would make so much Bank
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:53,920	| IOT031 |	If
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:55,968	| IOT031 |	You know you buy these ones
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:58,784	| IOT031 |	And they had something like NFC or zigbee or
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:00,576	| IOT031 |	Bluetooth or anything in them
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:01,856	| IOT031 |	And when you got home
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,904	| IOT031 |	You could like Point them
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:04,928	| IOT031 |	At a senior house
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:08,256	| IOT031 |	And you could say something like Wingardium Leviosa
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:09,024	| IOT031 |	Open your blinds
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:12,352	| IOT031 |	That's that's interesting
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:16,960	| IOT031 |	Proprietary no because it's Hogwarts magic so you know they're not going to do something standard
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:19,008	| IOT031 |	But that would be cool kind of
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:23,616	| IOT031 |	Pointing at the device you want to control and then leveraging what I called the
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,408	| IOT031 |	Invisible interface to voice
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:31,296	| IOT031 |	Or she we should wait a second we should we should build a business around this hang on a second
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:32,576	| IOT031 |	Seaweed have to
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:33,344	| IOT031 |	Play JK Rowling
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:34,880	| IOT031 |	But
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,672	| IOT031 |	I think
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,208	| IOT031 |	How magical would that be
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:41,536	| IOT031 |	This is my business plan that unfortunately
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,304	| IOT031 |	Involves paying license
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:43,840	| IOT031 |	To somebody
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:48,448	| IOT031 |	Get rid of all those silly Way chords We have forever always devices you know
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:50,496	| IOT031 |	Exactly you could do your whole home in like
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,032	| IOT031 |	Harry Potter or is she or you know
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,312	| IOT031 |	Until 8
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:55,104	| IOT031 |	The Hobbit or something like that
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,640	| IOT031 |	You are precious
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:03:01,248	| IOT031 |	You could be like Gandalf I don't know what does he have like actual magic words or what I have to learn Elvish
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:05,088	| IOT031 |	Well he doesn't have his own they are there typically Elvish yes
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:05,856	| IOT031 |	How scary is it
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,136	| IOT031 |	Okay
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:12,000	| IOT031 |	Now that we have totally out of our cells is
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,792	| IOT031 |	Crazy crazy
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:17,120	| IOT031 |	Hanging lights up my Middle Earth map of Psyduck
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:20,192	| IOT031 |	Active
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,496	| IOT031 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:23,776	| IOT031 |	All right
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,056	| IOT031 |	What I
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:28,384	| IOT031 |	So so having had this II started out
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:30,688	| IOT031 |	Trying to get devices online
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:33,760	| IOT031 |	And in this took me a long time because every time I encountered a snag
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:35,040	| IOT031 |	Being
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:37,856	| IOT031 |	Someone add I would just say
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:41,696	| IOT031 |	Well while I wait for this to connect all go play with this other two
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,512	| IOT031 |	What devices today include by the way
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,816	| IOT031 |	SmartThings sent me
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,096	| IOT031 |	Diversion to Hub
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:49,632	| IOT031 |	And
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:52,704	| IOT031 |	What they called their monitoring kit the monitoring kit contain
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:55,520	| IOT031 |	To open close sensors
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:57,568	| IOT031 |	To the new smaller open close sensors
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,080	| IOT031 |	A
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,384	| IOT031 |	Motion detector
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,408	| IOT031 |	And an outlet
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:03,968	| IOT031 |	They also sent me a siren
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:05,504	| IOT031 |	A water sensor
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:07,040	| IOT031 |	And Samsung
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:07,808	| IOT031 |	IP camera
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:13,184	| IOT031 |	Those are not cheap and
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:16,256	| IOT031 |	They also sent me a roll of really sticky double-sided 3M tape
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:17,791	| IOT031 |	Which is very
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:21,631	| IOT031 |	That was the entire package that I got
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,399	| IOT031 |	I don't know the
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:25,215	| IOT031 |	Retail value of all of the stuff the
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,007	| IOT031 |	Home monitoring kit which contained
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:30,079	| IOT031 |	Before sensors and the connected home
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:32,639	| IOT031 |	Was I believe
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,175	| IOT031 |	249
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:35,199	| IOT031 |	Right right
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:40,319	| IOT031 |	And in all of these products that they sent you for who you are available to purchase and are shipping to Consumers now
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,623	| IOT031 |	They are all available in China
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,183	| IOT031 |	One more quick question
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:47,231	| IOT031 |	Homekit or no homekit support
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:49,279	| IOT031 |	Just clarified okay
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:51,839	| IOT031 |	SmartThings The Hub support zigbee
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,863	| IOT031 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,375	| IOT031 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,399	| IOT031 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,447	| IOT031 |	Those are those are your radio
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:57,727	| IOT031 |	Okay
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:01,311	| IOT031 |	A wonderful wonderful option and I've had version 1 of this in my home
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:02,591	| IOT031 |	For like
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:04,127	| IOT031 |	Two and a half years and I love it
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,663	| IOT031 |	It's
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,687	| IOT031 |	Lighthouse version 2
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,479	| IOT031 |	Version 2
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:12,319	| IOT031 |	So when I
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:15,903	| IOT031 |	Connect so the connection also did a completely fresh
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:19,999	| IOT031 |	Refresh like a fresh connection I did not try to upgrade
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,279	| IOT031 |	From version 1
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:21,791	| IOT031 |	Conversion to
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,863	| IOT031 |	Upon their advice they said
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,631	| IOT031 |	Don't do that
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,399	| IOT031 |	It's pretty
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:29,471	| IOT031 |	And that's actually Fair because I don't think
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:30,751	| IOT031 |	Most people buying this
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:34,079	| IOT031 |	Have already SmartThings Hub in all the other fun stuff
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,359	| IOT031 |	Okay so
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:38,431	| IOT031 |	That's enough if you have it and you want to do
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:39,711	| IOT031 |	A
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:42,271	| IOT031 |	Versionone to to refresh let me know how that goes for you
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,575	| IOT031 |	Good luck with that
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:46,111	| IOT031 |	No I am very curious
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,391	| IOT031 |	So my
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,671	| IOT031 |	So I made a brand new account
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,463	| IOT031 |	And
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,999	| IOT031 |	The setup itself
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,279	| IOT031 |	Very easy of the Hub
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:55,839	| IOT031 |	I had my account
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,375	| IOT031 |	All is well
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:58,655	| IOT031 |	And then
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:00,703	| IOT031 |	I started adding sensors
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:04,287	| IOT031 |	And it was very quick it was like hey do you want us to find sensors
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:05,311	| IOT031 |	You clicked yes
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,615	| IOT031 |	I think you click next
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:10,175	| IOT031 |	And then it started looking for sensors
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,967	| IOT031 |	At that point it found
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:16,319	| IOT031 |	Two of the four sensors for me and found the motion sensor and wanted the open closed sign
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:17,855	| IOT031 |	Atlantic capital
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:21,183	| IOT031 |	In about 5 minutes into that process I kind of got bored
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,279	| IOT031 |	What did it not find
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:27,839	| IOT031 |	It did not find one of the open closed sign
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:28,863	| IOT031 |	Sensors
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:30,143	| IOT031 |	And it did not find the outlet
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:31,935	| IOT031 |	So
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:35,519	| IOT031 |	That's kind of where things stood for a while I also added the camera
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,055	| IOT031 |	Dad the camera
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,871	| IOT031 |	You actually set up the camera on its own
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,919	| IOT031 |	And then you added that
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,455	| IOT031 |	Like you would any
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:51,135	| IOT031 |	Normal secondary device so smart things the benefit of smart things is that it's a very open and it's app
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,415	| IOT031 |	Import hundreds of
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,439	| IOT031 |	Outside devices
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,487	| IOT031 |	So Dad the camera
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:56,767	| IOT031 |	You would just
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,815	| IOT031 |	Find it as a supported device
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:01,375	| IOT031 |	And you went into like their security section
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:04,191	| IOT031 |	There's a section for cameras and it's
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,983	| IOT031 |	Centos supported there like Samsung
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:09,823	| IOT031 |	And that again makes sense to me as well because
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:15,711	| IOT031 |	The setup process would require getting the camera and IP address on your network and you know getting that connectivity going on
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:19,039	| IOT031 |	That it would be able to actually use the camera so that that's fine
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,855	| IOT031 |	Yes and this is the first version to is the first
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:23,647	| IOT031 |	SmartThings Hub support
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,159	| IOT031 |	Cameras
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,719	| IOT031 |	Why it's different
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,255	| IOT031 |	Special
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:34,399	| IOT031 |	I have trouble with the camera and I don't know if it's smart things or if it's Samsung or what the
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:34,911	| IOT031 |	WhatsApp
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:38,239	| IOT031 |	Hold up is now Samsung does own SmartThings
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,775	| IOT031 |	So I kind of find a surprising
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:43,359	| IOT031 |	You have to enter like many things
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:45,919	| IOT031 |	Do you want any Kate when you're trying to connect to
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,943	| IOT031 |	Separate devices
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:50,015	| IOT031 |	With a password
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:51,039	| IOT031 |	Some reason
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,343	| IOT031 |	My password just wasn't accepted
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:57,439	| IOT031 |	So I did a hard reset of camera twice to try to
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,975	| IOT031 |	Make sure that I was
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,743	| IOT031 |	Skating at the right path
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:02,047	| IOT031 |	But I was
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:05,887	| IOT031 |	That was frustrate
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,447	| IOT031 |	That was one of the frustration
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,519	| IOT031 |	I'm so I still haven't yet
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,287	| IOT031 |	Scene
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:12,799	| IOT031 |	The camera
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:16,895	| IOT031 |	Inside smart things I seen the camera outside SmartThings and it's a lovely camera
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:20,223	| IOT031 |	I guess it what you just go to a IP address of the
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:23,039	| IOT031 |	Cameron web browser
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:25,087	| IOT031 |	I didn't I didn't get so fancy
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:25,599	| IOT031 |	Passcode on iPad
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:30,975	| IOT031 |	CNN typically only cuz I have a couple IP webcam
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:33,023	| IOT031 |	Get there fast games are old
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:37,631	| IOT031 |	When I look through the browser if the same thing you still have to sign into thumbtack
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| IOT031 |	Which Wich
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,447	| IOT031 |	Make sense from security standpoint
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:41,727	| IOT031 |	Yes you
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:44,543	| IOT031 |	Secure home camera
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:45,823	| IOT031 |	Forever
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:49,663	| IOT031 |	Sometimes I do sometimes the cats and dogs really
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,967	| IOT031 |	Sometimes put on quite a show but you're right most people don't
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,991	| IOT031 |	Online faces my back
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:56,575	| IOT031 |	So this is it this is my use case that I was trying to monitor
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:59,391	| IOT031 |	The goal of setting this up with
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,671	| IOT031 |	Again my dog is escaping
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,975	| IOT031 |	She's very very good at that
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:06,303	| IOT031 |	So I set up my motion detector by the dog door
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:10,911	| IOT031 |	So when she walks out the dog door it would trigger the camera to start recording
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:15,519	| IOT031 |	And since it's facing the backyard I'm trying to figure out which hole in the fence she's getting through this time
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,823	| IOT031 |	And then
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:19,871	| IOT031 |	So that's that's my goal
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:20,639	| IOT031 |	I haven't achieved it yet
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,711	| IOT031 |	There's Hope
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:25,759	| IOT031 |	What's the savers on we're going to get there
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:29,855	| IOT031 |	So I can let the dogs figured it out and change the password on you but that's just
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,927	| IOT031 |	I know
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,975	| IOT031 |	That that was first issue
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,791	| IOT031 |	So when I came back to it a couple of light
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:38,559	| IOT031 |	I thought I took a
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,375	| IOT031 |	Wii cost basically for messing with this in
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:43,167	| IOT031 |	But when I came back to it
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,191	| IOT031 |	I was like
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:47,007	| IOT031 |	Let's try it again Daddy sensors
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:52,383	| IOT031 |	So this time instead of doing be kind of generic just find whatever is available I went to add them individually
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,431	| IOT031 |	That also did not work
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:55,967	| IOT031 |	So
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,503	| IOT031 |	The outlet
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,831	| IOT031 |	They came with it is a zigbee outlet so I moved it closer to the hub
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:02,367	| IOT031 |	Hoping that would help
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:02,879	| IOT031 |	How close
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,183	| IOT031 |	5 feet of the Hub
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:07,487	| IOT031 |	Observation connection
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,791	| IOT031 |	And I press the little button so
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,583	| IOT031 |	Light is blinking everything is good
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:12,607	| IOT031 |	It didn't connect
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:14,655	| IOT031 |	So
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,191	| IOT031 |	Not sure what's going on there
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:23,871	| IOT031 |	And just to clarify this is not a third-party generic zigbee switch this is an actual Samsung SmartThings
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:25,151	| IOT031 |	Sprint
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,711	| IOT031 |	Yashow SmartThings this came within the Hub
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:33,087	| IOT031 |	Open close sensor that did not connect
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:37,951	| IOT031 |	I don't know how to force it to connect I took out the battery to try to
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:38,463	| IOT031 |	Force
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,743	| IOT031 |	A new connection
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:41,279	| IOT031 |	It's so far has not
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:43,583	| IOT031 |	So we're going to
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,119	| IOT031 |	I don't that may just be a
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,143	| IOT031 |	A dead sensor
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:46,911	| IOT031 |	I don't come
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,191	| IOT031 |	I also tried to
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:50,239	| IOT031 |	Connect a couple of my devices
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,263	| IOT031 |	And that
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,055	| IOT031 |	Didn't work
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:58,175	| IOT031 |	I tried to connect those to the wink Hub to make sure that those devices were not
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:00,223	| IOT031 |	Fault is it connected to the wink hub
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:01,503	| IOT031 |	And then I
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,807	| IOT031 |	Disconnected them for the wink Hub 2
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:06,111	| IOT031 |	Because you can't have things connecting on multiple Networks
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,671	| IOT031 |	And then tried again to connect
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,463	| IOT031 |	Candismart things and they still weren't ready
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:12,767	| IOT031 |	Those received wave device
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:16,863	| IOT031 |	What about the open close sensor that is
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,143	| IOT031 |	Seen by The Hub
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:20,191	| IOT031 |	And the open close sensor that is seen by The Hub
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,727	| IOT031 |	Is always open
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,287	| IOT031 |	Even though right now it is
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:24,799	| IOT031 |	Technically supposed to
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,359	| IOT031 |	So
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,639	| IOT031 |	So what's working
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:32,735	| IOT031 |	So I have a working motion sensor
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:35,551	| IOT031 |	Yeah I have also added my Hue Lights
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,575	| IOT031 |	And they work
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:38,623	| IOT031 |	They are controllable and they're very lovely
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:42,975	| IOT031 |	My Sonos has also we're seen that's a
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:46,303	| IOT031 |	SmartThings has a Labs feature which means it's kind of
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,119	| IOT031 |	We have to stay together and
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:49,631	| IOT031 |	That sort of
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:53,215	| IOT031 |	So that works
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:55,775	| IOT031 |	I added my ecobee but it's not showing up
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:59,359	| IOT031 |	But it technically is supported so I'm not sure what's going on there
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,151	| IOT031 |	And so
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:01,919	| IOT031 |	Right now
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,711	| IOT031 |	Yes I feel that
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:04,735	| IOT031 |	This is not
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,015	| IOT031 |	A great
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:06,783	| IOT031 |	Experience
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:08,575	| IOT031 |	SmartThings is not so smart right now
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:09,087	| IOT031 |	But
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,623	| IOT031 |	Have a hopes
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:13,695	| IOT031 |	I have hopes that I either have a really bad hub
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:16,767	| IOT031 |	And that I will replace the Hub and
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:18,559	| IOT031 |	Work
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,839	| IOT031 |	Or I got like a
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:23,167	| IOT031 |	Sensor that went through like an EMP on the way to my house
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:24,703	| IOT031 |	I don't know
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:26,751	| IOT031 |	But we'll figure it out
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:27,519	| IOT031 |	Because
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:29,823	| IOT031 |	In the past SmartThings has been amazing
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:32,383	| IOT031 |	The software update
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:37,503	| IOT031 |	I've used it actually with my older SmartThings gear because the software update came out
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:40,319	| IOT031 |	Prior to me getting the Hub and I upgraded it
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:41,855	| IOT031 |	With my new stuff
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,135	| IOT031 |	With my old stuff
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:43,903	| IOT031 |	And it was
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:44,415	| IOT031 |	It was great
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,463	| IOT031 |	Let me ask you a question that
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:49,535	| IOT031 |	The old house that you have that everything's been working well
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,815	| IOT031 |	You Got It upgraded
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:52,607	| IOT031 |	Do these new devices
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:54,655	| IOT031 |	What should these new devices work with the old hub
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:57,215	| IOT031 |	I don't know because I didn't
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:58,239	| IOT031 |	Want to mess with
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:02,079	| IOT031 |	Theoretically I'm thinking they should
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:04,383	| IOT031 |	Theoretically they should because
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:05,663	| IOT031 |	The old
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:08,735	| IOT031 |	Hope still supports those radios
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:10,015	| IOT031 |	Yasso
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:12,575	| IOT031 |	Temperature is and I know it's time-consuming for you
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:17,951	| IOT031 |	Pictures if these sensors that are not connect to the new Hub acts like you connect to the old Hub that's been software upgraded
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,231	| IOT031 |	I will
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:21,535	| IOT031 |	Try that after I
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:24,863	| IOT031 |	Yeah they come and give Stacey homework
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:27,679	| IOT031 |	After I get through this
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:31,519	| IOT031 |	I've been trying to avoid the SmartThings support Beyond
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:35,359	| IOT031 |	Basic stuff because I don't want to get special Lake
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:39,711	| IOT031 |	Right yeah but we weren't us all the time as reviewers you know once
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:42,271	| IOT031 |	The company finds out your own problems they attach a special
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:44,319	| IOT031 |	Team 10
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:47,391	| IOT031 |	Fixed up as quickly as possible but consumers don't have that
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:51,487	| IOT031 |	So I try and do that what you're doing go through the standard support process and
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:52,767	| IOT031 |	And so on
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:55,583	| IOT031 |	Maybe on their help forums we're kind of a little more anonymous
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:56,863	| IOT031 |	UE
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,911	| IOT031 |	Their health forms are good
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:00,703	| IOT031 |	And I have online chat
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,263	| IOT031 |	Inspire things actually has great
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:04,799	| IOT031 |	Like
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:06,079	| IOT031 |	Normal people
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:08,127	| IOT031 |	SmartThings will get people
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:09,407	| IOT031 |	But people will call you
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,175	| IOT031 |	As a norm
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:12,479	| IOT031 |	A person if you're having a lot of trouble
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:15,039	| IOT031 |	They actually will get some
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:15,551	| IOT031 |	Someone to call you in
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:17,343	| IOT031 |	Think so it's not
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,623	| IOT031 |	It's not like wynk that has a
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,671	| IOT031 |	Support line that you can call
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:23,487	| IOT031 |	Read after you've gone through like a support forum
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,255	| IOT031 |	Iran chat
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,559	| IOT031 |	Everyone scratching their heads they're like
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:28,351	| IOT031 |	We're calling
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:34,239	| IOT031 |	So it's it's not too crazy but I'm kind of to the point where they
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,031	| IOT031 |	I really have done it
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,311	| IOT031 |	Thanks
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:40,127	| IOT031 |	Well and you have more patience than most because this is
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,663	| IOT031 |	You know that's what we do
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:44,735	| IOT031 |	9 and 4 standard everyday mainstream consumers
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:49,343	| IOT031 |	If they had gone through what you've gone through right now I think they probably would return the device at this point
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:52,927	| IOT031 |	I think a normal consumer probably would have returned the device after
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,207	| IOT031 |	The sensors were not found
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:56,767	| IOT031 |	Like in the beginning
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,815	| IOT031 |	Which is when I stopped and started adding
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,607	| IOT031 |	Other devices of mine
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,119	| IOT031 |	And it started like
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:03,167	| IOT031 |	Sure actually broken
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:09,055	| IOT031 |	Cuz you said it could be just a bad Hub it could be
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,847	| IOT031 |	Something that's a one-off
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,871	| IOT031 |	Hardware issue
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:15,711	| IOT031 |	But to me is somebody was considering the purchase of this cuz I am
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,527	| IOT031 |	Just like I said I mean if one goes away this is my
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,831	| IOT031 |	My next best choice for me
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,599	| IOT031 |	I'm not
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:23,135	| IOT031 |	Turn up the lights yet
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,415	| IOT031 |	Well you don't have to
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:25,695	| IOT031 |	Because I have a spare hub
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:28,255	| IOT031 |	That's even better good news
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:31,839	| IOT031 |	So yes if it is if it does turn out I haven't pulled out the spare hub yet
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,143	| IOT031 |	I really thought the
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:38,239	| IOT031 |	Well I also think there are some sensory issues here so hot
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:40,031	| IOT031 |	Couldn't even spot that Hub out
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,567	| IOT031 |	If you do nothing else
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,591	| IOT031 |	Cuz it could be that
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,103	| IOT031 |	That is the neck
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:44,383	| IOT031 |	Good
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:45,919	| IOT031 |	Next week
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:47,967	| IOT031 |	Maybe I'll be like
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,807	| IOT031 |	It was the EMP at the post office
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:56,159	| IOT031 |	So now I will figure this out and
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:16:00,511	| IOT031 |	Maybe next week I'll be singing the Praises and you guys should all rush out and buy one but not the one that I bought
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:03,583	| IOT031 |	One of those thought or question hero I have not I was
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,631	| IOT031 |	Traveling yesterday and
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:12,287	| IOT031 |	Busy on Monday I have not read other reviews of this new product I'm assuming there are some out there and I'm curious if other people have
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:15,359	| IOT031 |	Praise this or have had similar problems
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:17,407	| IOT031 |	So the reviews are really mixed in
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:20,223	| IOT031 |	The professional reviews
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:23,807	| IOT031 |	Haven't really said that the hardware is good the software
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,319	| IOT031 |	Is iffy
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:25,855	| IOT031 |	Which
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,367	| IOT031 |	It's kind of
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,903	| IOT031 |	That's been my
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:32,255	| IOT031 |	Previous experience with this so I was like that's what I kind of expected
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:35,583	| IOT031 |	The Amazon customer reviews who said that
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:38,143	| IOT031 |	Getting this online has actually been tough
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:41,471	| IOT031 |	And then there's the typical five stars that are like gray product
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:43,519	| IOT031 |	So
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,567	| IOT031 |	The reviews are little
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,847	| IOT031 |	The place quite honestly
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:51,967	| IOT031 |	Happened to review the challenge of getting it online and working
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:55,295	| IOT031 |	And some of them have been kind of like prepare to Tinker
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:58,367	| IOT031 |	So I don't I don't really know what to say about that
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:16:59,647	| IOT031 |	Other than
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:02,719	| IOT031 |	This my experience may not be that unusual
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,999	| IOT031 |	And that
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:05,535	| IOT031 |	Seems to be kind of ominous
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:08,095	| IOT031 |	So that's
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:10,143	| IOT031 |	That's why I try not to read reviews too much
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:11,167	| IOT031 |	Before I go into
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,191	| IOT031 |	Same here
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:13,471	| IOT031 |	Because
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:18,335	| IOT031 |	But once I once I start experiencing trouble then I'm like okay
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,127	| IOT031 |	It's just me
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,663	| IOT031 |	What's happening
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,711	| IOT031 |	So that's that
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:24,479	| IOT031 |	Stay tuned
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:25,759	| IOT031 |	Next week hopefully
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:28,063	| IOT031 |	Will have a new Hub Maybe
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,599	| IOT031 |	Or maybe I'll have fixed all of this
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:32,671	| IOT031 |	Maybe it's maybe it's the foil I wrap my hubby
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:36,767	| IOT031 |	I would say anybody who is thinking about buying this you may want to wait till next week show
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:37,791	| IOT031 |	Or just a
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,095	| IOT031 |	Definitely wait till they
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,143	| IOT031 |	Okay so
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:44,447	| IOT031 |	Enough time I'm at let's talk about
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:46,495	| IOT031 |	CIO magazine
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:50,079	| IOT031 |	Cover this and I'm glad they did because we covered this before but
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:51,871	| IOT031 |	I know I do this existed but
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:54,943	| IOT031 |	The OT aide online trust Alliance put out a check list
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:59,039	| IOT031 |	Things you should do if you have Smart devices in your home and you're about to
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:17:59,551	| IOT031 |	To move
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:02,367	| IOT031 |	And I'll put a link to it in the show notes
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:03,647	| IOT031 |	But it's
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,695	| IOT031 |	It's pretty cool right
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:10,815	| IOT031 |	This this is a pretty comprehensive list and honestly when I have my house for sale last year I kept
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:14,143	| IOT031 |	On my to-do list make a list of all the things you need to
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,423	| IOT031 |	Pull out of the house or
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:18,495	| IOT031 |	Reset passwords for its own because
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:22,079	| IOT031 |	With all these gadgets and things hooked up into the home that somebody is buying
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:25,919	| IOT031 |	You can't leave them high and dry where they have all these smart switches and the
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:27,711	| IOT031 |	You're not working cuz I don't have access
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:30,015	| IOT031 |	You certainly don't want your old data available to the
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:30,783	| IOT031 |	To the new buyer
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:35,647	| IOT031 |	If there's a ton of stuff and I didn't really realize until I saw this OTA checklist
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,927	| IOT031 |	Yasso
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:38,719	| IOT031 |	Some things on here like
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:40,767	| IOT031 |	Again will give you the complete list but
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,535	| IOT031 |	Things like
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:44,095	| IOT031 |	Modems gateways hubs
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:47,167	| IOT031 |	Like in some of this you got to think like are you going to pull out
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:48,447	| IOT031 |	Your Nest right
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:50,495	| IOT031 |	Leaving to pull out your connector garage door
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:54,591	| IOT031 |	So you got to think about book passwords but then also resetting that make
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:55,615	| IOT031 |	Making sure they can't get to the day
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:57,919	| IOT031 |	Those are probably the big things
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,967	| IOT031 |	Connected switches
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:03,551	| IOT031 |	Which I have site mean they're hardwired in
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:06,111	| IOT031 |	Yeah so it's same here like all my Lutron switches
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,647	| IOT031 |	I like do I
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:09,951	| IOT031 |	Do you give him like the Lutron
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,487	| IOT031 |	Bridge do you tell him hey
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:13,535	| IOT031 |	If you want to control these from the internet
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:17,887	| IOT031 |	The nice thing about my switches and probably yours are they still work as switches even if you don't
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,191	| IOT031 |	Correct
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:22,751	| IOT031 |	So big they work like normal switches
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:23,519	| IOT031 |	And
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,311	| IOT031 |	I guess technically anything that's
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:29,151	| IOT031 |	Part of the home when you're actually selling the home should go to the buyer unless you
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:34,271	| IOT031 |	Work out something so I guess what we will do cuz we will still be moving just
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,319	| IOT031 |	After waiting for the kids to finish up High School
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:40,415	| IOT031 |	You know I think what we'll do is we'll just negotiating said do you want these
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:43,743	| IOT031 |	If so we'll leave the man that will make sure that you have passwords and all that
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:46,047	| IOT031 |	As a buyer I guess I'd be concerned out
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:51,167	| IOT031 |	G are these people going to still have access to the things after they're gone I mean
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:54,239	| IOT031 |	You know it's probably a conversation that actually need to be had
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:58,079	| IOT031 |	In a way it's kind of like I don't know about you but like I have a
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:00,895	| IOT031 |	I have a list like in case I die with all of my
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:05,247	| IOT031 |	Not as social media but email credit cards all those passwords that are there for
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:05,759	| IOT031 |	My husband
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:09,087	| IOT031 |	You kind of have to create something like that for your house
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,391	| IOT031 |	But happy thought
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:14,975	| IOT031 |	I know you're right I mean
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:16,511	| IOT031 |	Morbidity
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:17,791	| IOT031 |	You're absolutely right I mean
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,583	| IOT031 |	Otherwise you know it's like
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:24,703	| IOT031 |	You're gone and then the family is like I don't know how to turn these lights on anymore I mean
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:27,007	| IOT031 |	Seriously that's that's kind of crazy
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:28,287	| IOT031 |	And you have to remember like
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:30,847	| IOT031 |	What are these light bulbs
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:32,383	| IOT031 |	Bright
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:38,527	| IOT031 |	Laika the last item in here is like disable connectivity for devices no longer supported by the manufacturer or replace them
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,063	| IOT031 |	Holy crap
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:46,463	| IOT031 |	Cuz in 10 years am I going to still remember who made my LEDs that are now like halfway through their life cycle
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:50,303	| IOT031 |	So this will leave in here
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,583	| IOT031 |	It's a great topic
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,351	| IOT031 |	Conversation
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,119	| IOT031 |	For you
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:56,959	| IOT031 |	Great kind of thing where you're like in the middle of moving now I'm going to have to think about like
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:03,615	| IOT031 |	Having a conversation and remembering all the passwords associated with all of my connected devices some of which I may not even remember
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:05,919	| IOT031 |	All right
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,199	| IOT031 |	And now
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:07,967	| IOT031 |	We should get to
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:09,503	| IOT031 |	Verizon
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,039	| IOT031 |	What are they doing
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:12,319	| IOT031 |	2
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:14,367	| IOT031 |	Verizon on Wednesday
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:16,672	| IOT031 |	Is set to announce because today is Wednesday
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,208	| IOT031 |	Is set to announce a
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:20,000	| IOT031 |	Kind of effort
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:20,768	| IOT031 |	2
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:24,096	| IOT031 |	No that is not a word that is not over
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:25,632	| IOT031 |	What's a boost
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:27,424	| IOT031 |	It's internet of things kind of
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:29,728	| IOT031 |	Revenue Generation by creating
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,752	| IOT031 |	What it cost tools
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:33,056	| IOT031 |	So what it's doing is kind of
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:40,480	| IOT031 |	It is launching a cloud platform called thingspace it'll compete with Amazon's Internet of Things
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:45,344	| IOT031 |	Cloud IBM's internet-of-things cloud and all these other Internet of Things clouds that are out there
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:48,416	| IOT031 |	How many clouds
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:49,184	| IOT031 |	Houdini cloud
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:51,488	| IOT031 |	It is going to have like
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:53,024	| IOT031 |	It's basically a place where developers can
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:57,632	| IOT031 |	Point there are things at and send data and then build apps against
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:59,936	| IOT031 |	That's pretty like normal
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:00,448	| IOT031 |	Right everyone
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:05,568	| IOT031 |	But the cool thing that's pretty specific to Verizon is that is partnered with sequins
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:07,104	| IOT031 |	Sequence the Moto Maker
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:11,712	| IOT031 |	And it's going to offer modems LTE modems for
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:13,760	| IOT031 |	Basically half the price of an LTE modem
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,808	| IOT031 |	So about 15 bucks
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:19,648	| IOT031 |	Really high but it's not as high as it could be
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:21,952	| IOT031 |	And that's that's important
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:22,464	| IOT031 |	Because
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:27,584	| IOT031 |	Cellular modems are expensive much more expensive than Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modems
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,120	| IOT031 |	And that
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:33,728	| IOT031 |	Really adds to the cost of any sort of device that you really want to build that
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:36,288	| IOT031 |	Go anywhere and be always on
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:38,592	| IOT031 |	And it's one of the reasons why
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:40,640	| IOT031 |	We don't get a lot of trackers that
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:42,176	| IOT031 |	Doesn't depend on
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:42,944	| IOT031 |	You know your phone
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,224	| IOT031 |	And
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:45,248	| IOT031 |	Petition
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,296	| IOT031 |	They're also going to be
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,064	| IOT031 |	Doing
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:52,160	| IOT031 |	Different profiles and data plans for quote-unquote things
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,976	| IOT031 |	Verizon did not get specific
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,000	| IOT031 |	About the type
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:58,816	| IOT031 |	Data plans that it can offer unfortunately
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:04,448	| IOT031 |	But it is willing to negotiate which is kind of an unusual stance for it because prior to this it wasn't
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:07,776	| IOT031 |	So
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:10,592	| IOT031 |	If you're planning on making a connected Pet Tracker
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:13,152	| IOT031 |	Please please because again my dog
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:15,200	| IOT031 |	She's got an escape at some point in time
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:18,016	| IOT031 |	And I would love to be able to follow her beyond the
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,040	| IOT031 |	Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:20,064	| IOT031 |	Because right now
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:20,576	| IOT031 |	I cannot
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:23,392	| IOT031 |	In a cellular modem on her collar would be
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,160	| IOT031 |	Great for that
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:24,928	| IOT031 |	Alipay
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:27,488	| IOT031 |	Maybe a slightly different subscription fee
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:30,304	| IOT031 |	Alright what wait hold the phone for a second
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:33,888	| IOT031 |	Because I was joking about this two weeks ago on Twitter but it actually exists
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:36,960	| IOT031 |	There is a cellular caller
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:41,056	| IOT031 |	For Pet's they actually showed a video of it with cats but
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:44,640	| IOT031 |	It's literally a phone its GPS and a speaker in microphone
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:47,200	| IOT031 |	And it's on the collar of the animal
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:49,504	| IOT031 |	And you can track where they go and then you can
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:51,552	| IOT031 |	Speak it up and you can hear what they hear
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,832	| IOT031 |	I was at the meow meow thing
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:57,952	| IOT031 |	I don't recall what I was laughing so hard when I saw the Cat video of a cat being told
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:00,512	| IOT031 |	Is it like that French video and it's the woman's eye
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,280	| IOT031 |	Where are you
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,328	| IOT031 |	Yes that's exactly what it is
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:06,144	| IOT031 |	I did see that I wish that does exist
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:07,424	| IOT031 |	And that might
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,472	| IOT031 |	I don't know if your dog listens when you
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:11,776	| IOT031 |	You know tell her to stay or come inside but
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:13,568	| IOT031 |	I will cuz I can help you
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:17,408	| IOT031 |	No but you know at least I could see her she said she'll come back eventually
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:19,968	| IOT031 |	It is it's more just like
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,808	| IOT031 |	She's not being
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:24,320	| IOT031 |	My coyote
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:27,904	| IOT031 |	Yeah that's not something you want to hear on a cell phone
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:28,416	| IOT031 |	Ocado
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:29,696	| IOT031 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:36,352	| IOT031 |	Total Downer of a show
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:42,496	| IOT031 |	Oster digital will you pass away if your family don't forget to listen to your dog being eaten over the phone
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,312	| IOT031 |	Yasso
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:48,384	| IOT031 |	Let's just go straight to the guest
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:50,176	| IOT031 |	Because of happy guests
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:53,248	| IOT031 |	It is we're talking about saving energy and
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,272	| IOT031 |	Commercials buildings
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:58,880	| IOT031 |	I'm a guest is the CEO of enlighted his name is Joe Costello
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:24:59,904	| IOT031 |	He has
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,440	| IOT031 |	Actually two cool things
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:03,488	| IOT031 |	That he's going to talk about 1
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,256	| IOT031 |	Is
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:06,816	| IOT031 |	Saving energy in commercial spaces
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,096	| IOT031 |	Hbac
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,400	| IOT031 |	And then he's talking about actually
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:12,704	| IOT031 |	Doing a b testing in the real world
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:14,752	| IOT031 |	Space
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:17,056	| IOT031 |	And like the number of people in an office space
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:18,592	| IOT031 |	And I actually enjoyed it
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:20,384	| IOT031 |	A big nerd
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,920	| IOT031 |	Discovered from the beginning of the show
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:26,016	| IOT031 |	So I wish I could say goodbye to you in Elvish can you say goodbye in Elvish Kevin
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:28,576	| IOT031 |	I could but I want to
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:31,904	| IOT031 |	There we go
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:35,488	| IOT031 |	We will not say goodbye in Elvish or Klingon or any of the other languages that
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:37,280	| IOT031 |	But you know
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:38,560	| IOT031 |	You can you can say in your head if you
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:44,192	| IOT031 |	So instead we'll go with and stay tuned for
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:50,592	| IOT031 |	Joe Costello the CEO of enlighted
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:54,944	| IOT031 |	Today's guests I have Joe Costello
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:57,248	| IOT031 |	Who is president CEO of enlighted
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,528	| IOT031 |	Hi Joe how are you doing today
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:01,856	| IOT031 |	Fantastic Stacy thanks for inviting us
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:04,416	| IOT031 |	I am super excited to have you we have talked
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:05,952	| IOT031 |	Bunch of times about enlighted
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:09,024	| IOT031 |	And this is a company you guys that makes
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:12,608	| IOT031 |	It makes LEDs for corporate space so
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:16,960	| IOT031 |	I was going to say Enterprise space but that is not really a thing so
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:18,752	| IOT031 |	You make it for commercial buildings
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:19,264	| IOT031 |	And
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:25,152	| IOT031 |	You don't just jammed lights up there you also Jam all kinds of sensors up there so Joe you want to tell us a little bit
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:27,968	| IOT031 |	More about enlighted and what you can do with that
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:29,504	| IOT031 |	Yes
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:34,624	| IOT031 |	It's actually everything perfect for your show or Internet of things for commercial real estate
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:35,904	| IOT031 |	Is the best way to die
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,672	| IOT031 |	Describe it
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:41,024	| IOT031 |	And we put a sensor Network into the ceiling of the building
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:44,608	| IOT031 |	That's what brings that building into the Internet of Things
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:46,400	| IOT031 |	And in fact we attached
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:50,240	| IOT031 |	1 sensor module to every light fixture almost every life
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:56,640	| IOT031 |	And the light fixture gives the little sensor module power and it's also great for position because if you have one of them
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:27:01,504	| IOT031 |	Light fixture it almost guarantees you see every square inch of the buildings ejaculate every square inch of the building
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:06,112	| IOT031 |	And so we got the power in the place from the light and we give the light back a brain
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:08,160	| IOT031 |	To send every life we give a little
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:10,976	| IOT031 |	Piece of a processor that's inside the sensor to the lights
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,512	| IOT031 |	To control the lights
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:14,048	| IOT031 |	And optimize
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:16,608	| IOT031 |	The lightning function as well as energy
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:17,632	| IOT031 |	And we typically say
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:21,728	| IOT031 |	About two-thirds 67% of the energy
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:28,128	| IOT031 |	It is used before we install the network we reduce 67% of the light energy used in buildings
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:34,528	| IOT031 |	Typically it is that because you transfer in addition to doing the sensors and all the benefits that provides you also do an
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:35,552	| IOT031 |	LED instead of
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:36,832	| IOT031 |	Incandescent light
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:41,952	| IOT031 |	Looking really interesting you get a kind of a double whammy typically in a typical installation
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,720	| IOT031 |	Is
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:49,120	| IOT031 |	You'll get about two-thirds of the reduction of whatever the energy whatever lighting that you put in once you install
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:49,888	| IOT031 |	Are censored
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:51,936	| IOT031 |	But most most of the time
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:55,264	| IOT031 |	We actually put in LEDs at the same time you get even
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,544	| IOT031 |	Morning savings
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:28:00,384	| IOT031 |	Because of this is a savings you get from the LED so there's kind of the two factors
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:02,176	| IOT031 |	There's going for fluorescence
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:08,064	| IOT031 |	Two LEDs that gives you savings and then there is the savings you get by putting in our senses which takes it even father
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:12,416	| IOT031 |	Okay and Those sensors were going to tell you a little bit I'm sure
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:14,720	| IOT031 |	About some of the things that Those sensors and Evil
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:15,744	| IOT031 |	So
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:18,560	| IOT031 |	Couple things were going to talk about today which is
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:20,352	| IOT031 |	You guys have a brand new deal
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:22,144	| IOT031 |	We're not going to go too much into that
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:24,192	| IOT031 |	But it'll be a good kind of example of
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:28,288	| IOT031 |	What you guys can do and then I want to talk about financing
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:30,336	| IOT031 |	Because you have a really cool model so
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,128	| IOT031 |	As a use case
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:38,528	| IOT031 |	Let's talk about jll facilities management company in your two new apps because this will give people a really clear understanding
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:41,856	| IOT031 |	Standing of how you guys kind of get the savings and what you do
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,136	| IOT031 |	For a customer
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:49,024	| IOT031 |	Yeah exactly I think it's it kind of tells the whole story so the sensor Network that we put in
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:51,840	| IOT031 |	Is really about Gathering data
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:54,144	| IOT031 |	On the entire building
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:58,496	| IOT031 |	Obviously the lighting in it but also the temperature
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:02,848	| IOT031 |	And then everything going on inside the building all the human activity
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:03,616	| IOT031 |	People
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:05,408	| IOT031 |	Assets equipment so
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:07,456	| IOT031 |	The sensors are being put in
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:08,224	| IOT031 |	Not
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:09,248	| IOT031 |	Just to control lighting
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:14,112	| IOT031 |	Lightning is just a very small subset of what the data that you get from the Sun
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:14,880	| IOT031 |	Duke
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:19,232	| IOT031 |	This isn't this information your gathering on the building the building environment can be used
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:20,512	| IOT031 |	For all kinds of things
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:23,328	| IOT031 |	Yes lighting this is a great first application
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:28,960	| IOT031 |	And it's wonderful because we save so much energy that is essentially cost justifies the installation of the net
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:35,360	| IOT031 |	But once you get that sensor Network any build other applicants. That's exactly what we are announcing today
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,640	| IOT031 |	Is the first
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:37,408	| IOT031 |	Public Announcement
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:39,968	| IOT031 |	Other half
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:46,112	| IOT031 |	Which is our application which allows you to control your HVAC system using this data
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:51,488	| IOT031 |	In space which is a tool that enables people typically real estate real estate management people
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:54,816	| IOT031 |	To manage their space and figure out how well or
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:56,352	| IOT031 |	Hopefully it is utilized
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:58,656	| IOT031 |	Okay so are is
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:01,472	| IOT031 |	Dive out there other companies who
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:04,800	| IOT031 |	Do Air Management there's like building robotics is kind of
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:06,848	| IOT031 |	Lets people control their own air
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:11,200	| IOT031 |	Kind of temperature controls now this is measuring temperature up at the lighting level
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,736	| IOT031 |	And
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:14,272	| IOT031 |	It's basically saying hey
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:16,064	| IOT031 |	Your cooling an area right now
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:18,624	| IOT031 |	The people aren't in and that's where the savings come in
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:22,976	| IOT031 |	Connor different ways you can save energy in HVAC
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:24,000	| IOT031 |	Systems just like
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:26,304	| IOT031 |	Lady one of them is what you said
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:27,328	| IOT031 |	Around
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:30,656	| IOT031 |	Drunk me I'm cool and beat the heck out of the states
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:32,448	| IOT031 |	Because it scares that worthwhile attempt
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,728	| IOT031 |	And let's talk about
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,264	| IOT031 |	Space
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:36,544	| IOT031 |	So you have
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:38,336	| IOT031 |	In addition to are you have space What is
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:46,528	| IOT031 |	So this is really interesting to get a whole different now
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,296	| IOT031 |	Energy-savings
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:49,856	| IOT031 |	Kitchen lighting in HVAC
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:53,696	| IOT031 |	Is giving real estate people in space planners as they're described
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:55,488	| IOT031 |	The ability to
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:56,768	| IOT031 |	Real time
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:57,792	| IOT031 |	All the time
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:31:00,096	| IOT031 |	Exactly how their facilities being used
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:04,192	| IOT031 |	How many people are in every single space every single minute of the day
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:11,360	| IOT031 |	But no such data exist today
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:13,920	| IOT031 |	When you talk to those people about the day-to-day use
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:17,248	| IOT031 |	They actually use about two things they never one batch data
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:18,784	| IOT031 |	Did the person come to work
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:20,576	| IOT031 |	If you have no idea where they are
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:25,184	| IOT031 |	Then the second thing they do is they do study for people walk around
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:28,768	| IOT031 |	Literally either with no tags or the beginning of a nation is with an iPad
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:33,632	| IOT031 |	And then you go into each room and area and count the number of people at a certain time of day
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:34,144	| IOT031 |	I keep walking
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:42,080	| IOT031 |	That's the day that they use a one-time event of someone walking around the county people
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:42,848	| IOT031 |	What you say
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:44,128	| IOT031 |	Breezy inaccurate sister
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:51,296	| IOT031 |	Have the actual real time Dairy all the time every single day
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:55,904	| IOT031 |	There's a gigantic leap in the information they can use for planning their space are there real estate
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:59,744	| IOT031 |	Buescher in once you have this and you start looking at this
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:01,536	| IOT031 |	You can take it a step further and
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:06,144	| IOT031 |	Well you can kind of put the space planners possibly out of a job bye-bye
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:09,472	| IOT031 |	I starting to recommend things to
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,776	| IOT031 |	Space planners or
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,288	| IOT031 |	People like
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:13,568	| IOT031 |	Oh
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:14,592	| IOT031 |	For a
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:16,384	| IOT031 |	White-collar consulting firm
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:18,688	| IOT031 |	In this type of Sophos setup
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:20,992	| IOT031 |	This is the amount of space you need
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:27,392	| IOT031 |	Yes but you know what the interesting thing is all the space planners absolutely love
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:28,416	| IOT031 |	This capability
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:33,280	| IOT031 |	And I get on their passionate about it when they see this week we've been in beta for
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:34,816	| IOT031 |	Almost a year with a lot of
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:35,328	| IOT031 |	Customers
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:39,424	| IOT031 |	It when they see the Olympics
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:40,192	| IOT031 |	And playing with it
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:47,872	| IOT031 |	Mitsubishi
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:50,688	| IOT031 |	If you been in space By Any professional your whole life
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,480	| IOT031 |	You get an instinct
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:56,832	| IOT031 |	Thanks you have a feeling about what you smell use not well used what the needs are
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:59,392	| IOT031 |	And he said it so we have no idea who that by the way
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:00,672	| IOT031 |	Your product
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:02,464	| IOT031 |	It's great that you weigh more
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:06,304	| IOT031 |	A whole nother level
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:08,608	| IOT031 |	We actually have a decent idea about
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:11,424	| IOT031 |	States that are grossly underutilized
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:19,104	| IOT031 |	Comedians and we talked to
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:24,480	| IOT031 |	Put these two different floors and buildings together and save a whole bunch of a real estate rental or whatever
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:25,504	| IOT031 |	And up
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:28,320	| IOT031 |	It happens is he getting a meeting
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,344	| IOT031 |	And it's all politics
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:35,744	| IOT031 |	Is that some corporate vice president with the Henderson group or general manager that's a bunch of baloney
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:41,888	| IOT031 |	You know my guys know we have just barely in a space we can't cut down you don't want to ruin people's productivity and janz connect
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:47,776	| IOT031 |	The problem in this business is it's never been data-driven
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:49,568	| IOT031 |	To have the data
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:52,896	| IOT031 |	Show people and make a data-driven in fact
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:55,712	| IOT031 |	Is a true Revolution it's what we've been waiting for our whole life
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:59,040	| IOT031 |	Okay and that makes sense that a lot of things
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:00,576	| IOT031 |	I think
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:03,648	| IOT031 |	Being data-driven is going to change a lot of them
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:05,184	| IOT031 |	Discussions and
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:09,792	| IOT031 |	Want to see how it really affects the people who are working there maybe it won't
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:15,424	| IOT031 |	You find about this is that
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:17,216	| IOT031 |	Misconception
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:18,752	| IOT031 |	You're one of the things you find
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:21,312	| IOT031 |	If you're coming out next year with a product run conference
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:22,592	| IOT031 |	Conference
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:23,616	| IOT031 |	Dirty test
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:24,128	| IOT031 |	Real estate
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:35,904	| IOT031 |	The truth is when you look at the actual data
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:37,952	| IOT031 |	That's usually not true
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:41,280	| IOT031 |	The conference rooms actually aren't that well utilized
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:45,888	| IOT031 |	What is really going on
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:46,656	| IOT031 |	And
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:47,680	| IOT031 |	The problem is
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:51,008	| IOT031 |	Didn't order to manage conference rooms people set of bookends
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:57,408	| IOT031 |	And then what people do in order to make sure they have a room is they overbook and of course that creates more of a book
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:02,016	| IOT031 |	Conference rooms look like
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:03,808	| IOT031 |	Brookings or that they might be
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:05,600	| IOT031 |	No we don't have enough conference rooms
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:07,904	| IOT031 |	But when you actually look at how they're used
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:11,232	| IOT031 |	They may have to use 25 or 30% of the time
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:13,792	| IOT031 |	So you have to have a tool to give the feedback
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:16,352	| IOT031 |	It says he opens up let someone else use
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:23,264	| IOT031 |	Example of what you can do when you're actually have the day off but I'll tell you over all looking at
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:26,592	| IOT031 |	Hundreds of thousands of square feet of
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:28,128	| IOT031 |	Space now that we look at
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:34,016	| IOT031 |	I've never seen a floor or a space that didn't have at least
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:38,368	| IOT031 |	20% opportunity for improvement in efficiency in those areas
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:42,720	| IOT031 |	Or you just have a ton of wasted space and even places where people
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:44,000	| IOT031 |	Stop the company said
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:47,072	| IOT031 |	I thought this was a pretty good shape but when I see the data
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:47,584	| IOT031 |	I realize that
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:52,704	| IOT031 |	We'll have to see I'm I'm curious Lake
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:58,080	| IOT031 |	You don't have in common areas or even just having kind of a vacant area where you can like
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:01,664	| IOT031 |	Momentarily go to rest in the value there
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:03,712	| IOT031 |	I have no idea what we'll have to see
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:08,320	| IOT031 |	Cuz your point is
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:10,880	| IOT031 |	Really interesting cuz there's another group
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:12,672	| IOT031 |	Maybe a different approach
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:16,768	| IOT031 |	People who tried to reinvent the workspace
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:17,792	| IOT031 |	Just as you described
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:19,584	| IOT031 |	Where you have
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:23,936	| IOT031 |	It's been having your cure your office in the strict area that you're supposed to be working in
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:29,568	| IOT031 |	Mix it up a bit more common areas for working anywhere open areas in public areas for
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:34,176	| IOT031 |	I'll make a little bit more relaxed environment you can collaborate
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,968	| IOT031 |	Etcetera
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:40,320	| IOT031 |	The interesting thing is that the people that are trying to build those kinds of work space
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:42,112	| IOT031 |	Love to stay tattoo
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:44,672	| IOT031 |	Because it tells of the kids some feedback
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:46,208	| IOT031 |	Is it really work
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:49,536	| IOT031 |	What is the culture change were trying to effect actually
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:50,816	| IOT031 |	Doing anything
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:56,704	| IOT031 |	Exactly and I won't need the name of the company but we had a recent experience where
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:58,496	| IOT031 |	One of the people here just
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:36:59,776	| IOT031 |	Implemented
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:02,336	| IOT031 |	What are these new workspaces in the building
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:05,920	| IOT031 |	Running into the building
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:07,968	| IOT031 |	Can I see it though
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:08,736	| IOT031 |	Show them the data
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:11,808	| IOT031 |	And he looks at it and literally in 6
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:12,832	| IOT031 |	60 seconds he went
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:13,600	| IOT031 |	It's not working
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:20,768	| IOT031 |	You said it's not working I can tell looking at the flow in the traffic patterns and what's happening here this is not what we intended
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:24,352	| IOT031 |	And the question is is it because we didn't educate people
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:30,496	| IOT031 |	We didn't tell them you know how it was to be utilizing what the opportunities were or is it just designed Willie and so
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:35,360	| IOT031 |	She got real time data for the first time that we instead of anecdotal or subjective
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:38,944	| IOT031 |	She could look at it and instantly see it wasn't what they could plan
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:42,528	| IOT031 |	Wow bummer for him and
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:44,320	| IOT031 |	What a cool opportunity to be like
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:46,368	| IOT031 |	Hey now we can try
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:49,184	| IOT031 |	And this is this is kind of the cool thing about the Internet of Things
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:54,560	| IOT031 |	And if it works for everything is when you have real-time data you can Implement changes
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:57,120	| IOT031 |	And see if they're working like
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:59,680	| IOT031 |	Instantly and you don't have to wait
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:01,216	| IOT031 |	You know
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:06,848	| IOT031 |	4 weeks or months you can actually make small changes and iterate very quickly
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:09,920	| IOT031 |	And things is largest you know changing your company's culture
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:12,224	| IOT031 |	Which I think is really
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:12,992	| IOT031 |	Really powerful
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:17,088	| IOT031 |	It strikes
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:21,184	| IOT031 |	People I think intuitively think the Internet of Things is a big deal and it is
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:26,048	| IOT031 |	We just have to find those applications and places where it is at the theaters
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:28,608	| IOT031 |	Just what you described as what people found
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:31,424	| IOT031 |	When people went to internet via level of marketing
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:33,216	| IOT031 |	Websites you could change
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:34,496	| IOT031 |	How you approach to the cast
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:41,408	| IOT031 |	Tons of experiments
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:43,968	| IOT031 |	The same things possible with the internet
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:45,504	| IOT031 |	More Realty
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:46,784	| IOT031 |	Experimentation
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:48,320	| IOT031 |	Truly database with quick
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:50,624	| IOT031 |	Turn around bright eyes a b testing in the real world
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:53,440	| IOT031 |	And be like okay guy
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:58,560	| IOT031 |	Change something this weekend he do make a great catch a case study for you later on
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:38:59,840	| IOT031 |	Okay
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:00,864	| IOT031 |	So let's talk
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:01,888	| IOT031 |	About
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:03,936	| IOT031 |	You guys and
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:06,752	| IOT031 |	You did something very cool probably
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:10,080	| IOT031 |	I'm guessing about two years ago now when you came into the company
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:11,616	| IOT031 |	Because
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:13,152	| IOT031 |	Your product is not cheap
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:16,736	| IOT031 |	And you had a really tough time
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:18,272	| IOT031 |	Selling it
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:21,856	| IOT031 |	Two companies not because they didn't see the value in what you were doing but because it
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:24,928	| IOT031 |	It's expensive to retrofit your buildings and
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:25,952	| IOT031 |	As you put it
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:27,488	| IOT031 |	Facilities management
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:30,048	| IOT031 |	That is not a budget line item that gets a lot of love
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:35,168	| IOT031 |	I think you put it a little bit more
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:36,704	| IOT031 |	A little differently but we won't do that because
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:44,384	| IOT031 |	Facilities Management so you guys built a really cool product
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:48,224	| IOT031 |	I say it's really cool because I'm a finance keep but I'd love for you to talk about
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:48,736	| IOT031 |	What you guys do
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:54,368	| IOT031 |	No you hit it on the head I got when I got to the company you see this
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:54,880	| IOT031 |	You put in the SEC
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:59,744	| IOT031 |	Energy transfer itself
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:00,512	| IOT031 |	And so then
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:05,888	| IOT031 |	Turn off the shelves was the first clue
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,424	| IOT031 |	Is an ass
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:12,800	| IOT031 |	Buildings done....
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:17,664	| IOT031 |	And it's right there the problem
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:21,248	| IOT031 |	It was a hundred companies which for a young company with a lot of company
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:22,784	| IOT031 |	One building
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:27,392	| IOT031 |	There's one company with a hundred buildings and 19 between 2 and 8
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:33,280	| IOT031 |	And so clearly we weren't moving from one to two to three buildings quickly
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:36,864	| IOT031 |	Problem do people not like it is their nose or some tissue
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:38,144	| IOT031 |	Not at all the issue
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:40,192	| IOT031 |	If it was just what you said
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:41,984	| IOT031 |	It was the capital Lobster
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:44,288	| IOT031 |	Every single building
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:45,824	| IOT031 |	Costas decided as you said
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:54,784	| IOT031 |	A couple of dollars a square foot to do this kind of
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:57,856	| IOT031 |	And the Capital Equipment
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:41:00,416	| IOT031 |	Approval or priority inside companies
EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:05,792	| IOT031 |	Facilities as pretty much at the bottom of the barrel they don't get a lot of love I think it's a great description
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:08,352	| IOT031 |	How do you solve that problem
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:11,680	| IOT031 |	Will they want someone company which was AT&T
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:16,288	| IOT031 |	And that's where the problems have been solved
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:19,360	| IOT031 |	At least the seeds of the problem had been solved
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:25,760	| IOT031 |	They are we did something that we now call the go model for financing or it's really a business model
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:27,552	| IOT031 |	AT&T
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:28,832	| IOT031 |	What's exactly is Experian
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:31,648	| IOT031 |	Solder technology thought it was wonderful
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:32,928	| IOT031 |	Went to go get it done
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:39,072	| IOT031 |	And realize in the process o my God I will be retired by the time I get 20 buildings. It's just going to be
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:40,352	| IOT031 |	Arduous
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:43,424	| IOT031 |	Crazy process to get approval building by building
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:44,448	| IOT031 |	And the issue is
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:50,080	| IOT031 |	We got to get over that hurdle and so that person at AT&T
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:52,384	| IOT031 |	In a couple of people at
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:54,175	| IOT031 |	Ablation invented this year model
EDL	00:41:54,687	00:41:56,735	| IOT031 |	Adagio model in its ultimate
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:58,783	| IOT031 |	The simplest way maybe to describe it
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:01,343	| IOT031 |	It's like SolarCity for company
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:05,439	| IOT031 |	Yeoman SolarCity going to come to your house or any of its brethren
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:07,743	| IOT031 |	SolarCity comes to your house
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:09,791	| IOT031 |	You don't have to cough up a single penny
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:12,863	| IOT031 |	It'll take out gather alone without any money
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:18,239	| IOT031 |	They come there they designed they install the solar panel system
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:19,519	| IOT031 |	And all you have to do is
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:26,687	| IOT031 |	And that's what I go model is for corporations
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:28,479	| IOT031 |	Around the energy Savings in lighting
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:30,271	| IOT031 |	So we come into the company
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:36,671	| IOT031 |	We say hey look we're going to all of that
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:39,231	| IOT031 |	Impinge your balance sheet 1iota
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:45,375	| IOT031 |	And you start getting the Energy savings right away and share at the beginning to get party Energy savings of course
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:48,191	| IOT031 |	Your tire price of God
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:51,263	| IOT031 |	Of the design installation and maintenance of this
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:52,287	| IOT031 |	Yeah censor net worth
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:58,175	| IOT031 |	At the end of the term of the contract issues anywhere between three and the longest we've ever done is 10 years
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:43:02,527	| IOT031 |	The customer gets all the savings and so this is a capital freeway
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:08,415	| IOT031 |	How people get all they sensor networks installed and have their entire portfolio real estate
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:08,927	| IOT031 |	Become
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:09,951	| IOT031 |	Smart building
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:11,231	| IOT031 |	3D sensor Network
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:13,279	| IOT031 |	Paid for by the Energy savings
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:14,303	| IOT031 |	Finance
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:18,399	| IOT031 |	To our vehicle legal range for the financing just like SolarCity
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:23,007	| IOT031 |	And how many other customers have you added since been doing
EDL	00:43:24,031	00:43:27,871	| IOT031 |	So we have a starting at the end of the last year
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:29,919	| IOT031 |	So at the end of 2014
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:31,967	| IOT031 |	Change the focus of the company
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:35,039	| IOT031 |	Hayirli to focus a direct sales on Justice
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:36,063	| IOT031 |	Geocel
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:39,903	| IOT031 |	Portfolio selling
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:42,207	| IOT031 |	Not interested
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:44,255	| IOT031 |	Still it's not the right match with what we're doing
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:48,351	| IOT031 |	AT&T at the end of last year we batted so far this year six
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:49,887	| IOT031 |	New jio customer
EDL	00:43:50,399	00:43:52,191	| IOT031 |	Gone for the portfolio wide
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:52,959	| IOT031 |	Approach
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:57,311	| IOT031 |	An interesting discussion today about errands
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:58,079	| IOT031 |	Space
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:44:00,895	| IOT031 |	Is that when you go in and you talk
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:03,967	| IOT031 |	First of all those decisions have to be made at a sea level
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:04,991	| IOT031 |	It's released
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:08,575	| IOT031 |	The CFO the CEO of the clo
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:10,367	| IOT031 |	Administrative officer
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:13,439	| IOT031 |	Potentially sometimes the general manager is someone at that level
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:14,463	| IOT031 |	Who's looking at coffee
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:15,487	| IOT031 |	Tire Company
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:17,791	| IOT031 |	Tire real estate portfolio
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:19,583	| IOT031 |	And that person typically
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:21,887	| IOT031 |	Excited is one of the application
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:27,007	| IOT031 |	You're so most recently I was with the CFO of Fortune 20 company

EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:46,207	| IOT031 |	It's been very much
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:49,535	| IOT031 |	Partition done building by Building Group by Group by area
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:51,583	| IOT031 |	And we've got to get our arms around that
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:57,983	| IOT031 |	And we need the data I want that data on every single building so I have an ability to manage everything I want all night
