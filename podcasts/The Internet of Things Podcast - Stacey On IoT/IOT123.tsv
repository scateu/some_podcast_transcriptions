EDL	00:00:06,656	00:00:11,776	| IOT123 |	Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:00:11,776	00:00:12,800	| IOT123 |	This is your house
EDL	00:00:12,800	00:00:14,848	| IOT123 |	Stacey Higginbotham and this is our co-host
EDL	00:00:15,360	00:00:15,872	| IOT123 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:16,384	00:00:20,992	| IOT123 |	We have got an amazing show for you today we're going to focus on Defcon hacks
EDL	00:00:21,504	00:00:23,296	| IOT123 |	We've got questions about how
EDL	00:00:23,808	00:00:26,112	| IOT123 |	I could driving is going to work we got a bunch of news bit
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:28,416	| IOT123 |	Including week being sold
EDL	00:00:28,416	00:00:30,208	| IOT123 |	To William
EDL	00:00:30,208	00:00:32,768	| IOT123 |	We got a Q&A from one of our readers
EDL	00:00:32,768	00:00:35,840	| IOT123 |	And we're going to highlight and improbable iot product
EDL	00:00:35,840	00:00:36,864	| IOT123 |	This week because
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:40,448	| IOT123 |	It's really improbable and after all of that
EDL	00:00:40,960	00:00:44,032	| IOT123 |	We will have a message from our sponsor Hyksos Solutions
EDL	00:00:44,544	00:00:45,312	| IOT123 |	I want to hear about them
EDL	00:00:46,592	00:00:52,736	| IOT123 |	Our Guest this week is Sam George who's in charge of Microsoft Azure iot efforts
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:57,344	| IOT123 |	About a lot of industrial and Enterprise iot
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:00:58,112	| IOT123 |	Information
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:00:58,880	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:01:01,184	| IOT123 |	Stick around for all of that and now
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:07,584	| IOT123 |	Another one of our sponsors this week and they are launching their
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:13,984	| IOT123 |	2nd generation mesh wi-fi system these new aero systems contain one
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:17,056	| IOT123 |	KIRO that is in the older square shape
EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:20,640	| IOT123 |	And when did you begin switch are mesh access points
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:27,040	| IOT123 |	They also have cool features like a night like they're smaller and you can put them just about anywhere you just plug
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:29,856	| IOT123 |	Right in there is no pork
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:36,000	| IOT123 |	You will also be able to buy individually rozar begins to add to your current system they are fully backwards compatible
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:37,536	| IOT123 |	So for example I spend
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:43,936	| IOT123 |	$149 and I bought additional Beacon to put in my hallway to improve cover
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:47,520	| IOT123 |	Average for my Wi-Fi doorbells because they needed it
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:51,360	| IOT123 |	So the original system containing one zero and two beacons
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:57,760	| IOT123 |	Starts at the 399 again this is for people who are in the market for a mesh wi-fi system
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:02:04,160	| IOT123 |	I have one I have the Eros I have loved them for a long time and the new system is faster so
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:10,560	| IOT123 |	You may want to start adding New pieces I don't know what I like about them it's just so easy to extend your mesh Network
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:13,376	| IOT123 |	So you can see just like you said saw them into an outlet
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:15,680	| IOT123 |	And boom got insulin coverage
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:17,984	| IOT123 |	Cuz you got backwards compatibility if you have the old Euro
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:24,896	| IOT123 |	So if you are interested you can go to www Eero that is eat
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:27,200	| IOT123 |	Ero.com
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:33,600	| IOT123 |	And with this code Stacy and I encourage
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:35,392	| IOT123 |	Go out
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:41,792	| IOT123 |	Grab some of these and tell them that we sent you all right
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:42,304	| IOT123 |	Back to the show
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:50,496	| IOT123 |	Lots of hacking to talk about
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,032	| IOT123 |	Besides
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:52,544	| IOT123 |	Actually
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,360	| IOT123 |	Big hacking conference in Las Vegas
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:58,432	| IOT123 |	And we learned a lot of things
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,456	| IOT123 |	Such as
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:01,248	| IOT123 |	I think we learned about the Amazon Echo getting hacked
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,808	| IOT123 |	I don't know if that happened at Defcon but
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:06,368	| IOT123 |	It was definite there's always a lot of Newsroom
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:10,208	| IOT123 |	Yeah it happened around the same time as death, don't think it happened
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,256	| IOT123 |	During the fire at Defcon but
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,280	| IOT123 |	This is
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:19,680	| IOT123 |	At first it's concerning but it's a little less concerning once I explain what the heck actually is and what it takes
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:23,008	| IOT123 |	Actually a security researcher has been able to
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,032	| IOT123 |	Show
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:26,080	| IOT123 |	That he can take over
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:29,920	| IOT123 |	The microphone of Amazon Echo not an echo dot or an echo
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:34,016	| IOT123 |	How are you going to vacuum the only on the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:34,784	| IOT123 |	The original one
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:35,808	| IOT123 |	And
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:42,208	| IOT123 |	He can listen in and have the audio that it captures sent to a server Elser and you don't even know
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:43,744	| IOT123 |	Now
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:45,792	| IOT123 |	Again that sounds concerning and it should be
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,072	| IOT123 |	However
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:52,448	| IOT123 |	Newer Echoes are not affected by the hack so if you have an echo
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:54,240	| IOT123 |	Check and see the
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:04:00,384	| IOT123 |	That is packaging with the device itself and if there's a 2017 on it and the model number and ending in 02
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,920	| IOT123 |	It is not vulnerable
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:03,712	| IOT123 |	Anything else he's vulnerable
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:05,504	| IOT123 |	However
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,528	| IOT123 |	To actually
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,296	| IOT123 |	Implemented
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:09,856	| IOT123 |	He or somebody would need to
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:14,976	| IOT123 |	To have physical access to your Echo and we need some time to manipulate the files on it
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:18,559	| IOT123 |	There's a root exploit that he would need to use
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:21,119	| IOT123 |	So if nobody's coming out of your house
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:26,495	| IOT123 |	Oh my God it's like it's like the 21st century version of like having the Russian spies come in and plug your place
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:27,775	| IOT123 |	There you go
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,311	| IOT123 |	There you go
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:30,335	| IOT123 |	Dapsone
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,871	| IOT123 |	I would say
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:35,967	| IOT123 |	Fret too much about this I don't know if Amazon can actually fix this with
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:40,831	| IOT123 |	A firmware update though that's that's the more concerning parked me some the older Echoes witch
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,623	| IOT123 |	Mine was bought by
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:46,975	| IOT123 |	Before this year's I'm sure it's vulnerable and Stacey I'm sure yours is to
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:48,767	| IOT123 |	Mine was first off the line
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:51,583	| IOT123 |	Yeah I'm not sure that can be fixed
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:52,863	| IOT123 |	I'm okay with that
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:53,887	| IOT123 |	I figured
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:56,447	| IOT123 |	So in addition to
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:58,751	| IOT123 |	Your Amazon Echo could be hacked freakout
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:04,639	| IOT123 |	We also have car washes could be hacked this is actually from Defcon and
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,919	| IOT123 |	These researchers
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,199	| IOT123 |	Showed that
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:09,503	| IOT123 |	They could find access to automatic
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:12,063	| IOT123 |	Car washes online I bet they're using chaudin
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,111	| IOT123 |	To be honest it what happened is
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:16,159	| IOT123 |	They can find these car washes
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:23,071	| IOT123 |	And they could gain control of them lock a vehicle in them and then beat the vehicle with the robotic washing arm
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:27,167	| IOT123 |	That's very it is a very scary thing to have happen I am sure
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:31,263	| IOT123 |	But the reason this is happening is because
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:37,151	| IOT123 |	These car washes are online and they didn't change the password so like if you own a car wash
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:40,991	| IOT123 |	And you invested in the automated thing maybe change your password
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,271	| IOT123 |	That's going to help a lot
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,807	| IOT123 |	Which then brings us
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,087	| IOT123 |	2
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:50,975	| IOT123 |	Oh my God it's 2017 and we're still having to tell people to change their password but maybe next year we won't
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:54,559	| IOT123 |	Because there is new iot security legislation
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,351	| IOT123 |	Proposed Hindi
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:57,887	| IOT123 |	Send it
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:05:59,935	| IOT123 |	Go Far Kid
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:05,055	| IOT123 |	I wonder if they're listening to us because I think it's the last two or three episodes we've been
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,079	| IOT123 |	Talking about
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:08,895	| IOT123 |	Potential consumer protection legislation for
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,407	| IOT123 |	Smart devices
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:10,431	| IOT123 |	And
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:17,343	| IOT123 |	This is a step is a baby step in and there's no guarantees that the legislation is going to pass but it wouldn't surprise
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,879	| IOT123 |	Crazy because it's very minimal
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,183	| IOT123 |	What is a bipartisan legislation
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:27,583	| IOT123 |	That would prohibit vendors from offering up devices that have unchangeable password switch
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:30,655	| IOT123 |	It's good you should be able to change your password if you purchase something
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:33,983	| IOT123 |	And or possess known security vulnerabilities
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:39,871	| IOT123 |	I dread that separate article about this aside from the Reuters one that I'm looking at right now and I believe it said
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,919	| IOT123 |	It would also
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:45,247	| IOT123 |	Require the devices to be firmware updatable
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,271	| IOT123 |	Remotely
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:46,783	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:48,063	| IOT123 |	Again
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:50,111	| IOT123 |	That's kind of a given her mostly
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:52,927	| IOT123 |	Devices today but still
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:59,327	| IOT123 |	Tire vendors that provide internet connected equipment to the US government to ensure their products are patchable Income form
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,095	| IOT123 |	Industries
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:06,495	| IOT123 |	Well G look look out for the government not for the people
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:08,031	| IOT123 |	Allows federal agencies
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:11,359	| IOT123 |	Ask the US Office of the OMB Office of Management and budget
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:15,199	| IOT123 |	Buy non-compliant devices
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:18,527	| IOT123 |	If other controls such as Network segmentation
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:22,879	| IOT123 |	So most of these I'm like wow this is like the bare minimum it doesn't hurt
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:26,719	| IOT123 |	It does expand
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:30,303	| IOT123 |	Directions for cyber researchers who are working in good faith to hack
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:33,375	| IOT123 |	Which is a big deal because
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:36,959	| IOT123 |	You know I don't know if you guys remember but Oracle used to sue hackers
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:37,727	| IOT123 |	Like all the time
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,263	| IOT123 |	Regretted
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:41,311	| IOT123 |	There's this whole kind of idea
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:45,663	| IOT123 |	I don't know if these are controversial still that they used to be because people would be like
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:48,991	| IOT123 |	Why don't you just tell us where
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,015	| IOT123 |	King of Thieves hacked
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:51,551	| IOT123 |	Why do we have to pay you
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:54,367	| IOT123 |	In kind of felt a little extortionist
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:55,647	| IOT123 |	2 News
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:08:00,511	| IOT123 |	It's a good incentive though it is it's actually one of the things I tell people to look for
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:04,607	| IOT123 |	If you're going to buy a connected home product or a connected device
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:09,215	| IOT123 |	Look for companies that have bug bounties because it does mean that they are serious about
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:11,007	| IOT123 |	More serious about security
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:19,199	| IOT123 |	J4 getting on board I would like to see consumer protections I would like to see the FTC and able to expand consumer
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,223	| IOT123 |	Productions in this area
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,527	| IOT123 |	This looks like it's only the
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,087	| IOT123 |	Yeah I think you're right
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,367	| IOT123 |	But it's a start
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:31,487	| IOT123 |	So you know who knows if we're going to get anything passed Congress has been kind of
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:32,767	| IOT123 |	Analysts call it divided
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:39,679	| IOT123 |	This is legislation in the Senate they're going to introduce similar legislation in the house will have to happen is they're going to talk about it send it to committee
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:41,727	| IOT123 |	If it makes it out of committee
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:44,543	| IOT123 |	Hold on versions of it who knows what else will get stuck in there
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,079	| IOT123 |	And then maybe
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:46,591	| IOT123 |	Maybe it will
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,663	| IOT123 |	There's a lot left
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,199	| IOT123 |	So it may dying
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,527	| IOT123 |	Haley StarTalk
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,319	| IOT123 |	Yep
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,343	| IOT123 |	Let's move on to other
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,903	| IOT123 |	Specifically how are
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:00,415	| IOT123 |	Cars
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:01,439	| IOT123 |	Talk to them
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:02,975	| IOT123 |	What will they talk
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:10,655	| IOT123 |	Well I remember way back when you and I were for gigaom I remember our colleague Katie foreign-backed listen to a bunch
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:12,703	| IOT123 |	To research and stories on cars
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,239	| IOT123 |	Using a specific
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:17,567	| IOT123 |	Wi-Fi protocol to talk to each other member that
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,615	| IOT123 |	Yes it was the vehicle to vehicle
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:20,127	| IOT123 |	Communication
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:22,943	| IOT123 |	I don't remember which
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:29,855	| IOT123 |	80802 something something I don't remember but obviously since then
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,647	| IOT123 |	345 years ago since then
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,183	| IOT123 |	Autonomous vehicles
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,207	| IOT123 |	Have really
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:37,535	| IOT123 |	Jose taken off you know there's a lot of momentum in that area
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:38,559	| IOT123 |	Which is awesome
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:44,703	| IOT123 |	But there's a lot of other things on the road that are not cars on the side of the road which yes
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,471	| IOT123 |	Carson see them
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,263	| IOT123 |	But you also have
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:50,079	| IOT123 |	Bicycles especially in a lot of urban areas
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:53,151	| IOT123 |	You have scooters and motorcycles so on
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:10:00,063	| IOT123 |	And none of these things talk to the cars the cars may even have problems identifying number of deserting them from pedestrians
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:04,927	| IOT123 |	So there's a researcher out of Carnegie Mellon
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:08,511	| IOT123 |	Who says hey you know cars have a regular pattern with the way they move
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:10,303	| IOT123 |	People right when people riding bicycles
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:14,399	| IOT123 |	The chain between acting like cars on side of the road or they might
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:18,495	| IOT123 |	Look up on the sidewalk
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:19,775	| IOT123 |	Journey Don't Stop at stop sign
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,823	| IOT123 |	This is true
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:23,359	| IOT123 |	I know I know I know I'm guilty
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,151	| IOT123 |	I myself am I my road bike
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:28,223	| IOT123 |	But you're actually right there they're not as predictable
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,247	| IOT123 |	As a car
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,527	| IOT123 |	When you look at it that way
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:35,647	| IOT123 |	What the researcher is doing is he actually loaded up a bicycle with lidar and radar and
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:38,207	| IOT123 |	Cameras everything else and he's trying to
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,743	| IOT123 |	Create data
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:44,095	| IOT123 |	That maybe they can add to the algorithms to the cars that say hey
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:48,191	| IOT123 |	That's really a bike and here's what you need to be careful for it may not stop at the stop sign
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,215	| IOT123 |	Everything But Water
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:54,079	| IOT123 |	You know it's not a pedestrian so it might have different rules that it has been applied to it and so on
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,615	| IOT123 |	So it's kind of interesting
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:11:02,015	| IOT123 |	I'm intrigued by this because I do ride a road cycle quite a bit I'm actually going for my motorcycle permit
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:02,783	| IOT123 |	Probably next week
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:05,599	| IOT123 |	In hopes of buying a large scooter
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:06,879	| IOT123 |	And
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:09,951	| IOT123 |	Part of me says he has a great idea but the thing is
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,999	| IOT123 |	Bicycles are not battery powered
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:16,607	| IOT123 |	And you're going to need battery power constant battery power for
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:18,399	| IOT123 |	Bikes to be able to speak to cars
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:21,215	| IOT123 |	Free sample if they want to say hey I'm over here doing come in my lane or whatever
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:23,007	| IOT123 |	And I don't know how that's going to work
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:24,799	| IOT123 |	Me either
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,079	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,639	| IOT123 |	Disappointed
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:32,479	| IOT123 |	There are lots of USB powered bike
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:32,991	| IOT123 |	Accessories
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,527	| IOT123 |	So I can see a couple
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,575	| IOT123 |	ICU addon
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,183	| IOT123 |	Very curious about
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:44,511	| IOT123 |	Like motion kinetic energy harvesting from a bike
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,535	| IOT123 |	Possible short
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:48,095	| IOT123 |	So could you power something that way
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:55,007	| IOT123 |	It's kind of got to be foolproof if for example eventually and I'm thinking far ahead here
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,031	| IOT123 |	Eventually there's a
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:59,615	| IOT123 |	Alert on your bike at says hey there's a car coming
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:02,175	| IOT123 |	Very close to you from behind or something like that you know
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,479	| IOT123 |	Is it bench I could see all the sensors that are in cars
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:06,015	| IOT123 |	Mitchell way down to
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,551	| IOT123 |	Motorcycles and bicycles
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:10,367	| IOT123 |	But the latter work you've got to have constant power
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,927	| IOT123 |	Champion sometimes I power and sometimes I don't
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:16,255	| IOT123 |	You'll have is constant power
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:17,535	| IOT123 |	From a battery
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,583	| IOT123 |	And I was just
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,631	| IOT123 |	You'll have that constant power for a set amount
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,143	| IOT123 |	Time
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:25,727	| IOT123 |	You'll be able to go on a 4-Hour bike ride with those features
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:28,799	| IOT123 |	Tonight anything else you're going to be back in the Dark Ages
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,079	| IOT123 |	This is Mike my hunch
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:31,615	| IOT123 |	I think it's think about it they had like
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:39,039	| IOT123 |	You know where they were trying to do a heads-up display that was all powered on a helmet
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:42,367	| IOT123 |	You know so that was charged and then
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,415	| IOT123 |	I don't know how long it would have lasted
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:50,815	| IOT123 |	I can see this happening I think things like electric bikes like in China right now those are surely
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:53,375	| IOT123 |	Super big so I think those kind of things might
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,143	| IOT123 |	Become part of that
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:57,471	| IOT123 |	It honestly because those are valuable safety
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:58,751	| IOT123 |	Repeaters
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:02,079	| IOT123 |	It does kind of get into this bigger discussion about
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:04,127	| IOT123 |	How will Design the roads are they
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:04,895	| IOT123 |	The future in life
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:09,247	| IOT123 |	Right away who will talk to whom in that sort of thing to think about
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,807	| IOT123 |	The rules for cars
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:12,575	| IOT123 |	Nice purses
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:19,743	| IOT123 |	Baby bikes and pedestrians insomnia
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:20,511	| IOT123 |	In terms of
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:22,815	| IOT123 |	Population
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:26,655	| IOT123 |	So cars with autonomous I'll just slow the
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,935	| IOT123 |	Cuz I have
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,471	| IOT123 |	Not your second power but
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:32,287	| IOT123 |	Add a longer battery life I can totally
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:36,895	| IOT123 |	Afford taking of slow down where's the spikes got to get where it's going so
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:37,663	| IOT123 |	Recharge
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:42,527	| IOT123 |	Right right I mean I think we're way ahead of the curve on this discussion because
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:45,087	| IOT123 |	We got to wait for all the cars become autonomous
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,367	| IOT123 |	And that's going to take time
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:47,647	| IOT123 |	And as you said
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,951	| IOT123 |	We may not we may not put
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:53,535	| IOT123 |	Maybe a Tipping Point where most of them are or something to that effect
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:57,887	| IOT123 |	Then I think it trickles down to the smaller vehicles I think we are ahead of the Curve
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:14:04,031	| IOT123 |	Related only because we talked about it last week member how we mention Google Glass making a comeback and Industrial and such
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:09,919	| IOT123 |	I'm actually thinking of on retiring my Google Glass to wear under my motorcycle helmet
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:12,223	| IOT123 |	Pacifically for a heads-up display for directions
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:19,391	| IOT123 |	Oh that feels like it was going to hurt your Bridge of your nose let me know how that works I have customized custom lenses
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:22,463	| IOT123 |	Is already inserted into custom glass frames for glasses
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:23,999	| IOT123 |	Sony came out
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:26,559	| IOT123 |	Oh yeah. Yeah you couldn't wear glasses with
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,071	| IOT123 |	But now
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,631	| IOT123 |	You can do that so
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:33,215	| IOT123 |	I look forward to hearing back from you on your both motorcycle test
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:35,519	| IOT123 |	Experiment
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,103	| IOT123 |	Let's get to the news bits portion
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:39,871	| IOT123 |	The show
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:40,895	| IOT123 |	Real quick
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:41,407	| IOT123 |	Eero
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,455	| IOT123 |	Hey we talked about them earlier
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:47,295	| IOT123 |	They are sponsored they acquired the thing to do it so last week
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:49,087	| IOT123 |	We said
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,599	| IOT123 |	Dington
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:50,623	| IOT123 |	Add shutdown
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:55,999	| IOT123 |	Kind of wanted to be an OS for the smart home well it turns out
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,815	| IOT123 |	Tom Coates and Matt Build-Off
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:02,655	| IOT123 |	T2 Founders and the only two employees I know of is
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,191	| IOT123 |	They have been
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:04,959	| IOT123 |	Aqua hired
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:09,311	| IOT123 |	And no one's talking much about what they're doing their butt
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,615	| IOT123 |	I look forward to it cuz
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:15,711	| IOT123 |	Like I said those guys are super smart and very thoughtful about living in
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:19,295	| IOT123 |	A connected home and how people interact
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:21,343	| IOT123 |	The connected home and how it's not a one-to-one
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,927	| IOT123 |	Other news tracker
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,207	| IOT123 |	Jose track r
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:28,511	| IOT123 |	The Bluetooth tracker company
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:30,559	| IOT123 |	I don't know what else to call it it helps you find yourself
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:33,119	| IOT123 |	50 million dollars
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,143	| IOT123 |	They compete with
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:35,423	| IOT123 |	Sceptile
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:40,287	| IOT123 |	I am interested in them because they have this product called tracker at
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:43,615	| IOT123 |	This is not out yet it was supposed to be out this summer so far
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:47,967	| IOT123 |	Not out yet but you plug these little plugs in there like Bluetooth
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:50,271	| IOT123 |	And they have an echo skill
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:52,575	| IOT123 |	So what happened
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:54,111	| IOT123 |	You plug the sit-in then
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:56,927	| IOT123 |	It knows what room things are in so you can say hey
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:16:00,255	| IOT123 |	Anime where is my wallet
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,023	| IOT123 |	It'll be like it is
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:01,535	| IOT123 |	Set the living room
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,095	| IOT123 |	But you know
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,143	| IOT123 |	It's great know where to start
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:11,775	| IOT123 |	I mean we'll see what happens when this product comes out of still available for pre-order as you said it's not out yet
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:14,591	| IOT123 |	But I'm scratching my head on this one because
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:21,247	| IOT123 |	I'm all for using Bluetooth as a location device I have some trackers that I purchased before SM tiles as well
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,807	| IOT123 |	But moving everything
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:25,599	| IOT123 |	To these two outlets
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:32,255	| IOT123 |	I just don't see the point of it because it really replicates what you should be able to do with your phone and a Tracker app
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:32,767	| IOT123 |	Meaning
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:35,327	| IOT123 |	You got the processing power on your phone
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:37,887	| IOT123 |	Two algorithmically figure out the
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:40,959	| IOT123 |	Signal strength of where a Bluetooth tracker is
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:43,263	| IOT123 |	And she kind of navigate you too
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:45,311	| IOT123 |	Great room without these things might
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:52,479	| IOT123 |	I think you might be right I think there might be like a Powertrain the people might be upset about also you've got to sell more Hardware
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:54,527	| IOT123 |	In the iot connected business model
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:58,879	| IOT123 |	I get the I get the business model
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:01,951	| IOT123 |	Don't know that makes sense and I would also say
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:05,279	| IOT123 |	I read about this company a couple of weeks ago it's called switch
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,047	| IOT123 |	They make Outlets
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,887	| IOT123 |	So I actually kind of like
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:14,239	| IOT123 |	One day we're going to have all of this in our outlets and by God that's going to be a beautiful day
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:16,799	| IOT123 |	Until then we may have to buy things that we
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:19,615	| IOT123 |	Plug-In or in Kevin's case we will just hope
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:20,639	| IOT123 |	What you downloaded
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:21,919	| IOT123 |	It doesn't for us
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:23,455	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:25,503	| IOT123 |	That's tracker other news
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,271	| IOT123 |	Wink
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,039	| IOT123 |	Was sold
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,575	| IOT123 |	William
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:30,879	| IOT123 |	Who is not just a rap star and
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,927	| IOT123 |	Outkast I was like
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:33,951	| IOT123 |	Not the Outlaws
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,719	| IOT123 |	Not the Fugees
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:35,999	| IOT123 |	Outkast
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:41,887	| IOT123 |	I was a member of Outkast and he also used to work for Intel as they're like creative
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:45,215	| IOT123 |	Technology Ambassador guy
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,239	| IOT123 |	It didn't go in
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:49,311	| IOT123 |	William has bought wink
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:51,103	| IOT123 |	The smart home platform
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:52,383	| IOT123 |	Flex Flex
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:54,943	| IOT123 |	Kevin
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:56,223	| IOT123 |	Is not happy
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:00,319	| IOT123 |	Did I say that out loud
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,343	| IOT123 |	Especially my inner monologue
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:03,391	| IOT123 |	Sorry about your inner monologue
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:06,463	| IOT123 |	Look I mean as a very happy wink owner
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:09,535	| IOT123 |	I mean I could have gone with a bunch of different platforms but I've
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:12,095	| IOT123 |	I'm stuck with wink because it doesn't work well for me
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:14,143	| IOT123 |	That was already sad when flexbot
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:14,911	| IOT123 |	Wink
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:18,495	| IOT123 |	Is a maiko what's going to happen now you know but everything seemed to be okay
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:22,079	| IOT123 |	And it was and now it's going to William
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:26,431	| IOT123 |	Who just my opinion does not have a very solid track record in the tech space
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:29,759	| IOT123 |	I remember when he came out with its wearable and I'm like please
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,807	| IOT123 |	Come on it was it was terrible
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:34,367	| IOT123 |	Minute you can't even get it now so
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:37,951	| IOT123 |	That tells you everything you need to know I I just I don't have confidence in
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:39,999	| IOT123 |	Disability and hopefully he's surrounded himself with
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,791	| IOT123 |	With good people
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:42,559	| IOT123 |	And
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:43,327	| IOT123 |	The wink
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,631	| IOT123 |	Hardware and services and software
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:51,519	| IOT123 |	Continue to expand but I just was not happy when I heard this news
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:56,895	| IOT123 |	Nathan Smith the former CTO a twink who is in charge of
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:00,223	| IOT123 |	He's actually gone over to Amazon
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,527	| IOT123 |	Another fellow that
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,295	| IOT123 |	I won't say his name
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,599	| IOT123 |	He's nice but he's one of the
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,111	| IOT123 |	People who
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:08,927	| IOT123 |	Have been a twink forever
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:09,695	| IOT123 |	Just left
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:10,719	| IOT123 |	For another job
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:19,679	| IOT123 |	I think we are going to have to I mean I'm willing to see but I think we might when people tell us they want a hub
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,727	| IOT123 |	We usually said if your
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:26,079	| IOT123 |	You're not really into like playing around and working real hard
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,359	| IOT123 |	Wink is the way to go
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:30,175	| IOT123 |	We may change that recommendation going
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:30,687	| IOT123 |	Forward back
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:32,991	| IOT123 |	SmartThings although it is
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:36,831	| IOT123 |	We'll talk about this in another show cuz we're running out of time but
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:39,135	| IOT123 |	It is also an indication of where the Hummer
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:40,159	| IOT123 |	It is
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,463	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:42,975	| IOT123 |	Lot's happened
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,535	| IOT123 |	Speaking up hugs
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:49,887	| IOT123 |	We asked you guys for questions and by God you delivered
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,655	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,679	| IOT123 |	We're going to take
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,447	| IOT123 |	A question
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:54,495	| IOT123 |	This week from
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,775	| IOT123 |	Tom brincefield
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:59,871	| IOT123 |	And this is a good question summarize at a little bit
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:03,199	| IOT123 |	So he's got a Google home and he is
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:05,247	| IOT123 |	Currently looking for things to automate
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:10,367	| IOT123 |	So he's got a Google home Philips Hue hubs and three color bulbs and a WeMo switch
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:11,135	| IOT123 |	Farmers porch lighting
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,183	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:14,463	| IOT123 |	He has
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:18,815	| IOT123 |	A problem though he wants to automate a fluorescent light over his kitchen sink
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:23,167	| IOT123 |	But it doesn't have a neutral wire so I can't use the WeMo switch
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:25,215	| IOT123 |	He wants is getting voice control
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:27,775	| IOT123 |	And remote control of that light
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:29,567	| IOT123 |	Second
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:35,711	| IOT123 |	He has a dumb monitor plasma TV a Samsung Blu-ray player and an older tuner that he run sound through
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:38,271	| IOT123 |	As well as the Chromecast audio for music
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,319	| IOT123 |	None of these work with voice control
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:46,207	| IOT123 |	Also is there any method that we know of that could give him the ability to turn these things on and switch some settings
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,487	| IOT123 |	Especially on the tuner
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:49,791	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:50,559	| IOT123 |	Tom
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:52,095	| IOT123 |	I feel like we got really good news for you
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,631	| IOT123 |	But it is going to cost you
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,447	| IOT123 |	That's usually how it works
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:57,727	| IOT123 |	Self
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:21:03,103	| IOT123 |	Your lighting question is so common that I actually knew automatically where to send you and
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:04,639	| IOT123 |	I did it myself
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:05,663	| IOT123 |	Sort of
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:07,455	| IOT123 |	Because
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:13,855	| IOT123 |	You want to have voice control and because you're dealing with a fluorescent which a lot of the kind of automated immersed
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:14,623	| IOT123 |	Don't
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:15,903	| IOT123 |	Fluorescence
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:18,976	| IOT123 |	I'm going to steer you to the Lutron system
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,792	| IOT123 |	For there on off switch
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:27,168	| IOT123 |	Because this is the only thing I know of that you can use without a neutral wire
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,704	| IOT123 |	It's still get voice
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:32,032	| IOT123 |	So what you're going to need in this is really important
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:35,616	| IOT123 |	Is the Lutron pd5 WS
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:38,688	| IOT123 |	/ DD / White
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:40,736	| IOT123 |	Actually the wh stands for white
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:42,528	| IOT123 |	So if you need an almond
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:46,368	| IOT123 |	But it's the Lutron PD 5ws
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:47,136	| IOT123 |	Slash TV
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:48,928	| IOT123 |	The five stamps
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:49,440	| IOT123 |	For 5 a.m.
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:52,512	| IOT123 |	And this is important because they have a 6 amp
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:55,072	| IOT123 |	26 AMP one requires a neutral wire
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:57,120	| IOT123 |	So you have to get the V amp
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:00,960	| IOT123 |	And you can order this Amazon has a really high price on it right
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:03,008	| IOT123 |	I ordered by and for
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:05,824	| IOT123 |	Like 65 Amazon bright now showing a hundred bucks for the
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,616	| IOT123 |	What you'll do is you
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,896	| IOT123 |	Pop the switch in
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:12,224	| IOT123 |	You're also going to need the Lutron Hub which is about $80
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:13,760	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:20,416	| IOT123 |	Then you got voice control of your fluorescent lights and I have mine for my under cabinet lighting
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:22,720	| IOT123 |	My husband always left on and I love it
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,512	| IOT123 |	I also have a lot of other Lutron switches
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,840	| IOT123 |	If you want to go that way
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:28,352	| IOT123 |	Go that way
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:30,656	| IOT123 |	I will tell you I am very hot
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:34,240	| IOT123 |	So that is the answer to your lighting question
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:36,800	| IOT123 |	For your television
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:37,312	| IOT123 |	Question
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:39,872	| IOT123 |	This what I thought was kind of tricky
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:42,432	| IOT123 |	But it actually wasn't
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:43,456	| IOT123 |	Stacy figure this out
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:44,992	| IOT123 |	Before the show
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,016	| IOT123 |	It looks like the
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:49,600	| IOT123 |	Only way might be to add yet another Hub and that would be the Harmony Hub
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:53,440	| IOT123 |	This is about
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:54,464	| IOT123 |	65
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,512	| IOT123 |	This is a
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,280	| IOT123 |	Little
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:58,560	| IOT123 |	I have one
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:00,864	| IOT123 |	I saw this conversation
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,936	| IOT123 |	Now before you buy it
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:06,240	| IOT123 |	You can either buy it and see if it works
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:08,544	| IOT123 |	Logitech has a list
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:13,664	| IOT123 |	Oldest tuners in stuff that support so because you didn't tell me what your tuner was I couldn't look it up
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:15,200	| IOT123 |	But but but
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:16,480	| IOT123 |	It does work with
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:17,248	| IOT123 |	Most
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:20,576	| IOT123 |	IR compatible devices yes
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:22,880	| IOT123 |	It has an eye it actually comes with a little IR blaster
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:26,208	| IOT123 |	This makes my husband go nuts
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:28,000	| IOT123 |	We had to put the
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:28,512	| IOT123 |	GoNoodle
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:31,328	| IOT123 |	It goes in our
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,352	| IOT123 |	AV cabinet
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:33,376	| IOT123 |	Under eye television
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,680	| IOT123 |	Total Wireless
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,192	| IOT123 |	Next to it
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:38,240	| IOT123 |	Because we don't have a
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:45,408	| IOT123 |	But it won't let me drill a hole in
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:45,920	| IOT123 |	I can fix that little
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:52,576	| IOT123 |	The other thing to note is for your Chromecast audio. 100% sure this is going to work
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:54,624	| IOT123 |	Kevin found
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:56,416	| IOT123 |	What did you find
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:00,000	| IOT123 |	I did find some support
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:03,840	| IOT123 |	Questions and answers about the Chromecast and Logitech Harmony Hub and
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:07,680	| IOT123 |	The only mention Chrome Cast audio which suggests to me that it does work is
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:11,520	| IOT123 |	That Harmony Logitech rather suggest you create a
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:12,544	| IOT123 |	A shortcut
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,312	| IOT123 |	2
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,080	| IOT123 |	Play music
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:18,432	| IOT123 |	And so on therefore it should work and in my opinion but it wouldn't tell you to create a shortcut
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:22,528	| IOT123 |	Chromecast audio play music if it didn't work so I suspect it does work
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:25,600	| IOT123 |	Probably support Chromecast
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:26,624	| IOT123 |	Audio it should work
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:29,440	| IOT123 |	But he has a Google home so you should be able to
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:31,488	| IOT123 |	Voice activated Chromecast audio ady
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:32,256	| IOT123 |	And control
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:34,816	| IOT123 |	Oh yes without even doing
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:37,632	| IOT123 |	I will say that I have my tuner setup
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,400	| IOT123 |	To play
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:41,472	| IOT123 |	Okay this is complicated but my Sonos goes through my tuner
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:43,264	| IOT123 |	To some of my speakers
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:47,104	| IOT123 |	I have set up a special thing
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:48,128	| IOT123 |	Special shortcut
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:49,920	| IOT123 |	Display Sonos living room
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,200	| IOT123 |	And so
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:55,552	| IOT123 |	The other nice thing is when you connect your Logitech to your Google home
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:58,624	| IOT123 |	You're going to have the option of naming the shortcut
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,904	| IOT123 |	Again for the Google
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,696	| IOT123 |	Or your Amazon Echo
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:02,464	| IOT123 |	For anyone who's
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:05,024	| IOT123 |	What do I do
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,304	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,584	| IOT123 |	Those are two things for you
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:09,376	| IOT123 |	You are going to pay
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,936	| IOT123 |	Let's see what brought it up to 280 so
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:13,216	| IOT123 |	300 box
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,008	| IOT123 |	I don't know if it's worth it
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,056	| IOT123 |	I spent
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:20,896	| IOT123 |	I have not
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:22,688	| IOT123 |	I'm crazy
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:26,272	| IOT123 |	Okay so that was a question for the week and here's our
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,296	| IOT123 |	Iot
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,576	| IOT123 |	Improbable device
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:29,600	| IOT123 |	Of the day
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:36,512	| IOT123 |	Is an Indiegogo campaign is for something called
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:37,280	| IOT123 |	Smalt
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:38,560	| IOT123 |	And Kevin
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:41,376	| IOT123 |	Would you like to tell us what the small tis
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:44,192	| IOT123 |	Yes we are talking about the small
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:46,496	| IOT123 |	Which stands for smart
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:50,080	| IOT123 |	Salt dispenser because of course everybody needs a smart
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:50,848	| IOT123 |	South
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:51,360	| IOT123 |	Dispenser
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:56,480	| IOT123 |	But it's more than just a selfish Spencer it's a centerpiece according to the Indiegogo campaign
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:58,528	| IOT123 |	You can play music through the
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:02,624	| IOT123 |	Integrated Bluetooth speaker you can set the mood with multicolored lighting
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:05,696	| IOT123 |	And of course the Spencers in any amount you please
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:07,488	| IOT123 |	I'm sorry but
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:09,792	| IOT123 |	There's just no place for Texans
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:15,168	| IOT123 |	This is going to be $99 for the super early bird special
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:17,472	| IOT123 |	But the actual price of a 199 when it hits
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:19,264	| IOT123 |	So it ships
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,056	| IOT123 |	March 28th
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:22,848	| IOT123 |	So we're going to have to wait awhile
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:25,152	| IOT123 |	I don't think it's going to shift at all
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:27,968	| IOT123 |	You're probably right my favorite part is
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:28,992	| IOT123 |	It is
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:33,088	| IOT123 |	To dispense
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:36,928	| IOT123 |	A tablespoon of salt but if you don't have an echo you can go in the app
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:37,952	| IOT123 |	Hindu gestures
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:44,608	| IOT123 |	Because I know when I'm dispensing salt
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:47,168	| IOT123 |	I really want to open my phone
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:49,728	| IOT123 |	Solutely
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,264	| IOT123 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:55,616	| IOT123 |	And I've seen decently large salt shakers before this is big
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:59,712	| IOT123 |	I'm looking at a picture of it right now and it's like a two-handed device
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:00,992	| IOT123 |	It is yeah this is
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:04,576	| IOT123 |	It looks like a slightly smaller it looks like a bigger tap
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:05,344	| IOT123 |	Actually
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,112	| IOT123 |	Yes
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:06,624	| IOT123 |	Solace
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:10,208	| IOT123 |	If you've ordered one of these sentences explain why
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,072	| IOT123 |	That is stupid
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,448	| IOT123 |	Telus
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:22,752	| IOT123 |	Why if you were one of the backers of this product
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,616	| IOT123 |	Is it

EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:55,680	| IOT123 |	Really working on cutting-edge research and development in the area of iot
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:57,728	| IOT123 |	And it's our job to put them in touch
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:02,080	| IOT123 |	And how does an engagement with haikou happen
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:02,848	| IOT123 |	How does that get started
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:04,128	| IOT123 |	Generalist
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:07,200	| IOT123 |	Peking a client is going to start with a smaller
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:09,248	| IOT123 |	Call it a pilot project
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:11,296	| IOT123 |	Where they're just going to get an opportunity
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:14,624	| IOT123 |	Is this going to be a good fit for us
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:17,696	| IOT123 |	And then really for us to why should we be working together
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:19,488	| IOT123 |	Because let's face it I can
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:21,280	| IOT123 |	Sit here and tell you how great we are in
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:24,864	| IOT123 |	Provide you with some really solid documentation that
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:29,216	| IOT123 |	It's super technical any Bill to see you like well can maybe these folks know what they're doing
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:31,520	| IOT123 |	But the reality is you need to get connected
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:35,360	| IOT123 |	And get some knowledge from them firsthand
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:37,152	| IOT123 |	Communication
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:37,920	| IOT123 |	10 strong
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:39,200	| IOT123 |	You can just
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:42,016	| IOT123 |	We want you to be comfortable knowing that you have a good partner
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:44,064	| IOT123 |	And until you interact with
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:45,600	| IOT123 |	The team that you can be working with
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:46,880	| IOT123 |	It's just really
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:49,952	| IOT123 |	Difficult to know that so you know you got a small piloting
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:51,744	| IOT123 |	This how we would get started
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:55,584	| IOT123 |	Jeremy that sounds great so how can I get in touch with haikou solution

EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:24,256	| IOT123 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:28,864	| IOT123 |	Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:33,472	| IOT123 |	Is Sam George the director of iot for Microsoft azure
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:35,008	| IOT123 |	Hi Sam how are you today
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:37,056	| IOT123 |	Great Stacy thanks for having me
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:40,640	| IOT123 |	Me and I am super excited we have had several conversations
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:41,920	| IOT123 |	And every single time
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:42,432	| IOT123 |	We have
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:47,296	| IOT123 |	Yeah I learned a lot so this time I'm excited to bring the rest of you guys listing
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,064	| IOT123 |	Along for the ride
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:49,600	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:51,648	| IOT123 |	Let's get started with
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:52,928	| IOT123 |	Conversation about
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:56,256	| IOT123 |	Iot architecture
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:56,768	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:59,584	| IOT123 |	You guys when we first talked
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:01,376	| IOT123 |	We had a big conversation
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:03,168	| IOT123 |	A couple years ago
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:04,704	| IOT123 |	You're a half ago about pain
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:07,008	| IOT123 |	A lot of happening in the cloud
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:11,104	| IOT123 |	I think you were looking at head of the middle area so not the edge but that
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:12,896	| IOT123 |	Middle Gateway area in your life
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:14,432	| IOT123 |	I don't know if I'll be there
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:15,968	| IOT123 |	And how is that change
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:16,992	| IOT123 |	Because it certainly has
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:19,040	| IOT123 |	Yeah when
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:20,576	| IOT123 |	We didn't realize
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:22,112	| IOT123 |	Really early on that
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:25,696	| IOT123 |	Is iot got going that there is going to be the Natural Balance
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:26,464	| IOT123 |	Natural
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:28,000	| IOT123 |	Equilibrium if you will
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:29,280	| IOT123 |	Between
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:31,072	| IOT123 |	Processing that happens in the cloud
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:33,120	| IOT123 |	What happens at all devices
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:38,496	| IOT123 |	And so that's always been one of that Central Central tenants
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:40,544	| IOT123 |	We were looking at
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,312	| IOT123 |	Reintroduced
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:43,360	| IOT123 |	A Gateway a c k
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,128	| IOT123 |	Last year
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:45,664	| IOT123 |	Just now
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:48,992	| IOT123 |	So you capabilities as well for a joke
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:49,504	| IOT123 |	Definitely
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:52,576	| IOT123 |	Definitely a
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:53,856	| IOT123 |	Beacon Central
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:55,392	| IOT123 |	Docker iot
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:55,904	| IOT123 |	Strategy
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:58,464	| IOT123 |	How are you guys
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:01,280	| IOT123 |	Defining the edge cuz when I think of the edge I think cloud
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:02,560	| IOT123 |	Then I think
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:06,144	| IOT123 |	Gateway that usually on-premise and then when I think of edge I actually think of
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,960	| IOT123 |	No it's not necessarily sensors but maybe so
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:13,824	| IOT123 |	Will you find edges anything that's
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:15,360	| IOT123 |	Capable of running
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,128	| IOT123 |	Intelligence
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:18,432	| IOT123 |	Located on physical
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:19,200	| IOT123 |	Outside the cloud
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:22,016	| IOT123 |	That could definitely be a gateway
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:25,600	| IOT123 |	Could definitely be an iot node or combination of the two
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:27,904	| IOT123 |	It really just depends on capabilities
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:28,672	| IOT123 |	Mean
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:30,208	| IOT123 |	As you look at that
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:31,488	| IOT123 |	Spectrum of device
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:33,024	| IOT123 |	Ituc everything
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:36,096	| IOT123 |	Sensors all the way up through
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:38,400	| IOT123 |	Oblong gateways
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:40,448	| IOT123 |	And everything in between
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:42,496	| IOT123 |	And so when we think about Edge
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:45,312	| IOT123 |	We think about you know there's these waves of computing they're happy
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:46,336	| IOT123 |	This Cloud
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:47,616	| IOT123 |	Coyote
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:48,384	| IOT123 |	Leverage
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:50,688	| IOT123 |	Cloud in an edge leverages Cloud II
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:53,248	| IOT123 |	And we
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:56,832	| IOT123 |	Slightly different and iot is about sending signals from those devices
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:58,624	| IOT123 |	Attacking on the signal
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:32:59,648	| IOT123 |	Betches about
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:00,928	| IOT123 |	Pushing cop intelligence
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:03,488	| IOT123 |	Into the devices themselves
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:04,768	| IOT123 |	Silicon man
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:05,792	| IOT123 |	Offline
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:07,584	| IOT123 |	Are low latency loops
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:10,912	| IOT123 |	Fail-Safe systems in cases local network outages
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:15,520	| IOT123 |	I mean another big trend is simply just minimize any amount of data that's being transferred
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:18,336	| IOT123 |	Between devices in the cloud that's part of that equilibrium
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:20,384	| IOT123 |	Everything about between edging
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:23,712	| IOT123 |	Okay and you just threw in like a whole new
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:24,992	| IOT123 |	I don't even know what to call it
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:30,368	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,904	| IOT123 |	I got you
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:33,952	| IOT123 |	I got you
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:37,024	| IOT123 |	So when you're tired iot just being signaling
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:39,328	| IOT123 |	Can you help me understand what's your talk
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:45,472	| IOT123 |	Looking for example no customers doing predictive maintenance
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:47,520	| IOT123 |	Industrial Park
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:50,336	| IOT123 |	I don't want to smoke or service that are under service
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:53,152	| IOT123 |	If a device is simply just sending
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:54,432	| IOT123 |	Sheepshead sedated
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:55,456	| IOT123 |	The cloud and your doing
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,760	| IOT123 |	G'morning and analytics Fair
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:03,392	| IOT123 |	Need to determine the maintenance window and maybe even your shut down the machine in case of a pending failure
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:06,208	| IOT123 |	Yeah I kind of classify that usages
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:08,000	| IOT123 |	Pretty straightforward and Vanilla Ice.
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,816	| IOT123 |	Edge's for the vet next week where
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:11,584	| IOT123 |	Instead of
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:13,376	| IOT123 |	Sending all of that data to the cloud
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:14,656	| IOT123 |	I can't
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:15,680	| IOT123 |	Or processing
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,216	| IOT123 |	I can take
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:19,264	| IOT123 |	The processing and move it to where data is
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:20,544	| IOT123 |	Because
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:22,848	| IOT123 |	As machines at Society really gets going
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:26,688	| IOT123 |	These devices generate more and more and more data data has gravity
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:28,480	| IOT123 |	It's much easier to move
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:30,528	| IOT123 |	Computer where data is
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:31,296	| IOT123 |	Cutest
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:32,064	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:33,344	| IOT123 |	In this example that was
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:35,136	| IOT123 |	Just giving about industrial equipment
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:38,464	| IOT123 |	Much easier does take that cloud intelligence about
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:41,792	| IOT123 |	When do I need to shut this down or when the maintenance going to need to be adjusted
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:43,840	| IOT123 |	Tickets on the cloud and just
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:44,608	| IOT123 |	Right right on the
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:51,776	| IOT123 |	So on the IRT thing I'm thinking this is a differentiator here is there's not a real-time element
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:53,568	| IOT123 |	For the edge stuff I thinking
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:55,616	| IOT123 |	Real time
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:57,664	| IOT123 |	I'm thinking maybe a conservation of data
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:01,248	| IOT123 |	It's not making decision
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:03,552	| IOT123 |	There's no decision-making happening
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:09,952	| IOT123 |	Some intelligence
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:11,232	| IOT123 |	Fighting to take action
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:13,280	| IOT123 |	In an unsupervised manner
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:16,864	| IOT123 |	Okay so when I look at all these iot edge things that are
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:17,376	| IOT123 |	Coming
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:19,680	| IOT123 |	Count you guys have yours
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:21,216	| IOT123 |	Their competitors have
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:23,776	| IOT123 |	That's the decision
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:27,360	| IOT123 |	Exactly
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:30,432	| IOT123 |	Exactly now you guys work with a lot of
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:31,456	| IOT123 |	Big Industrial
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:35,808	| IOT123 |	Most of the big players that I talk to you there like Azure all the way
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:41,952	| IOT123 |	So I'm very curious because you're probably dealing with this right now this divide that they have between the it side of the house
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:43,744	| IOT123 |	In the operational side of the
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:45,280	| IOT123 |	And
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:49,376	| IOT123 |	I'm wondering how far the it infrastructure
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:50,912	| IOT123 |	Can actually stretch cuz
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:52,960	| IOT123 |	If I talk to someone like Honeywell
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:55,776	| IOT123 |	They have parts of their Factory automation
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,312	| IOT123 |	It's on their gear
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:59,360	| IOT123 |	On their private Network
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:01,152	| IOT123 |	And a lot of wire
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,432	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:04,992	| IOT123 |	I'm curious how far into that infrastructure you
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,016	| IOT123 |	You can go or you even want
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:08,832	| IOT123 |	But I think that's a big
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:10,112	| IOT123 |	Part of why
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:12,672	| IOT123 |	Weekly schedule such an important concept
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:13,440	| IOT123 |	Because
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:16,256	| IOT123 |	There's many many times where you want
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:17,536	| IOT123 |	All about logic
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:19,072	| IOT123 |	Then you want to be able to
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:19,840	| IOT123 |	El Pollo Loco
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:24,192	| IOT123 |	In a local itot teams
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:27,776	| IOT123 |	You're a lot of people especially in the commercial and industrial iot space
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:30,592	| IOT123 |	Want to make sure that their data saves resident
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:35,200	| IOT123 |	I think that we're doing with iot Edge and also with Azure stack
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:36,224	| IOT123 |	Billy about in England
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:39,296	| IOT123 |	Who is managing these and buying them
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:39,808	| IOT123 |	He's inside these
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:41,600	| IOT123 |	Because
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:43,648	| IOT123 |	I talked to these OT guys and they are
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:44,672	| IOT123 |	Very smart
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:46,464	| IOT123 |	They're very smart about different things
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:49,536	| IOT123 |	What I think the typical Azure customers
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:52,352	| IOT123 |	Iot is the
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:54,656	| IOT123 |	Anchorman that really forces
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:56,192	| IOT123 |	Itot games
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:56,960	| IOT123 |	To work together
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:58,240	| IOT123 |	And
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:00,800	| IOT123 |	Your customers that have worked that out
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:03,616	| IOT123 |	It worked out that the balance between the two
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:05,152	| IOT123 |	OT teams realize
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:08,992	| IOT123 |	I keep going to be managing
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:12,832	| IOT123 |	And it teams respect the OT discipline
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:14,368	| IOT123 |	When that really works
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:16,416	| IOT123 |	Can you can have iot
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:17,440	| IOT123 |	Enabled for that business
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:21,792	| IOT123 |	What are some best practices that you see in your customers who are actually able to
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:23,584	| IOT123 |	What are they doing today like
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,704	| IOT123 |	Right chest pain
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:31,776	| IOT123 |	The most successful customers they don't think about it
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:33,312	| IOT123 |	Disciplining an OT different
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:34,336	| IOT123 |	I'm thinking about
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:37,920	| IOT123 |	And what happened to different phases of the car
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:41,504	| IOT123 |	And we'll wind up happening is it both different 1/2
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:43,552	| IOT123 |	Coordinate those rolls
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:44,576	| IOT123 |	So for example
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:45,856	| IOT123 |	There's a role for
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:47,648	| IOT123 |	Designing software
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:49,952	| IOT123 |	Designing a software that runs on a hardware
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:51,232	| IOT123 |	Updating that
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:53,280	| IOT123 |	True
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:57,120	| IOT123 |	It what's the top-rated going to be running on it and what's her update strategy
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:38:00,704	| IOT123 |	Taking people from both discipline and having to be accountable
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:03,264	| IOT123 |	Designing that process together
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:04,800	| IOT123 |	Helps break down some of those barriers
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:07,104	| IOT123 |	Okay how often does that actually happen
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:09,152	| IOT123 |	It really depends on the cusp
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:16,576	| IOT123 |	Some customers that have been around for a long long time you know for OT has been around a lot longer and it
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:18,112	| IOT123 |	That can take a long time to break down
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:21,440	| IOT123 |	It really starts with
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:23,232	| IOT123 |	Leadership and will
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:26,816	| IOT123 |	Commanded the next two teams are going to work together
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:29,376	| IOT123 |	Waterpik 150 Prime
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:30,912	| IOT123 |	I'll bring the other one along
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:32,448	| IOT123 |	It is the
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:32,960	| IOT123 |	The prime one
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:34,496	| IOT123 |	Is it usually OT
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:39,872	| IOT123 |	I think it really varies I'm starting to feel more more it
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:40,896	| IOT123 |	Actually
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:42,688	| IOT123 |	Anthony industry
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:45,248	| IOT123 |	In a world where we've got like
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:47,552	| IOT123 |	Breezy security breaches happening
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:52,672	| IOT123 |	And even when you know you're dealing with like compliance issues at big companies are
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:54,976	| IOT123 |	Maybe your tracking hazardous chemicals and
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:57,280	| IOT123 |	This whole iot ecosystem
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:58,816	| IOT123 |	How do you
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:38:59,584	| IOT123 |	Track
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:01,120	| IOT123 |	Your partner's both
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:04,192	| IOT123 |	Appliance perspective or just bring them on board for lie
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:05,984	| IOT123 |	Tracking
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:08,544	| IOT123 |	Materials I mean is it's very tough
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:09,312	| IOT123 |	So
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:10,848	| IOT123 |	What are you seeing developed
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:11,616	| IOT123 |	What are you guys thinking
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:13,408	| IOT123 |	To make that easier
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:15,200	| IOT123 |	Let's pick on security for a second
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:19,808	| IOT123 |	That looks like for example that you know I'm a customer I'd go pick solution and eye solution
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:24,160	| IOT123 |	And I had some partners that were involved in helping me with that are that are still operating
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:24,672	| IOT123 |	For me
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:29,280	| IOT123 |	In that situation you know you've had many hands touch their iot project
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:32,096	| IOT123 |	I'm so nope I'm at customer and I want to
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:34,656	| IOT123 |	That's the question which it should
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:35,680	| IOT123 |	Life Solutions
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:36,192	| IOT123 |	Cure
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:40,288	| IOT123 |	It's not a simple answer because there's been so many for so many different parts
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:41,824	| IOT123 |	Absolution
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:42,848	| IOT123 |	Do we handle that
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:45,408	| IOT123 |	Is with Security Programs
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:49,504	| IOT123 |	Security program for add royalty
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:51,296	| IOT123 |	With third-party auditors
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:55,136	| IOT123 |	That you know we train on every key that
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:55,904	| IOT123 |	You can come and inspect
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:57,952	| IOT123 |	ONN solution
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:00,512	| IOT123 |	Import of what we're doing there
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:01,024	| IOT123 |	Is
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:04,096	| IOT123 |	And we work with standards bodies around the world
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:07,680	| IOT123 |	And a very important one we work with this industrial internet Consortium
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:10,496	| IOT123 |	And so we recently introduced
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:11,520	| IOT123 |	Security maturity model
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:13,824	| IOT123 |	And the reason why
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:15,616	| IOT123 |	Is it security maturity model
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:16,384	| IOT123 |	Is
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:17,664	| IOT123 |	Answer the question of
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:19,456	| IOT123 |	Which security
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:22,528	| IOT123 |	Techniques you need to bring to bear and iot for which
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:23,808	| IOT123 |	Types of something
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:25,600	| IOT123 |	Because
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:27,648	| IOT123 |	We hear a lot of customers asking us to
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:28,928	| IOT123 |	Am I secure
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:33,024	| IOT123 |	And can I say that I'm certified to be secure
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:34,048	| IOT123 |	I like the Cure
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:35,072	| IOT123 |	For what
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:37,888	| IOT123 |	What specifically until you have to start talking about
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:42,496	| IOT123 |	Different types of techniques that were employed and what the security maturity model
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:43,008	| IOT123 |	Is a way of
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:46,336	| IOT123 |	Everyone agreeing and that's why we're doing it in a standard body
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:49,920	| IOT123 |	Is everyone agreeing in a hay for these types of scenarios
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:51,968	| IOT123 |	This level of security is
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:52,480	| IOT123 |	Appropriate
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:55,296	| IOT123 |	The things that we're doing on
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:59,392	| IOT123 |	But that sort of touches to your question about Hugo 6
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:40:59,904	| IOT123 |	Square
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:02,976	| IOT123 |	If there are a lot of hands and balls
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:05,536	| IOT123 |	You need to find a way to certify the thing
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:09,888	| IOT123 |	How to make sure certified the solution and make sure that it itchy the level of
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:11,168	| IOT123 |	Appliance
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:11,680	| IOT123 |	Security
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:13,728	| IOT123 |	Date of residency
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:16,032	| IOT123 |	There's also this
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:17,312	| IOT123 |	Idea of
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:18,336	| IOT123 |	It's ever-changing
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:20,896	| IOT123 |	So is new vulnerabilities
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:23,200	| IOT123 |	Pure or maybe someone shifts
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:26,272	| IOT123 |	I've talked to people who've had one of their
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:28,576	| IOT123 |	Your partner switch their underline Cloud Player
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:31,136	| IOT123 |	Right or maybe their database provider
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:32,928	| IOT123 |	All of a sudden
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:35,232	| IOT123 |	They've opened up a hole that they didn't
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:40,608	| IOT123 |	It may not even be security it may just be breaking some functionality further down in the chain
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:43,424	| IOT123 |	Chasing all of that
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:45,216	| IOT123 |	Is tough
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:46,752	| IOT123 |	But you can't tell people
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:48,032	| IOT123 |	Thou shalt
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:48,544	| IOT123 |	Change
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:53,919	| IOT123 |	And that is where Auditors come into play
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:56,479	| IOT123 |	Play this word you know there's an expert
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:58,527	| IOT123 |	Bet you make a living doing this
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:02,623	| IOT123 |	Do your partners proactively have to notify you
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:06,463	| IOT123 |	What does that so
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:09,791	| IOT123 |	Many of the solutions that we see and IRT
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:11,839	| IOT123 |	Is you'll have a partner that will develop
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:14,399	| IOT123 |	Solution
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:16,447	| IOT123 |	Coyote
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:16,959	| IOT123 |	Where
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:21,311	| IOT123 |	The partner secures devices build the solution
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:24,127	| IOT123 |	And many times operated on
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:26,175	| IOT123 |	So there's not
EDL	00:42:26,943	00:42:30,527	| IOT123 |	You don't get into a case where there's no lots and lots of vendors that are
EDL	00:42:30,527	00:42:33,087	| IOT123 |	Words that end in solution
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:34,879	| IOT123 |	Is iot
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:37,183	| IOT123 |	Industrial iot in particular
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:38,207	| IOT123 |	Enterprise
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:39,743	| IOT123 |	Really scalable yet
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:41,791	| IOT123 |	I need it feels like everything is still
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:42,559	| IOT123 |	Fairly
EDL	00:42:42,559	00:42:43,071	| IOT123 |	Custom
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:45,631	| IOT123 |	Because Industries require highly specific
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:49,471	| IOT123 |	Because you have these kind of
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:51,775	| IOT123 |	Custom built Solutions
EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:53,055	| IOT123 |	The bear may not be hosted on
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:54,847	| IOT123 |	Your cloud or somebody else's
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:56,127	| IOT123 |	But still
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:56,895	| IOT123 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:58,687	| IOT123 |	At this point
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:02,015	| IOT123 |	There's still a tremendous amount of vertical specialization
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:04,575	| IOT123 |	And I think that there's always going to be
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:06,367	| IOT123 |	Yeah like that degree of
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:07,647	| IOT123 |	Your vertical specialization
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:09,951	| IOT123 |	The thing that you see all of us stealing is
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:13,535	| IOT123 |	Providing more and more functionality
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:15,839	| IOT123 |	That reduces the amount of vertical specialization that
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:21,727	| IOT123 |	If you were to do an iot Solutions say 5 years ago
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:23,263	| IOT123 |	You would have
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:26,079	| IOT123 |	Painted some virtual machines and build something custom yourself
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:28,383	| IOT123 |	Now we have platform services
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:30,175	| IOT123 |	Where you don't have to worry about scalability
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:31,967	| IOT123 |	We handle that part for you
EDL	00:43:32,479	00:43:35,551	| IOT123 |	You can connect devices in billions of Massachusetts
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:39,391	| IOT123 |	That reduces the amount of vertical specialization
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:40,159	| IOT123 |	And then
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:40,927	| IOT123 |	They have
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:42,207	| IOT123 |	You like we've introduced
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:42,975	| IOT123 |	Assassin
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:47,071	| IOT123 |	So that you don't even need Cloud solution development expertise in order to build
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:48,863	| IOT123 |	And so
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:52,447	| IOT123 |	Yes you're absolutely right now the iot industry is still
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:53,471	| IOT123 |	Pretty nails
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:56,543	| IOT123 |	So what you're saying and I think it a pretty rapid pace
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:58,079	| IOT123 |	You're seeing
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:02,943	| IOT123 |	Provide more and more functionality so that
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:04,991	| IOT123 |	There's less specialization required
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:06,527	| IOT123 |	I have to ask this question
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:07,807	| IOT123 |	Chi products deep billions
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:08,575	| IOT123 |	Millions of messages
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:11,903	| IOT123 |	I was talking to somebody who's up for a diet
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:16,255	| IOT123 |	T solution and they were actually frustrated because they couldn't find one that could handle
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:18,047	| IOT123 |	Hundreds of millions of synchronous messages
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:20,607	| IOT123 |	I like what that seems like a lot
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:25,471	| IOT123 |	He's like well consumer Products Company
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:26,751	| IOT123 |	I want
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:29,055	| IOT123 |	I need to be able to do that
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:32,383	| IOT123 |	I understand that
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:35,199	| IOT123 |	What's the kind of technologies that
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:36,223	| IOT123 |	People
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:37,759	| IOT123 |	Need that we don't have yet
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:41,343	| IOT123 |	So what are you guys looking for that your customers are like
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:42,111	| IOT123 |	August 1st
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:43,647	| IOT123 |	That would be cool
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:46,463	| IOT123 |	That's a great question
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:48,255	| IOT123 |	What are the challenges
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:51,071	| IOT123 |	Imagine for a second that you know you could all tonight
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:51,583	| IOT123 |	Solution
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:54,143	| IOT123 |	And you know you're going to add
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:55,679	| IOT123 |	What's a 1090 device
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:58,239	| IOT123 |	Typically that what you see is you know
EDL	00:44:58,239	00:44:59,519	| IOT123 |	Contact
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:01,311	| IOT123 |	Pilot
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:04,895	| IOT123 |	Great limited device that you know you do your scale test
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:08,735	| IOT123 |	One of the challenges after you get all that in place
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:12,831	| IOT123 |	Shift from being getting a solution in place
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:14,111	| IOT123 |	To provision
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:17,439	| IOT123 |	Impala saying software staff
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:18,207	| IOT123 |	Things are slow
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:20,255	| IOT123 |	You can put Asian
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:21,791	| IOT123 |	Capacity for handling
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:24,351	| IOT123 |	Billions of messages in minutes
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:28,959	| IOT123 |	But to actually your provisionals devices and make them operational
EDL	00:45:29,471	00:45:29,983	| IOT123 |	Cat cakes
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:33,567	| IOT123 |	That's where you at we look at problem like that we say
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:37,407	| IOT123 |	Hey that's a great example where we need a service it does that
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:40,479	| IOT123 |	That's why we introduced a device provisioning service
EDL	00:45:40,991	00:45:41,503	| IOT123 |	Tysons Corner
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:42,527	| IOT123 |	Contact it
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:44,319	| IOT123 |	Give permission to the right
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:45,599	| IOT123 |	After service
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:49,183	| IOT123 |	And then no download latest software operational
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:51,487	| IOT123 |	Ice provisioning
EDL	00:45:51,487	00:45:53,535	| IOT123 |	If you have something in the sexy sexy
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:02,239	| IOT123 |	No it's it a lot of the stuff is is
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:03,519	| IOT123 |	Spacek
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:06,079	| IOT123 |	Tackling it feels like for computing problems
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:09,663	| IOT123 |	You know a lot of people
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:11,967	| IOT123 |	Managing hundreds of thousands of servers
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:12,479	| IOT123 |	And so
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:15,039	| IOT123 |	Okay let's take all of that
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:15,551	| IOT123 |	Running
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:20,159	| IOT123 |	How to do the world where we have no control over things in their devices
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:20,671	| IOT123 |	Have not a lot of
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:23,743	| IOT123 |	And maybe not even great network connection
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:25,279	| IOT123 |	That's right
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:28,607	| IOT123 |	Do you have any cool favorite things that people have built that you're like
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:29,887	| IOT123 |	I can't believe they did this
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:30,655	| IOT123 |	It's crazy
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:34,751	| IOT123 |	My favorite right now is what Hershey's is done
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:36,287	| IOT123 |	You know top of
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:37,311	| IOT123 |	Add Realty
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:40,383	| IOT123 |	If that's something they call the internet a Twizzlers
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:41,663	| IOT123 |	And
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:43,711	| IOT123 |	Actually
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:46,527	| IOT123 |	Connected Twizzler production plant
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:48,575	| IOT123 |	Azure iot
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:49,855	| IOT123 |	To optimize it
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:51,647	| IOT123 |	One of the challenges
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:54,719	| IOT123 |	Someone like Hershey's faces when they're producing Twizzlers
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:56,255	| IOT123 |	Is when
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:46:58,303	| IOT123 |	Put a bunch of Twizzlers in a package
EDL	00:46:59,071	00:47:01,119	| IOT123 |	It says it weighs 3 ounces
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:02,399	| IOT123 |	It has to wait at least 3 ounces
EDL	00:47:02,911	00:47:03,423	| IOT123 |	And
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:04,959	| IOT123 |	Tuning your
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:05,983	| IOT123 |	Factory
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:07,263	| IOT123 |	The bad you know
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:09,311	| IOT123 |	It produces a predictable number
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:10,847	| IOT123 |	Twizzlers
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:12,383	| IOT123 |	Cancer in the mouth
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:13,919	| IOT123 |	Turns out to be a heart problem
EDL	00:47:14,431	00:47:15,711	| IOT123 |	Tibetan example where
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:17,247	| IOT123 |	They used
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:18,527	| IOT123 |	Machine learning
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:20,063	| IOT123 |	As well as
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:21,343	| IOT123 |	Connectivity to the cloud
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:24,159	| IOT123 |	In order to monitor
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:25,183	| IOT123 |	Production batch
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:26,463	| IOT123 |	Spell the liquor she's being
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:26,975	| IOT123 |	Mixton
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:30,047	| IOT123 |	And so they can tuna production bat
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:31,583	| IOT123 |	Any extruders
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:33,119	| IOT123 |	To generate
EDL	00:47:33,119	00:47:33,631	| IOT123 |	Precise
EDL	00:47:34,911	00:47:36,447	| IOT123 |	Face of a bunch of money
EDL	00:47:37,471	00:47:39,263	| IOT123 |	So we just bought some the other day
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:40,799	| IOT123 |	And I was telling people on the team
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:42,079	| IOT123 |	This is using our stuff
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:44,383	| IOT123 |	I mean it's just an amazing thing
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:45,919	| IOT123 |	Be part of an industry
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:47,199	| IOT123 |	They compared those kind of scenario
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:51,295	| IOT123 |	Okay that is awesome in on that sweet note
EDL	00:47:51,295	00:47:52,319	| IOT123 |	We shall end
