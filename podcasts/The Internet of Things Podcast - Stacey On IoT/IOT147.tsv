EDL	00:00:57,344	00:00:59,136	| IOT147 |	We talked about how to regulate
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:00,416	| IOT147 |	Companies
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:04,512	| IOT147 |	When data is the new oil so you're going to want to stick around for some
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:06,048	| IOT147 |	What is a life-changing
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:06,560	| IOT147 |	Thoughts there
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:08,864	| IOT147 |	Now let's go to another
EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:09,632	| IOT147 |	One of our sponsors
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:12,704	| IOT147 |	This week sponsor is CBT Nuggets
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:19,104	| IOT147 |	How does the iot change the way we do business for many organizations it means a proliferation of devices and tools
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:23,200	| IOT147 |	In every device connecting to your network is another potential vulnerability
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:29,600	| IOT147 |	You may think that your greatest security threat as a malicious hacker but what if it's really an unsecured smartwatch
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:30,880	| IOT147 |	Someone on your team
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:34,720	| IOT147 |	But if everyone on your team is trained and security best practices
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:38,560	| IOT147 |	It significantly reduces your chance of a data breach or the severity of the

EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:00,576	| IOT147 |	In the internet
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:01,600	| IOT147 |	Thanks
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:05,440	| IOT147 |	Okay
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:06,720	| IOT147 |	I didn't get the
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:08,000	| IOT147 |	Did you
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:12,096	| IOT147 |	No this is one of the first times that I did not get sick
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:12,864	| IOT147 |	From
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:13,888	| IOT147 |	CES which is
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:17,984	| IOT147 |	Nearly impossible to avoid because you have all those people in
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:21,568	| IOT147 |	Confined spaces for days upon days upon days
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,616	| IOT147 |	No no honey I'm good
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:24,384	| IOT147 |	Yeah
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,152	| IOT147 |	So
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:25,664	| IOT147 |	I feel like
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,200	| IOT147 |	Will be struck down with something
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,992	| IOT147 |	Ten times worse
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,272	| IOT147 |	But I'm really excited
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,808	| IOT147 |	I got back
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:33,600	| IOT147 |	I was tired so I didn't do this yet
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:36,416	| IOT147 |	After seeing everything happening
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,184	| IOT147 |	With voice
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:37,696	| IOT147 |	It CS
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,488	| IOT147 |	I realized it
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:42,560	| IOT147 |	I should probably switch over to using Google home
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,096	| IOT147 |	Instead of Madam
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:48,192	| IOT147 |	So my family is going to kill me but I am switching over
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,728	| IOT147 |	Because
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:51,776	| IOT147 |	I tested out a couple of the
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,824	| IOT147 |	I have been testing out
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:55,104	| IOT147 |	Google related
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,896	| IOT147 |	Integrations and they work
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:58,176	| IOT147 |	Really well in
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:00,224	| IOT147 |	Just Google is so much better than madame
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,272	| IOT147 |	When it comes to answering
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,552	| IOT147 |	When it called the big question
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:08,928	| IOT147 |	Yes yes and it's really ironic that you bring this up
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:11,232	| IOT147 |	Because and we did not coordinate this
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:13,536	| IOT147 |	I'm actually doing the same thing
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,840	| IOT147 |	You know the one place that Google falls down
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:17,120	| IOT147 |	Amazon music
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,680	| IOT147 |	So a couple of my rooms
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,192	| IOT147 |	Can Aleve
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:25,312	| IOT147 |	Echo in like my daughter because she plays music all the time Google is
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,336	| IOT147 |	Terrible
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:30,432	| IOT147 |	When it comes to it like I asked for a song it almost always gives me the
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:30,944	| IOT147 |	Karaoke
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,736	| IOT147 |	I don't know why
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:37,344	| IOT147 |	It just it always gives me the wackiest version of the song I wanted to
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:37,856	| IOT147 |	Play so
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:40,672	| IOT147 |	That is one place where I'm like nope I can't
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,184	| IOT147 |	I can't rely on
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,256	| IOT147 |	In your Google Maps history do you have like a
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:47,328	| IOT147 |	Series of searches for karaoke bar
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:53,728	| IOT147 |	That's really odd but and it's funny cuz I thought you're going to say something else about music I agree with you that the music is where it falls down
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:57,056	| IOT147 |	For the most part there's another variable probably talk about it
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:00,384	| IOT147 |	You're very limited music choices to set
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:02,176	| IOT147 |	As your you know to link rather
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:04,736	| IOT147 |	Nature Google play music person
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,504	| IOT147 |	Yeah you're good
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,272	| IOT147 |	But
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,296	| IOT147 |	I'm Apple music
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,064	| IOT147 |	So Spotify
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:10,624	| IOT147 |	6 weird songs
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:13,696	| IOT147 |	It's
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:17,280	| IOT147 |	So in my default settings
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,047	| IOT147 |	It's just
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:19,327	| IOT147 |	Google's brain just
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:21,631	| IOT147 |	Maybe Google just feels like I should be
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:25,471	| IOT147 |	Maybe I hear you singing on the show I don't know
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,495	| IOT147 |	I do have it in my bath
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:32,639	| IOT147 |	Could be could be
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:38,271	| IOT147 |	Falls down for me a little bit still in the smart home area but it has gotten better like in October
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,551	| IOT147 |	They added support
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:43,135	| IOT147 |	In Google Assistant which we didn't transfer over to Google home
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,927	| IOT147 |	For Canary integration
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,719	| IOT147 |	I'm having problems setting it up
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:48,255	| IOT147 |	Probably on my end I don't know
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,791	| IOT147 |	They recently added
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,559	| IOT147 |	Sbarro
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:56,703	| IOT147 |	Fathers that come up recently been at it since they haven't quite caught up to Amazon in the terms of those integration
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,007	| IOT147 |	But they're getting much closer for me
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:01,311	| IOT147 |	Yes so I'm going to use my Google home
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,591	| IOT147 |	It's moving out of the master bathroom
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,895	| IOT147 |	It's moving into
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,663	| IOT147 |	Bedroom
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,943	| IOT147 |	And then actually
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:09,503	| IOT147 |	The Google home will move downstairs to the kitchen
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:10,527	| IOT147 |	And then
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,575	| IOT147 |	Google mini
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,599	| IOT147 |	Will move
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,623	| IOT147 |	Into the bedroom
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,391	| IOT147 |	Replacing an echo
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:18,719	| IOT147 |	Yeah see you're in a better spot than I am because
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,255	| IOT147 |	I only have
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:26,655	| IOT147 |	A Google home and everything else is an echo device so I would have to be replacing with some Minis and things and I just I want to get the
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,935	| IOT147 |	Lenovo smart
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:29,471	| IOT147 |	Screen that has
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:33,055	| IOT147 |	Google home integration
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,335	| IOT147 |	For the smaller and
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,639	| IOT147 |	Correct
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:42,783	| IOT147 |	I'll wait for that but I'll probably in a couple minutes and unfortunately they're not $29 anymore they're back up to $49 so
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,551	| IOT147 |	I swear
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:45,087	| IOT147 |	Just walk in
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:49,951	| IOT147 |	Sign up for the New York Times you got it
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,975	| IOT147 |	I see the free mini
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,791	| IOT147 |	Yeah but they usually with things I don't need
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,839	| IOT147 |	I already have that Supply have any Kobe
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:06:00,191	| IOT147 |	Not that don't figure that part again you're better place from it
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:06,591	| IOT147 |	And as far as going back to the music for singing I'll still stick with the Sonos Play 1 with the matinee
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,871	| IOT147 |	Integration for now
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,919	| IOT147 |	Because I also works with it
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:12,223	| IOT147 |	Music services that I love you so
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:15,807	| IOT147 |	Show control music but Google home will do everything else is my thought
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:20,159	| IOT147 |	Well there's an opportunity because Google has now hooked up with yonomi
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,439	| IOT147 |	Which
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,207	| IOT147 |	Is
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,231	| IOT147 |	One of my favorites
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:25,791	| IOT147 |	All-time favorite apps they actually just got 5 million last week
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:31,679	| IOT147 |	Not for their smart home stuff but because they have this really awesome architecture that lowers the cost of
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:36,543	| IOT147 |	Devices of supporting connected devices so on the backend so companies
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,311	| IOT147 |	Like
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,079	| IOT147 |	Sonos
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,103	| IOT147 |	Can look at
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,383	| IOT147 |	You know me is cloud
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:43,455	| IOT147 |	And be like oh it's so much easier to operate
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:43,967	| IOT147 |	Yay
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:49,343	| IOT147 |	The cool thing is with Google being integrated with
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:49,855	| IOT147 |	You know me
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:52,159	| IOT147 |	Yonomi control Sonos stuff
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:54,463	| IOT147 |	And it actually does a really good job I've had it
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,999	| IOT147 |	Controlling my son has stuff for a while
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:07:00,607	| IOT147 |	You can't get it to play a particular song on
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,119	| IOT147 |	On the Sonos
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:02,911	| IOT147 |	Which is better outside
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:09,311	| IOT147 |	Whether you got that's all I need because I tune into channels typically like on XM
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,591	| IOT147 |	Serious
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,871	| IOT147 |	Satellite for example
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:15,711	| IOT147 |	So I can already set that as a favorite in Sonos app so I should be good
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:18,783	| IOT147 |	Yeah so like if I'm looking it allows you to play favorite
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,319	| IOT147 |	Or play a playlist
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:21,855	| IOT147 |	You can also have
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,623	| IOT147 |	It tell you things
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,671	| IOT147 |	Can make your own text
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:27,487	| IOT147 |	Welcome to study law.
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:28,767	| IOT147 |	How may I ask
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,071	| IOT147 |	That's actually pretty scared
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:36,447	| IOT147 |	So all of those things you can do volume mute unmute
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,215	| IOT147 |	Next
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:37,983	| IOT147 |	Previous
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,519	| IOT147 |	Play and pause so those are all the commands
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:41,567	| IOT147 |	And
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:43,615	| IOT147 |	Yeah so it's actually fairly Flex
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:47,967	| IOT147 |	I once when I was first playing with you know me I actually had set it up
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,759	| IOT147 |	All of my Sonos is around my house
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:53,087	| IOT147 |	Play my favorites when I walked in
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:54,623	| IOT147 |	And what happened was
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:56,927	| IOT147 |	Their geolocation was still kind
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:08:00,767	| IOT147 |	It apparently at 4 in the morning and decided I'd come home
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,047	| IOT147 |	And all of my sodas
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,327	| IOT147 |	This Sunday started playing late
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,119	| IOT147 |	Public Radio
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,935	| IOT147 |	Middle of the night rave party
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:10,239	| IOT147 |	Husband was not impressed
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,847	| IOT147 |	Let's see what else about the Google home
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,663	| IOT147 |	We want to talk about it messing with our Wi-Fi cuz that was a big
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:21,503	| IOT147 |	Well it still is a big deal is being fixed however a couple people
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:26,367	| IOT147 |	Start reporting issues and was looked into it turns out that Google's
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:32,767	| IOT147 |	Cast protocol which is used in the Chromecast as well as Google home and other Google devices was causing Wi-Fi
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:36,351	| IOT147 |	Issues in people with what's going on in my WiFi why can't misers
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,375	| IOT147 |	Not working at all
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,679	| IOT147 |	Turns out that the
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:43,775	| IOT147 |	Cast feature sends packets as a keep alive for a connection
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,591	| IOT147 |	For like the Google home
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:50,431	| IOT147 |	Unfortunately when a Chromecast device go to sleep
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,223	| IOT147 |	The packets buildup
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:57,599	| IOT147 |	So what happens is when something that uses the Google Cast protocol comes back online
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:59,391	| IOT147 |	It floods your router
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,671	| IOT147 |	Two boards of
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:03,231	| IOT147 |	Tens or hundreds of thousands of packets
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:07,071	| IOT147 |	And the memory fills up on the router and causes like an overflow error
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:09,119	| IOT147 |	And it just have to reboot the router
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:14,239	| IOT147 |	Obviously I don't like pictures the issue temporarily so what's going to happen is Google is working on a fix to
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:18,847	| IOT147 |	Not have that happened I don't think I change the protocol because I think they're using UDP
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:21,151	| IOT147 |	And yeah and that's
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,687	| IOT147 |	Probably not the way to go if you want to
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,967	| IOT147 |	Control the
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:26,527	| IOT147 |	The packets in this kind of situation so
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:31,647	| IOT147 |	It's more of a a setting or configuration that they need to fix it's nothing a user and user can do
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,695	| IOT147 |	But if you do have Wi-Fi issues
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:38,815	| IOT147 |	Give Me Maybe due to Google Cast type products in your house
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:43,167	| IOT147 |	And this will be fixed in the very near future some router
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,447	| IOT147 |	Companies are already fixing it
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:50,847	| IOT147 |	I know Linksys has a firmware update Netgear is working on tp-link which actually makes my Google
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,383	| IOT147 |	Call this now Google WiFi
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:52,895	| IOT147 |	Router
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,455	| IOT147 |	Google
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,271	| IOT147 |	That's it on Hub
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,551	| IOT147 |	Yasso
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,319	| IOT147 |	So it's getting fixed
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:03,647	| IOT147 |	Wifi issues recently this could be the problem
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:09,279	| IOT147 |	Right right
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:11,839	| IOT147 |	Google Google when messing with your WiFi
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,631	| IOT147 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:19,519	| IOT147 |	Let's see other this is actually an interesting reason to maybe switch over to Google home especially for you guys who want
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,311	| IOT147 |	Troll Kevin
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:21,823	| IOT147 |	Discovered
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:25,151	| IOT147 |	Yeah well I discovered something somebody else's guy
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:31,551	| IOT147 |	Android police wrote an article earlier this week saying Google home as a hidden API that local devices can use
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:35,135	| IOT147 |	My eyebrows
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,159	| IOT147 |	You raise the eyebrow
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,743	| IOT147 |	Sleep with this little bit will put a link in the show notes
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:46,655	| IOT147 |	But basically yeah you couldn't as long as you know the IP address of your Google home there is a you can just plug it into your bra
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:52,543	| IOT147 |	Browser search bar and then there are some commands you can do for getting and posting HTTP requests
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:57,151	| IOT147 |	I was able to just before the show like sent a request and just get the wireless network
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:00,479	| IOT147 |	That Google is connected to in my house for example I got all the
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,759	| IOT147 |	The SSID
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:04,063	| IOT147 |	WPA information so on and so forth
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,855	| IOT147 |	I was not able to act
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,159	| IOT147 |	How to change anything on my Google home but that's because
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:10,975	| IOT147 |	You do need to install a small little helper app to
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,999	| IOT147 |	Configure your request
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:18,911	| IOT147 |	So I seen pictures of this working I'm sure it's working but I have not actually gotten it to work at so you can enable Bluetooth mode
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:21,727	| IOT147 |	You can change the night mode settings and such from command line so
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:25,055	| IOT147 |	It's interesting and Google doesn't talk about this
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:29,407	| IOT147 |	And they don't offer any type of interface for it and Teresa see if they ever
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,175	| IOT147 |	Open it up so it's
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,223	| IOT147 |	So for those of us who
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,271	| IOT147 |	Terminal user
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,551	| IOT147 |	What is the benefit of this
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:37,599	| IOT147 |	User
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:38,879	| IOT147 |	Why would I want to
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:45,279	| IOT147 |	From a user standpoint you probably don't because all these things
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,559	| IOT147 |	It's already begun
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,327	| IOT147 |	Seriously
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,863	| IOT147 |	They can already be done in
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:49,887	| IOT147 |	The app
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,167	| IOT147 |	Got it
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:51,935	| IOT147 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:56,543	| IOT147 |	What but if you wanted to create your own version of a Google home app
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:58,079	| IOT147 |	And do different things
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:59,615	| IOT147 |	As a developer could be interesting
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:02,175	| IOT147 |	I look forward to seeing what you decide
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:08,063	| IOT147 |	Yeah and user / sudo developer
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:08,831	| IOT147 |	I might want
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:14,975	| IOT147 |	How to change the Wi-Fi network my device connects to when I walk in the house because I'm going to use that Network for streaming video
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:16,511	| IOT147 |	I can do that with a command line potential
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,583	| IOT147 |	Say
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:27,263	| IOT147 |	So that's it on Google home but because
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:29,567	| IOT147 |	Switch our stuff over we're probably going to learn a lot
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:31,615	| IOT147 |	And we will share that knowledge
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:32,895	| IOT147 |	Actually
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,175	| IOT147 |	I do have
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,455	| IOT147 |	Cher
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,479	| IOT147 |	That's why I listen to you
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,247	| IOT147 |	This is he
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,527	| IOT147 |	Pro tip
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,807	| IOT147 |	From one of our listeners Marty
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:40,831	| IOT147 |	Champs
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:45,951	| IOT147 |	Cuz one of my big complaints about the Google home is
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:47,487	| IOT147 |	I can't always tell if it's hurt
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:48,767	| IOT147 |	Right
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:49,279	| IOT147 |	Is a little
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:51,071	| IOT147 |	It's on the diagonal
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,095	| IOT147 |	And a little light goes off
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:56,447	| IOT147 |	And so
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,215	| IOT147 |	This person
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:13:00,031	| IOT147 |	Email me to let me know that if I go into the accessibility settings
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:01,823	| IOT147 |	I can actually
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,103	| IOT147 |	Make it give me a little
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,383	| IOT147 |	To let me know that it's hurt
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:05,919	| IOT147 |	So
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:10,015	| IOT147 |	You could actually do that at the end of a command as well if you want to yes
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:11,551	| IOT147 |	So I needed that
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:12,831	| IOT147 |	And that his
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,343	| IOT147 |	Significantly
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:14,623	| IOT147 |	Enhanced my
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:23,071	| IOT147 |	Sepia and I actually do have that turned on because I asked for the very same reason I'm just not sure if it has heard me and I don't want
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,095	| IOT147 |	Want to have to look at it
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:24,863	| IOT147 |	So yes
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,631	| IOT147 |	And so
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,143	| IOT147 |	Guys
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:29,215	| IOT147 |	I now take away that feature and thanks Marty for
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:30,495	| IOT147 |	Telling you that
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:32,031	| IOT147 |	Apparently Kevin do it and didn't tell me
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,847	| IOT147 |	Well I didn't know you didn't know
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:42,527	| IOT147 |	Alright let's move on to some really interesting blockchain
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,599	| IOT147 |	We'll talk first about IBM and Maersk
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:47,135	| IOT147 |	The shipping Giant
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,415	| IOT147 |	Building
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,951	| IOT147 |	A joint venture
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:52,511	| IOT147 |	To track shipping around the world I thought this was fast
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:57,375	| IOT147 |	Last year IBM and Maersk created a partnership to focus on digitizing
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:57,887	| IOT147 |	Supply chain
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:00,959	| IOT147 |	And IBM spin a big black
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:02,495	| IOT147 |	3 years
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:04,287	| IOT147 |	And they were looking at it mostly for
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:04,799	| IOT147 |	Transactions
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:07,103	| IOT147 |	This is more about understanding worth
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:08,127	| IOT147 |	Bizarre
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:09,663	| IOT147 |	And now
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:11,455	| IOT147 |	After playing with this
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:15,295	| IOT147 |	4 year so they've decided there's enough to create like a whole new company
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:17,599	| IOT147 |	And they're going to put a
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:21,439	| IOT147 |	Global trade digitization platform built on Open Standards
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,487	| IOT147 |	For everyone and make it available
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:30,399	| IOT147 |	So what's going to happen is using blockchain they're going to make a record of all the transactions that occur in the global Shipping
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:30,911	| IOT147 |	Supply chain
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,191	| IOT147 |	And
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:32,959	| IOT147 |	That's a
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:34,751	| IOT147 |	Pretty significant
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:35,775	| IOT147 |	Thing to do
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:39,615	| IOT147 |	And it's also very iot Focus because
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:42,687	| IOT147 |	To do this you're going to have to have a way for these
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,991	| IOT147 |	Shipping pallets and things that are being tracked
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:45,503	| IOT147 |	Talk to one another
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,807	| IOT147 |	I look at this
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:51,903	| IOT147 |	And I cannot wait to see it's going to use IBM's cloud
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,439	| IOT147 |	Some of that Watson stuff
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,719	| IOT147 |	And then
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,743	| IOT147 |	Is ginormous a
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:57,791	| IOT147 |	Bishop
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,071	| IOT147 |	How many first
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:02,911	| IOT147 |	The global staff
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:05,215	| IOT147 |	The global stuff
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:06,751	| IOT147 |	So
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:09,311	| IOT147 |	The project has been piloted by Dow Chemical DuPont
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,359	| IOT147 |	And US Customs in
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,127	| IOT147 |	Border
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:13,919	| IOT147 |	So
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:16,991	| IOT147 |	This is cool cuz like you could see it being really useful for
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:18,527	| IOT147 |	Like hazardous materials
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,039	| IOT147 |	Counterfeit
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:20,831	| IOT147 |	Very excite
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:26,975	| IOT147 |	Yeah it's interesting that the Customs bit in determining if a product has made it to his destination as
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:28,255	| IOT147 |	Expected Hino
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:30,559	| IOT147 |	It's going from one country to another coming into our country
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:33,375	| IOT147 |	Yeah it's a wonder if they're going to have
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:39,519	| IOT147 |	They being IBM and Maersk are going to have a first-mover status here because this is a big undertaking
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:42,591	| IOT147 |	The one that can add tremendous value to any company
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,359	| IOT147 |	Around the world
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:44,639	| IOT147 |	Chips and
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:46,431	| IOT147 |	Like I said anything and anybody
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:51,039	| IOT147 |	That's a lot of them you know not services companies how to say but anybody produce something or
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:55,391	| IOT147 |	Keeps inventory and sells things you know your Walmarts you're all of your big
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,927	| IOT147 |	Supermarkets in such a penis
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:59,487	| IOT147 |	This is a good move right by these two companies I think
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:01,023	| IOT147 |	We'll have to see if it pays off
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:01,791	| IOT147 |	But I can
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:06,655	| IOT147 |	Citron Menace II out of this
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,679	| IOT147 |	Which is a startup
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,959	| IOT147 |	Filament labs
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:10,495	| IOT147 |	They've actually announced a new chip
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:11,775	| IOT147 |	The block lit
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,543	| IOT147 |	Chip
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:16,383	| IOT147 |	In what district does is you can put it on to any device
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:17,919	| IOT147 |	And
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,455	| IOT147 |	What is a secure
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:21,247	| IOT147 |	Transaction it runs
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,527	| IOT147 |	A variety of different
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:26,111	| IOT147 |	Blockchain so it becomes a secure transaction generator
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,135	| IOT147 |	On
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,183	| IOT147 |	Ascensor
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:33,023	| IOT147 |	This is kind of hard to think about but it's really revolutionary
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:33,791	| IOT147 |	Because
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:38,399	| IOT147 |	What you can do with this is the date of that stored and transmitted via the
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,423	| IOT147 |	Watching
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:41,215	| IOT147 |	Can be used to do transactions at
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:43,519	| IOT147 |	It can be used to
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,543	| IOT147 |	Calculate like
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:46,847	| IOT147 |	How much your old like you could even look up
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,127	| IOT147 |	You can even do like
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:49,151	| IOT147 |	For lookups like
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:52,223	| IOT147 |	How often are you pinning this device to
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:57,855	| IOT147 |	Find out where it is for example like much like GPS was monetized in the early days by lookups
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,647	| IOT147 |	So you can monetize it based on that
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:03,487	| IOT147 |	There's a lot of interesting things you could do with this and so filament
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:05,279	| IOT147 |	His creative basically this
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:07,071	| IOT147 |	Secure side
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:09,887	| IOT147 |	A way to do this securely in a trusted
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:10,655	| IOT147 |	The platform
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,423	| IOT147 |	With
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,191	| IOT147 |	A chip
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:16,799	| IOT147 |	So you buy this chip and all of the hard stuff is done on the security
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:18,591	| IOT147 |	You then enable your blockchain
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:22,175	| IOT147 |	Whichever one you want Sports ethereal and it supports
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,199	| IOT147 |	Bitcoin it support
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:24,479	| IOT147 |	Others
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:27,039	| IOT147 |	And then you've got to weigh to basically build this into a system
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:32,159	| IOT147 |	Yeah it is and I'm the security side of things
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,951	| IOT147 |	I think it's more along the lines
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:37,791	| IOT147 |	Being able to feel comfortable that whatever
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:40,095	| IOT147 |	Code is supposed to run on that device and
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:41,375	| IOT147 |	Sensor is
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,655	| IOT147 |	Legitimate trusted
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,167	| IOT147 |	Code
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,447	| IOT147 |	Meaning
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:50,847	| IOT147 |	Nobody could mess with the firmware or the colonel or anything else because obviously been anything that happened
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:54,687	| IOT147 |	Your packets of data could be siphoned off to somewhere else and somebody's getting that information so
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:18:01,599	| IOT147 |	If they manage that it's I think it's almost like a Chromebook can't wait to always secure because the special chip inside checks
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:03,391	| IOT147 |	To make sure it's secure and running the most
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,183	| IOT147 |	Current validsoft
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:05,951	| IOT147 |	Work basically
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:12,095	| IOT147 |	Yes they are doing deals so they run as a trusted execution environment for both Intel
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,375	| IOT147 |	And
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:13,887	| IOT147 |	The arms.
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:17,983	| IOT147 |	Arm-based chips
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:22,591	| IOT147 |	They also so that the chip design is an existing silicon they
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,639	| IOT147 |	Put a microcontroller
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:28,223	| IOT147 |	But that's the kind of combined it a different way so they put a microcontroller on there
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:30,527	| IOT147 |	Solopower low processing
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:32,831	| IOT147 |	The Odyssey real flash storage they have
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,343	| IOT147 |	Handle some of the
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:34,367	| IOT147 |	Reads and writes
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:39,743	| IOT147 |	And then a cryptographic key storage and an engine so there's a co-processor doing all the
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:40,511	| IOT147 |	Photography
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,535	| IOT147 |	Then again that's good for
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,607	| IOT147 |	So I think this is really
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:46,143	| IOT147 |	Really exciting
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:52,031	| IOT147 |	They've been developing this for like the last five years but actually just last year arm announced
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:53,567	| IOT147 |	The thing we're going to be able to put
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:57,663	| IOT147 |	A trusted execution environment on their microcontrollers
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:19:01,759	| IOT147 |	So before that this didn't even exist so these guys were building it ahead of the big
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:04,319	| IOT147 |	Japan during the space which is armed
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,087	| IOT147 |	So
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,111	| IOT147 |	It's really
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:06,879	| IOT147 |	I just really
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:11,231	| IOT147 |	It's one of them that I noticed in their white paper
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:14,303	| IOT147 |	They said they're saying the currency involved
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:19,423	| IOT147 |	For now for the people who are doing the the hashing and verifying all the information that comes through
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,447	| IOT147 |	The blockchain
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:25,311	| IOT147 |	It's Exchange in private side chains that are separate from the public Bitcoin blockchain
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:25,823	| IOT147 |	Therefore
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:30,687	| IOT147 |	These are shielded from bitcoin's transaction cost which can be very high when you talk about
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:35,807	| IOT147 |	Millions of iot devices using something like this transaction cause you to have to watch that
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,623	| IOT147 |	So that is another interesting aspect to me
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:41,183	| IOT147 |	Alright so that's our
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:41,695	| IOT147 |	Blockchain
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:43,231	| IOT147 |	Blah blah blah
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,535	| IOT147 |	Talk for the day
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,327	| IOT147 |	Let's go to
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,095	| IOT147 |	Some quick news
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,655	| IOT147 |	Will Kevin
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,679	| IOT147 |	Did you watch the Viking
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:58,079	| IOT147 |	I did and it was down to the final play of the game
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:03,455	| IOT147 |	The Saints to lose it but Vikings want it and what happened was
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:05,759	| IOT147 |	It was so much back and forth towards the tail end of that
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:11,135	| IOT147 |	Apple watches for telling people that they might be having heart attacks
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:16,511	| IOT147 |	I love this story because it is like it's an example of Wind Lake
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:20,351	| IOT147 |	The mass phenomenon of like sports and all that meets our custom data
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:23,423	| IOT147 |	Highly personalized data effort
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:24,959	| IOT147 |	We're all the same
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:26,239	| IOT147 |	So did you rap
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:28,543	| IOT147 |	Where you at Vesta
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:35,455	| IOT147 |	No I wasn't that vested in the game and it was a good game I watched it and saw the final play but no
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:38,015	| IOT147 |	Mine did not I'm kind of disappointed in this sense
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:38,527	| IOT147 |	I guess
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:43,903	| IOT147 |	When the Apple watch to text your resting but then your heart rate is above 120 beats per minute
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:48,767	| IOT147 |	That's when it send you your little alert which is super handy I love it I think it's great
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:51,583	| IOT147 |	But obviously in this case it was not a valid use
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:52,607	| IOT147 |	There we go
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,263	| IOT147 |	Moving outside
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:02,079	| IOT147 |	But still in a TV ish Realm
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:05,919	| IOT147 |	Comcast we talked about this Sunday special CES edition of the iot
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,711	| IOT147 |	It's worth mentioning here
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:09,247	| IOT147 |	Comcast
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:09,759	| IOT147 |	Is
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:12,575	| IOT147 |	They bought stringify and they are now
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:16,159	| IOT147 |	Allowing for home automation for up to 15 million household
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:20,512	| IOT147 |	So hey if you're in one of those 15 million households you should totally be listening to us
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:22,560	| IOT147 |	Talk about automation
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:23,840	| IOT147 |	But
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:29,728	| IOT147 |	This is a big deal this is how they're going to use stringify and if you're stringify user like me and not in the country
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,240	| IOT147 |	Cast household
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:32,032	| IOT147 |	You don't have to worry because
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:34,080	| IOT147 |	Cuz they're still supporting stringify for
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:34,592	| IOT147 |	Other user
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:42,272	| IOT147 |	If you don't like stringify you could try to do it with you know me but stringify is incredibly complicated and can let you do a lot of really
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,320	| IOT147 |	But again
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:45,856	| IOT147 |	Comcast
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:53,024	| IOT147 |	I was actually going to ask you but I waited until you brought up the stringify bit if you could only pick one third party app
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:55,840	| IOT147 |	Right now to use with home automation I you know me
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,400	| IOT147 |	Struvite what would it be
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:04,288	| IOT147 |	Yeah I would have to go through what devices probably would be my first step
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:05,824	| IOT147 |	Second step
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,104	| IOT147 |	Oh
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:10,176	| IOT147 |	I probably would go with you know me
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:14,528	| IOT147 |	Because they have some nice automation features but I haven't use stringify since
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:16,576	| IOT147 |	Since Comcast started fiddling with
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:17,088	| IOT147 |	That so I don't know if
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:19,392	| IOT147 |	Change Street
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:24,512	| IOT147 |	It's a it's not as into it as I think I think you know me is much more to it is
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,816	| IOT147 |	So I I would tend to agree with him right there
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:27,584	| IOT147 |	And if
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:30,400	| IOT147 |	They've added more complexity but it's still not
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:31,424	| IOT147 |	It's not to the level I was
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:35,008	| IOT147 |	But for normal people I would totally recommend using IF
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,360	| IOT147 |	Okay
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:43,200	| IOT147 |	Mossy BMW has acquired parkmobile
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:45,760	| IOT147 |	Which is a an app that helps you find
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:46,528	| IOT147 |	Parking
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:48,576	| IOT147 |	I cannot wait till I have sensors or
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:51,648	| IOT147 |	Sensors embedded under every parking space or maybe cameras
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:55,744	| IOT147 |	Use computer vision to tell me where parking spaces are so I do not have to Circle
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:56,256	| IOT147 |	Roblox
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:23:02,912	| IOT147 |	And even better I would like to see my car work with blockchain to automatically just make a
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:03,936	| IOT147 |	Machine machine
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,984	| IOT147 |	Purchase for my parking so I don't have
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:08,288	| IOT147 |	How to do it
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:15,712	| IOT147 |	And since we're on the subject of vehicles and self-driving cars that's worth noting that
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,992	| IOT147 |	Blackberry just launched
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:19,296	| IOT147 |	A new cybersecurity software
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,832	| IOT147 |	For these vehicles
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,368	| IOT147 |	It did this earlier this week
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:25,952	| IOT147 |	And it's interesting it's called Jarvis which is kind of a bummer cuz Jarvis
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:26,720	| IOT147 |	There's like
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:27,488	| IOT147 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,000	| IOT147 |	And awesome
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:33,120	| IOT147 |	Yeah and those aren't words that I would equate with Blackberry no offense Blackberry fans
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:33,632	| IOT147 |	China
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:35,424	| IOT147 |	Just not feeling it
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:39,776	| IOT147 |	In any case Blackberry Jarvis is going to be marketed towards automakers
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:40,800	| IOT147 |	And it's not
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:45,664	| IOT147 |	This is interesting it's not security running on the vehicle itself
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:50,784	| IOT147 |	It's actually software to help the software designers
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:52,832	| IOT147 |	Check for issues and security
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:56,160	| IOT147 |	Potential issues as they're developing software for self driving cars
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:59,744	| IOT147 |	And that makes a lot of sense I was a QA manager for
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:02,048	| IOT147 |	Wait a while myself for business and
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,584	| IOT147 |	It is so much
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:07,680	| IOT147 |	Cheaper to catch these types of issues well before things go out in production
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,728	| IOT147 |	The sooner in the life cycle that you
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:13,568	| IOT147 |	Attach an issue or potential issue security problem whatever maybe
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,128	| IOT147 |	It's so much cheaper so
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:20,480	| IOT147 |	This does two things it reduces the cost of software development in general
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:22,528	| IOT147 |	Because fixing something later is going to cost a ton of money
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:27,648	| IOT147 |	And two it should improve the security of the software that's used in the
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:28,928	| IOT147 |	Autonomous vehicles
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:32,256	| IOT147 |	Do you think Blackberry can make it come around to come back with the autofocus with
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:33,792	| IOT147 |	Everything
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:35,584	| IOT147 |	Sue
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,352	| IOT147 |	I would say
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:37,888	| IOT147 |	Probably
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:41,984	| IOT147 |	I mean anything can happen they've obviously gotten out of the hardware business
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:43,520	| IOT147 |	Is there still BlackBerry
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:45,824	| IOT147 |	Handsets that are made but those are made by
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:46,848	| IOT147 |	Alcatel One
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:48,128	| IOT147 |	TCL I believe in
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:48,640	| IOT147 |	Just Brandon
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:49,920	| IOT147 |	BlackBerry
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:56,320	| IOT147 |	They're focused on services and software and actually you know they have long been in this business and they know software
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:57,088	| IOT147 |	Security
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:58,112	| IOT147 |	I do think so
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:25:02,208	| IOT147 |	I really I really do that mean never be as big as they were back in their heyday
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:06,304	| IOT147 |	But I do think they will survive and slowly thrive
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:10,400	| IOT147 |	And final bit of small news4u Sierra Wireless has a new module
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:13,728	| IOT147 |	And why are we telling you this because it's actually a very exciting much
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:18,336	| IOT147 |	It has a 15-year battery life which is
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:19,104	| IOT147 |	Very impressive
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:21,664	| IOT147 |	And it can work on NB iot
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:24,224	| IOT147 |	Katem networks and
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:28,064	| IOT147 |	Fall back for 2G so this is the kind of module you would see in smart cities
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:30,112	| IOT147 |	Having that 15 year life
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:32,928	| IOT147 |	Really gives it the ability
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:33,440	| IOT147 |	2
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:36,000	| IOT147 |	Desiigner the ability to
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:41,632	| IOT147 |	Put this on a bridge for example in a hard-to-reach place because you're not going to want to come back out there every year
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:42,656	| IOT147 |	5 years to
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,168	| IOT147 |	Replace it
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:45,728	| IOT147 |	So you can have things measuring likes
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:47,008	| IOT147 |	Tension
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,056	| IOT147 |	Vibration Zoe
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,848	| IOT147 |	Tell when something's about to fail
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,128	| IOT147 |	So I thought this was actually
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:55,200	| IOT147 |	It's kind of dirty but it's also really interesting
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:55,712	| IOT147 |	Fort Apache
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:26:03,392	| IOT147 |	Yeah and it's currently sampling right now it's not available it will be available in the third quarter of this year is the presumption but I agree
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:06,208	| IOT147 |	Pretty for something that doesn't send a lot of data
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:07,488	| IOT147 |	That is
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:08,256	| IOT147 |	Remote
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:10,304	| IOT147 |	You know not something easily accessible
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:12,352	| IOT147 |	15 your battery life is very impressed
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:13,888	| IOT147 |	Yay
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,680	| IOT147 |	All right let us move
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:17,472	| IOT147 |	To our voicemail
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:19,008	| IOT147 |	Call from a listener this week
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:22,336	| IOT147 |	Just a reminder if you want to ask us a
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:22,848	| IOT147 |	A question
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:25,408	| IOT147 |	Give us a call at 5 1/2
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:26,688	| IOT147 |	6 to 3
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,712	| IOT147 |	7 4
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:28,224	| IOT147 |	To 4
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:29,504	| IOT147 |	And
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:30,272	| IOT147 |	Here we go
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:33,600	| IOT147 |	Hey Kevin and Stacey love the show
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,880	| IOT147 |	Really like the balance
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:37,184	| IOT147 |	What you guys to bring a different devices
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,208	| IOT147 |	Technology
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,512	| IOT147 |	Change so quickly
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:42,560	| IOT147 |	My question for you guys is
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:44,096	| IOT147 |	Do you think about
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:48,960	| IOT147 |	Safety a personal health safety police devices be connected
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:53,312	| IOT147 |	Admissions of different waves back and forth
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:55,104	| IOT147 |	Bluetooth technology research
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:56,128	| IOT147 |	Who sings I'm
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:59,712	| IOT147 |	Going down this journey with smart devices and a part of me wonders
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:02,528	| IOT147 |	How much faster are going to get cancer because of this
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:03,808	| IOT147 |	Hope to hear from you
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:04,832	| IOT147 |	Thanks a lot
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:06,624	| IOT147 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:10,208	| IOT147 |	This is a question that I almost feel guilty that I haven't
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:11,488	| IOT147 |	Really thought about
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:12,768	| IOT147 |	So
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:15,584	| IOT147 |	Will a
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:16,608	| IOT147 |	It's a good question
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:20,192	| IOT147 |	My initial take is you know with smartphone something that's
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:22,496	| IOT147 |	Cellular radio waves and its next year
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,776	| IOT147 |	Your brain basically
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:30,176	| IOT147 |	We do have a measurement program it's the SAR testing to determine how much radiation is coming off that device
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:36,576	| IOT147 |	That could impact you physically we don't in the home I'm not as concerned we don't have any testing for that
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:37,344	| IOT147 |	Any formal test
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:38,624	| IOT147 |	Should say
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:42,464	| IOT147 |	But I'm not as concerned I mean we've had Wi-Fi forever not forever but for
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:44,256	| IOT147 |	Two decades whenever
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:46,304	| IOT147 |	People still wear Bluetooth headsets
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:48,352	| IOT147 |	Switch I think you have star ratings
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:49,120	| IOT147 |	By the way
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:53,216	| IOT147 |	Just with the devices in our house I'm just not concerned about that
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:54,240	| IOT147 |	Maybe I should be
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,520	| IOT147 |	But I haven't seen any
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:28:01,920	| IOT147 |	Danger signs any studies that say Hey you shouldn't have all these wireless devices in the home so again
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:02,944	| IOT147 |	I'm not overly concerned
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:04,480	| IOT147 |	Okay well
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:08,320	| IOT147 |	That was this week's question again if you have a question and want to stop us
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,344	| IOT147 |	Or
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,136	| IOT147 |	Can the pinyin
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:15,232	| IOT147 |	Possibly a knowledgeable opinion
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:15,744	| IOT147 |	Possibly.
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,560	| IOT147 |	6 to 3
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:19,584	| IOT147 |	7 4
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:20,096	| IOT147 |	To 4
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,376	| IOT147 |	And now
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,912	| IOT147 |	Stay tuned for our
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:25,216	| IOT147 |	Guess who is going to talk to us about
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:25,984	| IOT147 |	5G
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:27,520	| IOT147 |	Low-power wide area Networks
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:28,032	| IOT147 |	And
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:32,384	| IOT147 |	How we should think about regulation in this new era where data is King
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:39,808	| IOT147 |	And now a message from our sponsor hey everyone we're taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:46,208	| IOT147 |	Read message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Central and I have Sean Miller president
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:47,232	| IOT147 |	Here to talk to us
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:51,328	| IOT147 |	Tell us just a little bit about what point Central does
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:55,424	| IOT147 |	1 Central in the Metro what we always were the leading provider

EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:03,104	| IOT147 |	We've been in business for about five years and where are you supposed to re-up alarm.com
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:06,176	| IOT147 |	Collectively Pete of substantive alarm.com Adidas a lot of
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:07,456	| IOT147 |	What time is it
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:08,736	| IOT147 |	We have expensive
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:11,040	| IOT147 |	Experience working with property managers
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:13,600	| IOT147 |	As well as the ability to really be a long-term partner
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:14,112	| IOT147 |	Pop emoji
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:17,184	| IOT147 |	Smart Home Solutions
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:22,048	| IOT147 |	All right you guys offer a bunch of products from big-name vendors like Amazon
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:24,096	| IOT147 |	OGE Lutron
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,376	| IOT147 |	Google home nest

EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:30,752	| IOT147 |	And so what's the advantage of bringing all of these well-known consumer brands
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:31,776	| IOT147 |	Together under the
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:32,288	| IOT147 |	Point Central
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:35,616	| IOT147 |	So we're interested and had a tough time
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:37,408	| IOT147 |	Getting smart home devices

EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,128	| IOT147 |	First
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:18,432	| IOT147 |	I really would love for you to break down
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:21,504	| IOT147 |	Since you've been doing this for a really really really long time

EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:38,400	| IOT147 |	Emanated from
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:40,448	| IOT147 |	The notion of where the next
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:41,984	| IOT147 |	Generation of Revenue is going to come from

EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:03,488	| IOT147 |	Good point where
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:04,768	| IOT147 |	Spelling in Many Nations
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:06,560	| IOT147 |	And then I'll just
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:07,328	| IOT147 |	Country experience
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:09,120	| IOT147 |	Indira
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:13,216	| IOT147 |	But eventually even the deer has grown little peep and Deborah

EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:18,592	| IOT147 |	Meaning the next cycle of innovation as well as Revenue generation
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:20,384	| IOT147 |	Have to be focused on
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:23,456	| IOT147 |	Anthem of Pakistan
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:24,736	| IOT147 |	Adopted the framework

EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:35,232	| IOT147 |	And so the notion of course
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:39,584	| IOT147 |	That while you focus on your bread-and-butter business of providing access
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:42,400	| IOT147 |	Is going to come from
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:45,728	| IOT147 |	Like advertising or like
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:47,776	| IOT147 |	What's security
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:50,080	| IOT147 |	Verticals like healthcare
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:50,848	| IOT147 |	Nutella
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:53,664	| IOT147 |	Until under the broad umbrella
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:59,296	| IOT147 |	Also invite other
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:01,600	| IOT147 |	By the way others to the ecosystem
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:03,136	| IOT147 |	Populist have to compete
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:04,160	| IOT147 |	Very differently
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:04,672	| IOT147 |	Then they have

EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:14,400	| IOT147 |	What do you mean
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:16,704	| IOT147 |	They have to really figure out

EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:13,088	| IOT147 |	Actually funny
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:15,648	| IOT147 |	Let's talk about the edge specifically
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:17,440	| IOT147 |	How we're going to
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:21,024	| IOT147 |	Connectivity to all of these sensors at
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:23,328	| IOT147 |	There is a
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:27,424	| IOT147 |	It's still ongoing debate about which low-power wide area network
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,448	| IOT147 |	Work for you
EDL	00:37:29,216	00:37:30,496	| IOT147 |	And we got
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:32,032	| IOT147 |	Proprietary companies
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:35,104	| IOT147 |	6 public radio reference
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:39,456	| IOT147 |	Help us
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:41,504	| IOT147 |	Make sense of
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:43,808	| IOT147 |	Yasso
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:48,160	| IOT147 |	Iot as you might realize it's already used
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:48,928	| IOT147 |	Epix
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:50,208	| IOT147 |	And so
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:52,256	| IOT147 |	Anastasia look like almost Park
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:54,816	| IOT147 |	And so it really comes down to requirements
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:55,584	| IOT147 |	And the Sun rises
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:38:00,192	| IOT147 |	So if somebody is looking for a Time rising of 2 years to 5 years
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:01,984	| IOT147 |	It might require and
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:02,752	| IOT147 |	August
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:06,336	| IOT147 |	If you are looking for 5

EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:10,944	| IOT147 |	Damn you might deploy
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:12,224	| IOT147 |	Different strategy
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:12,992	| IOT147 |	I'm so
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:17,088	| IOT147 |	Ecosystem provides a very compelling Sparrow

EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:25,024	| IOT147 |	You can be up and running
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:27,584	| IOT147 |	To address
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:28,352	| IOT147 |	Problem
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:34,240	| IOT147 |	And in those cases security might not be a consideration
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:35,520	| IOT147 |	Or updating
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:36,800	| IOT147 |	And the sensors
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:38,080	| IOT147 |	Tesla software
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:40,896	| IOT147 |	Might not be a critical element
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:43,456	| IOT147 |	You might consider going
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:46,528	| IOT147 |	Unlicensed in areas that require internet
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,600	| IOT147 |	Oregon police

EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:53,184	| IOT147 |	And you need to update or Cara
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:56,512	| IOT147 |	An update

EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:05,472	| IOT147 |	Is also
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:06,752	| IOT147 |	The number of players on China
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:09,824	| IOT147 |	Is investing in a project that requires
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:12,128	| IOT147 |	Investment
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:16,480	| IOT147 |	They would be safer to go away
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:17,760	| IOT147 |	Longer than song
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:21,344	| IOT147 |	Thumbs down to a number of factors for a given project

EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:30,304	| IOT147 |	And in the number of the cases going to be the Laurel and six packs of the world
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:31,072	| IOT147 |	Because
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:32,864	| IOT147 |	Really low car
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:35,424	| IOT147 |	An important occasion

EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:40,544	| IOT147 |	And so if I'm asking myself questions
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:42,336	| IOT147 |	Something about 10
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:44,640	| IOT147 |	It sounds like I should think about security
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:45,920	| IOT147 |	Longevity of my product
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:47,200	| IOT147 |	Cost
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:48,480	| IOT147 |	And
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:48,992	| IOT147 |	Any others
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:53,856	| IOT147 |	Do you know how many suppliers can you have
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:55,136	| IOT147 |	And the type of modules might be
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:39:57,184	| IOT147 |	Hanukkah celebration
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:39:59,232	| IOT147 |	Can be done
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:01,280	| IOT147 |	Yo what's the projection for
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:02,304	| IOT147 |	Ditto evolution
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:07,168	| IOT147 |	Because it could be
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:08,192	| IOT147 |	Increase in 5 years
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:09,472	| IOT147 |	Then
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:11,776	| IOT147 |	Project
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:15,360	| IOT147 |	So you have to kind of plan out
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:19,200	| IOT147 |	Spreadsheet and database
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:22,272	| IOT147 |	Scenarios and that'll help you narrow down
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:26,368	| IOT147 |	Which wire is orbit technology on my Toshiba
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:29,184	| IOT147 |	Is part of this
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:31,232	| IOT147 |	I feel like you also have to ask
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:33,024	| IOT147 |	Carriers want to do business
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:35,584	| IOT147 |	It's still an ongoing complaint
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:37,120	| IOT147 |	Surprising
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,656	| IOT147 |	A lot of companies
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:40,448	| IOT147 |	We're doing work on Prototype
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:41,984	| IOT147 |	Or even smaller companies

EDL	00:40:44,032	00:40:44,800	| IOT147 |	Based
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:45,824	| IOT147 |	Products
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:47,872	| IOT147 |	Very hard time talking to the
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:50,944	| IOT147 |	What role do you think carriers need to
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:51,456	| IOT147 |	To play with
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:54,016	| IOT147 |	Backing this innovation
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:55,040	| IOT147 |	Younger
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:41:00,416	| IOT147 |	Nothing depends on what country
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:05,024	| IOT147 |	Somebody like you
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:07,840	| IOT147 |	Dabbing dealing with

EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:18,080	| IOT147 |	And so if you think
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:21,920	| IOT147 |	Bonita Park activity or want to get a module
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:23,968	| IOT147 |	American Senior Verizon whoever it is

EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:54,687	| IOT147 |	Speed of how China
EDL	00:41:54,687	00:41:55,199	| IOT147 |	Like to work
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:57,247	| IOT147 |	Let's move over to
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,015	| IOT147 |	Regulation
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:58,783	| IOT147 |	Because
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:42:03,903	| IOT147 |	Gosh I feel like this was a couple years ago but you published a really insightful publication
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:06,207	| IOT147 |	About how we should think about regulation
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:07,231	| IOT147 |	In the digital age
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:09,791	| IOT147 |	Do you want to give me an overview
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:11,583	| IOT147 |	Yeah sure
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:15,679	| IOT147 |	Current regulatory regime
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:16,703	| IOT147 |	Countries
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:20,287	| IOT147 |	Is really based on 30-40 your idea of regulating
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:23,871	| IOT147 |	And subsequently the internet provider
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:30,783	| IOT147 |	GameWorks

EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:59,199	| IOT147 |	Really
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:01,503	| IOT147 |	The problem
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:03,295	| IOT147 |	I'm not doing that
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:06,623	| IOT147 |	In the sense that if you look at

EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:08,927	| IOT147 |	I mean from the ecosystem
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:11,743	| IOT147 |	It used to be 85% of the revenue
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:13,535	| IOT147 |	In the wireless Market used to be coming
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:17,119	| IOT147 |	And now that has dropped down to less than 50
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:20,191	| IOT147 |	The new growth
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:21,727	| IOT147 |	Clearly coming from

EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:49,631	| IOT147 |	The most important component
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:52,191	| IOT147 |	By their own admission did Aizen uol
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:53,983	| IOT147 |	But apparently they're not
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:55,519	| IOT147 |	Article about house

EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:19,839	| IOT147 |	And so the papers price
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:28,543	| IOT147 |	Got it okay so we're going to break some of this down but we talked about things at the access layer probably the most well-known
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:32,383	| IOT147 |	Neutrality
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:35,199	| IOT147 |	Under your ideas do you think net neutrality
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:36,223	| IOT147 |	Still needs to
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:40,831	| IOT147 |	Exist
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:44,927	| IOT147 |	Layers in the ecosystem need to be very transparent about
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:46,719	| IOT147 |	How did Adidas
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:48,767	| IOT147 |	And the mystical concept
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:49,535	| IOT147 |	Me too
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:50,815	| IOT147 |	Mature
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:53,119	| IOT147 |	Frontpageafrica
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:58,751	| IOT147 |	Amazon denying consumers Google
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:04,127	| IOT147 |	Or vice versa in motion of the 9th
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:06,431	| IOT147 |	And so I think it's a really
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:07,711	| IOT147 |	Be honest about
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:08,735	| IOT147 |	Net neutrality
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:10,783	| IOT147 |	It shouldn't go up and down the chain
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:12,319	| IOT147 |	But only for certain things
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:14,111	| IOT147 |	I mean it doesn't make sense
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:15,903	| IOT147 |	PS of course
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:23,071	| IOT147 |	Who have a massive platform
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:24,607	| IOT147 |	Breakfast on big one
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:27,935	| IOT147 |	Or Android
EDL	00:45:27,935	00:45:29,727	| IOT147 |	Are back from life awf
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:32,543	| IOT147 |	That you be transparent and be equal
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:33,311	| IOT147 |	Everybody
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:39,711	| IOT147 |	Albuquerque, new players that are coming on
EDL	00:45:43,551	00:45:46,367	| IOT147 |	And responsibility after you go to a certain time
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:48,415	| IOT147 |	That are you be confident than welcome to
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:52,767	| IOT147 |	And so do you think it's
EDL	00:45:52,767	00:45:57,887	| IOT147 |	A size like number of users would be the threshold is it dependent on the type of platform
EDL	00:45:57,887	00:45:58,399	| IOT147 |	Is it
EDL	00:45:59,167	00:45:59,935	| IOT147 |	There's so many ways to
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:01,215	| IOT147 |	This cat as it were
EDL	00:46:01,727	00:46:04,287	| IOT147 |	Yeah I mean I don't know what the right
EDL	00:46:04,799	00:46:05,567	| IOT147 |	What I would like to
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:09,407	| IOT147 |	Steers motivate about it as to what the right answer car
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:13,759	| IOT147 |	And my pimples are and how should Dental Community think about
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:14,783	| IOT147 |	Having
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:18,367	| IOT147 |	But clearly you don't want you to say
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:22,975	| IOT147 |	Probably different
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:23,999	| IOT147 |	Fly
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:27,071	| IOT147 |	Emmanuel covering maybe 5 or 10%.
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:27,839	| IOT147 |	Saturday

EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:31,423	| IOT147 |	And because of that added
EDL	00:46:31,935	00:46:32,703	| IOT147 |	Cyberbass
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:34,239	| IOT147 |	The added responsibility
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:36,543	| IOT147 |	Not everybody is willing to
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:37,311	| IOT147 |	Going up to

EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:57,535	| IOT147 |	Yeah so I think they're thinking about how they want to be
EDL	00:46:57,535	00:46:58,047	| IOT147 |	And
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:46:59,327	| IOT147 |	Yeah they have
EDL	00:47:01,631	00:47:04,447	| IOT147 |	If it is indeed the new oil
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:05,983	| IOT147 |	Or if it's the new
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:08,287	| IOT147 |	Instead of Revenue stream for giving Nation
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:10,591	| IOT147 |	Then we should figure out how to
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:11,615	| IOT147 |	20
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:12,639	| IOT147 |	And they doesn't get abused
