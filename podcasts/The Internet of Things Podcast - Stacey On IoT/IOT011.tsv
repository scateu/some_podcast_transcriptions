EDL	00:00:08,960	00:00:11,776	| IOT011 |	Hey everybody Welcome to The Internet of Things show
EDL	00:00:12,544	00:00:14,592	| IOT011 |	This is Stacey Higginbotham and my co-host
EDL	00:00:15,104	00:00:15,872	| IOT011 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:15,872	00:00:21,760	| IOT011 |	And we are coming to you today from lovely New York city so I'm going to apologize if you hear honking or text
EDL	00:00:21,760	00:00:22,784	| IOT011 |	Tcaps in the background
EDL	00:00:23,296	00:00:24,576	| IOT011 |	I'm not in my studio
EDL	00:00:25,088	00:00:25,856	| IOT011 |	It Kevin
EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:27,392	| IOT011 |	What's your excuse for the day
EDL	00:00:27,904	00:00:31,744	| IOT011 |	It's early in the morning that you woke me up for this ship
EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:33,792	| IOT011 |	I have no excuse now
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:39,424	| IOT011 |	It's very early in the morning for Kevin so let's let's talk a little slower today we'll take it a little easier
EDL	00:00:40,704	00:00:41,728	| IOT011 |	Starting off with
EDL	00:00:41,728	00:00:42,752	| IOT011 |	The big news this is
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:44,288	| IOT011 |	The day after
EDL	00:00:44,800	00:00:45,312	| IOT011 |	Apple's big
EDL	00:00:45,824	00:00:47,104	| IOT011 |	Keto diet at
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:49,920	| IOT011 |	W is a WWDC
EDL	00:00:49,920	00:00:51,200	| IOT011 |	DC
EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:56,320	| IOT011 |	It's WWDC worldwide and appleland is one Kit Kat needed word
EDL	00:00:56,320	00:00:57,600	| IOT011 |	Okay that's what I thought
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:00,928	| IOT011 |	Someone the other day was trying to tell me otherwise
EDL	00:01:02,208	00:01:02,976	| IOT011 |	It's not
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:04,256	| IOT011 |	So this is the day after
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:06,304	| IOT011 |	WWDC
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:07,328	| IOT011 |	And
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,120	| IOT011 |	I was looking for a lot
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:11,680	| IOT011 |	A lot of news around homekit
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:14,752	| IOT011 |	As you guys probably could tell having listened to our previous two shows
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:16,544	| IOT011 |	And Kevin
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:18,336	| IOT011 |	Do we get any news around homekit
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:19,616	| IOT011 |	We got bikers
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:22,176	| IOT011 |	We did we got
EDL	00:01:22,688	00:01:24,736	| IOT011 |	How do you say we got very little
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:26,528	| IOT011 |	And now you're right you're right
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:28,832	| IOT011 |	It's the bikini was very
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:35,232	| IOT011 |	Pactiv a lot to talk about but the focus was not on homekit for sure it was certainly on iOS 9
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:37,536	| IOT011 |	IOS 1011
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:40,096	| IOT011 |	Apple pay in Saint sauveur
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:46,240	| IOT011 |	Don't get really barely got a mention there was talk of the new devices that are currently available and then
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:51,616	| IOT011 |	They turn more towards the future and said here is what we're going to have funeral homes
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:54,176	| IOT011 |	Punk it will be able to support window blinds and
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:58,528	| IOT011 |	Other sensors and you'll be able to remotely access your homekit
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:01:59,296	| IOT011 |	Devices
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:00,320	| IOT011 |	Through iCloud
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:04,160	| IOT011 |	Which is interested in say through your Apple TV because we found out last week
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:06,464	| IOT011 |	That is one of the ways you will actually do that
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:08,512	| IOT011 |	True and actually there was no apple.
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,024	| IOT011 |	TV news
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,560	| IOT011 |	Again Butkus
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,072	| IOT011 |	Nothing
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:13,376	| IOT011 |	They did have the streaming media service
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,656	| IOT011 |	So
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:16,192	| IOT011 |	I actually talk to you
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:21,056	| IOT011 |	Stewart Lombard who is the CEO of ecobee because I was very
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:21,568	| IOT011 |	Curious
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:26,176	| IOT011 |	About the ecobee last show we speculated originally that the ecobee
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:28,224	| IOT011 |	3 which was going to be homekit supported
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:31,296	| IOT011 |	It would get an over-the-air software update cuz that
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:33,088	| IOT011 |	Made the most sense for my perspective
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:40,000	| IOT011 |	Especially considering they launched this thermostat in September 2014 after homekit was even announced
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:44,352	| IOT011 |	What we found out later and we had a correction on the show was that
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:46,400	| IOT011 |	Actually
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:49,216	| IOT011 |	You have to buy a new one and people were not
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:50,496	| IOT011 |	Happy
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,264	| IOT011 |	No
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:54,848	| IOT011 |	And I can understand that means spending a $250 on a thermostat
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:03:00,736	| IOT011 |	Install a gate in your house and then realizing it less than a year later it's basically not going to be
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,016	| IOT011 |	Compatible with homekit
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:04,576	| IOT011 |	If we get something that's important to you that
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,344	| IOT011 |	That's a real bummer
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:11,232	| IOT011 |	I I would agree with you let me here's a question and not and it's okay if you don't know the answer I don't know the answer either but
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:18,144	| IOT011 |	Yes we know that Apple announced the homekit platform look at last year's WWDC so last May or June I forget which month
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:18,656	| IOT011 |	It was last year
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:25,824	| IOT011 |	And it's been talking to her partners and so on and so forth and has the homekit certification program and there's a little hunk it logo for
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:26,848	| IOT011 |	For that certification program
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:33,248	| IOT011 |	Did ecobee and other Hardware partners that matter have the homekit logo on the products that they've been selling up to this point
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,272	| IOT011 |	I'm betting not
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:35,296	| IOT011 |	No they haven't
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:39,648	| IOT011 |	So ecobee basically it was one of the first four devices
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,928	| IOT011 |	I got certified last week
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:43,232	| IOT011 |	The others with a Lutron
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:45,024	| IOT011 |	Specific Lutron hub
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,304	| IOT011 |	Specific insteon hub
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:48,864	| IOT011 |	Is it alegado
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,400	| IOT011 |	A group of sensors
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:55,008	| IOT011 |	That will not be back out or they will not be on the market anytime soon
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:57,568	| IOT011 |	In talking to Stewart because
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:04:02,688	| IOT011 |	I heard enough complaints from people I was I was like I got to talk to this guy and figure out what's going on
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:03,968	| IOT011 |	He told me
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:07,040	| IOT011 |	But what happened was sometime after
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,064	| IOT011 |	After CES
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,600	| IOT011 |	Basically
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,368	| IOT011 |	Apple
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:16,768	| IOT011 |	Made up its mind and went with the hardware-based security solution which meant that the existing products
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:20,607	| IOT011 |	Existing ecobee3 products on the market we're not going to be upgradable
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:23,935	| IOT011 |	Obviously he was very disappointed by that he said
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,983	| IOT011 |	He said he thought about it but
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,263	| IOT011 |	He wanted to get his product
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:30,591	| IOT011 |	Updated it out and certified by Apple
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:34,687	| IOT011 |	And he was acknowledging that his other users are going to be kind of left out in
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,455	| IOT011 |	Nicole
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,223	| IOT011 |	But
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:37,247	| IOT011 |	They're still going to get
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:39,039	| IOT011 |	Updates for all the other stuff
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:39,551	| IOT011 |	It's just not home
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:42,879	| IOT011 |	It's definitely a catch-22 for any
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:46,207	| IOT011 |	Hardware maker or device maker this space because you
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:50,559	| IOT011 |	Don't want to upset your existing customer base they're the ones that are helping you move forward to begin with
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:55,167	| IOT011 |	But you don't want to miss the opportunity being one of the first quarter quell first people to
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,703	| IOT011 |	You know p
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:59,519	| IOT011 |	Certified and be in the Apple store and have
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,543	| IOT011 |	That wide
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:03,103	| IOT011 |	Range of availability at such a tough call
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,407	| IOT011 |	Exactly he hears a quote from
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:06,175	| IOT011 |	Storage
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:06,943	| IOT011 |	He told me
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:10,783	| IOT011 |	We could have held back on homekit and left our existing model in the market
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:14,111	| IOT011 |	But we wanted to involve the platform as quickly as possible
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:18,975	| IOT011 |	No matter when we decided to do the upgrade there is always going to be someone who bought the
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:20,255	| IOT011 |	The products last month
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:21,791	| IOT011 |	It's true
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:22,303	| IOT011 |	It's true
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:24,607	| IOT011 |	So the reason
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,911	| IOT011 |	Herb for anybody
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:28,447	| IOT011 |	What is this
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:31,519	| IOT011 |	It looks like it boils down to Apple security
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:34,591	| IOT011 |	Its or at least in this case Lombard said that
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:38,687	| IOT011 |	Apple required a security coprocessor to actually be in the device
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:40,991	| IOT011 |	And they open till
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,783	| IOT011 |	Currently January when they told
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,575	| IOT011 |	Ecobee said it wouldn't be
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:47,903	| IOT011 |	Supper a credible they were going back and forth like
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:51,231	| IOT011 |	Would it be software upgradable or would it have to be Hardware
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:54,303	| IOT011 |	And apparently Apple chose Hardware with his co-processor
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:58,399	| IOT011 |	And that actually has big ramifications because it sounds like
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:01,727	| IOT011 |	That wasn't actually known until after CES
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:05,567	| IOT011 |	So when I talk to Philips the makers of the hue light bulbs at CVS
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:11,199	| IOT011 |	They implied strongly that their customers would have access or their customers would be upgradable
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,991	| IOT011 |	They didn't come out and say it
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:17,855	| IOT011 |	But the implied very strongly that their customers who are their existing customers
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:18,879	| IOT011 |	Wouldn't have problems
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:19,391	| IOT011 |	Switch homekit
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,439	| IOT011 |	What's actually happen
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,487	| IOT011 |	Philips hue light bulbs
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,535	| IOT011 |	They're homekit certified that hoe
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:26,815	| IOT011 |	Whole package won't come out
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:27,583	| IOT011 |	Until September
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:30,655	| IOT011 |	And it is going to require new hardware
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:31,935	| IOT011 |	Black Phillip says
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:34,239	| IOT011 |	They will make sure that their existing
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:35,519	| IOT011 |	Hue light bulb
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,543	| IOT011 |	Holders will
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,335	| IOT011 |	Let's see what was there quote
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:41,151	| IOT011 |	All existing hue light sources will be made
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:42,431	| IOT011 |	Compatible with homekit
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:48,831	| IOT011 |	Apple's homekit support will launch this fall and Philips Hue will help existing users to upgrade their system
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:52,159	| IOT011 |	So I don't know what kind of help I should be looking for 4
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,183	| IOT011 |	Yas
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:58,559	| IOT011 |	I am turn on I doubt it's going to be a trade in program I have no idea what it's going to be maybe some reduce rates
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,095	| IOT011 |	Basically this is
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,399	| IOT011 |	This looks to be about security
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,935	| IOT011 |	Which is very important to a
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,983	| IOT011 |	And
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:07,519	| IOT011 |	From a user standpoint that's
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:13,663	| IOT011 |	Crate I was at a conference last week where the CMO of Home Depot actually raised her hand and asked a panel of smart home
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,455	| IOT011 |	Manufacturers
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:17,759	| IOT011 |	What is the deal with security
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:18,783	| IOT011 |	How can we
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:22,111	| IOT011 |	Sell these things to Consumers when there's a big concern about this
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:24,671	| IOT011 |	And if the CMO of Home Depot
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:28,767	| IOT011 |	Which is a retailer that stocks a lot of these products is concerned about security then
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,327	| IOT011 |	You know what baby apple made the right back here
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,887	| IOT011 |	I don't think they made the wrong
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:36,191	| IOT011 |	Decision here I think choosing
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:36,959	| IOT011 |	Tighter or
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:41,567	| IOT011 |	Security that you can control and some other way shape or form is much better
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:46,687	| IOT011 |	It's just that the timing of it and the communication to Partners and sew onto made it
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:49,503	| IOT011 |	We see this a lot it's not just that
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:53,855	| IOT011 |	I also don't want to pick on any single company in here but we see this a lot especially in this space
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,903	| IOT011 |	Plan people have great plans
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:08:00,255	| IOT011 |	The details are still murky when the plans get announced platforms are announced
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,303	| IOT011 |	And then over time as
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,071	| IOT011 |	Details come
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,863	| IOT011 |	Qunar workout
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,143	| IOT011 |	Ultimately
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:08,447	| IOT011 |	Consumers are either left flirting cuz they
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:09,727	| IOT011 |	But earlier products
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,263	| IOT011 |	It's something is change of the platform
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:14,847	| IOT011 |	Or something to that effect it's it's it's really really tough It's
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,895	| IOT011 |	Frustrating
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:19,711	| IOT011 |	Especially in this space because I've been doing this for
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:21,247	| IOT011 |	5 years old
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,527	| IOT011 |	Do-it-yourself home
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,063	| IOT011 |	Stuff
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:24,831	| IOT011 |	It's frustrating
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:28,927	| IOT011 |	It is so the moral here is the moral here don't be an early adopter
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:33,279	| IOT011 |	Well I mean I'm I'm always going to be one because it's in my blood
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:35,327	| IOT011 |	So it's hard for me to say that kind of feel like
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,119	| IOT011 |	I shouldn't say that but yeah
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:40,959	| IOT011 |	There's there's a lot of great products out there and they offer so much
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,983	| IOT011 |	Thomas
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:48,127	| IOT011 |	But at the end of the day may make sense to not go with version 1 of anything and then wait for v2 I mean that's that's pretty
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:51,199	| IOT011 |	And nodejs in iot space but
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:53,503	| IOT011 |	Phone watches wearables whatever maybe
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:54,527	| IOT011 |	There we go
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:59,903	| IOT011 |	Well out there was some watch news so that the second iteration of the Apple watch
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:00,927	| IOT011 |	Since you haven't
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:03,743	| IOT011 |	Apple watch are you excited what did you think about the
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,255	| IOT011 |	Futuristic
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:09,887	| IOT011 |	I think what we're moving real fast and we went from watch OS want to watch OS 2 in a matter of
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,655	| IOT011 |	6 weeks
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:14,495	| IOT011 |	Cuz that's what that one else watch os2 for their Apple watch
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:18,335	| IOT011 |	I am excited that the whole Apple watch experience has been
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:20,127	| IOT011 |	Mostly good for me it
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:23,199	| IOT011 |	Been disappointing in terms of apps because there really are no native apps
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:25,503	| IOT011 |	From third parties only from Apple
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:28,831	| IOT011 |	And the glances in the notifications and such
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:33,183	| IOT011 |	They can take time to get from the phone which is where the
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,719	| IOT011 |	Watch apps are really running now
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:36,767	| IOT011 |	So it's been a frustrating experience
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:39,839	| IOT011 |	Watch os2 should help that because it gave developers the Opera
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,887	| IOT011 |	Opportunity the tools I should say
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,935	| IOT011 |	To build native apps so
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:48,287	| IOT011 |	Some of the some of the interesting bits here there's going to be more
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:50,335	| IOT011 |	Customizable faces
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,615	| IOT011 |	Really liked actually the
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:54,687	| IOT011 |	The time lapse face I don't know if you got to see any of this Stacy but
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:58,015	| IOT011 |	You can take a time-lapse photo and then when you when your watch
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,807	| IOT011 |	Activate to show you the time
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:03,903	| IOT011 |	Time lapse washer take place so it's you know you might get a boat going across a
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:06,975	| IOT011 |	River really fast in a time lapse matter what I was just kind of Interest
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:12,607	| IOT011 |	App developers will get to create their own was called complications on watches Witcher
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,399	| IOT011 |	Little data points so
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,191	| IOT011 |	Instead of having just the
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:21,823	| IOT011 |	The Apple only type choices for what you can put on your watch face you'll be able to say put your
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:25,151	| IOT011 |	Your next appointment or your travel schedule for example or
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,687	| IOT011 |	They showed
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:28,479	| IOT011 |	The charging rate of your
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:29,503	| IOT011 |	Hybrid car
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:30,783	| IOT011 |	Just like the activity
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:33,599	| IOT011 |	Rings that they have on there today
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:37,695	| IOT011 |	So your car is charging little ring won't close up you know so you can have that on your watch
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:40,767	| IOT011 |	So developers to create that which is awesome
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:41,791	| IOT011 |	Whatever they want
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,071	| IOT011 |	And complications
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:43,839	| IOT011 |	Ventura watch
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,887	| IOT011 |	Compilations actually
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,959	| IOT011 |	That's a realtor it's a real watch Turbo I thought I think
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:51,007	| IOT011 |	It's like all the little
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:54,335	| IOT011 |	Any
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:57,407	| IOT011 |	Yeah any additional information other than the time
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:59,711	| IOT011 |	Libya complication watch the date
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,223	| IOT011 |	Today
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:01,759	| IOT011 |	The time zone exactly
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,551	| IOT011 |	So there you go so
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:07,647	| IOT011 |	Wow I just sent that early in the morning
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:09,183	| IOT011 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:10,463	| IOT011 |	So outside of app
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:11,999	| IOT011 |	I have
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:14,559	| IOT011 |	Because I was in San Francisco last week
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,327	| IOT011 |	Meeting with startups
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,375	| IOT011 |	I have an amazing
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,655	| IOT011 |	Start up that I have to
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,423	| IOT011 |	To tell you about
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,471	| IOT011 |	They're making an intelligent oven
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:23,519	| IOT011 |	So
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:25,055	| IOT011 |	Play The Jacksons can I just
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,079	| IOT011 |	Punch numbers in
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:29,919	| IOT011 |	Just have it's almost as cool so here's what they're did
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:32,223	| IOT011 |	These guys are making a countertop oven
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,503	| IOT011 |	And they
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:37,087	| IOT011 |	Instead of just being like I'm going to put some Wi-Fi in it and it's going to be smart
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:39,647	| IOT011 |	What they've done is they've added
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,927	| IOT011 |	A camera
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,207	| IOT011 |	On the roof of the oven
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:43,487	| IOT011 |	That
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,279	| IOT011 |	Looks at the food inside they've added
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,815	| IOT011 |	Integrated thermometer probe
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:49,887	| IOT011 |	Now that you can shove into the food and then they've added
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,935	| IOT011 |	Sensors in the feet
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:52,447	| IOT011 |	Of the other
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:53,983	| IOT011 |	So
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:56,031	| IOT011 |	The oven itself can become a scale
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:57,567	| IOT011 |	So what happens is
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:59,359	| IOT011 |	If you stick like a roast
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:02,175	| IOT011 |	You take a roast and you stick it in the oven you're going to pop
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:05,503	| IOT011 |	Thermometer in there so it knows the temperature inside
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:06,271	| IOT011 |	The chicken
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:08,575	| IOT011 |	The camera is going to recognize
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:10,367	| IOT011 |	That there's a chicken in the oven
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:12,159	| IOT011 |	It's using the same sort of
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:15,487	| IOT011 |	Computer vision algorithms that Google and Microsoft working on
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,815	| IOT011 |	It's a little easier for them because there's a lot
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:19,839	| IOT011 |	Fewer
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:22,655	| IOT011 |	Food classes that they have to teach the computer
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:25,215	| IOT011 |	Because everything taste like chicken
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,263	| IOT011 |	This is a bagel taste like chicken
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,567	| IOT011 |	Descale
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:30,335	| IOT011 |	Elements
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,871	| IOT011 |	Measure the weight of your check
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:33,663	| IOT011 |	So basically what you do
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:35,711	| IOT011 |	Ability as you can tell the
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,223	| IOT011 |	Open
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,783	| IOT011 |	Capacitive touch screen on the front
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:39,807	| IOT011 |	Of course it does
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:42,111	| IOT011 |	In-N-Out
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:43,135	| IOT011 |	I should say that but
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,927	| IOT011 |	I never want to touch
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:47,231	| IOT011 |	Spike my hands get so greasy I'm like I don't want to touch
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,511	| IOT011 |	You know anything
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,535	| IOT011 |	Any touch screen
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:51,583	| IOT011 |	It wouldn't be nothing without a knob anyway
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,887	| IOT011 |	So you can pop your chicken in
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:55,935	| IOT011 |	You say hey I want to roast chicken
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,983	| IOT011 |	Set your timer
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:01,055	| IOT011 |	It will set your temperature it will do all of that for you
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:06,175	| IOT011 |	Because it knows how much it weighs it knows it's a chicken at knows the temperature inside
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,199	| IOT011 |	As it's been cooked
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:07,967	| IOT011 |	Anna Scott
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:08,735	| IOT011 |	Panchos
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,551	| IOT011 |	Recipes and stuff inside and the ability to kind of
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,623	| IOT011 |	So it's pretty amazing
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,647	| IOT011 |	The other thing about it
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,183	| IOT011 |	And you can also do your own
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,487	| IOT011 |	You do not have to follow if you're like
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,279	| IOT011 |	I am smarter than you
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:23,583	| IOT011 |	Call the June oven so I'm smarter than you June
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:24,607	| IOT011 |	You can do that
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:26,911	| IOT011 |	And it also has
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,679	| IOT011 |	Adapt
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:34,335	| IOT011 |	But the nice thing about the app is with all of the stuff you don't actually to keep going back and checking on your food so even if you don't try
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,895	| IOT011 |	You can look at the camera in
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,431	| IOT011 |	See the food inside of you like
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:40,223	| IOT011 |	My chicken looks almost done
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:42,015	| IOT011 |	And you don't have to keep opening in the oven
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:42,527	| IOT011 |	So that's
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,575	| IOT011 |	Someone who is like
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,855	| IOT011 |	A little Taipei in
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,903	| IOT011 |	You know makes things all the time
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:48,927	| IOT011 |	And has a husband who
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:51,999	| IOT011 |	Petrified of food that's not cooked to the proper temperature
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:53,535	| IOT011 |	Would be amazing for me
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:55,327	| IOT011 |	So this it's on your countertop
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:58,911	| IOT011 |	It has its about 22 in across
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,959	| IOT011 |	The big Square thing so it
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:03,007	| IOT011 |	It would replace its large
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,031	| IOT011 |	The other thing
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,055	| IOT011 |	About this is
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:07,359	| IOT011 |	They built it of new materials
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,151	| IOT011 |	And they really rethought
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:12,223	| IOT011 |	The oven in a way that I think is amazing like
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:13,247	| IOT011 |	The heating elements
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:14,527	| IOT011 |	AR
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:15,551	| IOT011 |	Carbon nanotubes
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:16,831	| IOT011 |	Basically
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,623	| IOT011 |	Carbon fiber nanotubes
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,903	| IOT011 |	Steady up
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:23,487	| IOT011 |	Superfast for your oven to preheat to 350 degrees in 4 minutes
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,279	| IOT011 |	Which
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,815	| IOT011 |	That's impressive that is nice
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:28,863	| IOT011 |	And there's like all kinds of like
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:33,983	| IOT011 |	Oven features I'll call them Thursday consulted with Michael Mina who is a chef
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:35,519	| IOT011 |	About like
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:37,055	| IOT011 |	Oven features you need
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:38,847	| IOT011 |	Zoe's
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,383	| IOT011 |	Easy Bake Oven to.
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:43,199	| IOT011 |	Exactly it's a it's a fancy toaster oven
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,479	| IOT011 |	So
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,015	| IOT011 |	Considering that a wall oven
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:50,623	| IOT011 |	How much does it cost
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,391	| IOT011 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:51,903	| IOT011 |	It cost
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,695	| IOT011 |	$1,500
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,023	| IOT011 |	Well that's actually less than I
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,559	| IOT011 |	Expected but then again
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,327	| IOT011 |	It is small
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:01,887	| IOT011 |	It is small so you cannot cook a turkey
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:05,215	| IOT011 |	A traditional half sheet cookie sheet cannot fit in it
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:06,495	| IOT011 |	You have to get
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,519	| IOT011 |	Especial
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:10,079	| IOT011 |	It will fit a 9 by 13 baking
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:12,127	| IOT011 |	Which is the traditional kind of
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,663	| IOT011 |	Baking pan that use for cakes
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:18,783	| IOT011 |	It'll come with its own stuff too but you can buy special size
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:21,087	| IOT011 |	Cure for smaller ovens believe in
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:24,671	| IOT011 |	They're not it'll fit a tray that is 11 in by 16 in
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:28,511	| IOT011 |	That's actually about an inch smaller around a half sheet
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:30,559	| IOT011 |	A traditional half sheet
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:31,071	| IOT011 |	Trey
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,607	| IOT011 |	So
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,375	| IOT011 |	Is it
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,655	| IOT011 |	Replacement oven
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:37,727	| IOT011 |	For most things
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,239	| IOT011 |	Probably
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:39,775	| IOT011 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:42,079	| IOT011 |	For everything know you can't cook your Thanksgiving turkey
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,871	| IOT011 |	Right right
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:52,063	| IOT011 |	Traditional wall oven does cost between 11000 in like if they can go up to it like crazy high things I've got a
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:53,343	| IOT011 |	Double wall oven that was like
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:55,135	| IOT011 |	3500 I think
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:55,903	| IOT011 |	So
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,927	| IOT011 |	Athens or not
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,719	| IOT011 |	Cheap but this is probably
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:03,071	| IOT011 |	Unless you're you know Young and Living in a small apartment this is probably not
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:03,583	| IOT011 |	Replace rubber
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:07,679	| IOT011 |	Yeah I put a burrito saying about being early adopters
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:09,727	| IOT011 |	Exactly
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:12,543	| IOT011 |	I really I really do I like that they
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:15,359	| IOT011 |	I like all the sensors I've seen that piecemeal
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:18,687	| IOT011 |	We talked about super mechanical waves you can Heather CEO in the podcast
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:24,319	| IOT011 |	Talk about the range thermometer and the intelligence that adds there's the meld kitchen knob the oven knob
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:28,159	| IOT011 |	That does a similar kind of learning thing that helps you it has
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,695	| IOT011 |	A knob that
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,207	| IOT011 |	Controls
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:32,767	| IOT011 |	Your stove start your stove top
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:36,095	| IOT011 |	And what it does is it measures the
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:38,911	| IOT011 |	Temperature of whatever you're cooking on the stove
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:41,471	| IOT011 |	And that it automatically adjust
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:47,615	| IOT011 |	Burners basically back or up to keep that temperature in the rate range for doing whatever you're trying to do
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:50,687	| IOT011 |	Is this a currently available or is it coming soon
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:53,503	| IOT011 |	You can pre-order it
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:54,271	| IOT011 |	Starting this week
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,575	| IOT011 |	You have to put $95 down
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:58,367	| IOT011 |	If it will not be out
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,391	| IOT011 |	Until spring of
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,159	| IOT011 |	26
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:06,559	| IOT011 |	I was going to say if it's out soon I give it a year before Samsung buy these guys
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,095	| IOT011 |	There you go well
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:09,887	| IOT011 |	Make it two years now
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:14,751	| IOT011 |	Make it two years I've seen I seen the oven at baked me cookies they were delicious
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,263	| IOT011 |	So
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:17,823	| IOT011 |	I am sitting
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:20,127	| IOT011 |	Really can I justify a 50
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:25,247	| IOT011 |	But I'm not my rule is I don't buy until so
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:25,759	| IOT011 |	Something's actually on
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,807	| IOT011 |	On the market that price point
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,135	| IOT011 |	A small
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,927	| IOT011 |	A small toy pet I will not buy
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:37,279	| IOT011 |	A $1,500 oven on sale right now I would agree
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:39,583	| IOT011 |	But hopefully someone will because
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:43,423	| IOT011 |	There's a lot of innovation here I like the way they're thinking about it
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,215	| IOT011 |	It's hard to read
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,751	| IOT011 |	I made it really is
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:53,151	| IOT011 |	Yeah I agree with you I love the idea that they have going on here I would like to see it expand
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:58,271	| IOT011 |	Tattoo traditional size ovens and to be honest and I'm not trying to downplay what they've done by any means
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:58,783	| IOT011 |	When I say this
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:05,951	| IOT011 |	I mean you could add these types of sensors and things to traditional ovens and that's why I said what I said about Samsung who does make tons more
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:06,463	| IOT011 |	Appliances
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,743	| IOT011 |	So
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:12,351	| IOT011 |	To me this is a precursor for what you met at Sea in a standard traditional oven
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,119	| IOT011 |	In
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:13,887	| IOT011 |	Your five
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:14,655	| IOT011 |	8 years
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:17,727	| IOT011 |	And did you just replace all of your appliances
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:20,799	| IOT011 |	Thank you thanks thanks so much for reminding me though
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:26,943	| IOT011 |	We just did that thank you so much you know if it makes you feel better I just bought all my appliances only 2 years ago so I feel like
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:29,503	| IOT011 |	I can't really buy a new oven
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,015	| IOT011 |	Probably
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:35,391	| IOT011 |	Alright so that's the June oven and I really excited about that partially
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,975	| IOT011 |	In other news this week
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:40,255	| IOT011 |	There is a
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:40,767	| IOT011 |	Wink
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:44,351	| IOT011 |	By my least favorite home hub is having
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,911	| IOT011 |	My understanding is that
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:47,935	| IOT011 |	Wink
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:49,983	| IOT011 |	The software platform
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:51,519	| IOT011 |	Has been for sale
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,567	| IOT011 |	Actually several months
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:56,895	| IOT011 |	And now I'm hearing that quirky
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:58,175	| IOT011 |	Which is the company that
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,967	| IOT011 |	Is producing a lot of
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,735	| IOT011 |	Hardware
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:04,319	| IOT011 |	It's the product development shop that produces a lot of the hardware for wing
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,879	| IOT011 |	Techquickie is getting out of manufacture
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,671	| IOT011 |	That is pretty
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:09,439	| IOT011 |	That's big
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,975	| IOT011 |	Big news
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:13,023	| IOT011 |	It's not necessarily surprising
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:14,815	| IOT011 |	But it is kind of
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,351	| IOT011 |	I don't know it's
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:17,119	| IOT011 |	Kind of sad
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,143	| IOT011 |	To see
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:20,703	| IOT011 |	Sunday that had so much support
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,215	| IOT011 |	Court
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:24,799	| IOT011 |	Are there still their parents are still available at Home Depot I know that
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:27,871	| IOT011 |	They are and they just had a couple weeks ago
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,407	| IOT011 |	They had a big sick
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:30,431	| IOT011 |	Security snafu
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:33,759	| IOT011 |	Where certificate
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:35,039	| IOT011 |	Some people's hubs
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:37,855	| IOT011 |	They couldn't even update over-the-air because of this problem
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:40,159	| IOT011 |	So they actually had to send their wings
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:41,183	| IOT011 |	Cubs back
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:43,231	| IOT011 |	Which you can imagine did not make
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,023	| IOT011 |	Customer is very happy
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:46,815	| IOT011 |	So
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:50,911	| IOT011 |	Yeah I'm clear what all is happening at
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:54,751	| IOT011 |	Winkle actually called them and try to figure out but I haven't heard back from anyone at Winker Corky
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:56,031	| IOT011 |	So
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:58,591	| IOT011 |	That is what we know now but
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,895	| IOT011 |	If you guys are in the market for a home hub do not buy a Wii
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,455	| IOT011 |	I'd be cautious
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:05,759	| IOT011 |	7
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:06,527	| IOT011 |	I'll be diplomatic
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:09,343	| IOT011 |	Speedway on Lake
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:11,903	| IOT011 |	We never you never know what's going to happen
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:15,743	| IOT011 |	Honestly I mean you know we've seen companies at 4
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:21,631	| IOT011 |	You know you thought they were down and out and then they get picked up by somebody else in the product line continues does it happen often no
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:22,655	| IOT011 |	But it does happen
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:27,007	| IOT011 |	Thirsty I'm sure there's a lot of people that have this product out there so that you know they're going to want
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:30,335	| IOT011 |	To keep using it in One support and so on and so forth so
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,615	| IOT011 |	It's it's hard to say what's going to happen
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:33,151	| IOT011 |	Maybe Samsung
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:33,663	| IOT011 |	Pick some up
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:35,455	| IOT011 |	And with the
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:38,783	| IOT011 |	Fix it there you go I mean it's a perfect example of what
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:41,343	| IOT011 |	Would probably be a best case scenario everything
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:41,855	| IOT011 |	Yes
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:46,975	| IOT011 |	So now we have Samsung buying another company we talked about and possibly wink
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:48,255	| IOT011 |	This is our speculation
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:50,047	| IOT011 |	Samsung is not actually buying us company
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:53,119	| IOT011 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,887	| IOT011 |	So I think
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:55,423	| IOT011 |	This week we don't have a guest
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:59,775	| IOT011 |	Because I was so hopeful excited that Apple would do a bunch of cool home stuff
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,799	| IOT011 |	Wentworth
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,591	| IOT011 |	I know it we did not
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,871	| IOT011 |	Schedule a guest for this week
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,431	| IOT011 |	Which now in hindsight I feel like
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:12,063	| IOT011 |	Why did I do that Tim Cook was just too busy today to come on the show on porchlight talk about on
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:15,391	| IOT011 |	It's true and you know I would have settled for Jony Ive
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:18,720	| IOT011 |	Sell aluminium
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:20,512	| IOT011 |	Say that all day long
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:24,096	| IOT011 |	So I think that means that it is time for our
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:26,400	| IOT011 |	5-minute review
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:28,960	| IOT011 |	All right
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:30,752	| IOT011 |	Today's review is ring
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:32,544	| IOT011 |	It is a $200
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,312	| IOT011 |	Connected
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:34,080	| IOT011 |	Doorbell
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,872	| IOT011 |	And I've had this on my
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:38,432	| IOT011 |	It's actually not installed
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:40,736	| IOT011 |	In my doorbell and we'll get to that in a second
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:43,040	| IOT011 |	What this is is
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:44,320	| IOT011 |	You place this doorbell
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:46,624	| IOT011 |	It's about the size of a smartphone
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:49,440	| IOT011 |	Either wired into your doorbell
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:51,744	| IOT011 |	Or you can just bounce it
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:55,840	| IOT011 |	If it is Wireless so it it talks to the internet via Wi-Fi
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:58,400	| IOT011 |	It what it does is it has a camera and a microphone in
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:00,704	| IOT011 |	It when someone rings the doorbell
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:03,264	| IOT011 |	It opens up a video feed of that
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:04,032	| IOT011 |	Person
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,568	| IOT011 |	And you can talk to them in
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:06,592	| IOT011 |	And say things like
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:10,176	| IOT011 |	Hey leave the package downstairs I'll come grab it or
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:12,224	| IOT011 |	You can even pretend to be home when you're not home
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,016	| IOT011 |	And
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:14,784	| IOT011 |	It's
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:17,088	| IOT011 |	Actually really need device I have wanted a video
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:18,112	| IOT011 |	Doorbell
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:21,952	| IOT011 |	Almost since I started covering the smart home because I have a
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:24,000	| IOT011 |	A rooftop deck in my house in
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:24,768	| IOT011 |	What we all
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,048	| IOT011 |	Go up there in the sky
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,840	| IOT011 |	It's more like the spring
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:29,632	| IOT011 |	We like to go up there and
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:30,656	| IOT011 |	Order pizza
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:33,472	| IOT011 |	I have friends over but we can't hear the doorbell Up on the Roof
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:35,264	| IOT011 |	So this way
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:37,568	| IOT011 |	We could both hear the doorbell cuz it brings to our phone
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:39,872	| IOT011 |	If you install it
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:42,944	| IOT011 |	In place of your existing doorbell it will also ring
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:47,040	| IOT011 |	If you wired into your wall basically it will also bring your actual name
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:47,552	| IOT011 |	Mechanical door
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:49,344	| IOT011 |	And then
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:50,880	| IOT011 |	Ring
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:54,976	| IOT011 |	Is going to launch a product this month called the chime
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,256	| IOT011 |	That for $20
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,560	| IOT011 |	It basically if you don't
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:01,120	| IOT011 |	Connect it to your mechanical doorbell it will still ring
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:02,400	| IOT011 |	In your house
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,168	| IOT011 |	So
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:04,448	| IOT011 |	That's kind of what it does
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:06,752	| IOT011 |	And here's some things I learned about it
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:07,776	| IOT011 |	Install
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,824	| IOT011 |	1 this works
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:13,664	| IOT011 |	Ring used to be known as a company called Orbot and their original doorbell
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:16,480	| IOT011 |	Having a lot of issues people really didn't enjoy
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:17,248	| IOT011 |	Using it
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:19,040	| IOT011 |	The video feed wasn't good
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:20,576	| IOT011 |	Appear very fast
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:25,184	| IOT011 |	This is much better this the video feed is almost instantaneous
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:30,304	| IOT011 |	The challenge I had with these and I have no idea how your doorbell is oriented
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:34,144	| IOT011 |	But my doorbell is not oriented on the same wall
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:34,912	| IOT011 |	Is my door
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:36,448	| IOT011 |	So
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:37,728	| IOT011 |	My doorbell
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,776	| IOT011 |	Is that a right angle
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:40,544	| IOT011 |	To my
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,312	| IOT011 |	Door
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:42,080	| IOT011 |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:46,944	| IOT011 |	Yeah so it makes the camera so basically what I'm looking at an Indian people also
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:48,224	| IOT011 |	When they ring the doorbell
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:49,248	| IOT011 |	They don't realize there's a
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:52,064	| IOT011 |	What you're going to see you
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:52,832	| IOT011 |	Depending on how high
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:57,696	| IOT011 |	Right it's probably a wide-angle lens I'm thinking but still here with the height
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,464	| IOT011 |	It is a wedding
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,000	| IOT011 |	So you can see a lot of
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,816	| IOT011 |	Not very flattering
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:07,680	| IOT011 |	Camera adds 20lbs best wide angle
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:11,264	| IOT011 |	I didn't install it to my actual
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:13,056	| IOT011 |	Doorbell so I don't know about it
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:13,824	| IOT011 |	Mechanical
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,360	| IOT011 |	Efficacy rate
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:17,408	| IOT011 |	For ringing the doorbell
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:21,504	| IOT011 |	So I mean I'm sorry you guys nor do I know how easy it is to install
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,528	| IOT011 |	From a wired
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:27,136	| IOT011 |	Perspective and you said it was mechanical so does it physically press your doorbell button if you install
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:29,696	| IOT011 |	Electrical
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:31,232	| IOT011 |	The electrical signal to the thing that
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:33,280	| IOT011 |	It doesn't actually
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,840	| IOT011 |	Sorry it sent it to The Chimes
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:37,888	| IOT011 |	What's inside your house
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:40,960	| IOT011 |	So I stuck it on the outside of my
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:43,008	| IOT011 |	Dorin because it's a review
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:43,776	| IOT011 |	Daughters are harder review
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:49,152	| IOT011 |	I had to like command tape that sucker
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:51,456	| IOT011 |	Is a lot of double-sided tape I had to create some padding
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:54,016	| IOT011 |	Even so
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:56,064	| IOT011 |	Famous Amos very changkyun ugly
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,344	| IOT011 |	But
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,624	| IOT011 |	And then I covered up my doorbell with
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,672	| IOT011 |	Ring The Ring
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:02,208	| IOT011 |	Which provided a lot of
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:02,976	| IOT011 |	Fusion at Birth
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,536	| IOT011 |	Yours doesn't have
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,048	| IOT011 |	To be set up.
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,096	| IOT011 |	Yours could be pretty
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:10,144	| IOT011 |	And
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,680	| IOT011 |	Although if your doorbell is Orion
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,728	| IOT011 |	Does your doorbell face out
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:20,128	| IOT011 |	Mine faces out we live in the sticks and really I don't think our doorbell has been running for years but it does face
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:22,688	| IOT011 |	So it was neat to be able to see
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:27,296	| IOT011 |	Cuz it's motion it has a motion sensor so when people started walking up to the door
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:27,808	| IOT011 |	Which trigger Inlet
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:29,600	| IOT011 |	So
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:34,720	| IOT011 |	If the UPS guy was coming and had a package I can actually make it down the time to sign the package before he like
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:38,304	| IOT011 |	Which is usually what
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:40,608	| IOT011 |	They have places to be I guess
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:41,888	| IOT011 |	So
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,424	| IOT011 |	$200
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:44,960	| IOT011 |	It's the ring doorbell
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:47,008	| IOT011 |	And you can buy it
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:48,288	| IOT011 |	Amazon at their website
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:50,336	| IOT011 |	Best Buy
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:52,128	| IOT011 |	And it is
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:55,200	| IOT011 |	You know if you're in the market for something like this
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:58,784	| IOT011 |	It seemed to do well I will let you guys know that I am getting a
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:25:59,552	| IOT011 |	A Skype
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:00,832	| IOT011 |	Which is one of its competitors
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,112	| IOT011 |	Very soon
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,392	| IOT011 |	So if you're
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:05,184	| IOT011 |	Want to listen to see how
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:06,208	| IOT011 |	That door.
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:06,720	| IOT011 |	Comparison
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:12,352	| IOT011 |	You know you have to mount the two of them together now so we can have a b testing for
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:14,144	| IOT011 |	You know video and audio and all that
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:16,448	| IOT011 |	So your chest but I actually have
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:18,752	| IOT011 |	Two front doors with doorbells
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:19,776	| IOT011 |	Believe it or not
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,824	| IOT011 |	My house is oriented so
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:23,360	| IOT011 |	I have two entrances
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:25,152	| IOT011 |	A front in the back
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:28,736	| IOT011 |	Can't wait to get into the house and they both look like a front door with a doorbell
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:29,760	| IOT011 |	So
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:30,784	| IOT011 |	I can actually
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,088	| IOT011 |	You won't choose which ones
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:33,600	| IOT011 |	You get to
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,416	| IOT011 |	There we go
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:37,952	| IOT011 |	So that is
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:38,720	| IOT011 |	Play
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:40,512	| IOT011 |	Review of the Ringling
