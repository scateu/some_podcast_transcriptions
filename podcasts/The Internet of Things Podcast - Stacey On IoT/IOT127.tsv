EDL	00:00:16,640	00:00:17,408	| IOT127 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:17,408	00:00:20,736	| IOT127 |	And we have today
EDL	00:00:21,248	00:00:25,856	| IOT127 |	Zuv speaker and assistant news that we're going to cover including it
EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:29,696	| IOT127 |	Amazon Echo multi-room audio in Google Assistant coming to
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:30,208	| IOT127 |	Josh
EDL	00:00:30,976	00:00:33,792	| IOT127 |	So we're going to discover GE trying to fix it
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:35,584	| IOT127 |	Predix Industrial iot
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:36,864	| IOT127 |	And
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:40,704	| IOT127 |	We build a special project just for our listeners
EDL	00:00:40,704	00:00:41,728	| IOT127 |	You're going to love it
EDL	00:00:41,728	00:00:45,056	| IOT127 |	We've also got a message from this week's brand new sponsor for truck
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:45,824	| IOT127 |	And
EDL	00:00:45,824	00:00:46,592	| IOT127 |	Our Guest
EDL	00:00:46,592	00:00:48,384	| IOT127 |	This week Alastair Allen
EDL	00:00:48,384	00:00:50,176	| IOT127 |	Who is a geek reimagining
EDL	00:00:50,176	00:00:53,504	| IOT127 |	How to secure the Internet of Things by having devices
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:54,528	| IOT127 |	Lie to each other
EDL	00:00:55,552	00:00:56,576	| IOT127 |	Going to be exciting
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:01:00,928	| IOT127 |	And before we get into all of that let's have a quick message from another one of our sponsors
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:07,328	| IOT127 |	This week sponsor is Lively did you know that on average it takes companies 18 months to launch and iot
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:08,096	| IOT127 |	Connected products
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:14,496	| IOT127 |	But it doesn't have to get your products into the hands of your customers faster with side li-po from concept 2
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:18,848	| IOT127 |	Connected in 4 months or less and get everything you need to run your connected product
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:25,248	| IOT127 |	Lively offers everything needed to get up and running including Hardware Integrations a lunch ready mobile app
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:26,528	| IOT127 |	Systems to manage
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:32,928	| IOT127 |	User and device data and pre-built Integrations with tools like Salesforce visit Zylie.
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:36,512	| IOT127 |	That s i v e l y
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:38,816	| IOT127 |	. com for more information
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:41,888	| IOT127 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:45,984	| IOT127 |	So much news let's get started first with GE and it's predict stuff
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:46,752	| IOT127 |	Because
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:49,056	| IOT127 |	In the billions of dollar category I feel like this
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:50,080	| IOT127 |	This is the biggest item we've got
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:51,872	| IOT127 |	So what happened it is
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:54,432	| IOT127 |	Rare's discovered that GE
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:55,712	| IOT127 |	Has
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:57,248	| IOT127 |	Shifted its
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,528	| IOT127 |	Focus on the
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:01,088	| IOT127 |	Industrial internet-of-things because
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:03,648	| IOT127 |	It was crazy spending on its predix platform
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,696	| IOT127 |	And accountability
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,232	| IOT127 |	So
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:11,072	| IOT127 |	In Spring GE called a two-month timeout to tackle these
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,888	| IOT127 |	And now they're focusing
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:15,936	| IOT127 |	Only on a few Industries as
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:16,448	| IOT127 |	As opposed to
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:18,496	| IOT127 |	Iot
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:20,800	| IOT127 |	Opportunity so now they're going to only emphasize
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:23,616	| IOT127 |	Sales to existing customers in energy
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:24,896	| IOT127 |	Aviation
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:26,176	| IOT127 |	And oil and gas
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:28,480	| IOT127 |	Is this make sense
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:29,760	| IOT127 |	Because
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,296	| IOT127 |	I actually
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:33,088	| IOT127 |	Talk to a company that is
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:33,856	| IOT127 |	Competing with
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:35,392	| IOT127 |	Critics it's called flutura
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:37,184	| IOT127 |	And they were
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:43,328	| IOT127 |	Napping customers because a lot of customers who had Industrial Equipment data didn't want to give their
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:46,400	| IOT127 |	Proprietary data about how some of their Machinery work
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:47,424	| IOT127 |	Route to Geb
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:47,936	| IOT127 |	Because GE my
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:53,056	| IOT127 |	So there's that issue so people worried about GE trying
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:57,920	| IOT127 |	Compete with them which makes sense then that she's got only try to serve its existing customers that are already buying their
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:59,456	| IOT127 |	Equipment potoo
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:01,504	| IOT127 |	It also kind of emphasizes
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:04,832	| IOT127 |	How in the wild wild west of the Industrial internet-of-things
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:06,112	| IOT127 |	GE wanted to be
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:13,280	| IOT127 |	All things to everyone it wanted to be an IT player it wanted to be a traditional industrial Powerhouse and then it also
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,328	| IOT127 |	202 develop the algorithms needed to like do
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,144	| IOT127 |	It wanted to be IBM
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,424	| IOT127 |	Yes
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:24,032	| IOT127 |	It's not easy to do that and basically what happened is G Building Stone clouds and last year it said
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:29,664	| IOT127 |	You know what our own cloud that's not a win for us we're going to work on Azure and AWS beak
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:31,200	| IOT127 |	Does that make sense
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:33,504	| IOT127 |	And what it seems to be now is
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:37,856	| IOT127 |	They're like okay we're also only going to work in certain industries
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:42,464	| IOT127 |	Not only where we have customers but also we have our expertise because
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:48,864	| IOT127 |	Frank Leo I don't think we figured out how to scale in industrial iot platform I don't think there's one platform
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,400	| IOT127 |	That's going to work across all Industries
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:56,544	| IOT127 |	I would agree I would agree there's there's too many individual requirements for different types of Industries so
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:58,336	| IOT127 |	By focusing on these three core
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:04,224	| IOT127 |	Verticals it makes sense for GE to you know cuz I can focus on growing the customer base that they already have
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:07,552	| IOT127 |	We're not competing with those Industries so it makes sense
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,320	| IOT127 |	And
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:09,344	| IOT127 |	Huge Industries
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,136	| IOT127 |	It's going to be
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:17,280	| IOT127 |	That's kind of the GE story I think we're going to see we're already seeing it like samsara which is an industrial
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,071	| IOT127 |	Iot startup
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,351	| IOT127 |	It's doing very well
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:26,239	| IOT127 |	They wanted to do the same thing they wanted to build out this massive industrial iot platform and what happened was there like
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:30,079	| IOT127 |	It's pretty hard to do Fleet Management and cold
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:30,591	| IOT127 |	Supply chain
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:31,615	| IOT127 |	Because
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,407	| IOT127 |	Doing everything
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:34,687	| IOT127 |	Is it really pause
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:38,783	| IOT127 |	And I still talk to companies who are like hey you know what we're going to build the first scalable
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,391	| IOT127 |	But
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,439	| IOT127 |	I don't know if it's good luck with that
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:48,511	| IOT127 |	I want to hear about it if you think you've done it
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:52,863	| IOT127 |	So that's our industrial iot this is pretty big because
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:54,143	| IOT127 |	As part of this
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,959	| IOT127 |	GE is also expecting
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:02,079	| IOT127 |	12 billion in digital Revenue in 2020 and that includes its products stuff
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:03,103	| IOT127 |	That's compared to
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,871	| IOT127 |	15 billion
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:05,919	| IOT127 |	Previously talked about
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:08,223	| IOT127 |	I remember getting that prediction for them
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:09,759	| IOT127 |	A while back
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:10,527	| IOT127 |	How much years ago
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:12,319	| IOT127 |	That's amazing
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,879	| IOT127 |	But apparently it was a little too amazing
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,159	| IOT127 |	So
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:17,695	| IOT127 |	But they're not backing off
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:18,719	| IOT127 |	They're just
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:21,791	| IOT127 |	Refocusing perhaps
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:22,303	| IOT127 |	A little bit more
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,095	| IOT127 |	Where we are today
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,375	| IOT127 |	All right
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,679	| IOT127 |	Moving along to
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,447	| IOT127 |	Crazy
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:28,959	| IOT127 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:33,055	| IOT127 |	News before we move on
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:33,823	| IOT127 |	I have to tell you guy
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,615	| IOT127 |	Little Harvey update
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:38,943	| IOT127 |	Hurricane Harvey strike Houston which is where I grew up
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:44,831	| IOT127 |	Add lots of friends and family there everybody I know is safe some of them have lost things that are precious to them
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,623	| IOT127 |	But everyone is safe
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:47,903	| IOT127 |	And
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:51,487	| IOT127 |	I am safe and for all of you guys who've been sending me nice messages
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:51,999	| IOT127 |	Thank you
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:53,535	| IOT127 |	And
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:55,583	| IOT127 |	I'll let you know next week after
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:57,631	| IOT127 |	Still ongoing as of now so
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:00,959	| IOT127 |	I don't know what to say right now
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,519	| IOT127 |	And can appreciate the help
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:05,055	| IOT127 |	And good thoughts
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:05,567	| IOT127 |	People are sending
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:12,223	| IOT127 |	That's good to hear on your side there still so many people that will be affected and that's it just tragic to watch quite honestly
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:13,759	| IOT127 |	Going to be insane
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,295	| IOT127 |	So
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,063	| IOT127 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:17,343	| IOT127 |	Oh I also have a
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,111	| IOT127 |	Correction
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:20,927	| IOT127 |	Right here in the middle of the show I have a correction
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:24,511	| IOT127 |	Two episodes ago we talked about the super sensor
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,047	| IOT127 |	This is a
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,863	| IOT127 |	Sensor that was developed to
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:33,215	| IOT127 |	Analyze sound and other information from the house and
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:36,031	| IOT127 |	Basically say oh hey you turn on the faucet in the kitchen
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,799	| IOT127 |	Or hey
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:37,823	| IOT127 |	That's your bathroom shower
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:39,615	| IOT127 |	Which we all thought was
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,383	| IOT127 |	School it is
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:41,663	| IOT127 |	I said it was from
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,199	| IOT127 |	But it is not
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:43,711	| IOT127 |	It is from Kearney
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,015	| IOT127 |	I know
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:49,343	| IOT127 |	Idaho
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,415	| IOT127 |	My apologies
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,975	| IOT127 |	MIT you do some very cool stuff Carnegie Mellon
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:57,535	| IOT127 |	So do you you also do really
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:59,327	| IOT127 |	Lake. In this case
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:06:59,839	| IOT127 |	You guys
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:00,863	| IOT127 |	Developed
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,167	| IOT127 |	So
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:03,679	| IOT127 |	Noted
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:08,031	| IOT127 |	I did send the link to the right place so if you ended up there from checking it out
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:09,823	| IOT127 |	Probably realized my mistake
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,383	| IOT127 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:13,407	| IOT127 |	Yeah we live on
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:13,919	| IOT127 |	I want to
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:14,943	| IOT127 |	Digital
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,223	| IOT127 |	Assistance
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,503	| IOT127 |	Dash
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,527	| IOT127 |	Should we start with
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:20,831	| IOT127 |	Multi-room audio from the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:25,695	| IOT127 |	We can do that that's that's something that you've been looking forward to and it's it snow here
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,231	| IOT127 |	It is
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:29,279	| IOT127 |	It's a little bit more difficult than I thought it would be
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:36,191	| IOT127 |	It's challenging it's it's also very a little bit limiting it's not on every Echo device yet so my tab
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:39,263	| IOT127 |	Sitting in the corner like it's being punished because it is not supported but
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:43,615	| IOT127 |	Echo dots and the original Echo and Echo Show devices all support
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:45,407	| IOT127 |	Multi-room audio
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:47,455	| IOT127 |	3rd party
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:56,671	| IOT127 |	Indeed indeed job you can also you can use this to play songs in different rooms from Amazon
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,975	| IOT127 |	TuneIn iHeartRadio Pandora
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:03,839	| IOT127 |	Not yet for Spotify with you Stacy listen to end SiriusXM which
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:04,863	| IOT127 |	I listen to you too so
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,911	| IOT127 |	Unfortunately what kind of
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:07,935	| IOT127 |	On hold for that
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:11,007	| IOT127 |	Securus a pro tips that Kevin and I have
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,519	| IOT127 |	I figured out
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:12,543	| IOT127 |	Trial
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:16,383	| IOT127 |	Which is going to hell you have to figure out a lot of your Amazon Echo
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:21,247	| IOT127 |	Not great
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,015	| IOT127 |	So
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,527	| IOT127 |	First
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:26,879	| IOT127 |	If your Spotify or Sirius XM is your default
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:32,767	| IOT127 |	You probably if you really want to get into this you're going to want to change your default to like Amazon
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:38,911	| IOT127 |	Or Pandora One of the services that works because your other alternative is to say something like play
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:42,239	| IOT127 |	Beyonce on Amazon music in this room
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,263	| IOT127 |	Which is kind of a lot
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:45,823	| IOT127 |	2
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,871	| IOT127 |	Let's talk about room names
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:51,967	| IOT127 |	Sopac when Amazon introduced calling and drop in
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:54,015	| IOT127 |	I actually changed the names of all of my
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,295	| IOT127 |	Echoes two things like
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,831	| IOT127 |	Master bedroom or
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,111	| IOT127 |	Color Kim
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,135	| IOT127 |	My daughter's name
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:00,415	| IOT127 |	Her name is not Kim
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:04,767	| IOT127 |	So what I would do it.
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:05,791	| IOT127 |	And the echo in a room
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,559	| IOT127 |	Woodwork
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,327	| IOT127 |	It was awesome
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:09,119	| IOT127 |	But when I tried to say
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:10,143	| IOT127 |	Play Beyonce on
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,447	| IOT127 |	The echo was like
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,215	| IOT127 |	Nope
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:14,495	| IOT127 |	So I actually have a change it to
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,007	| IOT127 |	To Kim's room
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:17,311	| IOT127 |	It seems to have to be location
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,871	| IOT127 |	Based from a context and point
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:22,943	| IOT127 |	Which was a little weird for me and I had a
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:24,479	| IOT127 |	Dot that I hit
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,503	| IOT127 |	Creatively named Dottie
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,855	| IOT127 |	And I actually ended up having to change that
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,623	| IOT127 |	2
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,391	| IOT127 |	Living room
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,183	| IOT127 |	Because it would not play
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:35,743	| IOT127 |	In Dottie it would not play in Daddy's room
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:38,559	| IOT127 |	It would not play on Dottie and it would not play on Daddy's room
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:45,215	| IOT127 |	So it's kind of a strange way of doing it and also when you do this you have to set up
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,751	| IOT127 |	Groups of speakers
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:52,383	| IOT127 |	And a little challenging if I don't where you actually do that I think we found two different places and they have to do that right
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,151	| IOT127 |	Yes
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:54,687	| IOT127 |	I did it in the smart home sec
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,479	| IOT127 |	Where are you at Creative Group
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:59,807	| IOT127 |	Or maybe you can grab some light bulbs for example by room
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:04,159	| IOT127 |	In there when you create a new group you have the option of what device group would you always had
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:09,535	| IOT127 |	You now have a multi-room music group option and that's where you set up or what I wear I setup my
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,815	| IOT127 |	My multiple speaker
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,327	| IOT127 |	Groups
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:13,631	| IOT127 |	And if you go under settings
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:16,447	| IOT127 |	You can scroll under all your devices
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:20,287	| IOT127 |	Two groups and if you click on multi-room music
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,055	| IOT127 |	You can pick
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,335	| IOT127 |	Your
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:24,383	| IOT127 |	Multi-room music so you can take create group there
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:26,943	| IOT127 |	You can only put a device
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,223	| IOT127 |	Into a single group
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:30,783	| IOT127 |	See you downstairs and upstairs
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:33,855	| IOT127 |	And you have all your downstairs ones in it
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:37,183	| IOT127 |	If you do that then you can't have one called everywhere that includes
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:37,951	| IOT127 |	All of them
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:38,719	| IOT127 |	Right
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:40,255	| IOT127 |	So it's a little limited there
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,815	| IOT127 |	Java group you have to have more than one device
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,351	| IOT127 |	We actually trying to
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:48,191	| IOT127 |	Get around to the weird naming by creating a group called the proper name
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:48,703	| IOT127 |	But that did not
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,543	| IOT127 |	It does not work
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,567	| IOT127 |	Car Bluetooth streaming
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:55,359	| IOT127 |	So if you're streaming something
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,127	| IOT127 |	From your phone
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,663	| IOT127 |	It's not going to play
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:59,199	| IOT127 |	In Minneapolis
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:03,039	| IOT127 |	Strictly that the streaming directly through
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:04,831	| IOT127 |	Amazon were connected services
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:07,135	| IOT127 |	I'm kind of bummed about the tapping
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,927	| IOT127 |	Supported right now because
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:11,231	| IOT127 |	It's always like the one that gets featured the last
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:15,839	| IOT127 |	And I get that it's maybe not always plugged in for people but come on they did it with the
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:18,655	| IOT127 |	I'm always listening option A later added that
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:22,239	| IOT127 |	It also gives the option that included in a multi-room audio group
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:23,519	| IOT127 |	That's why I don't like that
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:31,199	| IOT127 |	No I take my tap out on the tech I take it you in different rooms that don't have an account for every room
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:31,967	| IOT127 |	In fact
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:35,295	| IOT127 |	Because of some news when I talk about the minute I may not buy anymore Equus at all
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,575	| IOT127 |	Yes
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,855	| IOT127 |	In fact I will you
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:40,159	| IOT127 |	Use my Sonos on the routes because
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:45,535	| IOT127 |	Sonos is set to announce its multi-room audio at features or a speaker rather
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:49,119	| IOT127 |	With a microphone is smart speakers smart speakers
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:52,703	| IOT127 |	On October 5th so we will let you know how that goes
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,031	| IOT127 |	Related to that
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:59,359	| IOT127 |	I don't know if you caught this in the Amazon press release on multi-room audio
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:05,759	| IOT127 |	Amazon has added an SDK for multi-room music and it connected speaker API
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,551	| IOT127 |	And guess who they got a quote from
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:12,159	| IOT127 |	The VP of software at Sonos
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:16,255	| IOT127 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,023	| IOT127 |	Disconnect
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:20,863	| IOT127 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,447	| IOT127 |	Scrappy dappy Doo
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:28,287	| IOT127 |	Ambidextrous of working with Bose sound United and Samsung so
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:34,175	| IOT127 |	Tell me interesting to see by the end of the year I suspect we'll see lots of Amazon Echo
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:35,455	| IOT127 |	Voice service speakers
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,735	| IOT127 |	Excellent but
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,783	| IOT127 |	What are you don't really love
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:39,295	| IOT127 |	Madam
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:40,831	| IOT127 |	What's
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,743	| IOT127 |	Here it is
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,791	| IOT127 |	Which is the giant Appliance in
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,071	| IOT127 |	Consumer
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:51,839	| IOT127 |	Home show
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:52,607	| IOT127 |	In Germany
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,375	| IOT127 |	I wish you were there
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,911	| IOT127 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:55,935	| IOT127 |	Said it would work with
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:56,447	| IOT127 |	LG
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:57,983	| IOT127 |	And other things right.
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:04,383	| IOT127 |	Yeah since you returned my speakers I'll go through this first Google Assistant will be coming soon to
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:06,943	| IOT127 |	Zillow
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:10,527	| IOT127 |	Best speaker the take-home mini by mob boy
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:12,831	| IOT127 |	And the ga10 speaker by Panasonic
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:16,159	| IOT127 |	So there will be more speakers coming but
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:16,927	| IOT127 |	You will have
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:19,487	| IOT127 |	Google assistant at least it was three speakers soon
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:23,071	| IOT127 |	I believe it's by the end of the year that's coming out later this year
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:26,911	| IOT127 |	Most of it up on the US UK Australia Canada Germany and France
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:29,983	| IOT127 |	More interesting to me is
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:33,567	| IOT127 |	LG appliances are getting
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,103	| IOT127 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,151	| IOT127 |	And my appliances I just don't mean like
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:38,943	| IOT127 |	Fridge I mean washer
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:41,247	| IOT127 |	Dryer's vacuums and more
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:46,367	| IOT127 |	And we didn't realize this at least I didn't before the show started looking around and LG I didn't know
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:49,439	| IOT127 |	Makes a series of Roomba like
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:52,511	| IOT127 |	Vacuums they call it the humba twice
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:56,863	| IOT127 |	Not called the homebodies probably Stacy said to me before they probably already is a home.
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:14:00,447	| IOT127 |	But these are from 679 to $999
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,239	| IOT127 |	Robotic vacuums
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:04,799	| IOT127 |	With cameras and security features and so on
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:08,639	| IOT127 |	It would not surprise me if these get Google Assistant later this year
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:13,503	| IOT127 |	All right
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,575	| IOT127 |	Should we call this amount of Zurich
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,087	| IOT127 |	Cortana news
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:18,623	| IOT127 |	Yes

EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:47,295	| IOT127 |	Windows 10
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,391	| IOT127 |	Deceive it's a little clunky how it's going to work
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:53,439	| IOT127 |	Microsoft says you'll just say
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,743	| IOT127 |	Hey Cortana open matinee
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:59,327	| IOT127 |	And then you can ask matabei to order something for example
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:01,887	| IOT127 |	And vice-versa can say hey madhumeh open Cortana
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:03,167	| IOT127 |	And
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,191	| IOT127 |	Maybe get your
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:04,959	| IOT127 |	Office
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,239	| IOT127 |	365
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:09,567	| IOT127 |	Next calendar event or something like that Amanda thinking I would do that but
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:12,127	| IOT127 |	Just as an example there's a little bit of clunkiness here
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:14,431	| IOT127 |	Internity interface
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:15,455	| IOT127 |	I think that's
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:17,503	| IOT127 |	Partly because voice is still so
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,271	| IOT127 |	Unusual
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:22,111	| IOT127 |	Relatively new and these kind of Partnerships and figuring out
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:24,927	| IOT127 |	How to position your brand
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,719	| IOT127 |	In voice command cuz that's
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:28,255	| IOT127 |	Part of the challenge
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:29,535	| IOT127 |	Right here like
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:35,935	| IOT127 |	This is probably a win for both companies but in my opinion is more of a win from Microsoft
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:36,703	| IOT127 |	Because
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:42,591	| IOT127 |	Originally Cortana came out on Windows phones and those are no more.
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:44,639	| IOT127 |	Product line is essentially dead
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:51,039	| IOT127 |	So yes Microsoft Cortana into the newer operating systems Windows 10 and so on so forth
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:51,807	| IOT127 |	Good
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:53,855	| IOT127 |	But it hasn't found a growing
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:57,695	| IOT127 |	Market to add Cortana to expand its base because PC
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:59,487	| IOT127 |	Market is not growing
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,535	| IOT127 |	Phones are growing but they don't have any
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,815	| IOT127 |	What is growing
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:04,095	| IOT127 |	Digital assistants
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:06,911	| IOT127 |	So now they've got their AI into
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:09,983	| IOT127 |	I don't know I'm going to guess tens of millions of
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:11,007	| IOT127 |	Amazon echos
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:13,055	| IOT127 |	This could be very interesting
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:18,175	| IOT127 |	Sing in the Enterprise space so if you guys are I would love to hear from people who are working in offices
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:19,967	| IOT127 |	What this means for you
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:22,271	| IOT127 |	You guys because I think that's where this could get
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:27,903	| IOT127 |	Interesting although a lot of people are building and putting Amazon Echo into offices I think there's
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:31,487	| IOT127 |	Real advantages to having some of the security and admin
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:34,047	| IOT127 |	Elements that Microsoft
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:39,167	| IOT127 |	I would agree with that and I go a step further and say this is Microsoft's
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:42,239	| IOT127 |	First real step into the Smart Home Market
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:43,007	| IOT127 |	Because
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:47,359	| IOT127 |	What can you do with Cortana from a Spartan perspective right now probably not much I don't think
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,383	| IOT127 |	Feeling it too
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,919	| IOT127 |	The echo you can then
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:51,199	| IOT127 |	Voice control that stuff
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:54,527	| IOT127 |	No I have been hearing rumors that Microsoft is going to announce something
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,295	| IOT127 |	Really big
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,063	| IOT127 |	Andy's Market Market
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:58,879	| IOT127 |	Would not surprise me
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,159	| IOT127 |	Actually it is a little
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:07,839	| IOT127 |	It is a little surprising because if I look at where Microsoft is not just traditionally been power
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:10,399	| IOT127 |	Powerful that where it's reaching and pushing
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,679	| IOT127 |	IT services
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,191	| IOT127 |	With azure
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:13,727	| IOT127 |	It is
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:15,007	| IOT127 |	Definitely pushing more
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:17,311	| IOT127 |	Enterprise Industrial
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,079	| IOT127 |	Data analytics
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:21,407	| IOT127 |	So it is a little odd to me that it would be like a getaway
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,479	| IOT127 |	Let's let's go back to the store
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:26,527	| IOT127 |	That just seems bizarre to me
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:32,927	| IOT127 |	But they've had two versions slimdown version of Windows to run on arm processors and Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:34,207	| IOT127 |	Pies and so on so they haven't
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:39,071	| IOT127 |	Totally overlooked this area but I would agree that Focus has been warned Enterprise
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,863	| IOT127 |	Asher is doing a great job
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:41,631	| IOT127 |	So
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:45,983	| IOT127 |	Smart speaker news story for us we have a new smart speaker
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:46,751	| IOT127 |	Slayer
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,543	| IOT127 |	This is a startup called
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:51,359	| IOT127 |	J-Stars company's name the product is Josh
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:52,895	| IOT127 |	Dot AI
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:55,199	| IOT127 |	And it is
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,479	| IOT127 |	Josh
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:56,991	| IOT127 |	Micro
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,527	| IOT127 |	Is this
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:01,087	| IOT127 |	Particular product so Josh has been around for a while
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,111	| IOT127 |	Doing
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:05,439	| IOT127 |	Professional installs and voice activation associate
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:09,535	| IOT127 |	Professional installers so you could have called like your CDA guy
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:12,863	| IOT127 |	Install basically a computer running Josh that
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:13,887	| IOT127 |	Control
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:16,447	| IOT127 |	Your control for your
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:19,007	| IOT127 |	Lutrinae or whatever else is installed in the
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:22,335	| IOT127 |	What this is it CD of this year
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:24,383	| IOT127 |	They're going to be showing off
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,919	| IOT127 |	In launching
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:29,503	| IOT127 |	Echo like device it actually looks would you say it look like Kevin
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:32,831	| IOT127 |	I said it looks like an upside-down bowl with the top cut off
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,111	| IOT127 |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,671	| IOT127 |	It reminded me of the eufy genie
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,535	| IOT127 |	We don't know how much it's going to cost
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:44,863	| IOT127 |	This is Wi-Fi the cool things that this has
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,631	| IOT127 |	Sitar
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,399	| IOT127 |	Worth thinking about
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:48,447	| IOT127 |	Is the top of it
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:49,471	| IOT127 |	Top of the
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:51,775	| IOT127 |	Which I guess would be the bottom of the bowl but
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:52,543	| IOT127 |	It's facing.
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,567	| IOT127 |	Top since it's upside down
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:58,943	| IOT127 |	That part has a motion sensor light sensors temperature sensors Etc
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:03,039	| IOT127 |	So you can do things that knows when you're in the room so you can do things like
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:06,367	| IOT127 |	Josh turn on the lights and it will actually turn on the lights of the room that
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:12,255	| IOT127 |	Has memory so it can retain the conversation
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:13,279	| IOT127 |	Been having
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:15,327	| IOT127 |	I don't know how long
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:17,119	| IOT127 |	But you know if you say turn on the lights
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:22,239	| IOT127 |	It'll turn the lights on and then if you say dim lights to 50% it'll be like
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,775	| IOT127 |	Yeah there's a light that just turned out I bet
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:26,591	| IOT127 |	So that's cool and then it also accepts
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:27,615	| IOT127 |	Multiple commands at 1
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:29,151	| IOT127 |	Which
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:30,431	| IOT127 |	Yes please
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:35,295	| IOT127 |	So I think this is really interesting without pricing
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:38,879	| IOT127 |	I'm going to see it when I'm at CDO by the way you guys I'll be
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,415	| IOT127 |	Next week
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:43,487	| IOT127 |	And we will have a special CD podcasts
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:45,023	| IOT127 |	Will get a double bonus
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,047	| IOT127 |	That's forever
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:49,119	| IOT127 |	I know you're cheering right now
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:51,935	| IOT127 |	That's only speaker
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:53,471	| IOT127 |	We got some Home Care
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:58,079	| IOT127 |	I think that's what we do as homekit devices again all this news coming out of
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:00,127	| IOT127 |	Dife orifa show
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:03,711	| IOT127 |	Elgato has some new homekit devices
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:09,343	| IOT127 |	I want is actually a refresh of an existing devices really for new devices
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:15,487	| IOT127 |	The eve Thermo is there connected radiator valves the way that's a second-generation so that way you can control your
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:19,583	| IOT127 |	He threw the scheduling and someone's got the password touch control
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,607	| IOT127 |	What temperature display
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:24,959	| IOT127 |	Bridgeless architecture and mornstar shipping on September 26
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:29,567	| IOT127 |	And then the new products are the eaves smoke smoke detector
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:34,431	| IOT127 |	The eve window guard the evelock which is done conjunction with Yale
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:37,247	| IOT127 |	And the eve Aqua connected irrigation controller
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,039	| IOT127 |	So these are all
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:45,439	| IOT127 |	Products that you would expect to see for the smartphone market not like anything at totally outrageously new but again these are all home kits
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,975	| IOT127 |	Supported so that is a big deal for them
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:49,023	| IOT127 |	It is end
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:51,583	| IOT127 |	I didn't love their original motion
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:52,863	| IOT127 |	Which I had tried
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:55,679	| IOT127 |	It wasn't very fast it didn't
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:56,959	| IOT127 |	It was big
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:58,751	| IOT127 |	Didn't love it from the sensor perspective
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:00,543	| IOT127 |	But things like
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:02,335	| IOT127 |	New lock
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,871	| IOT127 |	That's actually pretty exciting
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:05,663	| IOT127 |	870 euros
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:06,687	| IOT127 |	Roughly 60
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:10,783	| IOT127 |	So that's the homekit news out there's also a homekit light bulbs
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:12,063	| IOT127 |	How-to geek
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:14,111	| IOT127 |	It's most colors
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:18,976	| IOT127 |	It looks like a candelabra bulb but it's actually like a regular size bulb so it's
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:20,000	| IOT127 |	Rather large
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:20,512	| IOT127 |	Unwieldy
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:27,936	| IOT127 |	Sylvania smart a19 light bulb that is shaped like
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:28,960	| IOT127 |	Looking for normal light
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:31,008	| IOT127 |	Homekit enabled does not require a hub
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:33,568	| IOT127 |	And that actually works really well the colors are
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:34,848	| IOT127 |	Rich it works
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:40,992	| IOT127 |	Motion detector in homekit I've programmed that light to come on
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:41,760	| IOT127 |	Quickly
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:42,272	| IOT127 |	Pleasantly
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:46,368	| IOT127 |	I've run to the colors they are bright they're not as bright as rich as the
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:50,976	| IOT127 |	Second gen Hue richer colors if you guys are taking notes on that but they
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:52,000	| IOT127 |	Did you look lovely
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:53,792	| IOT127 |	Book lovely
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:55,328	| IOT127 |	How much is that bulb
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:55,840	| IOT127 |	45
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:22:02,752	| IOT127 |	45 peso this one is also how does homekit supported and it's 36 so it's even
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:07,872	| IOT127 |	It looks a little like I said unwieldy if you have it under a shade or something you wouldn't really see it then
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:10,432	| IOT127 |	It displays more than 16 million colors which is nice
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:15,040	| IOT127 |	All right and we're going to take a listener question
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:17,344	| IOT127 |	So our question this week is from
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:18,624	| IOT127 |	North Yarmouth
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,392	| IOT127 |	Name
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:22,208	| IOT127 |	And mr. young asking us about
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,488	| IOT127 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:24,512	| IOT127 |	He writes
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:31,680	| IOT127 |	Thank you for bringing me into the iot world I'm concerned about SmartThings not sticking around most everything is on sale now in
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:32,704	| IOT127 |	Including their newest hubs
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:35,776	| IOT127 |	Homes are being cleared out what is the successor
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:39,104	| IOT127 |	And this person really enjoys using SmartThings in two different properties
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:41,152	| IOT127 |	And there
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:42,688	| IOT127 |	Little sad about battery life
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:44,736	| IOT127 |	They would hate to see them
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:45,760	| IOT127 |	Well
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:48,576	| IOT127 |	We have an answer for you they're not leaving me
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:51,392	| IOT127 |	They were purchased by Samsung
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:51,904	| IOT127 |	A couple years ago
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:54,208	| IOT127 |	And what is happening is
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:23:00,352	| IOT127 |	I think it's part of this overall movement away from hubs because most normal mainstream consumers
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:01,632	| IOT127 |	I want to invest in a hub
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:07,008	| IOT127 |	So they'll still make those but Samsung is embedding SmartThings in smart TVs
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,544	| IOT127 |	And also into
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:11,360	| IOT127 |	It's Wi-Fi access point
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,128	| IOT127 |	Poinsettias make
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:12,640	| IOT127 |	So
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:13,664	| IOT127 |	That is
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:14,944	| IOT127 |	What is happening
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:18,528	| IOT127 |	SmartThings they are innovating they actually earlier this year
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:21,856	| IOT127 |	Did a major back-end redesigned which
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:26,720	| IOT127 |	But what it does is it gives it a lot more agility in
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:28,768	| IOT127 |	Inflexibility for building new services
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,816	| IOT127 |	And Kevin any thoughts from you
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:37,728	| IOT127 |	And it's certainly not going anywhere as you said they're going public yay I love that anywhere and everywhere that they can
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:43,872	| IOT127 |	Put SmartThings into devices appliances and so on they're going to continue doing so I would have no concern about smart things going anywhere
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,688	| IOT127 |	All right
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,480	| IOT127 |	You can keep your SmartThings stuff
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:49,504	| IOT127 |	And will
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:52,832	| IOT127 |	Yay
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:53,856	| IOT127 |	Kevin
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:57,440	| IOT127 |	You built us all a big surprise
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:58,720	| IOT127 |	Blisters
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,024	| IOT127 |	Everybody
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:03,584	| IOT127 |	Well
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:09,472	| IOT127 |	We build a voicemail system specifically for the iot podcast and while we could have done this
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:13,312	| IOT127 |	Just by using Google Voice or Skype voicemail
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:16,128	| IOT127 |	We decided to take it like a little iot project
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:16,896	| IOT127 |	So
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:23,040	| IOT127 |	I'm since we love getting your questions or comments and so on what we have is let me get the voicemail number out first and I'll explain what it is
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,600	| IOT127 |	Palace at 5 1/2
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:28,928	| IOT127 |	623-7424. Message
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:30,208	| IOT127 |	In your message
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:32,768	| IOT127 |	Let us know if it's okay to actually
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:37,632	| IOT127 |	Embed your question you're coming in the show if we don't have your permission we certainly will not do that
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:42,240	| IOT127 |	What we did is we have the response system running on a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:48,128	| IOT127 |	A headless Raspberry Pi meaning there's no monitor keyboard or mouse attached currently
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:50,688	| IOT127 |	Set it up I did have to connect a monitor to it
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:56,576	| IOT127 |	We're using the standard the software that comes on Raspberry Pi and got some Python scripts
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:58,368	| IOT127 |	They're constantly running
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:03,744	| IOT127 |	We tied those into twilio and Stacy
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:06,304	| IOT127 |	Yeah
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:10,400	| IOT127 |	There you go I was couple years back so we decided let's try to really again
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:16,800	| IOT127 |	The apis are very easy to use there's a nice little console on dashboard that tells us when you called when there's a message
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:20,128	| IOT127 |	Play your message and record it and save it and all that
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:24,736	| IOT127 |	So basically this is just a little like a set of inexpensive Raspberry Pi running
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:26,272	| IOT127 |	Python scripts
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:28,576	| IOT127 |	With the chulio so if you call it
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:31,392	| IOT127 |	You can leave a message and we will actually
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:37,280	| IOT127 |	Get a text message that we know that you have left us a message and then we'll go take a listen
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:39,840	| IOT127 |	Ye all right so let's get that number again
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:42,912	| IOT127 |	Yep it is 512
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:44,448	| IOT127 |	6 to 3
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,472	| IOT127 |	7 4
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:46,240	| IOT127 |	2/4
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:50,848	| IOT127 |	Because it was a little iot project it might make sense for me to write this up
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:56,992	| IOT127 |	For the new Stacey on iot blog we can get into it more that details for people who want to know how to do this
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:58,272	| IOT127 |	So
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:26:00,576	| IOT127 |	We're also going to put it on the website
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:02,624	| IOT127 |	Call the iot podcast listener hotline
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,392	| IOT127 |	Woohoo
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,928	| IOT127 |	And I have an Android app
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:09,280	| IOT127 |	Actually if you search for The Internet of Things podcast on Android
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:11,072	| IOT127 |	I actually think it's Stacey on iot
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:11,584	| IOT127 |	On Android
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:13,888	| IOT127 |	You should be able to find it and download the app
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,424	| IOT127 |	If you're happy that way
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:18,752	| IOT127 |	And there is a link in there to call the show
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:19,264	| IOT127 |	So
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:20,544	| IOT127 |	Guys
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:21,824	| IOT127 |	Send us your question
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:24,128	| IOT127 |	Girls also send requests
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:26,432	| IOT127 |	I cannot wait
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:28,480	| IOT127 |	Kevin thank you so much for
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,040	| IOT127 |	Yeah it was fun
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:32,576	| IOT127 |	Yeah we look forward to your write-up
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:33,856	| IOT127 |	And now
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:36,928	| IOT127 |	Let's talk about having our devices
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:42,304	| IOT127 |	Lie to each other and how that might enhance security for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:44,608	| IOT127 |	Stay tuned for our guest
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,632	| IOT127 |	Alistair Allen
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:46,912	| IOT127 |	Up next
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:53,312	| IOT127 |	On the Internet of Things podcast we're breaking into the Internet of Things podcast with the message from
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:56,384	| IOT127 |	Our sponsor sponsor is Fort Rock
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:27:00,736	| IOT127 |	And I have Robert Humphrey the CMO of four truck here to talk to me
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:02,272	| IOT127 |	So Robert
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:04,576	| IOT127 |	Fort Rock is a digital identity management
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:08,672	| IOT127 |	Why does Fort rocks platform matter for the internet
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:12,000	| IOT127 |	And what digital identity does it help
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:18,912	| IOT127 |	Companies monetize customer relationships as well as dress regulations that are filled front and center and everybody's
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:20,192	| IOT127 |	Mine our own privacy
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,216	| IOT127 |	Sense things like
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,776	| IOT127 |	European Union's gdpr
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:30,176	| IOT127 |	HIPAA regulations here in the US FCC privacy regulations Etc digital identity
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:31,712	| IOT127 |	Alias the enabler in the
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:38,112	| IOT127 |	Center of all of that digital identity initially it kind of its Inception was all about employee
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:41,696	| IOT127 |	Identity in grew into customer identity
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:44,000	| IOT127 |	And now in our differentiation
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,560	| IOT127 |	And where we were founded was all about
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:48,352	| IOT127 |	Identity of people devices
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:50,400	| IOT127 |	The difference
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:52,448	| IOT127 |	Between employee ID
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,728	| IOT127 |	Customer identity
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,264	| IOT127 |	Growing into
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:58,080	| IOT127 |	Peyote is the issue of scale
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:01,664	| IOT127 |	Employee identity is limited to the number employee somebody has
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,456	| IOT127 |	100000 is a lot of employee
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,992	| IOT127 |	Customer identity
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:07,040	| IOT127 |	Is limited to the number of them
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:09,344	| IOT127 |	Customer somebody has so it's in the Millions
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:13,952	| IOT127 |	Iot identity in the identity of things is
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:17,024	| IOT127 |	Almost unlimited but clearly it's in the billions
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:19,328	| IOT127 |	And billions identity and that
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:21,120	| IOT127 |	Is why it's important to iot
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:22,912	| IOT127 |	And that's one of my biggest differentiators
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:28,288	| IOT127 |	And how do you guys help your customers improve their businesses using
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:29,056	| IOT127 |	Digital identity
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:35,712	| IOT127 |	Start with one that people probably haven't heard of a company called Amer Sports Hammer is the owner of Wilson Sporting Goods
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:39,552	| IOT127 |	Salomon skis Atomic skis Precor exercise equipment
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:40,320	| IOT127 |	Except
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:41,600	| IOT127 |	And like a lot of companies
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:44,928	| IOT127 |	Didn't know who their customers are
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:48,512	| IOT127 |	Didn't have a relationship with the customers because of the nature of their products
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:50,048	| IOT127 |	Has done
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:51,328	| IOT127 |	Is
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:53,632	| IOT127 |	Using iot is now
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:29:00,032	| IOT127 |	Put sensors into many of their products or today you can walk into a sporting good store or buy from Amazon
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:01,568	| IOT127 |	Wilson X basketball
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:07,968	| IOT127 |	Has a sensor in it that allows you then to do really cool things with a basketball now I can play horse with somebody
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:08,992	| IOT127 |	In another country
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:10,784	| IOT127 |	Let the ball is telling me
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:12,064	| IOT127 |	Where to shoot from
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:13,856	| IOT127 |	Excedrin is tracking all that stuff
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:15,136	| IOT127 |	Interesting from a
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:18,976	| IOT127 |	Amber perspective is they now because they're connecting
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:20,000	| IOT127 |	The customer
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:21,280	| IOT127 |	Good at basketball
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:25,632	| IOT127 |	They know who their customers are and they're able to them cross cell in Excel
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:29,216	| IOT127 |	Basketball football soccer Balls Etc
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:31,520	| IOT127 |	Because they know their customers much better
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:34,592	| IOT127 |	Doing two things from the Amber perspective there knowing the customer
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:37,152	| IOT127 |	Unable to do all sorts of interesting things
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:40,224	| IOT127 |	From a customer's perspective
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:43,296	| IOT127 |	They're building more in interesting engagement
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,064	| IOT127 |	Approaches
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:48,416	| IOT127 |	Because of what they can do they can extend that Plainfield for the sporting equipment
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:51,744	| IOT127 |	Across borders across continents countries Etc
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:53,024	| IOT127 |	By connecting those ball
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:54,304	| IOT127 |	Awesome
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:56,352	| IOT127 |	Alright Robert where can I go

EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:26,560	| IOT127 |	Great to be here thanks I haven't
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:28,096	| IOT127 |	I am really excited
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:30,912	| IOT127 |	First because you're British and you're going to sound smarter
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:32,192	| IOT127 |	All of my other
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,984	| IOT127 |	Even if you're not
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,264	| IOT127 |	But
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:37,824	| IOT127 |	You actually are pretty smart so let's get started
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:38,848	| IOT127 |	Briefly
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:45,248	| IOT127 |	You have put forth some ideas about how we should secure the internet of things and how we're thinking about the way we
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:46,784	| IOT127 |	We design Hardware kind of wrong
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:49,088	| IOT127 |	Can you describe this as like a few sentences
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:50,624	| IOT127 |	Sure so
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:56,768	| IOT127 |	Recently I've come across some cases of what I'm calling maldita malicious dates are being injected into
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:31:00,608	| IOT127 |	Internet of Things sensor systems distributed sensor systems
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:02,656	| IOT127 |	And that serve kicked off a line of thought
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,680	| IOT127 |	Tell me about
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:05,216	| IOT127 |	How we're designing
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:05,984	| IOT127 |	The architectures
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:08,288	| IOT127 |	Things itself in about how
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:11,360	| IOT127 |	Those architectures affect the security
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:12,128	| IOT127 |	Fun fact
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:15,456	| IOT127 |	The the Felicity of the dates are going around those systems
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:18,528	| IOT127 |	And just didn't like it before I bite smart devices
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:19,296	| IOT127 |	Essentially
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:20,320	| IOT127 |	These days
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:22,112	| IOT127 |	Hardware is just software Raptor
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:22,624	| IOT127 |	Symplastic
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,416	| IOT127 |	An idea I think has done
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:25,696	| IOT127 |	Real harm
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:26,720	| IOT127 |	To the way with design
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:27,744	| IOT127 |	Devices
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:32,352	| IOT127 |	Let's break that down because what does it mean when you're talking about
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:33,632	| IOT127 |	Hardware just being software
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:35,936	| IOT127 |	Does that mean we're ignoring
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:37,216	| IOT127 |	Security on the hardware side
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:41,824	| IOT127 |	What's happened is that we've inherited in architecture from our software
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:44,128	| IOT127 |	System so when you
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:47,456	| IOT127 |	Ask a device to do something you'd say turn on or turn off
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:49,760	| IOT127 |	You're essentially just telling the device
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:53,088	| IOT127 |	Effectively the API the devices
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,368	| IOT127 |	Presenting to the world
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,392	| IOT127 |	Is just
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:32:00,256	| IOT127 |	The software on donut are delaying it so essentially your calling a software subroutine to do something
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:01,536	| IOT127 |	On the device
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:02,560	| IOT127 |	Which means
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:03,328	| IOT127 |	That
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:05,120	| IOT127 |	Very much is a command-and-control arkit
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,936	| IOT127 |	All the devices are presenting
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:11,264	| IOT127 |	Direct access to the physical things they do
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:13,824	| IOT127 |	So a light switch or a light bulb
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,104	| IOT127 |	Turn on or off
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:17,408	| IOT127 |	A sensor can be
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,200	| IOT127 |	You can get the value of the sensor
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:22,784	| IOT127 |	And I think that actually quite harmful architect
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:25,856	| IOT127 |	Patrick is sure as a person I should be able to tell my
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:26,624	| IOT127 |	Light bulbs
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,392	| IOT127 |	Turn on and off
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:33,280	| IOT127 |	But increasingly are smart devices are controlled by well other smart devices
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:36,096	| IOT127 |	So why should another smart device have the
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,120	| IOT127 |	Control over my thing
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:38,400	| IOT127 |	Did I do
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:39,936	| IOT127 |	So what I've been thinking about
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:40,704	| IOT127 |	Is
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:43,520	| IOT127 |	Howell devices should talk to one another Rob
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:49,408	| IOT127 |	Okay and that that makes sense because ideally we're building something that's scalable
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:50,688	| IOT127 |	It doesn't require me
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,224	| IOT127 |	To sit in the middle of
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:55,040	| IOT127 |	Tell everything in the world around me to do anything
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:59,136	| IOT127 |	So your idea here is that you will program things to lie to each
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:00,672	| IOT127 |	So how would that work
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:06,048	| IOT127 |	What are the problems with the Internet of Things always the consumer side of the internet of things right now is
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:06,560	| IOT127 |	That
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:11,168	| IOT127 |	Pretty much all of the systems that are commercially available assume that there is a human in the
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:14,496	| IOT127 |	That is part of the conversation with the device or the system
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:16,288	| IOT127 |	There is a human
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:18,592	| IOT127 |	Making decisions or at least monitor
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,360	| IOT127 |	Bring the system in some way
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:21,920	| IOT127 |	And I see said that isn't going to scale
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:23,200	| IOT127 |	What is this new way to scale that
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:26,784	| IOT127 |	It's it's if you look at your iPad right now I mean I have this problem
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:27,296	| IOT127 |	If you must have this
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:30,112	| IOT127 |	There must be 50 apps in your iPad right now to
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:32,416	| IOT127 |	Even more
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:34,720	| IOT127 |	Yeah okay I have a whole folder these
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:36,512	| IOT127 |	Exit it Scrolls page at
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:40,608	| IOT127 |	And 0 with we are outlined cases you and
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:42,656	| IOT127 |	We are not the typical consumer
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:43,168	| IOT127 |	It anyway
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:44,704	| IOT127 |	But the problem is
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:47,008	| IOT127 |	That's where the typical
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:47,776	| IOT127 |	Consumers going to be in
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:49,056	| IOT127 |	Time
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:50,592	| IOT127 |	So very obviously
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:51,872	| IOT127 |	We all know this
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:52,896	| IOT127 |	That's going to have to
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:58,016	| IOT127 |	But if you imagine the case in the future of say a smart heating system
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:01,600	| IOT127 |	And you can tell a smart heating system to turn off
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:03,392	| IOT127 |	Okay that's fine
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:05,184	| IOT127 |	Until Tim and Tina a temperature
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:06,464	| IOT127 |	Okay
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:09,024	| IOT127 |	But say you're in a kitchen
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:12,608	| IOT127 |	Your oven is smart on the oven
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:14,400	| IOT127 |	Should be able to tell a smart heating system
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:16,192	| IOT127 |	To turn off
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:18,496	| IOT127 |	Because it's turn the oven on in the heat
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:20,544	| IOT127 |	The kitchen's going to heat up because the oven
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:25,408	| IOT127 |	Or say the ovens turned off and it tells the heating system
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:26,176	| IOT127 |	How to turn back on again
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:28,480	| IOT127 |	At the same time the window is open
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:29,504	| IOT127 |	The windows smart
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:32,576	| IOT127 |	So the window tells the heating system
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:36,672	| IOT127 |	To do something else because obviously now you've got the kitchen is open to the outside in
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:37,952	| IOT127 |	I need to waste money
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:39,232	| IOT127 |	Heating outside
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:40,000	| IOT127 |	Or
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:44,864	| IOT127 |	You have a son sensor to tell you how much I liked is coming through the window and it
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:45,632	| IOT127 |	It's the middle of the day
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:52,800	| IOT127 |	Once the system is told you to turn the heating on in one system tells it to tell the heating
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:53,312	| IOT127 |	To turn off
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:56,640	| IOT127 |	What does the heating system listen to
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:59,200	| IOT127 |	Well in this is something I as an individual
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:00,480	| IOT127 |	Most of us will not work
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:04,320	| IOT127 |	I don't want to be it's hard enough that I have to set priorities in my
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:05,344	| IOT127 |	Is my internet
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:08,928	| IOT127 |	Skype calls prioritize this
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:11,232	| IOT127 |	So I can imagine saying
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:12,512	| IOT127 |	Hey listen to my window sensor
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:14,048	| IOT127 |	HVAC or
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:16,096	| IOT127 |	Oh no no listen to my ceiling fan
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:17,888	| IOT127 |	So you're
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,424	| IOT127 |	Solution
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:20,704	| IOT127 |	Your thought here is
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:24,032	| IOT127 |	The solution is that it shouldn't listen to any of
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:30,176	| IOT127 |	They should be able to talk to it and it should be able to talk to them but they shouldn't take commands from other objects
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:35,296	| IOT127 |	Why should my smart window are my Smart Oven be able to tell my heating system
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:37,088	| IOT127 |	Demand for my heat
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:37,856	| IOT127 |	System
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:38,880	| IOT127 |	Did it turn on the roll
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:42,208	| IOT127 |	They should be able to to provide information
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:43,488	| IOT127 |	Or request
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:46,048	| IOT127 |	Hey I turn on you might want to think about turning off
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:49,120	| IOT127 |	So all of this would then be mediated where
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:50,400	| IOT127 |	Because
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:53,216	| IOT127 |	The benefit of having a truly smart home is having these
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:53,984	| IOT127 |	Things have this kind
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:55,008	| IOT127 |	Conversation
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:36:00,128	| IOT127 |	Exactly the conversation is is exactly the right word right now what happens
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:02,944	| IOT127 |	Those apis are very specifically tied
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:04,480	| IOT127 |	To the function of the device
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:05,760	| IOT127 |	To turn on or off
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:07,296	| IOT127 |	Set this temperature
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:13,696	| IOT127 |	Imitated the architecture them separately currently playing with RR what a cold agent architecture is there they're actually truly
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:14,208	| IOT127 |	Smart device
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:15,744	| IOT127 |	And
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:17,536	| IOT127 |	What happens if you actually have negotiation
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:18,816	| IOT127 |	Ansel
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:20,864	| IOT127 |	The smartness if you like
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:25,984	| IOT127 |	Drop side of what's called emerging complexity did the negotiations between the various devices
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:27,520	| IOT127 |	So
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:30,336	| IOT127 |	Effectively there isn't one place where this is mediated
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:34,688	| IOT127 |	Eights mediated in the exchange of messages between all the devices
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:38,784	| IOT127 |	So what does that look like cuz I'm hearing you and I'm picturing
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:39,552	| IOT127 |	Some sort of
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:40,832	| IOT127 |	Butler inside my home
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,880	| IOT127 |	A computer that is
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:45,184	| IOT127 |	Tracking all this and making decisions
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:46,976	| IOT127 |	But that actually doesn't sound
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:47,488	| IOT127 |	Quite what you're
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:52,352	| IOT127 |	That's not exactly what I'm talking about that's that's only one architecture where
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:54,400	| IOT127 |	Where you have some sort of central point
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:56,192	| IOT127 |	Negotiation
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:58,496	| IOT127 |	Send failure what I'm talking about is more distributor
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:36:59,264	| IOT127 |	Intelligence
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:01,824	| IOT127 |	There was a case recently in California
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:03,616	| IOT127 |	Of a Vineyard
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:04,384	| IOT127 |	Square
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:06,432	| IOT127 |	Malicious data was fed into
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:09,760	| IOT127 |	Distributed water sensing system
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:11,296	| IOT127 |	So this was a system setup
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:13,344	| IOT127 |	To check the moisture in the soil
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:16,928	| IOT127 |	And automatically triggers some sprinklers if the moisture in various places
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:17,952	| IOT127 |	What's below us
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:20,512	| IOT127 |	Levelland militia States was fed into the system
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:24,864	| IOT127 |	And that automatically triggered the sprinklers in the the crop
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:25,888	| IOT127 |	Was massively overwatered
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:27,936	| IOT127 |	And farmer was fine
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:30,496	| IOT127 |	Quite a large amount by the state of California for
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:33,824	| IOT127 |	Too much water at 4 actually triggered this whole
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:34,336	| IOT127 |	Line of thought
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:36,640	| IOT127 |	List exactly what happened
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:37,920	| IOT127 |	It was one single
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:40,480	| IOT127 |	Piece of data that was One commands to go
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:41,504	| IOT127 |	Hey I have
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:43,040	| IOT127 |	Low-moisture reading here
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:43,808	| IOT127 |	Turn on the sprinkler
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:45,088	| IOT127 |	And
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:49,440	| IOT127 |	What was happening was he sprinklers was sitting in the middle of a large distributed sensor net
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:52,512	| IOT127 |	And it was one single Auburn
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:54,816	| IOT127 |	Piece of data that was saying turn on
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:55,328	| IOT127 |	Sprinklers
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:38:00,448	| IOT127 |	Why did that single piece of dates a trick of the sprinklers while because of the way the architectures work
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:03,264	| IOT127 |	It's like if you got this sensor reading
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:04,544	| IOT127 |	You should turn on
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:05,056	| IOT127 |	On the sprinklers
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:08,896	| IOT127 |	But I also have a history if there is a history
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:09,664	| IOT127 |	O2 sensor readings
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:10,432	| IOT127 |	Fine
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:13,248	| IOT127 |	It was the only piece of day so that was that was Auburn
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:13,760	| IOT127 |	It was
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:16,832	| IOT127 |	Why should that particular piece of Beto triggered
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:17,856	| IOT127 |	The water
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:19,136	| IOT127 |	Shouldn't of done
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:21,696	| IOT127 |	So what should have happened was
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:22,976	| IOT127 |	If they should have looked
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:24,000	| IOT127 |	WhatsApp history
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:26,304	| IOT127 |	The sensor readings in Gone Wild
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:29,376	| IOT127 |	And then should go die and asked all the other sensors
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:30,656	| IOT127 |	Hey
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:33,728	| IOT127 |	What's going on is like do you have those Vizsla readings
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:38,336	| IOT127 |	Initiative intensive negotiation messaging should have happened and it should have been dead and gone
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:40,640	| IOT127 |	Well that's at Auburn piece of pizza
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:41,408	| IOT127 |	It's not
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:44,224	| IOT127 |	Something I should pay attention to I'm going to ignore that
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:46,016	| IOT127 |	Are the same thing
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:47,808	| IOT127 |	Should happen of a consumer level
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:48,320	| IOT127 |	In your home
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:49,856	| IOT127 |	So
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:52,928	| IOT127 |	If I'm thinking about building and architecture like this
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:53,952	| IOT127 |	Is there enough
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:57,536	| IOT127 |	Computing power on a sensor to actually handle this kind of
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:39:01,376	| IOT127 |	Pulling for certain data and then say what
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:03,936	| IOT127 |	How does this work within the systems we already have or do we
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:05,216	| IOT127 |	Rip and replace
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:07,776	| IOT127 |	Right so
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:08,800	| IOT127 |	That's a great question
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:10,080	| IOT127 |	Because you're right
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:11,104	| IOT127 |	You can't do it everywhere
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:18,016	| IOT127 |	So I guess the way I'm modeling it right now is is a series a tiers of Architecture is so the
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:18,784	| IOT127 |	The lowest level
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:20,576	| IOT127 |	You effectively have sensors
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:21,856	| IOT127 |	That's
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:23,904	| IOT127 |	Just get out of there
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:26,464	| IOT127 |	Moisture there measuring temperature there measuring
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:27,488	| IOT127 |	Humidity
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:28,000	| IOT127 |	Whatever
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:30,560	| IOT127 |	There's no real need for them to
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:34,400	| IOT127 |	Have the sort of intelligence the result of a decision making
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:37,472	| IOT127 |	Because they have no actuators they're not going to affect the world
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:40,800	| IOT127 |	They can provide readings readings can be requested from them
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:41,568	| IOT127 |	But that's it
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:43,104	| IOT127 |	At the lowest level in the
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:45,152	| IOT127 |	The really power constrained devices
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:47,712	| IOT127 |	There's no real necessity to have
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:49,248	| IOT127 |	DeSoto decision-making
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:51,040	| IOT127 |	Ability that's necessary in this earth
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:54,880	| IOT127 |	The mid-tier where you're having
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:56,416	| IOT127 |	Devices that
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:58,720	| IOT127 |	Are have a single actuator
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:00,256	| IOT127 |	Yes is problems there
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:01,792	| IOT127 |	So your sprinkler
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:04,096	| IOT127 |	Yes it was sprinkler system
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:05,632	| IOT127 |	Is this the real
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:06,912	| IOT127 |	Necessity to have
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:08,448	| IOT127 |	High end computing
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:12,032	| IOT127 |	It just turn the valve on
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:14,336	| IOT127 |	Why would you have a high in
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:16,640	| IOT127 |	There I don't have a quite
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:19,456	| IOT127 |	As I said these are
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:20,736	| IOT127 |	Ideas and playing with
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:23,808	| IOT127 |	They're not solidified yet and yeah that's
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:24,576	| IOT127 |	That is definitely
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:27,904	| IOT127 |	You could see it being mediated by
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:34,816	| IOT127 |	Higher-end devices that have the capability to do this sort of reasoning
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:36,864	| IOT127 |	Dedicated Gateway or is it going to be like
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:38,400	| IOT127 |	Oh heck I have
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:39,680	| IOT127 |	Extra compute power right
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:41,216	| IOT127 |	Where so I'm just going
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:41,984	| IOT127 |	Can use that
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:43,264	| IOT127 |	My turn ID with the latter
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:45,056	| IOT127 |	That you have
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:46,592	| IOT127 |	Computed nodes
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:49,920	| IOT127 |	Distributed so for instance warning things you seeing is
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:50,944	| IOT127 |	Gateway devices
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:51,456	| IOT127 |	Between sensors
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:52,992	| IOT127 |	Right so
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:57,856	| IOT127 |	You have zigbee systems Gateway into IP systems you have
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:41:00,416	| IOT127 |	Ble systems Gateway tint eyepieces
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:01,184	| IOT127 |	Shenzhen
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:04,256	| IOT127 |	Vice versa so this pretty much always
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,280	| IOT127 |	Extra computer
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:06,304	| IOT127 |	Available at those Gateway
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:08,608	| IOT127 |	That could be used for this sort of stuff
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:11,168	| IOT127 |	And you also have
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:11,936	| IOT127 |	For instance
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:12,960	| IOT127 |	YP
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:13,984	| IOT127 |	Accessible Gateway
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:15,008	| IOT127 |	TED talks to her
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:15,520	| IOT127 |	Sick pieces
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:17,056	| IOT127 |	Princess run
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:17,568	| IOT127 |	Sprinklers
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:21,152	| IOT127 |	But on top of that you find manufacturers often
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:22,688	| IOT127 |	Massively over spec
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:23,712	| IOT127 |	Stata CPU
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:25,248	| IOT127 |	Necessary
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:27,040	| IOT127 |	To do these other things
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:28,832	| IOT127 |	I was just simply because it's actually notes
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:34,208	| IOT127 |	Any more expensive to use a more powerful CPU in a lot of cases than it is to use a less powerful CPU
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:37,536	| IOT127 |	Simply because of the full light for the smartphone
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:40,096	| IOT127 |	I agree and I think
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:42,912	| IOT127 |	Figuring out inefficient and
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:45,728	| IOT127 |	Secure distributed architecture
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:46,496	| IOT127 |	Accountability
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:48,288	| IOT127 |	He's going to make a huge difference
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:50,592	| IOT127 |	That's why I'm really excited about what
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:51,872	| IOT127 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:52,384	| IOT127 |	Are there
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:55,455	| IOT127 |	More things to talk about here have you figured out
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:42:00,063	| IOT127 |	Anything else or are you playing around with other ideas around this that we should talk
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:02,367	| IOT127 |	Do you want to talk about blockchain
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:05,183	| IOT127 |	So I was going to make a little pissy fun, hey what is this
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:06,463	| IOT127 |	Watch it
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:07,743	| IOT127 |	Cuz I know it's there
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:09,535	| IOT127 |	Alright let's talk about
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:12,351	| IOT127 |	Yep so blockchain is
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:13,631	| IOT127 |	Massively missing
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:15,935	| IOT127 |	It's not about digital current
EDL	00:42:16,959	00:42:17,983	| IOT127 |	It's not about
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:20,031	| IOT127 |	The exchange of value
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:25,151	| IOT127 |	Essentially blockchain is just a way to write to record a log of events
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:26,687	| IOT127 |	And it's designed to be immutable
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:27,967	| IOT127 |	If you discard the height
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:30,527	| IOT127 |	It's a mechanism for reaching
EDL	00:42:30,527	00:42:36,415	| IOT127 |	Consensus regarding the states of a shared database between multiple parties who fundamentally don't
EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:36,927	| IOT127 |	Trust each other
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:39,743	| IOT127 |	Write this is actually why I think
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:40,255	| IOT127 |	It's so
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:41,535	| IOT127 |	Powerful
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:43,583	| IOT127 |	For iot because it's both scalable
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:45,119	| IOT127 |	And gives you a kind of build
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:47,423	| IOT127 |	So I'm like yeah
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:49,471	| IOT127 |	Alright so how does blockchain fit in
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:50,495	| IOT127 |	You're talking about
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:52,031	| IOT127 |	Well
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:53,567	| IOT127 |	The whole concept of
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:55,103	| IOT127 |	Visa decisions
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:56,895	| IOT127 |	This is that you have to have
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:42:59,455	| IOT127 |	Some sort of accountability between the devices
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:42:59,967	| IOT127 |	In the architecture
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:00,991	| IOT127 |	Brightside
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:06,623	| IOT127 |	When we talk to each other you have to have some sort of memory about what this device told you last time
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:07,903	| IOT127 |	I just actually turned out
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:09,183	| IOT127 |	Trick
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:12,767	| IOT127 |	And you need a way instead of shared consensus
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:14,303	| IOT127 |	All keeping track of that
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:19,935	| IOT127 |	And so that you can also tell all the people that hey you possibly shouldn't trust if you trust me you probably shouldn't Trust
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:20,703	| IOT127 |	This other person
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:21,727	| IOT127 |	By this other device
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:25,055	| IOT127 |	Essentially what you could do is blockchain could service TripAdvisor
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:32,223	| IOT127 |	That was a big jump there okay
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:39,647	| IOT127 |	So essentially it's a review site that the blockchain is it is it immutable way to store reviews
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:41,439	| IOT127 |	Sensor readings
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:43,999	| IOT127 |	Reliable actuator
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:46,303	| IOT127 |	If I hey I asked
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:50,911	| IOT127 |	I ask this thing over here can you turn the heating up can you continue make this
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:52,703	| IOT127 |	The room hotter it never did it
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:54,495	| IOT127 |	Never ever responds to requests
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:44:00,127	| IOT127 |	This sensor heater continually reads High against all the other senses I know of
EDL	00:44:01,919	00:44:03,455	| IOT127 |	Some reviews shouldn't
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:07,039	| IOT127 |	So for instance if you go to the real TripAdvisor
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:10,111	| IOT127 |	There are a whole bunch of reviews in hotel rooms in London.
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:11,903	| IOT127 |	Complain about the lack of air conditioning
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:13,439	| IOT127 |	The rooms are really small
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:16,511	| IOT127 |	For anyone that knows about hotel rooms in London
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:18,303	| IOT127 |	That's just how things
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:19,583	| IOT127 |	Work so you should
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:22,655	| IOT127 |	Push any reliability reviews
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:27,263	| IOT127 |	So for the same thing for the blockchain reviews all the sensors
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:28,031	| IOT127 |	If
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:32,639	| IOT127 |	There's a series of reviews that are obviously unreliable because they disagree with
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:33,919	| IOT127 |	Your view of reality
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:35,199	| IOT127 |	Then you ignore them
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:36,991	| IOT127 |	The way I said
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:40,575	| IOT127 |	Plum blockchain into this the city of Architecture is
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:43,391	| IOT127 |	It's bear as a shared record
EDL	00:44:43,391	00:44:44,927	| IOT127 |	Of whatever one thinks of everyone else
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:50,303	| IOT127 |	So what happens when the one-off malicious data so let's go back to your
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:50,815	| IOT127 |	Vineyard
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:52,863	| IOT127 |	I don't know why this
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:53,887	| IOT127 |	Censor decided
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:54,655	| IOT127 |	To tell the sprinkler
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:55,679	| IOT127 |	But
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:56,959	| IOT127 |	Let's say I was
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:44:58,495	| IOT127 |	I wanted to hack this Vineyard
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:00,031	| IOT127 |	I would put this data in
EDL	00:45:00,543	00:45:01,823	| IOT127 |	How would that can at work
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:02,335	| IOT127 |	Can practice with you
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:04,639	| IOT127 |	Obscure architecture
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:09,759	| IOT127 |	Call everything has a unique identity and in the case of the vineyard it was a hack
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:11,295	| IOT127 |	And
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:12,831	| IOT127 |	They effectively
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:16,671	| IOT127 |	They injected a piece of malicious data onto the the zip beanie
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:20,511	| IOT127 |	And that was forwarded through the zigbee mesh to
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:21,279	| IOT127 |	The edge
EDL	00:45:21,279	00:45:22,559	| IOT127 |	Where the
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:28,703	| IOT127 |	The computer that drove the sprinkler system. Stop beta I went out there's a little moisture reading I have to turn on
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:29,727	| IOT127 |	The sprinklers
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:31,263	| IOT127 |	Add a course
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:34,079	| IOT127 |	The problem was that it was injected for all
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:36,383	| IOT127 |	It was a piece of data that was injected with a randomizer
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:38,943	| IOT127 |	There really was no sensor
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:39,967	| IOT127 |	That existed on that net
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:42,271	| IOT127 |	It was creating that piece of dates
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:44,831	| IOT127 |	The shadow sensor
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:46,879	| IOT127 |	It was a shadow sensor yeah
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:53,791	| IOT127 |	So the obvious thing to do in in this area barkitecture is while I've never heard from that device before why should I trust it
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:55,839	| IOT127 |	What would happen in our cases
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:45:58,399	| IOT127 |	The computer driving the sprinkler system would go
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:04,799	| IOT127 |	Hey can I have a sensor reading from all the senses I really trust about what the the moisture levels are and say we go
EDL	00:46:04,799	00:46:06,079	| IOT127 |	Do I ask for for the sensory
EDL	00:46:06,847	00:46:08,639	| IOT127 |	It wouldn't ignore it cuz that would be that
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:11,711	| IOT127 |	Because I effectively what you're doing is you're trying to
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:15,295	| IOT127 |	Responsive effectively in this case of an emergency right it's like
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:16,831	| IOT127 |	It's an emergency I need to water so
EDL	00:46:17,599	00:46:19,903	| IOT127 |	Even ignore it but you would ask the clarification
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:20,671	| IOT127 |	Seaweed mask
EDL	00:46:21,439	00:46:23,999	| IOT127 |	Ozen sushi nearby hey can you tell me
EDL	00:46:23,999	00:46:24,767	| IOT127 |	Is it dumpster
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:27,071	| IOT127 |	And it would get back to reply
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:28,351	| IOT127 |	Shirts
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:31,167	| IOT127 |	Spine here come down bring beer it's all fine
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:32,959	| IOT127 |	Out of a pony with dead
EDL	00:46:32,959	00:46:37,823	| IOT127 |	Proceed to login to the blockchain hey this particular sensor I which I've never heard about
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:40,383	| IOT127 |	Seems unreliable to me possibly you shouldn't
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:41,919	| IOT127 |	Any notice
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:43,711	| IOT127 |	Got it all right
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:44,479	| IOT127 |	Now
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:46,015	| IOT127 |	To build this architecture
EDL	00:46:46,015	00:46:48,831	| IOT127 |	I feel like we need a lot of things are you actively
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:51,903	| IOT127 |	Trying to build mock-ups of this where are you in terms of me
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:52,415	| IOT127 |	Making this reality
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:54,463	| IOT127 |	I'm at the point where I am
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:55,743	| IOT127 |	Software
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:58,047	| IOT127 |	Demos so I obviously have software simulation
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:46:59,071	| IOT127 |	Signs
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:04,959	| IOT127 |	It's a 1/2 thing I'm playing with a model of the vineyard that started me down this track
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:10,591	| IOT127 |	In the first place so I have sensors and I have actuators and I have bits of computer
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:15,711	| IOT127 |	Flowing documents between all of these so right now I'm not Resorts limited I'm not
EDL	00:47:15,711	00:47:16,479	| IOT127 |	Putting on Act
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:17,247	| IOT127 |	Mitchell Hardware
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:18,015	| IOT127 |	Deploy
EDL	00:47:18,015	00:47:20,319	| IOT127 |	It's all sitting all about
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:23,135	| IOT127 |	Half-a-dozen ec2 nodes in the cloud
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:28,767	| IOT127 |	I think that this set of malicious Tater injection is Mal de to injection something we going to see moral
EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:30,559	| IOT127 |	When the it becomes
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:31,583	| IOT127 |	I think
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:34,399	| IOT127 |	Right now the security problems we've seen
EDL	00:47:35,167	00:47:36,447	| IOT127 |	Things Are
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:37,727	| IOT127 |	Should we go with unsubtle
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:39,519	| IOT127 |	Yes but
EDL	00:47:39,519	00:47:44,895	| IOT127 |	If you think about information warfare that's essentially what this is you're going up and giving bad information
EDL	00:47:44,895	00:47:46,687	| IOT127 |	To someone something
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:47,967	| IOT127 |	And they've got to figure out
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:48,735	| IOT127 |	How to handle that
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:51,807	| IOT127 |	Alistair thanks for giving us this
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:54,111	| IOT127 |	New way of thinking about architecture for iot
EDL	00:47:54,623	00:47:57,183	| IOT127 |	And thank you also for coming on the show this week
