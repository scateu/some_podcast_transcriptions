EDL	00:00:14,592	00:00:17,664	| IOT188 |	And we have an awesome show for you today
EDL	00:00:17,664	00:00:18,944	| IOT188 |	UCM already singing
EDL	00:00:18,944	00:00:23,040	| IOT188 |	We're going to be talking about a brand new smart home company
EDL	00:00:24,064	00:00:25,088	| IOT188 |	Resideo
EDL	00:00:25,088	00:00:26,368	| IOT188 |	They just went public this week
EDL	00:00:26,368	00:00:27,648	| IOT188 |	So we're talking about that
EDL	00:00:27,648	00:00:30,464	| IOT188 |	Russell talking about the death of the Smart Home
EDL	00:00:32,000	00:00:35,328	| IOT188 |	How to get a lot of feedback on this but without debatable death
EDL	00:00:35,328	00:00:36,096	| IOT188 |	The debatable.
EDL	00:00:37,632	00:00:39,424	| IOT188 |	IRobot is going to share your room but data with
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:46,080	| IOT188 |	We've got some security flaws to talk about and we're going to talk about the death of beacons
EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:47,104	| IOT188 |	What happened there
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:50,176	| IOT188 |	Microsoft has a vision for the smart campus we've talked a little bit about it
EDL	00:00:50,176	00:00:51,968	| IOT188 |	I thought we're going to talk some more about it today
EDL	00:00:51,968	00:00:52,736	| IOT188 |	And
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:54,016	| IOT188 |	We have our guest this week
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:58,368	| IOT188 |	Is Alexandra deschamps Encino who has a brand new book about the Smart Home
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:00:59,904	| IOT188 |	Actually really good
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:02,720	| IOT188 |	And where to talk to her about servant Dynamics
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:04,256	| IOT188 |	Women in the Smart Home
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:05,024	| IOT188 |	And
EDL	00:01:05,024	00:01:07,584	| IOT188 |	Why we're currently at this weird impasse where
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:09,120	| IOT188 |	Nothing works together and we hate
EDL	00:01:11,424	00:01:12,192	| IOT188 |	But it is
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:15,008	| IOT188 |	This is a Downriver show death death and Hate
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:17,056	| IOT188 |	It is a bit of a crib
EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:18,080	| IOT188 |	Episode but
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:19,616	| IOT188 |	As always we will Shepherd you through
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:21,152	| IOT188 |	The care and cents

EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:16,192	| IOT188 |	I am excited
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:19,264	| IOT188 |	I am super excited about this news because resideo
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:20,288	| IOT188 |	What is the name of
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:22,336	| IOT188 |	Honeywell Smart Home
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:23,360	| IOT188 |	Security spin-off
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:25,152	| IOT188 |	And it's actually going to be based in Austin
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:26,176	| IOT188 |	Which is where I now live
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:26,944	| IOT188 |	Yay
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:28,224	| IOT188 |	It is
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:32,320	| IOT188 |	Honeywell over a year ago and now it said it was going to spin off some of its businesses to
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,600	| IOT188 |	Streamline this is
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:35,136	| IOT188 |	A popular thing that happens
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:37,184	| IOT188 |	Every I don't know decade or so
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:40,768	| IOT188 |	Get really big and then everything and
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,048	| IOT188 |	It goes on and
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:43,584	| IOT188 |	Sperry fun
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:46,912	| IOT188 |	This time Honeywell is doing the resideo spinoff
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:47,936	| IOT188 |	It will be based in
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,704	| IOT188 |	In Austin
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:51,776	| IOT188 |	And it joins alarm.com control
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:52,544	| IOT188 |	4
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,312	| IOT188 |	Scott is not
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:56,640	| IOT188 |	Public so it's going to become one of the Smart Home
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:59,456	| IOT188 |	Security publicly traded companies out there
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:01,504	| IOT188 |	In I think this is kind of interesting
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:03,808	| IOT188 |	Because it ties to something else you wrote
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:04,832	| IOT188 |	Kevin which is
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:06,112	| IOT188 |	About the death of the Smart Home
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,904	| IOT188 |	And I think there's a couple big themes
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:09,952	| IOT188 |	It's the debatable.
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:13,024	| IOT188 |	If I look at this the macro picture is
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,328	| IOT188 |	We have set the stage for the smart
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,608	| IOT188 |	Home in the sense that
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,632	| IOT188 |	People are interested in
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:20,704	| IOT188 |	Their understanding that they can provide
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,984	| IOT188 |	Greater security.
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:24,032	| IOT188 |	Which is why I think a lot of these companies are doing
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:25,056	| IOT188 |	Pretty well or
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:26,592	| IOT188 |	Thinking they will do pretty well
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:29,664	| IOT188 |	But I also think it's still way too complex for normal
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,968	| IOT188 |	Which is where we're getting things
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,736	| IOT188 |	Dislike
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:34,784	| IOT188 |	The Professional Services in isps getting
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:36,320	| IOT188 |	To descend actually
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,624	| IOT188 |	A company called kaylex which
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,648	| IOT188 |	I Used to Know
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,416	| IOT188 |	Decades ago when it
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:42,976	| IOT188 |	Fiber and isps
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,024	| IOT188 |	Those guys actually launch day
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,048	| IOT188 |	Smart home Gateway
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,608	| IOT188 |	That will be sold through is
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:51,424	| IOT188 |	Spews and has Amazons
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:53,216	| IOT188 |	Madam a inside of it
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:55,008	| IOT188 |	Remember you guys met him a is what we
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:57,568	| IOT188 |	We call Amazon's digital assistants so as not to set off
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:58,848	| IOT188 |	Assistance
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:01,920	| IOT188 |	And this is actually it's all part of this larger theme wear
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:03,968	| IOT188 |	DIY feels almost dead
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:05,248	| IOT188 |	And let's talk
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:08,576	| IOT188 |	I know I said this was about hubs but it relates Kevin you want to
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:09,856	| IOT188 |	Can I talk about the death
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:13,440	| IOT188 |	The Hub debatable yeah yeah I'll talk about that
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:15,488	| IOT188 |	To clarify. Make sure for my own
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:17,536	| IOT188 |	Information the Presidio
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:23,935	| IOT188 |	Business that's more focused on like consumer residential type where is Honeywell still doing like industrial things
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,727	| IOT188 |	They are I do think it's weird that they
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:26,239	| IOT188 |	Facebook that often
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:27,519	| IOT188 |	I thought there's a
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,543	| IOT188 |	God help me
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,567	| IOT188 |	Synergies
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,591	| IOT188 |	It could be had
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:36,735	| IOT188 |	No actually I think it's a good idea because of those synergies I mean from a technology standpoint
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:43,135	| IOT188 |	There are obvious synergies there but yet the implementation standpoint are very different between industrial and consumer
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,671	| IOT188 |	I think it's
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:45,695	| IOT188 |	A good idea
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:49,535	| IOT188 |	Okay well there you go and I'm thinking not industrial I'm taking more Enterprise
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:51,071	| IOT188 |	Christ-like
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:51,839	| IOT188 |	That's where
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:54,143	| IOT188 |	The health and safety those kind of things that
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:57,983	| IOT188 |	Honeywell is so good at both on the residential and Enterprise side
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,007	| IOT188 |	I think it'll be sad
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:04,639	| IOT188 |	Will Sable send me that just went public so we'll find out in the future
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:09,759	| IOT188 |	But getting back to Hubs and I understand I'm probably going to get a lot of negative feedback
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:13,087	| IOT188 |	From the die-hard readers that have had hubs
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:15,135	| IOT188 |	For years and years you know we had
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:15,903	| IOT188 |	Maybe they had
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:18,975	| IOT188 |	Extend stuff go in an insteon hubs and so on and so forth
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:22,815	| IOT188 |	And trust me I didn't like writing this because I don't want to admit
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:25,119	| IOT188 |	Defeat but I am admitting defeat to a point
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:31,519	| IOT188 |	It seems to me like the hubs of today that we talked about over the past few years say your Samsung SmartThings or wink
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:33,823	| IOT188 |	Many others that are out there that people are using
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:36,895	| IOT188 |	Hyundai people I mean listeners and readers of the site not
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:37,663	| IOT188 |	Norml's
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,967	| IOT188 |	Back to their home DIY that you were talking about
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,527	| IOT188 |	I think they've been
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,295	| IOT188 |	Usurped
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,063	| IOT188 |	Bye
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:46,367	| IOT188 |	Apple Amazon and Google
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,135	| IOT188 |	Cause
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,159	| IOT188 |	Those three are
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:54,559	| IOT188 |	Are focused far less on adding more radios to support things which we don't want to hear because
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:58,655	| IOT188 |	Ravens EP devices but these guys are focusing mainly on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:00,447	| IOT188 |	Instead of focusing on radios
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:02,495	| IOT188 |	Deep focus on user interface
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:03,775	| IOT188 |	Moving over to
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:06,079	| IOT188 |	Or away from smartphones and into
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:09,151	| IOT188 |	Speakers for voice control as well as smart displays
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:12,735	| IOT188 |	And they also reached out to extend their
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,759	| IOT188 |	Integrations with
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:14,271	| IOT188 |	Brands
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:21,439	| IOT188 |	I look at some statistics as of last week Amazon says that the number of Madame a compatible devices
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:24,255	| IOT188 |	Tupac year to date
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:27,583	| IOT188 |	Two more than 20,000 devices from over 3,500 France
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,631	| IOT188 |	Google is also doing well they
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:36,031	| IOT188 |	I got the home holiday just introduced probably this month Google Assistant works with over 10,000 smart devices
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:42,431	| IOT188 |	Brands I don't think you can say the same about Samsung or wink or any of the other hubs that people that are
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,967	| IOT188 |	Our core audience might be using
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:46,527	| IOT188 |	So I think I'm illustrating the difference in the approach
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:48,319	| IOT188 |	And what's going to happen here is
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:51,647	| IOT188 |	Okay so the automation side of things that are missing from
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:54,719	| IOT188 |	The Big Trees I say the apples that Amazon's in
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:58,047	| IOT188 |	Google that's going to comment 3 oz Apple already has that
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:00,351	| IOT188 |	They got some automations that you can do with home
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,631	| IOT188 |	Get Sophie already there
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:03,679	| IOT188 |	I could easily see Amazon
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:10,079	| IOT188 |	And Google just keep building that bass apparently there's been a 50 million installed smart speakers from those two company
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:12,127	| IOT188 |	Nice so far in the US only
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:16,479	| IOT188 |	And once they keep building it up and it becomes just a matter of time y'all together in the cloud
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:19,551	| IOT188 |	And maybe pushing down local automations and such so
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:22,879	| IOT188 |	I kind of feel like the traditional smart on love is kind of dying away
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:24,159	| IOT188 |	I think
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:27,487	| IOT188 |	And it may not be dying so much as
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,279	| IOT188 |	It's just not right for the DIY
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:34,655	| IOT188 |	So and I would be remiss if I did not say that Amazon does have the Echo Plus
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,935	| IOT188 |	Which does have a CB radio in it
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:40,287	| IOT188 |	I would say that it is complicated and
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,311	| IOT188 |	I think
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:42,847	| IOT188 |	That ties back to the
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,383	| IOT188 |	Resideo and
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,151	| IOT188 |	Piknu
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:47,967	| IOT188 |	Kalyx box for isps which is
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:50,271	| IOT188 |	If you want crazy home automation
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:54,111	| IOT188 |	Really good detailed stuff you're going to get that from someone else you're going to hire that
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,391	| IOT188 |	If you are ignored
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,183	| IOT188 |	And
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,463	| IOT188 |	I think the challenge for
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:58,975	| IOT188 |	For those guys
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:02,047	| IOT188 |	Will be to establish business models that
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:02,815	| IOT188 |	Work for
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:03,839	| IOT188 |	Consumers
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,911	| IOT188 |	So the traditional business model
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,191	| IOT188 |	There's two one is
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,727	| IOT188 |	You buy all the gear and
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,775	| IOT188 |	You pay someone to put it in and then you pay them
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,543	| IOT188 |	And come back every now and
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,591	| IOT188 |	Or you
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,639	| IOT188 |	Pay fee and get all the gear
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,943	| IOT188 |	Which seems to be what you know the isps
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:22,271	| IOT188 |	Att's the alarm.com r28 which is
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:25,599	| IOT188 |	They supply all the equipment for a fixed fee
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:27,647	| IOT188 |	You're going to pay off that equipment
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:29,439	| IOT188 |	With a service contract
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,463	| IOT188 |	And the question is
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:32,255	| IOT188 |	Will people
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,791	| IOT188 |	Want to do that
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:38,143	| IOT188 |	And I think it depends on the values you get and security is still the number one value leader for
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,191	| IOT188 |	Not home automation
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:44,031	| IOT188 |	Yeah I'd be curious just bring it down to it less expensive
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:46,079	| IOT188 |	Products I'd be curious how many
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:48,127	| IOT188 |	Smart home webcam
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:50,175	| IOT188 |	Devices and companies
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,943	| IOT188 |	Actually
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:53,247	| IOT188 |	Turn those purchases into
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:59,647	| IOT188 |	Subscriptions for cloud storage of photos and such was actually really impressed so I've talked to a couple of company
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:04,767	| IOT188 |	Used to get numbers on their subscription services and I can't name any of them be
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,303	| IOT188 |	Because I would just be very upset with me
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,327	| IOT188 |	Me for saying this
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,607	| IOT188 |	If I named them
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:09,375	| IOT188 |	Ignominious
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,399	| IOT188 |	The top companies
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:13,471	| IOT188 |	The cloud subscriptions are above 50
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:15,775	| IOT188 |	50% in some cases their above
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:16,287	| IOT188 |	80%
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,591	| IOT188 |	Wow which is actually really
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,127	| IOT188 |	That the Hyatt at REI
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:21,663	| IOT188 |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:26,783	| IOT188 |	Subscription rate in those are $5 to $10 depending on the number of cameras depending on what you wanted to do
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,343	| IOT188 |	They're also not country
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:31,135	| IOT188 |	That's another thing to think about
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:33,183	| IOT188 |	Not right that they make it very easy to sign up for
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,719	| IOT188 |	Can you put this device in
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,743	| IOT188 |	In your house you get like an email
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:39,071	| IOT188 |	Yeah send us your credit card here like okay
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,351	| IOT188 |	In some cases you don't even have to do that
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,191	| IOT188 |	Yeah let's do it
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,983	| IOT188 |	And then every month I
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:49,311	| IOT188 |	In my case with Google I get an email saying hey by the way we're going to charge you this
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:50,591	| IOT188 |	Okay cool
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:54,431	| IOT188 |	I do the same with nest and Canary right now
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:56,479	| IOT188 |	Yeah so it's a very different model
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,503	| IOT188 |	Then
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:58,015	| IOT188 |	The old one
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,039	| IOT188 |	Show
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:02,111	| IOT188 |	I think all of these stories are interrelated
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,135	| IOT188 |	In a way that
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:04,671	| IOT188 |	Going into
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,439	| IOT188 |	29th
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,207	| IOT188 |	18
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:09,791	| IOT188 |	I think based on what we're seeing from Google Amazon in
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,839	| IOT188 |	An apple mostly Amazon
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| IOT188 |	To be honest to me
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:15,167	| IOT188 |	Attaching things easier and
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,959	| IOT188 |	Voice programming easier
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:19,519	| IOT188 |	I think they're going to win at the DIY stuff
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,799	| IOT188 |	And these
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,567	| IOT188 |	Formal
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:24,383	| IOT188 |	Is formal installs with
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:25,151	| IOT188 |	Probably
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:27,967	| IOT188 |	Higher level of security more sensors
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,991	| IOT188 |	More
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,271	| IOT188 |	Baby home automation
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,551	| IOT188 |	Those guys
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,831	| IOT188 |	Are going to
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:35,903	| IOT188 |	Do well there but I do think I'll have to adjust their business
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:42,047	| IOT188 |	On the plus side something I said earlier this year is probably also wrong now if it's a
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:43,583	| IOT188 |	The future that were talking about
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,607	| IOT188 |	When I said hey
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:49,983	| IOT188 |	Smart home hubs are probably going to kill off the immigration services such as Afton stringify and so on
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:54,847	| IOT188 |	Maybe not let me get into the houses and people want all Nation
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,639	| IOT188 |	The service is certainly a value
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:58,431	| IOT188 |	Well we talked about this last week
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:02,015	| IOT188 |	But I saw GitHub actions remember how we talked about
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,551	| IOT188 |	That wasn't last week that was a couple weeks ago
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,087	| IOT188 |	That's kind of like
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:10,463	| IOT188 |	Yeah it's always been alternative
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:15,583	| IOT188 |	It is in Comcast bought stringify so they'll be building that into their
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,631	| IOT188 |	Again cloud-based services
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:20,191	| IOT188 |	So maybe we'll see if gets snapped up by
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,983	| IOT188 |	Somebody who wants to make
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,543	| IOT188 |	Life a little easier to integrate or
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,311	| IOT188 |	Maybe
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,335	| IOT188 |	Amazon
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:34,015	| IOT188 |	I thought I wrote something about it I just talked to you about it like a hundred times already
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,551	| IOT188 |	Yes
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:39,135	| IOT188 |	It isn't yes to both probably Kevin has been very consistent
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,951	| IOT188 |	He would like Amazon to buy a gift and also pink
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:47,583	| IOT188 |	I'm not saying a liking to I'm just saying I could see it happen I could see why it would make sense
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,119	| IOT188 |	All right
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:51,167	| IOT188 |	Speaking of things that
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:51,935	| IOT188 |	Makes sense
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:52,959	| IOT188 |	Or rather don't make
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,007	| IOT188 |	Let's talk about the death of
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,031	| IOT188 |	A Bluetooth Beacon
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,567	| IOT188 |	This is a really
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:12:03,199	| IOT188 |	I'm mad that I didn't write this story because I seen this coming for years and apparently there was a news Peg that got venturebeat
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:03,711	| IOT188 |	Write about it so
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:05,247	| IOT188 |	Yay venturebeat
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:06,783	| IOT188 |	Paying attention
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:09,599	| IOT188 |	That news but it was actually Google turning off
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,647	| IOT188 |	Locations nearby
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,415	| IOT188 |	In
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:12,927	| IOT188 |	Android
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:15,487	| IOT188 |	Yeah nearby notifications is gone
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,047	| IOT188 |	And most people will not miss it because
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,071	| IOT188 |	I can tell you
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:21,119	| IOT188 |	The only time I encounter nearby
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:23,935	| IOT188 |	Notifications popping up on my phone was at Bluetooth world
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,215	| IOT188 |	And I think once when I visited
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:28,799	| IOT188 |	If it doesn't have any Bluetooth for all you know it's dead
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:31,615	| IOT188 |	So basically the problem with vegans
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:35,199	| IOT188 |	Is actually very similar to some of the problems a smart home has
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:37,503	| IOT188 |	Text no
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,039	| IOT188 |	It's Halloween you guys
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,367	| IOT188 |	Goofy as all get-out
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,671	| IOT188 |	She does this all the time not just on Halloween
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,207	| IOT188 |	But I digress
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:49,023	| IOT188 |	Standards there were two competing standards
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,327	| IOT188 |	That's always tear
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:54,143	| IOT188 |	Plus battery issues
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,423	| IOT188 |	If you put a beacon somewhere
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:58,751	| IOT188 |	You would have to find it again later and change the batteries
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,287	| IOT188 |	In some cases
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,311	| IOT188 |	People would actually movie
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:05,151	| IOT188 |	It was probably more like trickster ISM or sometimes it was just a fly
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:08,223	| IOT188 |	You know they put it someplace else
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:09,247	| IOT188 |	So batteries
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:14,111	| IOT188 |	Things that move you don't know where they are these are actually common problems with sensors that are
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:15,135	| IOT188 |	Deployed in
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:17,183	| IOT188 |	Enterprises and even in the home I have
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,975	| IOT188 |	Low battery notices uncensor sound like
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:23,071	| IOT188 |	There's a couple other things to a mean
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:27,167	| IOT188 |	Beacons art out as being very inexpensive and relatively speaking they are
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:27,679	| IOT188 |	However
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:31,775	| IOT188 |	I think almost all the major league baseball stadiums put them in
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:34,079	| IOT188 |	And it's not like they just put in a few pecans
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,359	| IOT188 |	They're everywhere
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,895	| IOT188 |	When you start going
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:41,503	| IOT188 |	And buying up hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of deacons That Azz Up really quickly
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:43,551	| IOT188 |	So from that perspective a big
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,855	| IOT188 |	Location it's not exactly cheap
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:46,879	| IOT188 |	And second
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:50,975	| IOT188 |	The value you get back is really limited by something not in your control
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:54,047	| IOT188 |	Do the people at your Venue have their Bluetooth
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,839	| IOT188 |	I never have my Bluetooth on
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,143	| IOT188 |	And
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:01,727	| IOT188 |	Not only do they have to have Bluetooth on in many cases they actually have to have
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:03,007	| IOT188 |	That works with
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:04,031	| IOT188 |	Can write on
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:05,823	| IOT188 |	Black
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:07,103	| IOT188 |	Yeah there's no native
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:08,895	| IOT188 |	Integration with Google to try that
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:11,199	| IOT188 |	Buffets nearby locations in Chrome and sunset
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:12,991	| IOT188 |	What's the even so that
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,783	| IOT188 |	Completely out of their control
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,575	| IOT188 |	If you don't have your Bluetooth on
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,599	| IOT188 |	We just spent all that money for no
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:21,695	| IOT188 |	Goodbye
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,207	| IOT188 |	I have a thought
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:29,119	| IOT188 |	I would still love to see these Technologies weathers ibeacon or Eddystone Etc I would still love to see
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:31,679	| IOT188 |	CDs continue in the home because
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:33,215	| IOT188 |	I think they could work well for
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:37,311	| IOT188 |	Presence even if I had to wear a silly little Bluetooth tag on my belt or something
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,079	| IOT188 |	Why would you need that
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,103	| IOT188 |	You have your phone on you
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:39,871	| IOT188 |	At all times
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:44,735	| IOT188 |	That's not true but I don't leave again I don't leave Bluetooth on I guess I would in that case
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,015	| IOT188 |	So I think
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:48,319	| IOT188 |	Instead of physical because there's a lot of
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:50,367	| IOT188 |	Interesting plays here around virtual
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:54,463	| IOT188 |	So there are companies like missed that are creating
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,487	| IOT188 |	Basically they
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:57,535	| IOT188 |	Could access points and now that we're seeing
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:59,839	| IOT188 |	Bluetooth actually in Wi-Fi hubs
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:01,631	| IOT188 |	This is possible in other places
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:03,167	| IOT188 |	That's where you basically
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:03,935	| IOT188 |	Can
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:04,959	| IOT188 |	Be a software
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:05,727	| IOT188 |	Create
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,007	| IOT188 |	Oracle pékin
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,799	| IOT188 |	Place them in a
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:11,615	| IOT188 |	Room or place them in where the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,127	| IOT188 |	Knows there's a
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,407	| IOT188 |	Basically
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,175	| IOT188 |	And
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:18,271	| IOT188 |	While I you have presence detection you have some of the same functionality
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:18,783	| IOT188 |	And
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:22,623	| IOT188 |	If there were a standard for this would you be amazing then
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,647	| IOT188 |	Other
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,951	| IOT188 |	Smart home devices or Enterprise devices
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,999	| IOT188 |	Could use it in the Enterprise
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:29,279	| IOT188 |	You may actually
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,047	| IOT188 |	Senior Corp
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,071	| IOT188 |	Phone have something
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,375	| IOT188 |	When you're inside the
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,655	| IOT188 |	Campus so it's less of a
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:36,703	| IOT188 |	They're what we need their though
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:37,471	| IOT188 |	Is
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:39,263	| IOT188 |	One Bluetooth and ask
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:42,079	| IOT188 |	Access points possibly that standard and three
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:43,359	| IOT188 |	Really good mapping
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:44,639	| IOT188 |	Which
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,663	| IOT188 |	Good sake
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:47,711	| IOT188 |	Brings us to our next story
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:50,783	| IOT188 |	Owosso
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:53,087	| IOT188 |	Which is
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,623	| IOT188 |	IRobot
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:56,415	| IOT188 |	The makers behind Roomba
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,183	| IOT188 |	Have
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:59,999	| IOT188 |	Can I deal with Google where they will mine
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:04,607	| IOT188 |	Google's going to use the mapping data that comes off of certain Roomba Vacuum
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,143	| IOT188 |	And
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,167	| IOT188 |	Then it can establish
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:07,679	| IOT188 |	Accurate Maps
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:10,751	| IOT188 |	In a sense I can add presents
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:13,311	| IOT188 |	For a Roomba service you can say
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,079	| IOT188 |	Hey Google
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,615	| IOT188 |	Tell Roomba to clean
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:18,687	| IOT188 |	He will know where the family room is
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:20,223	| IOT188 |	Because it has the mapping
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:22,015	| IOT188 |	And Google Assistant
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:25,855	| IOT188 |	Target that particular room so that that's more value to the room itself
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:30,719	| IOT188 |	So I think that is actually that's a really good point to make because I think that is the bare minimum you have to
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,743	| IOT188 |	Tudu tudu Dada
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,535	| IOT188 |	You have to offer the user some value
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:35,583	| IOT188 |	And tell Google she's very smart
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:37,631	| IOT188 |	He said he hears about you can say go do this
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,679	| IOT188 |	But
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:41,727	| IOT188 |	It also allows Google to understand
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:42,751	| IOT188 |	What's in your
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,543	| IOT188 |	Where it is
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:45,311	| IOT188 |	And
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:48,895	| IOT188 |	It's a possibility that hey that could be either matchcrete those for
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:52,223	| IOT188 |	To be a way to understand
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:53,759	| IOT188 |	Kevin you said presents but
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:55,039	| IOT188 |	You know usually I leave when my
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,575	| IOT188 |	Is there so I'm not in
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:59,135	| IOT188 |	All of this is supposed to be opt
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:02,975	| IOT188 |	And it will not be used by Google's ad service
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:06,559	| IOT188 |	So that's that's a big plus for a lot of people like that
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:10,911	| IOT188 |	And Google is quoted in one of the stories that we read about the
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:11,935	| IOT188 |	This as
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:13,471	| IOT188 |	Saying this is basically
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:16,287	| IOT188 |	Not just a smart home but a way to create a thoughtful
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:18,335	| IOT188 |	It requires less information from
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:21,151	| IOT188 |	In Kevin and I call this context
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:21,919	| IOT188 |	And I do think
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,967	| IOT188 |	That's actually true so
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:25,759	| IOT188 |	Yay
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,039	| IOT188 |	I may have to get a room again
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:30,111	| IOT188 |	Victor doesn't clean up the
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:32,671	| IOT188 |	Crumbs to Willy's only like 3 inches tall so
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,719	| IOT188 |	Takes a long time to clean up and vacuum
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:37,023	| IOT188 |	Oh he could be like honey when you're in a fancy restaurant like
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:45,983	| IOT188 |	Get I just got the alpha of the SDK for Vector so maybe home
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:48,031	| IOT188 |	There you go
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:48,543	| IOT188 |	You do need to come
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:50,847	| IOT188 |	I'll look forward to that video
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:54,175	| IOT188 |	And could you put them in a little touch
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:57,247	| IOT188 |	I could do that
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,527	| IOT188 |	I could
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:00,063	| IOT188 |	All right so that's the
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:01,599	| IOT188 |	Roomba Google News
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,367	| IOT188 |	Who's and
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,647	| IOT188 |	Speaking of context
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:06,463	| IOT188 |	Microsoft has a vision for the smart office
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,487	| IOT188 |	Bad
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,023	| IOT188 |	They showed off in a video that
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:09,791	| IOT188 |	You know
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:11,071	| IOT188 |	I actually saw the watch
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:13,119	| IOT188 |	It's worth a watch to see what you can
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:15,935	| IOT188 |	Do eggs also kind of a UI cluster
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,959	| IOT188 |	In my opinion
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:18,751	| IOT188 |	But that could just be like the demonstration ask
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,287	| IOT188 |	So
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:22,847	| IOT188 |	In this video you swipe your employee badge again
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:23,359	| IOT188 |	And something in the wall
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,639	| IOT188 |	It knows where you are in the
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:26,943	| IOT188 |	It also can't answer it Scott
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:28,223	| IOT188 |	Cortana in there so it's answering
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:28,735	| IOT188 |	Questions about the
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,783	| IOT188 |	Hey where can I find sushi
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:33,087	| IOT188 |	I like oh it's in this cafeteria
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:33,599	| IOT188 |	Here's the menu items
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,903	| IOT188 |	Oh hey I'm here for my meeting
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:38,463	| IOT188 |	That ties into Outlook and you
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:38,975	| IOT188 |	You can send out
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:42,047	| IOT188 |	Boom everybody's in the meeting except you where are you
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:43,327	| IOT188 |	All that seems cool
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:48,191	| IOT188 |	That is cool and I've actually been looking at bikes Mart
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:49,215	| IOT188 |	Workspaces
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,775	| IOT188 |	Couple years when I was back with Google it was fun
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:57,663	| IOT188 |	Topix I was researching and so on what I like about this aside from those examples of a show-off
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,687	| IOT188 |	They also
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,967	| IOT188 |	Show how
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:05,343	| IOT188 |	Again contacts the right information at the right place and time is super important for pretty much anything in the office
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:07,135	| IOT188 |	Presently said we can put one of these
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:08,927	| IOT188 |	In the bathroom or near the bathroom
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:11,999	| IOT188 |	And if there is maybe a water issue it is a leak or something
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,535	| IOT188 |	You could swipe your badge
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:15,583	| IOT188 |	It knows where you are knows who you are
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,863	| IOT188 |	And says what can I help you with
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:21,727	| IOT188 |	There's a leak in this bathroom please open a trouble ticket but system would say okay got it
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,495	| IOT188 |	Trouble ticket
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:26,335	| IOT188 |	Assigned and opened and I know where the bathroom is I know what the problem is
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:27,615	| IOT188 |	And the reason they say that
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,383	| IOT188 |	It's important because
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:31,711	| IOT188 |	In a regular office you probably to go all the way back to your desk
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:38,111	| IOT188 |	To make a phone call to facilities and so on what you're more than likely going to get stop by other people on your way back to the desk you're going to be thinking about work
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:41,183	| IOT188 |	Things and you're not going remember to actually open the ticket
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:42,463	| IOT188 |	That is true in
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,231	| IOT188 |	Here's what I'd like to
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:46,303	| IOT188 |	Just based on that and this was again a video with
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:48,863	| IOT188 |	Anchor was talking to a person about
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:49,631	| IOT188 |	The project
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:50,399	| IOT188 |	1
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,679	| IOT188 |	Sweating your badge
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,471	| IOT188 |	Before like to exchange information
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:53,983	| IOT188 |	But the system
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,263	| IOT188 |	Felt like
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,799	| IOT188 |	Not a lot of work but you may not
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:00,127	| IOT188 |	Right so I felt like for things like notifying you of a water leak
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:01,407	| IOT188 |	Having a screen there
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:02,431	| IOT188 |	Would be really helpful
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:03,967	| IOT188 |	They can say hey what are they
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:07,039	| IOT188 |	Right or conference in progress and a lot of these screens exist
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:08,319	| IOT188 |	Places today
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:10,111	| IOT188 |	The other aspect
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:14,975	| IOT188 |	Abyss that I didn't love was there still a lot of things you shouldn't do.
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:17,023	| IOT188 |	Voice so like when it started listening
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:18,303	| IOT188 |	The places where I can find sushi
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,583	| IOT188 |	I was like oh my God
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,095	| IOT188 |	Stop talking
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:25,983	| IOT188 |	But but but it also did say for more information and it wanted you to an internal campus
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:29,823	| IOT188 |	App for the map and that's been using all that I would love to see
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:30,847	| IOT188 |	I agree
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:33,151	| IOT188 |	Open the app to see this
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:35,711	| IOT188 |	The echo a party does this Google does this
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,735	| IOT188 |	What's Google Assistant
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:38,015	| IOT188 |	I know that Microsoft
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:41,087	| IOT188 |	They're not a lot of Microsoft phones
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,367	| IOT188 |	Are there still Microsoft phones out there
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:46,207	| IOT188 |	But there's still some out there there's no new ones
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,231	| IOT188 |	But there are still some out
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:52,863	| IOT188 |	Either shoot it over my phone or have it at programmable NFC tag or something that opens the app for me or something
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:54,143	| IOT188 |	Yes cuz I already got a swipe
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,423	| IOT188 |	Something other than swiping
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,727	| IOT188 |	So many things
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:20:59,519	| IOT188 |	Hajj will be
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:02,847	| IOT188 |	My phone my NFC chip will be in my hand
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:03,871	| IOT188 |	Or that
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,687	| IOT188 |	But then you see this stuff
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,479	| IOT188 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,247	| IOT188 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,527	| IOT188 |	So that's Microsoft smart
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:12,063	| IOT188 |	Office I will also say
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:14,367	| IOT188 |	To me this was probably super practical but
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:16,672	| IOT188 |	The coolest Microsoft smartoffice demo I've ever seen
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:18,720	| IOT188 |	It's still the one from build
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:21,280	| IOT188 |	Where you walked into the conference room it had like
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:23,840	| IOT188 |	Cortana on this magical pyramid sitting on the
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:24,864	| IOT188 |	The conference room table that hand
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:27,168	| IOT188 |	The calls and also had eye thing
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:27,936	| IOT188 |	Take a camera and
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:29,216	| IOT188 |	Recognize who is in the room
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:31,264	| IOT188 |	And they were using a AI that would
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:32,288	| IOT188 |	Basically create
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:33,824	| IOT188 |	To do notes from your meeting
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:37,664	| IOT188 |	The conversation so if someone said okay I'm going to follow up on that
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,432	| IOT188 |	I'll check
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:38,944	| IOT188 |	Calendar date
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,224	| IOT188 |	Get back to you
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:42,784	| IOT188 |	It would actually we need that we so need that
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:46,880	| IOT188 |	Yeah until it breaks down and then all office product
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:50,208	| IOT188 |	What happens today when email or Slack
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:54,048	| IOT188 |	There's a lot of hanging this show
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:54,560	| IOT188 |	Sorry you guys
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,632	| IOT188 |	Oh and speaking of
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:00,192	| IOT188 |	Let's talk about security issues Kevin
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:03,008	| IOT188 |	Scary research say that the Google home hub is in
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:03,776	| IOT188 |	Sure
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,056	| IOT188 |	Google unsurprisingly is
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:06,336	| IOT188 |	Saints
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:06,848	| IOT188 |	Insecure
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:08,128	| IOT188 |	What's new
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:14,528	| IOT188 |	There's a lot of houhai about this over the past few days and it all comes from the source of a personal blog by
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:15,296	| IOT188 |	Jerry
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:16,064	| IOT188 |	Gambling
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:17,856	| IOT188 |	ESI Security advocate
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:20,416	| IOT188 |	He started nosing around
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:22,720	| IOT188 |	Once you got a Google home harbin
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:25,280	| IOT188 |	I scanned the network
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:31,680	| IOT188 |	And saw what I was doing and he saw a bunch of open TCP ports after about 15
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:32,704	| IOT188 |	5 minutes
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:34,496	| IOT188 |	He figured out using an
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:36,288	| IOT188 |	Undocumented API
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:42,688	| IOT188 |	That was one crew command he could reboot the Google home hub which puts it right back up in setup mode
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,456	| IOT188 |	Google home app
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:48,320	| IOT188 |	And I totally understand that probably should not be allowed
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:51,648	| IOT188 |	Insecure
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:57,536	| IOT188 |	All kinds of back doors and people getting information there's no information that can be gotten from resetting
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,304	| IOT188 |	The Hub
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,328	| IOT188 |	By this method
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:03,168	| IOT188 |	And the fact is you have to be on the same Wi-Fi network to actually exploit this
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:04,960	| IOT188 |	So there's an awful lot of
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:07,264	| IOT188 |	Parameters here that I don't think
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:09,056	| IOT188 |	Make this a huge issue
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:11,360	| IOT188 |	That's what Google was unsurprisingly saying you know
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:14,688	| IOT188 |	If you do reset it
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:16,992	| IOT188 |	Wouldn't cuz you're not loading them through
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:18,784	| IOT188 |	Because like resets would be bad for someone like
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:21,600	| IOT188 |	Those are actually on the device
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,368	| IOT188 |	Itself so that
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:24,160	| IOT188 |	Descanso
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:26,976	| IOT188 |	If you just reset this basically you're going to lose your
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:35,680	| IOT188 |	So somebody resets whether they unplug my Hub bore do this I mean yeah that is going to cause those kind of pro
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,216	| IOT188 |	For sure but
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,240	| IOT188 |	Again I'm like
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:40,800	| IOT188 |	Is it really insecurity kind of thing
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,848	| IOT188 |	Going to come from a standpoint I don't think so
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:46,432	| IOT188 |	Shouldn't be allowed in happen to know what's your name Google search Patchett
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:51,552	| IOT188 |	I just saw so many stories this weekend I know I don't have a Google home hub so I wasn't gets her to begin with
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:54,112	| IOT188 |	I don't think people need to be overly concerned about this
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:55,648	| IOT188 |	Yeah I have
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:56,160	| IOT188 |	The sunset
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:57,952	| IOT188 |	I tell people I'm like look
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,976	| IOT188 |	You got to evaluate
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,256	| IOT188 |	Ideas for what they really
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:01,280	| IOT188 |	Do in German
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:04,096	| IOT188 |	Profiling that's not something apparently most media do yet
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:05,632	| IOT188 |	Unfortunate
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:06,912	| IOT188 |	Is there some really scary things out
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:10,752	| IOT188 |	Hey speaking of scary other things that we
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:12,544	| IOT188 |	Is
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,824	| IOT188 |	What's the weather hijacking
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:15,104	| IOT188 |	Connected Construction
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:17,152	| IOT188 |	Because I feels like
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:20,480	| IOT188 |	I could be related to related question where you just recently in Vegas
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:21,760	| IOT188 |	I was
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:24,576	| IOT188 |	Did you know that the official City bird is a crane
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,624	| IOT188 |	That used to be the joke in Austin
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:30,720	| IOT188 |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:35,072	| IOT188 |	Why were using City jokes now anyway
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:38,144	| IOT188 |	Yeah so this is a very unique interesting
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:40,704	| IOT188 |	Security issue
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:47,104	| IOT188 |	Connected Construction crane made by telecrane that literally has a connections that the
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:50,944	| IOT188 |	Operator the crane has some assistance in terms of how to
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:53,504	| IOT188 |	Run this thing and
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:55,040	| IOT188 |	But there is an exploit
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,832	| IOT188 |	That has been documented
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:25:00,928	| IOT188 |	That is an authentication bypass by capture replay
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:03,232	| IOT188 |	And what happens if a Suleiman in the middle attack
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:05,792	| IOT188 |	And somebody could theoretically
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:07,840	| IOT188 |	Spoof commands to hijacker
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:13,728	| IOT188 |	Crane and that's really bad because that's not just like a simple reboot where nobody gets hurt that somebody could like
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:15,264	| IOT188 |	Demolish a building for all we know
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,288	| IOT188 |	So
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,056	| IOT188 |	So
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:20,128	| IOT188 |	Like you never know
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,432	| IOT188 |	That is an example of something that
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:24,736	| IOT188 |	It's unlikely but the potential harp
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,272	| IOT188 |	Is huge exactly
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,040	| IOT188 |	So
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,576	| IOT188 |	We should probably be a little bit more worried about that
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,136	| IOT188 |	Nanjing
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:32,928	| IOT188 |	We are so are they going to patch it
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:38,816	| IOT188 |	They actually have in the latest firmware telecrane has it available so construction companies can actually get it and
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:39,584	| IOT188 |	Betty
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,608	| IOT188 |	Transformer
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:41,888	| IOT188 |	Yay
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:43,680	| IOT188 |	So actually if you're operating a telegram
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:46,240	| IOT188 |	Update
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:47,264	| IOT188 |	Chicken wire
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:48,288	| IOT188 |	Firmware
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,056	| IOT188 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,592	| IOT188 |	And because I am on the show
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:51,616	| IOT188 |	Kevin is
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:53,664	| IOT188 |	Kind person that let's talk about chips
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:54,944	| IOT188 |	Because
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:57,760	| IOT188 |	For all of us who care so much about Edge AI
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:59,040	| IOT188 |	There is a
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:00,064	| IOT188 |	It's actually not a new chip
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:01,856	| IOT188 |	Company I've written about it very briefly
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:05,952	| IOT188 |	Before in the newsletter but this is a company doing a j i
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:06,464	| IOT188 |	And they're doing it
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:08,256	| IOT188 |	Increasingly low power
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:09,536	| IOT188 |	Which is awesome
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:10,816	| IOT188 |	It's sentient
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:11,840	| IOT188 |	And it has
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:16,960	| IOT188 |	Scored 25 million in a series B round it is led by Microsoft Amazon
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:19,008	| IOT188 |	Mattamy fund Intel capital
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,056	| IOT188 |	And other investors who are like
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:24,128	| IOT188 |	Yes please can we get low-power AI at the edge
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:26,432	| IOT188 |	What's cool about sentient
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,712	| IOT188 |	And there's no
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:28,992	| IOT188 |	Are you doing the style
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:31,040	| IOT188 |	Of processing called Mythic
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:36,160	| IOT188 |	Is they are getting their low-power by doing the computation in memory
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:37,440	| IOT188 |	As opposed to on
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,208	| IOT188 |	The processor
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,256	| IOT188 |	This is a fundamental change in the way
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:40,768	| IOT188 |	Computers
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,304	| IOT188 |	And
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,840	| IOT188 |	It's pretty exciting
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:45,376	| IOT188 |	We'll have to see how this works
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,400	| IOT188 |	In the real world
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:48,448	| IOT188 |	But it's power consumption
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:48,960	| IOT188 |	Is crazy low
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,240	| IOT188 |	Kevin do you remember what the
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:51,776	| IOT188 |	Assumption was
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:55,360	| IOT188 |	I don't think I mentioned the power consumption but they said that it's 8:20
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,384	| IOT188 |	Cara Operations
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:58,176	| IOT188 |	Yes
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,200	| IOT188 |	Which is
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:00,736	| IOT188 |	Yes
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:03,296	| IOT188 |	So yes this is a
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:05,856	| IOT188 |	Possibly big game-changing kind of piece of
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:06,624	| IOT188 |	Technology
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:08,160	| IOT188 |	As it with all chip stories
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:09,184	| IOT188 |	Kind of debate
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,256	| IOT188 |	But keep an eye on it
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,024	| IOT188 |	Cuz
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:13,792	| IOT188 |	We definitely need to
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,584	| IOT188 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:16,864	| IOT188 |	No
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,888	| IOT188 |	He feels like time
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,936	| IOT188 |	We're actually getting kind of roof riser

EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:19,328	| IOT188 |	This is Michael
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,096	| IOT188 |	Rochester New York
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:22,400	| IOT188 |	I don't know what I'm looking for exist
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:23,424	| IOT188 |	But I'm hoping you can help me
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,728	| IOT188 |	I have a few lifx smart bulbs
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:27,520	| IOT188 |	Only recently dawned on me
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:29,312	| IOT188 |	A place to put another ball
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:31,104	| IOT188 |	The laundry room by the motion sensor
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:33,408	| IOT188 |	This way
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:36,224	| IOT188 |	I don't currently have any kind
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:36,992	| IOT188 |	Smart Hub
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:39,808	| IOT188 |	I'm trying to avoid getting one is a lifx bulbs work on Wi-Fi
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:42,368	| IOT188 |	I tried searching for wifi-connected motionsense
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:44,928	| IOT188 |	But all I could find were some that are part of
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:45,696	| IOT188 |	Home security kit
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:48,256	| IOT188 |	I couldn't tell if they would work with stringify
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:50,816	| IOT188 |	Do you know of any Wi-Fi motion sensor
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:52,608	| IOT188 |	That would work with what I'm trying to
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:53,632	| IOT188 |	Do and if not
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:55,168	| IOT188 |	Which Smart Hub
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:55,936	| IOT188 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:57,216	| IOT188 |	Will you recommend I get into
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:00,544	| IOT188 |	I'm also wondering if you're aware of any weather
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:02,848	| IOT188 |	I can use
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:04,896	| IOT188 |	Is whatever solution I need to go with
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:05,408	| IOT188 |	My laundry room
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:07,712	| IOT188 |	I have a couple of the lifx Plus
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:10,272	| IOT188 |	Bulbs in my flood light above the front door
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:11,296	| IOT188 |	Help with the night-vision.
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:12,576	| IOT188 |	Hello doorbell
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:14,368	| IOT188 |	Okay
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:17,696	| IOT188 |	It is the death of Hub having a rate
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:18,464	| IOT188 |	Here
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:20,768	| IOT188 |	So it's unclear from your voicemail Michael
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:21,792	| IOT188 |	If you are using
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:22,560	| IOT188 |	Homekit
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:25,632	| IOT188 |	So we decided to answer this question in two ways one
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:27,936	| IOT188 |	If you're using homekit we have a solution
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:29,984	| IOT188 |	For you and two if you're not using home
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:31,520	| IOT188 |	Explain
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:33,568	| IOT188 |	Why that may be kind of an issue for you in
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,104	| IOT188 |	Talk to you around it
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:36,128	| IOT188 |	Sounds like you're using stringify
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:39,712	| IOT188 |	If you're using homekit
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:45,856	| IOT188 |	What you could do is get a pumpkin motion sensor say one from fibaro
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:48,672	| IOT188 |	Search for the laundry room door
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:52,768	| IOT188 |	Typically close our door so we don't have to hear all that noise
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:54,048	| IOT188 |	But either one would work
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:57,120	| IOT188 |	And because those are Bluetooth sensors you would not need a hub
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:30:00,192	| IOT188 |	Although you technically would have a hug with homekit anyway
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:06,592	| IOT188 |	Could with an Apple iPad or an Apple TV regardless in the home app you can create an automation to have that work
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:07,616	| IOT188 |	Okay
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:10,432	| IOT188 |	And so evil also makes one of these sensors I'm going to add a little
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:10,944	| IOT188 |	Caveat there
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:13,760	| IOT188 |	You will want a hub in your home
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:16,832	| IOT188 |	Because if you doing laundry and you don't have your phone with you
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:18,368	| IOT188 |	It's not going to
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:22,208	| IOT188 |	Well it depends on how far your laundry room is
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:23,744	| IOT188 |	Sy what
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:26,304	| IOT188 |	That is
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:28,608	| IOT188 |	Now I will say macroview
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:29,888	| IOT188 |	Is a great
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:30,912	| IOT188 |	Great system
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:33,728	| IOT188 |	I actually have the exact same thing in my laundry room
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:34,752	| IOT188 |	And I love it
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:36,544	| IOT188 |	Here's where it gets complicated
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:37,824	| IOT188 |	It if you don't use home
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:40,384	| IOT188 |	You might find a Wi-Fi sensor and we did find several
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:42,944	| IOT188 |	But there's no way necessarily
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:45,248	| IOT188 |	To tell that Wi-Fi motion sensor
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:47,040	| IOT188 |	To turn on your lifx light
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:48,832	| IOT188 |	Because you don't have that
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:49,856	| IOT188 |	Interoperability
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:50,368	| IOT188 |	Lair
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:51,904	| IOT188 |	Which is what homework
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:53,440	| IOT188 |	So
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:54,720	| IOT188 |	In that case
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:56,000	| IOT188 |	You can buy a
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:57,024	| IOT188 |	Wi-Fi sensor
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:58,560	| IOT188 |	And the bad news is
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:30:59,584	| IOT188 |	There's none that are great
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:04,192	| IOT188 |	Police are the reviews that we've seen at least for the reviews iHome makes one there's a
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:05,728	| IOT188 |	A couple of no-name brands
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:07,776	| IOT188 |	Make one so what you're going to look for
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:09,056	| IOT188 |	D-Link actually has one
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:10,336	| IOT188 |	That works with
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:12,384	| IOT188 |	If you're going to look for something that works with
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:13,664	| IOT188 |	But if or stringify
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:15,712	| IOT188 |	Is a wifi-based sensor
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:16,992	| IOT188 |	And then
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:19,552	| IOT188 |	Gil Hughes after stringify to set up the
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:21,856	| IOT188 |	When this detects motion
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:25,696	| IOT188 |	Turn on lights and then you're also going to have a toggle that says
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:28,512	| IOT188 |	After a certain number of minutes turn off the lights
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:29,024	| IOT188 |	Emotions.
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:30,560	| IOT188 |	So keep that in my
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:32,096	| IOT188 |	I'm going to
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:32,608	| IOT188 |	Tell you
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:34,400	| IOT188 |	Hugh
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:34,912	| IOT188 |	Makes
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:38,496	| IOT188 |	Everything you need to do this it is a little bit expensive
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:40,288	| IOT188 |	But that's what I'm using in my
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:42,336	| IOT188 |	Laundry room and in my master bedroom
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:46,432	| IOT188 |	I use plain white hue light bulbs and I
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:49,248	| IOT188 |	Use a Hue motion sensor and I set that up inside
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:52,320	| IOT188 |	So that way you're not going
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:53,088	| IOT188 |	Whole home hub
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:54,880	| IOT188 |	And the Hue hub
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:55,904	| IOT188 |	Talk stoop
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:56,672	| IOT188 |	Google
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:57,696	| IOT188 |	Anime
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:58,464	| IOT188 |	And homekit
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:31:59,744	| IOT188 |	So
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:02,816	| IOT188 |	That would be what I would tell you to do I know it's not ideal
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:04,096	| IOT188 |	And then you do have a hub
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:06,144	| IOT188 |	So I've all those options
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:08,448	| IOT188 |	I feel like we've given you the tools you need to
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:08,960	| IOT188 |	Find the right
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:13,568	| IOT188 |	Do you have a preference on HUB ecosystem at all
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:14,336	| IOT188 |	Personally
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:16,128	| IOT188 |	You know the Hue ecosystem is really nice
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:17,664	| IOT188 |	They keep working on it
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,432	| IOT188 |	So
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:19,456	| IOT188 |	Now if we're talking about like
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:20,992	| IOT188 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:21,760	| IOT188 |	Or wink
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:22,272	| IOT188 |	Iperf
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:23,296	| IOT188 |	Wink
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:24,576	| IOT188 |	As do I
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:25,600	| IOT188 |	Because it's just easier to
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:27,136	| IOT188 |	So
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:27,904	| IOT188 |	Michael
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:29,952	| IOT188 |	I hope this helps you feel free

EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:17,824	| IOT188 |	Security researcher
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:20,896	| IOT188 |	So this week we're talking about
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:22,944	| IOT188 |	Parental control
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:24,224	| IOT188 |	And bitdefender box
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:26,016	| IOT188 |	This is your smart home Cyrus
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:28,320	| IOT188 |	And as a parent
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,088	| IOT188 |	I wanted to ask you
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:31,392	| IOT188 |	Can technology
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:33,952	| IOT188 |	Parents concerns around things like
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:34,464	| IOT188 |	Bling
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:36,256	| IOT188 |	Shirts online
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:37,280	| IOT188 |	Yes absolutely
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:38,560	| IOT188 |	Think about it
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:43,168	| IOT188 |	Because most solutions
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:44,960	| IOT188 |	Tacolicious
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:45,984	| IOT188 |	Oriental
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:55,968	| IOT188 |	We've designed a component
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:05,440	| IOT188 |	That's going to be notified
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:09,792	| IOT188 |	Can parents rely
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:28,480	| IOT188 |	Watford
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:34,624	| IOT188 |	With somebody
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:38,976	| IOT188 |	Or when there's an exchange
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:44,352	| IOT188 |	Or when somebody ask
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:49,728	| IOT188 |	Apple
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:57,408	| IOT188 |	Have a conversation
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:02,784	| IOT188 |	Okay how does this protect my
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:03,296	| IOT188 |	My child
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:28,896	| IOT188 |	How exactly
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:30,944	| IOT188 |	Can technology help with
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:31,712	| IOT188 |	Allaying
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:32,480	| IOT188 |	Parents concerns
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:34,784	| IOT188 |	Technologies.
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:37,600	| IOT188 |	Will be able to monitor
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:43,744	| IOT188 |	Domestication to the Palace
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:48,096	| IOT188 |	You will have to have a
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:50,400	| IOT188 |	Privacy
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:58,848	| IOT188 |	This sounds reassuring
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:35:59,616	| IOT188 |	So where
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:00,640	| IOT188 |	H&R the stairs
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:01,152	| IOT188 |	How to find out
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:03,968	| IOT188 |	Absolutely they can go to
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:19,328	| IOT188 |	Everyone will go back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:21,632	| IOT188 |	Is Alexandra deschamps sonsino
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:22,912	| IOT188 |	Alex
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:26,496	| IOT188 |	She is an industrial designer and the author of a brand new book
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:27,520	| IOT188 |	Call smarter homes
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:29,824	| IOT188 |	How technology will change your whole life
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:31,360	| IOT188 |	Hi Alex how are you doing today
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:38,016	| IOT188 |	I'm really well Stacey thank you for having me probably
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:41,344	| IOT188 |	And we've actually communicated for years you are
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:44,416	| IOT188 |	Add iot watch on Twitter
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:46,976	| IOT188 |	Product for the internet
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:48,512	| IOT188 |	Cash was at 2013
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:49,792	| IOT188 |	Good night lamp
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:53,632	| IOT188 |	I actually came up with in 2005 but will ignore them
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:55,680	| IOT188 |	I made my
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,192	| IOT188 |	First batch in 20
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:59,008	| IOT188 |	So and this was a great idea
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:00,800	| IOT188 |	This was basically
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:02,336	| IOT188 |	When you turned on this lamp
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:05,920	| IOT188 |	Somewhere else in the world to someone who has a corresponding lamp it would turn on
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:07,456	| IOT188 |	For them
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,736	| IOT188 |	The idea was just a
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:10,016	| IOT188 |	Easy way to communicate
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:11,808	| IOT188 |	Guess where you were in your day
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:12,576	| IOT188 |	Describe
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:17,440	| IOT188 |	Well I like to think of it as a nice way of sharing presence and availability
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:21,024	| IOT188 |	4 family members in a different time zone it's really nice
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:22,560	| IOT188 |	They're saying
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:24,608	| IOT188 |	Colin Moran right now
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:29,216	| IOT188 |	And it just opens up that space and that day-to-day routine with your family
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:31,008	| IOT188 |	You been doing this awhile
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:32,032	| IOT188 |	You have practical experience
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:35,360	| IOT188 |	I feel like we are war-torn individuals in a smart home
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:37,408	| IOT188 |	So what made you
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:37,920	| IOT188 |	Do this
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:41,248	| IOT188 |	I wanted to write a book for the longest time
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:47,648	| IOT188 |	And I sort of looked at the smart home space because designing the goodnight land being an industrial designer by training
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:48,416	| IOT188 |	Working with
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:49,440	| IOT188 |	Super large brands
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:52,256	| IOT188 |	Customers through the years as a consultant
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:56,096	| IOT188 |	I sort of knew a lot about the space and I thought oh well I'm sure you know I
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:38:02,496	| IOT188 |	I can do more research but someone else is booked to and I really couldn't find anything beyond a bunch of
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:03,264	| IOT188 |	Chiropractor
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:04,288	| IOT188 |	Pickle
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:05,056	| IOT188 |	Somehow
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:06,848	| IOT188 |	You know quite dry books
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:08,640	| IOT188 |	Networking in the house
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:10,432	| IOT188 |	But most of them were very old
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:12,992	| IOT188 |	And most of them were very very specific
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:18,880	| IOT188 |	And I'm a little bit of a design because well coming from industrial design and interaction design so I thought it would
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:20,672	| IOT188 |	Would be really interesting to look at
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:22,208	| IOT188 |	How often we've heard
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:22,976	| IOT188 |	About
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:25,280	| IOT188 |	What's this idea of the home of the future
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:27,584	| IOT188 |	Really
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:30,144	| IOT188 |	50s
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:35,008	| IOT188 |	Efficient home at the turn of the last century but we've always had to serve obsession with
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:37,312	| IOT188 |	And I wanted to explore that in the book
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:39,360	| IOT188 |	Going back through history
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:42,944	| IOT188 |	What has changed cuz when I take a smart home now I think
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:45,760	| IOT188 |	Oh internet connectivity and that's probably what most people
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:47,552	| IOT188 |	Or actually
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:48,576	| IOT188 |	If you had asked me
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:49,088	| IOT188 |	Probably
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:51,136	| IOT188 |	Six or seven years ago that's what I
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:51,904	| IOT188 |	What I said
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:52,672	| IOT188 |	And now
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:58,048	| IOT188 |	I feel like I would say oh well it's got to be connected to the internet but more importantly it has to have some sort of
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:38:59,328	| IOT188 |	Intuitive help
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:01,120	| IOT188 |	For me it has to have some sort of AI
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:02,144	| IOT188 |	Capabilities so it's not just
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:03,168	| IOT188 |	Code access to
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:05,728	| IOT188 |	But I'm curious what your
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:07,520	| IOT188 |	Take on the evolution of the efficient home
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:08,800	| IOT188 |	To the Smart Home
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:12,640	| IOT188 |	But I think that your description is pretty accurate
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:13,152	| IOT188 |	In the sense that
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:15,456	| IOT188 |	I think for both you and I are
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:22,368	| IOT188 |	People working in the technology space and we probably think of a smart home is being a technologically enabled home
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:23,648	| IOT188 |	Where is actually free to
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:24,928	| IOT188 |	Become a reality quote
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:29,792	| IOT188 |	Get a lot more people to buy something that turns their home
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:33,376	| IOT188 |	From what they have now which they might not think of his smart
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:39,008	| IOT188 |	They just think of is their home into a quote-unquote smart home and how you get someone
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:39,520	| IOT188 |	2
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:45,408	| IOT188 |	The face really is I think the history of every new consumer technology
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:50,016	| IOT188 |	So we might try to convince people to voice assistant right now
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:51,808	| IOT188 |	Connected thermostat
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:52,576	| IOT188 |	But that's because
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:55,392	| IOT188 |	We tried to convince people to buy
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:56,928	| IOT188 |	Completely you
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:59,232	| IOT188 |	Brand spanking new homes with loads
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:02,304	| IOT188 |	Things embedded in it we used to call it domotics in the 90s
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:04,864	| IOT188 |	Comes back to a bunch
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:07,680	| IOT188 |	People who met actually in the US
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:10,496	| IOT188 |	Something called the smart house project in 1987
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:13,056	| IOT188 |	And the point there was to say how it's going to be like
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:16,384	| IOT188 |	Even IBM got involved and has
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:24,576	| IOT188 |	And you could buy the retrofitting of your entire home with connectivity which
EDL	00:40:24,576	00:40:26,112	| IOT188 |	Set the timer
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:28,672	| IOT188 |	The web as we know it now but
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:32,512	| IOT188 |	Early internet aurelly technologies and early app
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:33,280	| IOT188 |	Applications of
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:36,096	| IOT188 |	New technologies for your home to make your home life better
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:36,864	| IOT188 |	Quote unquote
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:37,888	| IOT188 |	What I found
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:40,960	| IOT188 |	Was that actually the definition of what makes a home better is
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:44,288	| IOT188 |	Exactly the same definition as 50 years ago which is not
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:44,800	| IOT188 |	Too far away from
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:47,360	| IOT188 |	Years ago so
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:49,920	| IOT188 |	The story of how we talked about
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:51,712	| IOT188 |	Conductivity in the home hasn't changed
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:52,992	| IOT188 |	And that I was really shocked
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:54,784	| IOT188 |	Okay yes
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:41:00,928	| IOT188 |	And I remember going to an IBM smart home in like 2004 and they had like RFID interactions like an
EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:02,208	| IOT188 |	Kitchen counter that would interact
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:04,000	| IOT188 |	Food bags in your medicine
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:06,048	| IOT188 |	It was crazy out there
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:07,072	| IOT188 |	Kind of need
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:09,120	| IOT188 |	Disintegrated
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:13,728	| IOT188 |	Which brings me to something you've written about in your book
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:14,496	| IOT188 |	Witches
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:15,520	| IOT188 |	The way that
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:19,360	| IOT188 |	This sort of stuff Creeps in is not the way the tech world
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:20,128	| IOT188 |	Tends to work
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:21,920	| IOT188 |	Eclipse in individually
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:22,944	| IOT188 |	Entire cyst
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:24,736	| IOT188 |	Yeah absolutely
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:28,832	| IOT188 |	I think there's something kind of quite fun and interesting about how
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:35,744	| IOT188 |	Technology Giants tend to look at the homes face as if it was a comprehensive system like Vino etcetera
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:40,352	| IOT188 |	A coyote
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:41,120	| IOT188 |	Mathematically
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:46,752	| IOT188 |	Ansible system of things that connect other things and somehow there's a trickle-down effect
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:49,312	| IOT188 |	Between the use of one thing
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:51,104	| IOT188 |	Intriguer other things
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:52,128	| IOT188 |	Because that
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:54,175	| IOT188 |	Systems diagram is so appealing
EDL	00:41:54,687	00:41:56,479	| IOT188 |	Mathematically and computationally
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:42:00,575	| IOT188 |	And that's how we build against the web but it's really not how we build
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:04,927	| IOT188 |	Tom making and how we operate and think about our homes most of us
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:06,207	| IOT188 |	Want to
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:11,071	| IOT188 |	Turn the key in the morning to leave for work and not think about the house forever more
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:13,631	| IOT188 |	But somehow we are
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:15,423	| IOT188 |	You know meant to be buying
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:18,495	| IOT188 |	Products that will make us think about the home all the time
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:21,567	| IOT188 |	Notifications all the time about the home space
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:25,663	| IOT188 |	Which we were kind of hoping we're just leave behind and get on with our day and
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:28,991	| IOT188 |	Go see your friends or go out or whatever it is
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:31,295	| IOT188 |	But now we have this kind of needy child
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:35,647	| IOT188 |	It's part of a larger system that includes our location
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:39,487	| IOT188 |	You have this
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:45,119	| IOT188 |	Square systems affect that's being created for us that I don't think is really that appealing
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:49,215	| IOT188 |	I think it's also a weird thing to want to
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:53,567	| IOT188 |	Get people to do which is to just change their lifestyle from one day to the next
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:54,847	| IOT188 |	Because
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:56,895	| IOT188 |	Technology
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:42:57,663	| IOT188 |	Change your life
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:42:59,455	| IOT188 |	Lifestyle even when it's just
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:00,991	| IOT188 |	Baez sterilizer
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:07,903	| IOT188 |	Eat your vegetables in the shape of spaghetti it's a lifestyle change
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:12,767	| IOT188 |	For those of you guys who are into the zoodles are
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:13,279	| IOT188 |	Bikini noodles
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:19,167	| IOT188 |	So I think every purchase is a leap of faith and
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:20,959	| IOT188 |	To think that an average
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:22,239	| IOT188 |	Normal household
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:28,639	| IOT188 |	Who have you know so many other fish to fry they've got jobs to keep they've got families Health to come
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:29,663	| IOT188 |	Kind of tend to
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:31,711	| IOT188 |	Did they suddenly want a whole bunch of
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:35,295	| IOT188 |	Complex interdependence interactions with their home
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:36,575	| IOT188 |	I think is really
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:37,343	| IOT188 |	Strange
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:38,879	| IOT188 |	That actually is true
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:41,951	| IOT188 |	Feel like a couple weeks ago there were a couple articles out
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:42,975	| IOT188 |	Talked about this
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:45,535	| IOT188 |	Backlash in this idea that the whole movie
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:48,351	| IOT188 |	Neurotic so somebody wrote about their
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:50,143	| IOT188 |	Connected doorbell and they were like you know
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:51,679	| IOT188 |	Every now and then I get these
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:54,495	| IOT188 |	Notifications and they say something happened outside my home
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:56,543	| IOT188 |	Can I freaked out and then I'm like
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:44:01,151	| IOT188 |	Eventually this person took it out cuz they were like
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:02,175	| IOT188 |	I don't want these nuts
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:02,943	| IOT188 |	Location
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:03,711	| IOT188 |	Very astute
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:06,527	| IOT188 |	So where can technology
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:07,807	| IOT188 |	Actually help
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:08,319	| IOT188 |	Improve our life
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:10,111	| IOT188 |	Still work with it
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:11,391	| IOT188 |	Existing
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:13,183	| IOT188 |	I guess systems are what we think we
EDL	00:44:14,719	00:44:16,255	| IOT188 |	But I think that there
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:17,535	| IOT188 |	Key and core
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:20,351	| IOT188 |	Marketplaces for smart
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:23,935	| IOT188 |	Technology
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:24,703	| IOT188 |	Trying
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:28,543	| IOT188 |	New technologies the most around me and this is anecdotal
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:30,079	| IOT188 |	It's always been you parrot
EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:32,383	| IOT188 |	New parents who are supportive
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:33,407	| IOT188 |	Completely
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:35,455	| IOT188 |	You know I'm taken aback by the task
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:39,551	| IOT188 |	Skip and a new task at hand of raising a small child and
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:41,087	| IOT188 |	Suddenly Annie
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:45,951	| IOT188 |	Time that you can shave off of even switching the lights on is a welcome
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:49,279	| IOT188 |	Intrusion in a sentence and so I do think that
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:51,327	| IOT188 |	For some people these applications
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:52,095	| IOT188 |	Useful
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:56,191	| IOT188 |	It's just they're not useful at scale that I think most
EDL	00:44:56,191	00:45:01,823	| IOT188 |	Large companies would be happy with because apart from home computers mobile phones
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:06,687	| IOT188 |	Large appliances we share almost nothing of our home life
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:08,223	| IOT188 |	We don't have the same
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:09,503	| IOT188 |	Furniture we don't
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:12,575	| IOT188 |	The same decorations you know we don't share the same
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:15,391	| IOT188 |	Comings and goings and so we can't buy
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:16,415	| IOT188 |	Unmask
EDL	00:45:16,415	00:45:17,439	| IOT188 |	The same things
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:18,975	| IOT188 |	Yes we'll probably all by you
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:21,791	| IOT188 |	The usual toilet paper ends
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:23,583	| IOT188 |	Instant coffee or something but
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:25,119	| IOT188 |	That's actually rare
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:26,655	| IOT188 |	And so I think that there is
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:29,471	| IOT188 |	Going to be very nice uses for
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:31,263	| IOT188 |	Specific products to
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:36,383	| IOT188 |	Make our lives easier to a degree but I also think that we probably have
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:37,151	| IOT188 |	Comcast
EDL	00:45:37,151	00:45:39,199	| IOT188 |	The point where we do want to make our lives
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:40,223	| IOT188 |	Home easier
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:41,759	| IOT188 |	I think we want our lives
EDL	00:45:41,759	00:45:46,111	| IOT188 |	Outside of home to be easier especially women especially in 2018
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:47,647	| IOT188 |	And I think that there is
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:49,695	| IOT188 |	An interesting dynamic
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:50,975	| IOT188 |	For companies to think about
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:52,255	| IOT188 |	The think about what
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:53,535	| IOT188 |	Women's lives
EDL	00:45:53,535	00:45:59,423	| IOT188 |	Because women tend to be the audience for smart home devices and what their needs
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:05,055	| IOT188 |	Because actually remote access might be something that you really want but
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:07,359	| IOT188 |	Not necessarily for the doorbell
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:10,687	| IOT188 |	Might be for something else entirely so thinking laterally and think
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:11,711	| IOT188 |	Thinking outside of the
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:14,271	| IOT188 |	The helm box is it where I think is really
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:15,807	| IOT188 |	The next job for large companies
EDL	00:46:16,319	00:46:21,951	| IOT188 |	OC and I'm thinking about you know hey I would love for it to be easier to buy my toilet paper and that's where things like you know
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:23,487	| IOT188 |	Amazon has the dash buttons
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:25,023	| IOT188 |	Are some interesting Fifth Element
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:28,863	| IOT188 |	Things out their ideas that have been tried Target try to program
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:29,631	| IOT188 |	Carfax
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:30,399	| IOT188 |	You had like
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:33,983	| IOT188 |	Connected soap dispensers and I think I connected toilet paper roll actually
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:35,775	| IOT188 |	It would
EDL	00:46:35,775	00:46:37,567	| IOT188 |	Put this in your home
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:38,591	| IOT188 |	Connected to the internet
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:39,615	| IOT188 |	And when it
EDL	00:46:40,127	00:46:42,175	| IOT188 |	Became low you could set it to automatic
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:43,455	| IOT188 |	Reorder things
EDL	00:46:43,455	00:46:45,247	| IOT188 |	People didn't trust it
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:46,783	| IOT188 |	Betch didn't even make all of its money that
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:50,367	| IOT188 |	I think there's also something
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:51,135	| IOT188 |	Sunny
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:51,903	| IOT188 |	About
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:58,047	| IOT188 |	Treating the home in this is something that comes back to early 1900s sort of ear I would just treating the home
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:46:59,839	| IOT188 |	The factory floor
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:01,375	| IOT188 |	Like things have to be
EDL	00:47:01,375	00:47:04,191	| IOT188 |	Fulfilled like you are you know
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:06,751	| IOT188 |	Buying new materials to
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:08,287	| IOT188 |	Make a jet engine
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:09,055	| IOT188 |	Car
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:10,335	| IOT188 |	That's not the relationship
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:11,615	| IOT188 |	People have with
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:14,943	| IOT188 |	Something even a stupid is toilet paper or soap
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:17,247	| IOT188 |	You make different decisions on soap
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:19,039	| IOT188 |	Continuously
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:20,319	| IOT188 |	I'm always kind of
EDL	00:47:20,319	00:47:21,343	| IOT188 |	Trying new brands
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:27,231	| IOT188 |	Actually Four brand this is really important for them competitive
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:32,863	| IOT188 |	Stapled to the point that people just completely stopped thinking
EDL	00:47:33,375	00:47:36,191	| IOT188 |	It's been a case for British banks for example
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:40,287	| IOT188 |	As everyone moves to digital banking people don't necessarily
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:41,823	| IOT188 |	Know about any other bank
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:44,639	| IOT188 |	Keep the physical
EDL	00:47:44,639	00:47:47,967	| IOT188 |	Stores in the physical bank tellers they have
EDL	00:47:48,991	00:47:52,575	| IOT188 |	Retail presence in order for people to know that there are there bags
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:58,975	| IOT188 |	And so I think in the home we always want to know you know what what is the newest so by could be buying
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:48:02,559	| IOT188 |	Because it's you know sulfate-free paraben-free whatever
EDL	00:48:03,071	00:48:04,863	| IOT188 |	What are the better decisions like
EDL	00:48:04,863	00:48:06,143	| IOT188 |	I could be making for my family
EDL	00:48:06,143	00:48:08,191	| IOT188 |	Play end I want to keep those options open
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:09,215	| IOT188 |	I am not
EDL	00:48:09,215	00:48:12,031	| IOT188 |	Running a industrial facility I'm running a home
EDL	00:48:12,799	00:48:17,407	| IOT188 |	I like that okay so running a home what are the things then where are the opportunities
EDL	00:48:17,919	00:48:19,711	| IOT188 |	For companies to come in
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:21,503	| IOT188 |	And make a difference you talked about new pair
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:25,855	| IOT188 |	Terrence yeah I think aging-in-place is interesting but there is a paradox at most
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:27,391	| IOT188 |	We're older
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:28,415	| IOT188 |	They don't want to be monitored
EDL	00:48:28,927	00:48:30,463	| IOT188 |	This feels very invasive
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:30,975	| IOT188 |	Are my privacy
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:32,255	| IOT188 |	So
EDL	00:48:32,767	00:48:34,559	| IOT188 |	Totally I mean
EDL	00:48:34,559	00:48:35,327	| IOT188 |	Yeah
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:40,959	| IOT188 |	Beijing conundrum is also a social
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:43,519	| IOT188 |	And I think that companies example
EDL	00:48:43,519	00:48:44,031	| IOT188 |	Voice assist
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:45,567	| IOT188 |	I would love
EDL	00:48:45,567	00:48:51,199	| IOT188 |	To see them take more of a leap of faith in actually supporting families who have
EDL	00:48:51,199	00:48:51,967	| IOT188 |	Complex needs
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:54,015	| IOT188 |	I don't really see why
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:57,855	| IOT188 |	Assistant with any voice functionality wooden
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:48:59,391	| IOT188 |	Also unable
EDL	00:48:59,391	00:49:01,695	| IOT188 |	Someone who falls in their home to
EDL	00:49:01,695	00:49:02,719	| IOT188 |	Call out for help
EDL	00:49:02,719	00:49:05,535	| IOT188 |	And for the service to be called true that boys assist
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:09,119	| IOT188 |	That should be something that companies do want to take on
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:10,655	| IOT188 |	It might be done through
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:17,055	| IOT188 |	Some more open source Voice assistance and might be something that's already come out but I mean I just haven't heard about it and I
EDL	00:49:17,055	00:49:18,079	| IOT188 |	I think that that
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:22,943	| IOT188 |	Social care peace is not necessarily going to be resolved by something you can buy
EDL	00:49:22,943	00:49:29,087	| IOT188 |	But it is definitely going to be something that something like the goodnight lamp in part does That Trick
EDL	00:49:29,087	00:49:30,879	| IOT188 |	Which is to make people more at ease about
EDL	00:49:31,903	00:49:32,671	| IOT188 |	But there are
EDL	00:49:32,671	00:49:33,183	| IOT188 |	How to be others
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:36,767	| IOT188 |	There ought to be other ways in which someone can actually
EDL	00:49:36,767	00:49:39,839	| IOT188 |	Connect their neighbors connect to their Community connect their City
EDL	00:49:39,839	00:49:42,399	| IOT188 |	Because most older people are living alone
EDL	00:49:42,399	00:49:42,911	| IOT188 |	And that's the
EDL	00:49:43,679	00:49:49,823	| IOT188 |	So all the effort that we put into convincing people to buy more soap or soap more consistently I think we ought to think about
EDL	00:49:50,335	00:49:52,127	| IOT188 |	How to get people to socialize
EDL	00:49:53,151	00:49:53,919	| IOT188 |	I like it
EDL	00:49:54,431	00:49:55,199	| IOT188 |	Talking about
EDL	00:49:55,199	00:49:57,247	| IOT188 |	People you have an interesting point
EDL	00:49:57,247	00:49:58,015	| IOT188 |	About
EDL	00:49:58,015	00:49:58,783	| IOT188 |	Power dynamic
EDL	00:49:58,783	00:49:59,551	| IOT188 |	Next and how
EDL	00:49:59,551	00:50:01,087	| IOT188 |	In the home we've had
EDL	00:50:01,087	00:50:02,111	| IOT188 |	A history of
EDL	00:50:02,111	00:50:03,135	| IOT188 |	If you're super richer
EDL	00:50:04,159	00:50:06,207	| IOT188 |	Well off that you had servants and
EDL	00:50:06,207	00:50:07,999	| IOT188 |	Even now
EDL	00:50:07,999	00:50:09,535	| IOT188 |	Dynamic
EDL	00:50:09,535	00:50:10,559	| IOT188 |	Are digital assist
EDL	00:50:11,071	00:50:13,631	| IOT188 |	Hector called assistance you tell them what to do
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:16,447	| IOT188 |	And seemed to be that we shouldn't be developing to
EDL	00:50:16,447	00:50:18,239	| IOT188 |	Schools that replicate that
EDL	00:50:19,519	00:50:23,871	| IOT188 |	Yeah I think it's a really interesting and very dangerous Dynamics
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:24,895	| IOT188 |	To constantly think of
EDL	00:50:25,407	00:50:30,271	| IOT188 |	Technology services in the home space is being some kind of subservient entity
EDL	00:50:30,783	00:50:33,599	| IOT188 |	The fact that most assistance it's not changing
EDL	00:50:33,599	00:50:36,927	| IOT188 |	Women's names
EDL	00:50:36,927	00:50:39,487	| IOT188 |	Now I saw this yesterday
EDL	00:50:39,487	00:50:45,887	| IOT188 |	A smoke alarm sounds like a woman is more likely to or sounds like at someone's mother is more likely to wake up the kids
EDL	00:50:45,887	00:50:46,655	| IOT188 |	There's this const
EDL	00:50:49,471	00:50:52,799	| IOT188 |	Dealing with Automation in the home space in a way that
EDL	00:50:52,799	00:50:55,359	| IOT188 |	Moves away from this idea of servitude
EDL	00:50:55,359	00:50:56,895	| IOT188 |	Most people you know
EDL	00:50:56,895	00:51:00,735	| IOT188 |	If they have Maids or cleaners who come in once a week or so they will
EDL	00:51:00,735	00:51:03,039	| IOT188 |	Usually clean before the maid comes in
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:05,087	| IOT188 |	Because they started feel so guilty about
EDL	00:51:05,087	00:51:05,855	| IOT188 |	Using
EDL	00:51:05,855	00:51:06,879	| IOT188 |	Someone else for their
EDL	00:51:07,391	00:51:10,463	| IOT188 |	Ponies and part of this is because we live in
EDL	00:51:10,463	00:51:13,279	| IOT188 |	Especially North America we live in home sitter
EDL	00:51:13,279	00:51:14,047	| IOT188 |	Enormous
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:16,607	| IOT188 |	Compared to the space that we used to have a hundred years ago
EDL	00:51:17,887	00:51:19,167	| IOT188 |	Still have these tasks
EDL	00:51:19,679	00:51:20,447	| IOT188 |	We feel need
EDL	00:51:20,447	00:51:23,519	| IOT188 |	To be done at the United Pace that is incredible
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:25,567	| IOT188 |	We have basically removed
EDL	00:51:25,567	00:51:27,871	| IOT188 |	Most germs from
EDL	00:51:27,871	00:51:33,503	| IOT188 |	Children's environments to the point where now we're actively encouraging parents to
EDL	00:51:33,503	00:51:36,063	| IOT188 |	Make sure that their kids eat dirt somewhere and Beak
EDL	00:51:36,063	00:51:37,087	| IOT188 |	Because otherwise it
EDL	00:51:37,087	00:51:39,903	| IOT188 |	Immune system doesn't develop so we've
EDL	00:51:39,903	00:51:41,695	| IOT188 |	Assertive overdone it on the home side
EDL	00:51:42,463	00:51:43,999	| IOT188 |	And I think this idea of
EDL	00:51:43,999	00:51:45,023	| IOT188 |	Having someone
EDL	00:51:45,023	00:51:47,839	| IOT188 |	Help you do that is something that we probably should
EDL	00:51:49,119	00:51:51,423	| IOT188 |	In terms of language in terms of application
EDL	00:51:51,423	00:51:52,959	| IOT188 |	Maybe you can have
EDL	00:51:52,959	00:51:56,031	| IOT188 |	A friend has something with you and that's a completely different
EDL	00:51:56,031	00:51:56,543	| IOT188 |	Powerdyne
EDL	00:51:57,055	00:51:58,591	| IOT188 |	Can having an assistant
EDL	00:51:58,591	00:52:04,735	| IOT188 |	And it's also completely different Dynamic than having someone come into your home and help you do something
EDL	00:52:05,503	00:52:07,551	| IOT188 |	Help and it's not necessarily
EDL	00:52:07,551	00:52:10,623	| IOT188 |	Subservience you know a friend can help you your parents can have
EDL	00:52:10,623	00:52:11,135	| IOT188 |	How to do something
EDL	00:52:11,647	00:52:15,999	| IOT188 |	But somehow the language that we use commercially is still very tied to this idea
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:17,279	| IOT188 |	Service and servitude
EDL	00:52:18,047	00:52:20,351	| IOT188 |	If you compared to a hundred years ago well you know
EDL	00:52:21,119	00:52:23,679	| IOT188 |	People have made some live-in maids and living Cooks
EDL	00:52:23,679	00:52:24,703	| IOT188 |	But they also
EDL	00:52:24,703	00:52:27,775	| IOT188 |	Cared for them and they were pay they were housed they were
EDL	00:52:31,103	00:52:32,383	| IOT188 |	Unless you were superb
EDL	00:52:32,383	00:52:33,407	| IOT188 |	Rich you actually usually
EDL	00:52:35,199	00:52:35,967	| IOT188 |	See you later
EDL	00:52:39,807	00:52:41,599	| IOT188 |	Buses to Downton Abbey Upstairs Downstairs
EDL	00:52:42,111	00:52:43,135	| IOT188 |	Situation which was pretty
EDL	00:52:44,415	00:52:50,815	| IOT188 |	Reserved for it was the elite and they actually were the ones who really didn't understand you took
EDL	00:52:50,815	00:52:53,119	| IOT188 |	Allergies because electricity men's
EDL	00:52:53,119	00:52:55,167	| IOT188 |	Especially Plumbing mint
EDL	00:52:56,447	00:52:58,495	| IOT188 |	Wouldn't necessarily have a servant
EDL	00:52:58,495	00:52:59,263	| IOT188 |	Bring water
EDL	00:53:03,359	00:53:05,151	| IOT188 |	They just didn't get the point
EDL	00:53:06,943	00:53:10,527	| IOT188 |	Would have a completely different facility operate yourself
EDL	00:53:11,039	00:53:12,319	| IOT188 |	They're like this is a
EDL	00:53:12,319	00:53:13,343	| IOT188 |	Downsizing of
EDL	00:53:13,343	00:53:14,367	| IOT188 |	What I have now
EDL	00:53:14,367	00:53:15,647	| IOT188 |	So they're not necessarily the best
EDL	00:53:16,415	00:53:17,695	| IOT188 |	Look to for inspiration
EDL	00:53:18,207	00:53:19,743	| IOT188 |	Got it okay
EDL	00:53:19,743	00:53:22,815	| IOT188 |	Well the book is available in the US on
EDL	00:53:22,815	00:53:26,399	| IOT188 |	Amazon it's called smarter homes how technology will change your whole life
EDL	00:53:26,399	00:53:31,775	| IOT188 |	And it's also available in the UK from the a press.com website
EDL	00:53:31,775	00:53:36,895	| IOT188 |	And it's 20 lb if you're in the UK and it's about $30 for the digital version
EDL	00:53:36,895	00:53:37,407	| IOT188 |	In the US
