EDL	00:00:08,704	00:00:11,520	| IOT055 |	Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:00:11,520	00:00:12,544	| IOT055 |	This is your house
EDL	00:00:12,544	00:00:14,592	| IOT055 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:15,104	00:00:15,616	| IOT055 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:17,152	00:00:18,432	| IOT055 |	Excited
EDL	00:00:18,432	00:00:19,968	| IOT055 |	About
EDL	00:00:21,504	00:00:23,808	| IOT055 |	I think Intel's actually excited about the earnings
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:31,744	| IOT055 |	Announcing its shift away from the
EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:32,512	| IOT055 |	PPC Market
EDL	00:00:32,512	00:00:33,536	| IOT055 |	Place which we all knew it had to
EDL	00:00:34,304	00:00:36,352	| IOT055 |	They said they would lay off 12
EDL	00:00:37,888	00:00:38,656	| IOT055 |	Is a lot
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:39,424	| IOT055 |	Not good
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:41,984	| IOT055 |	Good luck for those people
EDL	00:00:42,496	00:00:45,056	| IOT055 |	And let's talk about their Internet of Things
EDL	00:00:45,824	00:00:46,592	| IOT055 |	Because that's
EDL	00:00:46,592	00:00:47,616	| IOT055 |	What are the places nearby
EDL	00:00:48,128	00:00:51,968	| IOT055 |	Yeah it is some infectious their highest growth area out of the other lines
EDL	00:00:51,968	00:00:54,016	| IOT055 |	The business of misery said they're kind of
EDL	00:00:54,016	00:00:57,600	| IOT055 |	I wasn't getting the PC market
EDL	00:00:57,600	00:00:58,368	| IOT055 |	Putting
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:01:01,184	| IOT055 |	Less emphasis on it with other areas of opportunity
EDL	00:01:02,208	00:01:07,328	| IOT055 |	Out of style 13.7 billion dollars in Revenue they still took in 7.5 billion in there
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:08,608	| IOT055 |	Current Computing group
EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:09,376	| IOT055 |	It's down
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:10,656	| IOT055 |	But that's okay
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:14,496	| IOT055 |	Is Internet of Things the Internet of Things group Revenue has
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:20,128	| IOT055 |	651 million which is up 4% sequentially and up 22%
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:21,408	| IOT055 |	Which is good and
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:26,272	| IOT055 |	Until Ashlyn calls it out saying this is their big growth area and where they are investing for the future
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:31,392	| IOT055 |	Is it actually earlier this week I met with rose schooler who's ahead of
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:37,280	| IOT055 |	She's in charge of data center
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:38,816	| IOT055 |	Enterprise pit of horizant
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:39,840	| IOT055 |	Platform for iot
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:43,936	| IOT055 |	Everything to do with the Enterprise and big business
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:51,616	| IOT055 |	Road maps
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:53,408	| IOT055 |	Corporate
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:53,920	| IOT055 |	Pikachu meaning
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,528	| IOT055 |	And bring out is
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:00,320	| IOT055 |	The recognized
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:04,928	| IOT055 |	Technology especially on the back end with regards to cloud data processing and security
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:08,256	| IOT055 |	Bring that too
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:13,120	| IOT055 |	Now Rose is a really honest person so she basically told me she's like
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:14,656	| IOT055 |	We are trying to get to
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:16,192	| IOT055 |	50%
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:18,240	| IOT055 |	When we going to incorporate
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:20,288	| IOT055 |	Corporate client
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:22,080	| IOT055 |	And we're just not there yet
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,104	| IOT055 |	And she's right
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:25,152	| IOT055 |	Right now if you're doing an enterprise-level
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,456	| IOT055 |	Deployment where you're trying to
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:32,320	| IOT055 |	I don't know you can do all kinds of
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:37,952	| IOT055 |	Are still highly custom jobs that require systems integrators
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:40,256	| IOT055 |	That's just not going to be
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,280	| IOT055 |	A business
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:44,352	| IOT055 |	I mean it'll be any type of business but it's not the kind of business
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:46,144	| IOT055 |	Pregnancy huge
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:46,912	| IOT055 |	From so
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:51,264	| IOT055 |	Rose and I talked about getting to that kind of scalable reusable
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:53,312	| IOT055 |	Enterprise internet
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,872	| IOT055 |	Until school is
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,152	| IOT055 |	Platforms
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:59,200	| IOT055 |	Sanders groups
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:00,224	| IOT055 |	And their technology
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,016	| IOT055 |	Sew-in getting Developers
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,576	| IOT055 |	So that's that
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,856	| IOT055 |	I don't know if that really helps
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,904	| IOT055 |	It's not a bad message it's actually
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:10,976	| IOT055 |	Quite good for Penthouse point of view there if they're banking on more than they're still at
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,536	| IOT055 |	Yeah well they have for now I'm in
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:21,472	| IOT055 |	Recognizing the big trends in the industry so it's just a question of
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:27,104	| IOT055 |	Christopher companies
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:27,872	| IOT055 |	Or
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,896	| IOT055 |	Yeah you can go to Honeywell
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,176	| IOT055 |	If your
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,760	| IOT055 |	That's probably the real question
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:34,272	| IOT055 |	Twitch
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:37,088	| IOT055 |	Interesting in the next 10 years
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:40,416	| IOT055 |	It's almost funny to look back at some of the big
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,720	| IOT055 |	Computer / platform companies
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,512	| IOT055 |	From 30 years ago how
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,560	| IOT055 |	You know the PC really helped make them
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,120	| IOT055 |	And now they're struggling innocence
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:51,936	| IOT055 |	But they are pivoting and Reinventing themselves
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,728	| IOT055 |	Shifting assets and Investments
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:59,616	| IOT055 |	It's just kind of having grown up in that era
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:02,688	| IOT055 |	When they were all up and coming in big
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,224	| IOT055 |	You're watching it happen
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,784	| IOT055 |	Which is another way of saying getting
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,464	| IOT055 |	In other news
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:22,911	| IOT055 |	Which is not necessarily A
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:23,423	| IOT055 |	Household
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,471	| IOT055 |	But they make amplifiers
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:27,519	| IOT055 |	And RF components for a bride
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:32,127	| IOT055 |	There's actually some silicon a bears in the
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:34,431	| IOT055 |	Echoing other things
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,455	| IOT055 |	So
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,039	| IOT055 |	But
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:39,807	| IOT055 |	What does it mean
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:43,135	| IOT055 |	It basically means that we're going to start seeing
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,927	| IOT055 |	Consolidation
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,207	| IOT055 |	Around Radio
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:46,975	| IOT055 |	Technologies
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:47,743	| IOT055 |	And
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:48,511	| IOT055 |	Zippy is
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:53,887	| IOT055 |	Good that because it's all so it's on the same protocol radio layer as thread
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:54,911	| IOT055 |	So
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,447	| IOT055 |	My guess is
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:58,495	| IOT055 |	Is corvo seize an opportunity here
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:02,591	| IOT055 |	There are in the space specially at the component level in
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:06,431	| IOT055 |	Brinkley for the internet of things a lot of the radio stuff is probably going to be kind of
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,223	| IOT055 |	Martha component-level
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:09,503	| IOT055 |	Overtime
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:12,319	| IOT055 |	So this is a good move for the zip because
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,879	| IOT055 |	Well I read
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,159	| IOT055 |	Cordless betting on it being
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,743	| IOT055 |	Will it be I don't know but
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:22,559	| IOT055 |	It's interesting. Just letting it run numbers green pee cuz
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,095	| IOT055 |	Shipped over 100 million
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:27,679	| IOT055 |	Zigbee chips in the smartphone market which is why I mean just
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:31,007	| IOT055 |	That's a lot inside the Comcast
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:33,567	| IOT055 |	RF remote so instead of using infrared
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:36,895	| IOT055 |	Set the Comcast Xfinity remote
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:42,015	| IOT055 |	Okay so it's a wireless not an infrared
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:50,975	| IOT055 |	You install a home audio system in there like I put a screen in here
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:54,303	| IOT055 |	Yeah we can extenders
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:57,375	| IOT055 |	Can I have a little sensor out there for your IR remote cix
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,167	| IOT055 |	Those days are over I think
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,191	| IOT055 |	So yes
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:03,263	| IOT055 |	Green tea can I guess corvo is betting on that
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:07,615	| IOT055 |	And in some ways I might be bad for the market like if you're big
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:09,151	| IOT055 |	Radio company in your leg
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:12,223	| IOT055 |	Silicon labs
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:15,295	| IOT055 |	What do I have to offer other than just this
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,319	| IOT055 |	Space component
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:18,879	| IOT055 |	Cuz that's that's a different world of chips than you know
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,671	| IOT055 |	Being high up in the staff
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:26,047	| IOT055 |	Yeah can we talk about chips a little bit more just real quick
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:26,559	| IOT055 |	Always
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:33,727	| IOT055 |	Just before the show you shared some interesting information with me about a chip in your smart
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:42,175	| IOT055 |	Citizen Beach it won't even better Segway what the heck happened to your light bulb
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,783	| IOT055 |	Just just read your Tweet
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:47,295	| IOT055 |	All right
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,439	| IOT055 |	I haven't
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:55,999	| IOT055 |	UShip
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,559	| IOT055 |	Espino People Get Ready
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:06:59,839	| IOT055 |	Get ready
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,631	| IOT055 |	Alright so here's between
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:05,727	| IOT055 |	The 20-year lifespan on my smartphone at the two-year lifespan
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:06,495	| IOT055 |	The radio inside
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:09,567	| IOT055 |	80 more years
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,871	| IOT055 |	What
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,431	| IOT055 |	Well
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:19,551	| IOT055 |	Essentially this the lights which means
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:21,599	| IOT055 |	When I talk to my lights
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,391	| IOT055 |	Spell for example using
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:23,903	| IOT055 |	The echo
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:26,207	| IOT055 |	I will say turn on kitchen
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,023	| IOT055 |	Well actually I'll say turn off kitchen
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,839	| IOT055 |	Everything but one life
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,351	| IOT055 |	Turns off
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:35,167	| IOT055 |	You sure it's not just
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:41,567	| IOT055 |	Something set up in the with the Hub or anything it's definitely the ball but you switch sockets or actually reset
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,335	| IOT055 |	All the light bulbs
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,871	| IOT055 |	And it didn't
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:45,151	| IOT055 |	Reset
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:50,527	| IOT055 |	So that's got to be paid like 40 or 50 bucks for a
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:56,415	| IOT055 |	A basic this is the original $15 GE link bulb
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:57,695	| IOT055 |	Too bad
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:01,791	| IOT055 |	Dollar so7
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,583	| IOT055 |	When I realize I realized
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,143	| IOT055 |	So basically I got about
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:08,447	| IOT055 |	18 months
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,799	| IOT055 |	This actually happened
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:14,335	| IOT055 |	Tutu lights that I got
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,359	| IOT055 |	Originally and I returned
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:19,711	| IOT055 |	Elderly on the process
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:20,735	| IOT055 |	Martin super smooth
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:21,759	| IOT055 |	Last year or so
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,599	| IOT055 |	And I don't have the packaging anymore because
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:27,135	| IOT055 |	Do you know after a year York
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,183	| IOT055 |	It's just clutter at that
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:32,511	| IOT055 |	I'm going to have to pick up
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:34,047	| IOT055 |	I'm probably going to put in an oz
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:37,119	| IOT055 |	Yay yay
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,423	| IOT055 |	No no I haven't
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,055	| IOT055 |	Idaho
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,103	| IOT055 |	You could I could send you mine
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,431	| IOT055 |	So yes in this gets to
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,479	| IOT055 |	A bigger problem for the internet
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:53,503	| IOT055 |	Once we talked about it
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:54,783	| IOT055 |	But it's
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,575	| IOT055 |	A lot of these things are in your house
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:01,183	| IOT055 |	They're designed to last a really long time but the components inside of them
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:02,719	| IOT055 |	You know there
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,511	| IOT055 |	Their Hardware
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,303	| IOT055 |	It's probably not going to last that long
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:06,815	| IOT055 |	So
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:07,839	| IOT055 |	How do we
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,655	| IOT055 |	Yeah I mean I've got
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:15,263	| IOT055 |	A closet full of dead devices which everything to go with bring to the electronics recycling
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,311	| IOT055 |	If they have it
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,335	| IOT055 |	Something
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:19,615	| IOT055 |	Computers
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:22,175	| IOT055 |	Tablas whatever it may be
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:22,943	| IOT055 |	5 6
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:25,503	| IOT055 |	7 years before
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:28,063	| IOT055 |	Some chipset went bad or some
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:30,111	| IOT055 |	Something happened
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:35,999	| IOT055 |	Yeah when you're talking about things you put in your house that you expect to last a long long time ago
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,791	| IOT055 |	Switchable doorbell
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,071	| IOT055 |	Stats problem
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:42,143	| IOT055 |	So that the next problem that I'm about to do
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:44,959	| IOT055 |	Is it's also a pain to
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:49,311	| IOT055 |	Unhook these from a system so when I'm going to take that bulge out
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,591	| IOT055 |	I'm going to have
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,359	| IOT055 |	2
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,407	| IOT055 |	It's not as simple as just replacing a bulb and everything
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:02,367	| IOT055 |	Discovery
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:07,743	| IOT055 |	This is probably really first real world pop problems but they're real problem
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:11,583	| IOT055 |	First world
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:17,471	| IOT055 |	And so that's one thing I will say that I did it I talk to a company named eco
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,007	| IOT055 |	Which
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,543	| IOT055 |	I did profile in my newsletter
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,335	| IOT055 |	If you decide that
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:24,383	| IOT055 |	That's okay because this company is selling
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:26,943	| IOT055 |	Hot swappable light switches
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:30,015	| IOT055 |	Little boxes
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:36,415	| IOT055 |	Modular switches that fit into boxes the boxes are wired to your
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:39,231	| IOT055 |	Electric electoral system but the switch itself
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:40,511	| IOT055 |	Pop out
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:44,095	| IOT055 |	Exactly and there's
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,167	| IOT055 |	New homes will have
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,703	| IOT055 |	Basically smart bulbs
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:52,799	| IOT055 |	And the cool thing is that the founder of this company
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:56,639	| IOT055 |	And I were talking and he's he explained that it's hot swappable and he went with the
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,199	| IOT055 |	Grey modular system because
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:01,759	| IOT055 |	He knew that a lot of the technologies that we have to
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:02,527	| IOT055 |	Today
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,807	| IOT055 |	Are not going to be the technology
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:04,831	| IOT055 |	5 or 10
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,159	| IOT055 |	Different Technologies
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:09,183	| IOT055 |	Protocols
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:09,951	| IOT055 |	Wireless
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:10,975	| IOT055 |	Whatever yeah absolutely
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,167	| IOT055 |	It's a pain to wire those
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,983	| IOT055 |	Well that's funny you say that because
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,799	| IOT055 |	For my 2010 installation of the insteon
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:26,591	| IOT055 |	Stuff I still have
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:30,175	| IOT055 |	Three insteon switches hardwired in my house
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:34,015	| IOT055 |	Even though I'm not running an insteon system at all I'm just using his radio switches obviously
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:36,575	| IOT055 |	If they're still little LED on their tail
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,343	| IOT055 |	What's the latest
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:39,391	| IOT055 |	Honor office should be on or off
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:43,231	| IOT055 |	I just didn't want to be bothered on wiring a butt with Chico's doing is
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:44,767	| IOT055 |	Okay.
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:46,815	| IOT055 |	Popping a different module
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,607	| IOT055 |	If you decide like
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,399	| IOT055 |	But no longer Z-Wave caliper
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,447	| IOT055 |	Is a loser
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:56,799	| IOT055 |	People
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:02,431	| IOT055 |	Selling a strictly to contractors at this point
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:04,479	| IOT055 |	Strictly to builders it's actually a
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,247	| IOT055 |	Prototype
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:05,759	| IOT055 |	Right now
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,855	| IOT055 |	It's a switch box
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:11,391	| IOT055 |	An electrical box
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,671	| IOT055 |	The shell
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:14,207	| IOT055 |	The frame that sits inside the wall
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:21,631	| IOT055 |	Electrical wiring
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:23,679	| IOT055 |	Bright
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:25,215	| IOT055 |	You could that mean if you're doing like a
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,007	| IOT055 |	Reset a retrofit of
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,287	| IOT055 |	Your house
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:29,823	| IOT055 |	Remodel
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,359	| IOT055 |	Just the remote
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,383	| IOT055 |	Expensive
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:35,711	| IOT055 |	Alice nightmare if you're doing that you could probably
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:38,783	| IOT055 |	Try for this but I'd wait a little longer because right now they're still testing
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:47,743	| IOT055 |	Macy's I would be interested in as an end-user consumer because I would like to swap out different things in but not well
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:54,143	| IOT055 |	This looks interesting because they're switch the hot swappable switch has a capacitor glass touchscreen
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:58,495	| IOT055 |	And that they have three different kinds right now one is like a basic dimmer
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,263	| IOT055 |	When is
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,031	| IOT055 |	I think
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:02,591	| IOT055 |	A couple different options in the one is a 4
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,407	| IOT055 |	Program for things in it
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:06,943	| IOT055 |	Four options like
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:09,759	| IOT055 |	The switch that you went to the room that you're
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:11,551	| IOT055 |	The light switches in but also like a button
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:13,087	| IOT055 |	Controlling the whole house
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:13,599	| IOT055 |	I'm turning it off
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,391	| IOT055 |	And
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:19,999	| IOT055 |	Again I think it's a smart way to go about it it's not as fancy as a lot of the light switches that we
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,279	| IOT055 |	Today
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:28,959	| IOT055 |	I'm thinking about like the most mainstream consumer is
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:31,263	| IOT055 |	Future-proof in terms of the technology
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:35,615	| IOT055 |	Tunic set like they're not interested in time is light switch is to
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,407	| IOT055 |	HBC system
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:39,967	| IOT055 |	That's not something
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:43,807	| IOT055 |	Other builders are really big they're looking for ways to offer
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,855	| IOT055 |	Customers services
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:46,879	| IOT055 |	Make a charge for the
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:50,975	| IOT055 |	So you could see your Builder
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,255	| IOT055 |	Echo Plus something else
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,303	| IOT055 |	Creating a software for
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:54,815	| IOT055 |	For your home
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,143	| IOT055 |	You passed $10
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:00,447	| IOT055 |	No
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,239	| IOT055 |	I know you want to
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:04,543	| IOT055 |	It's something to think
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:06,591	| IOT055 |	I already thought about it and
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:12,479	| IOT055 |	Sorry I'm not subscribing to my house
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,015	| IOT055 |	Well you know
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:16,063	| IOT055 |	My friend is so I'll give you
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:18,367	| IOT055 |	Sister-in-law
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:21,439	| IOT055 |	Pest Control built into the wall so it's kind of like those
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,743	| IOT055 |	You remember those old school indoor vacuum
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:27,583	| IOT055 |	Full House
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,631	| IOT055 |	I don't know what those things are called
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:34,751	| IOT055 |	Pest control company comes in and
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:35,775	| IOT055 |	Basically
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,055	| IOT055 |	Pest Control
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:40,383	| IOT055 |	Delivery thing to like this to becomes
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,687	| IOT055 |	And it runs throughout their whole body
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:45,759	| IOT055 |	Deception is the home
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:47,295	| IOT055 |	Daughter got a cut of
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:47,807	| IOT055 |	Whatever

EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:58,047	| IOT055 |	So it may not be as simple as a subscription to your home it may be like a 2-year dusita installer
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,583	| IOT055 |	I don't know
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,375	| IOT055 |	I know you still don't like it
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,959	| IOT055 |	I'm also.
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:06,239	| IOT055 |	Poison Spa
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:08,799	| IOT055 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,591	| IOT055 |	Andre Rieu should be
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,871	| IOT055 |	Leary
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,687	| IOT055 |	Why were
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:16,223	| IOT055 |	Random everywhere subject
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:17,759	| IOT055 |	Cuz we are at their nose
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:21,599	| IOT055 |	I found another use for the Amazon tap
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,135	| IOT055 |	So
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:23,903	| IOT055 |	Tapped is
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:28,511	| IOT055 |	But I ran into a person
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:30,047	| IOT055 |	I was going to say that's really good that you found
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:31,071	| IOT055 |	And if you don't have
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,631	| IOT055 |	I'm still not sure I buy one
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:34,655	| IOT055 |	Here it goes
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,191	| IOT055 |	Because I thought this was worthwhile
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:40,543	| IOT055 |	The top which is the portable Amazon Echo like
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,311	| IOT055 |	Device that you have
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:45,919	| IOT055 |	Talk to you as opposed to just talk to you it's not always listening
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,943	| IOT055 |	This guy
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:49,759	| IOT055 |	Cuz there's a little rubber sling that
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:56,671	| IOT055 |	Kids it is can't actually run around the house carrying it with him and basically they
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:59,231	| IOT055 |	They bring their music with them and
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:00,255	| IOT055 |	Bring it for like
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:02,815	| IOT055 |	Whatever else they were
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,327	| IOT055 |	I want to do with you
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,935	| IOT055 |	Oh no I haven't imaginative
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,895	| IOT055 |	Echo actually broke
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,175	| IOT055 |	He was one of the early
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:19,199	| IOT055 |	People who on an echo
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,015	| IOT055 |	When it died in
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,295	| IOT055 |	His whole family was bereft
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,575	| IOT055 |	Surprise kids with their tabs
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:29,951	| IOT055 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,231	| IOT055 |	We see that it's not on
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:34,047	| IOT055 |	Let's send you to they send them to a link
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:38,143	| IOT055 |	And the link basically had to reorder a power supply it came for
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:38,655	| IOT055 |	Like the next day
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:42,495	| IOT055 |	They were going to send
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:44,543	| IOT055 |	That's impressive
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:46,335	| IOT055 |	So there's your Echo if it breaks
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:49,151	| IOT055 |	Cuz apparently they've got
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:52,223	| IOT055 |	The kids are getting a lot of really good data from this
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:52,991	| IOT055 |	Or they
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,319	| IOT055 |	After discovery
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,343	| IOT055 |	The tapster
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,647	| IOT055 |	Let's go onto things you discovered
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:06,303	| IOT055 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:08,351	| IOT055 |	Yes yes yes so
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:14,495	| IOT055 |	Avery Dennison now there's a name that I wouldn't normally equate with technology nothing against them just
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:22,175	| IOT055 |	Office supply typing labels you going to Staples Office Depot
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:27,551	| IOT055 |	Will do really is for everything out because Avery Dennison and everything
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:28,575	| IOT055 |	Are going to put
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:33,695	| IOT055 |	10 billion pieces of apparel into the world of iot with
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:35,231	| IOT055 |	Smartlabel Spacek
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:38,559	| IOT055 |	This is kind of interesting and not something I saw it coming at all
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:45,727	| IOT055 |	No I thought if we were going to get smart clothing it was going to be through like weird Fabrics like project Jacquard or there was a new antenna
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,751	| IOT055 |	It was announced earlier this week
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:50,079	| IOT055 |	It's obviously research that could also like
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:51,359	| IOT055 |	Communicate
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:51,871	| IOT055 |	Wirelessly
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,943	| IOT055 |	This is it this is now
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:56,479	| IOT055 |	And
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:59,807	| IOT055 |	And I should also mention that everything is
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,087	| IOT055 |	It's a you prefer minute
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,879	| IOT055 |	Everything within
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:03,903	| IOT055 |	But no other house
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:07,487	| IOT055 |	Starts with an E and Annabelle
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:09,279	| IOT055 |	So
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:12,607	| IOT055 |	It's it's primarily I think it
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:14,911	| IOT055 |	Right now it's primarily about
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:15,679	| IOT055 |	Authenticity
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,703	| IOT055 |	Counterfeiting
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:19,775	| IOT055 |	Yeah and I seen labels attached
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:26,175	| IOT055 |	Certain things I got bought by Liverpool Jersey or anyone Arizona Cardinals Jersey and it comes a little
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:28,223	| IOT055 |	Navigation hologram with a number
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:32,319	| IOT055 |	If you want to check on SimCity you can go online and punch the number and all that
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:34,623	| IOT055 |	Gets rid of all of the number punching and then so on
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:37,695	| IOT055 |	Yes and you know there's actually
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,463	| IOT055 |	Another company
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:41,023	| IOT055 |	That is working with them
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:45,375	| IOT055 |	Jack Daniels and other liquor manufacturers to prevent like counterfeit
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,935	| IOT055 |	So they're actually putting labels
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,727	| IOT055 |	Alcohol bottles of alcohol
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:51,263	| IOT055 |	To prevent
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:53,823	| IOT055 |	So that's a similar thing
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:56,383	| IOT055 |	So
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:04,063	| IOT055 |	Sears hardware
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:06,367	| IOT055 |	Please read the label and they're hoping to
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,647	| IOT055 |	For third-party applications
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:12,255	| IOT055 |	Reorder something
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,303	| IOT055 |	Favorite white shirt with
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,607	| IOT055 |	Smart label get stained
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:19,423	| IOT055 |	Checking inventory we got one
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:26,335	| IOT055 |	I think it is kind of cold because it's again not from a
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:29,151	| IOT055 |	Company that I would traditionally have even thought about
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:29,919	| IOT055 |	Getting to the space
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,223	| IOT055 |	It's not actually that
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:34,783	| IOT055 |	Crazy they didn't have to invest in like crazy
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,063	| IOT055 |	Stop they're doing it
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:39,391	| IOT055 |	Do it with inventory tracking now
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:44,767	| IOT055 |	From the manufacturing standpoint but now it's coming out to the consumers
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:51,423	| IOT055 |	This is kind of fun I don't know how worried if we're going to just see it like as a counterfeit prevention method or if it's
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:54,751	| IOT055 |	Which actually is a
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:56,031	| IOT055 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:03,455	| IOT055 |	I mean for me at you know there's only five Arizona Cardinals fans on the East Coast so we like it
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:07,807	| IOT055 |	Somebody has their Jersey on and I my jersey on maybe there's an applicant
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,575	| IOT055 |	Tell me the
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:10,367	| IOT055 |	The right around the corner go have a beer with him
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:11,647	| IOT055 |	Weight when they just like
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:13,695	| IOT055 |	On the same day the Cardinals were
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:14,207	| IOT055 |	Airplane window
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:17,279	| IOT055 |	I don't just wear it then
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:20,607	| IOT055 |	I'm a fan
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,375	| IOT055 |	All right
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:26,751	| IOT055 |	Cardinals fans
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:27,519	| IOT055 |	Who's out there
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,287	| IOT055 |	Give me a shout out
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,383	| IOT055 |	And if you do
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:36,991	| IOT055 |	I got you a but if you do I will show you the little device I have in my hand right now
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:40,319	| IOT055 |	Please tell me a joke
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:41,343	| IOT055 |	Child friendly
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:44,927	| IOT055 |	I mean you can like
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,975	| IOT055 |	I suppose
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:47,999	| IOT055 |	Okay yeah
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:54,399	| IOT055 |	I know is child friendly and if it's one of their kickstarter's that I back that actually came through cuz it's so awesome
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,167	| IOT055 |	Nothing against
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:02,591	| IOT055 |	This is the pine64 missile attack a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:08,735	| IOT055 |	Is $15 the base price is $15 with a small board
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:09,503	| IOT055 |	Thumbs up
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:12,319	| IOT055 |	Quad core arm processor
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:13,855	| IOT055 |	Half a gram
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:17,184	| IOT055 |	Ethernet port HDMI couple USB ports whatnot
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:18,208	| IOT055 |	I actually
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:19,744	| IOT055 |	Moved up to the
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:21,792	| IOT055 |	Highest paid model which was only $29
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,072	| IOT055 |	That got me
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:24,608	| IOT055 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:27,168	| IOT055 |	What's your secret for 29 bucks
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:29,472	| IOT055 |	Mehandi all aboard with
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:34,080	| IOT055 |	The same chipset in all that
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:36,128	| IOT055 |	All of these have 4K video output with
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:38,176	| IOT055 |	Pretty impressive switch low power
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:39,456	| IOT055 |	Obviously
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,224	| IOT055 |	More line with
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:42,016	| IOT055 |	Computing projects
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:44,320	| IOT055 |	Like the Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:47,904	| IOT055 |	And less so with say chayote in Arduino
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:52,512	| IOT055 |	You could I'm still thinking about that once I get the
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:55,072	| IOT055 |	Linux install a nest
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:57,376	| IOT055 |	Of using the openhab apis and
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:59,168	| IOT055 |	Playing around with openhab
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:03,520	| IOT055 |	Interface for Smart Homes to see what I can do and just run everything off this little guy here
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:06,848	| IOT055 |	Remind me
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:08,384	| IOT055 |	We should have talked about
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:11,200	| IOT055 |	Until recently started shipping
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:14,528	| IOT055 |	That is a $15 board
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:15,808	| IOT055 |	Futures oh my gosh are you ready
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:17,344	| IOT055 |	The quark
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,136	| IOT055 |	32
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:25,024	| IOT055 |	Yeah I think it looks just like a little bored I have on my closet shelf height are they came to
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,328	| IOT055 |	Get around to it yet
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,376	| IOT055 |	You got one of these
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,912	| IOT055 |	I did I got the little devil
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,448	| IOT055 |	Just a little bit kid
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:34,752	| IOT055 |	This is like super behind the times
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:36,032	| IOT055 |	Because like I can buy
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:40,128	| IOT055 |	I think it's actually a $25 Raspberry Pi that has a 64-bit capable
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:45,504	| IOT055 |	It's like 1.2 gigahertz I think
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:46,016	| IOT055 |	This isn't a computer
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:49,600	| IOT055 |	This is what this is
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:52,928	| IOT055 |	Yeah this is bridging physical and digital
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:55,232	| IOT055 |	And I have Arduino set somewhere
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:59,328	| IOT055 |	And then I got this and unfortunately I just been busy and haven't taken out of the box yet but
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,376	| IOT055 |	Maybe in a week
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:03,936	| IOT055 |	I was excited
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:05,984	| IOT055 |	I'm looking for
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,032	| IOT055 |	Quark
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:09,312	| IOT055 |	Containing
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:09,824	| IOT055 |	Siri which is the
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:12,384	| IOT055 |	Sprint
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:14,944	| IOT055 |	As a friend
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:18,272	| IOT055 |	I don't have the other until board in my hand but
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:21,088	| IOT055 |	It's a frame of reference that Intel board is about
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:23,136	| IOT055 |	Third the size of this
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:30,048	| IOT055 |	Computer boards I have in my hand right now and this is pretty Smogon I think most people probably of an idea of how big a Raspberry Pi as this until
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:31,840	| IOT055 |	The board is less than half a size
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:32,352	| IOT055 |	Source Mall
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:33,888	| IOT055 |	Incidence
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:35,424	| IOT055 |	$15
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:37,728	| IOT055 |	If you don't you're feeling like you want to play with Intel's efforts
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,264	| IOT055 |	Just to see what it's
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,544	| IOT055 |	Got offer after Edison
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:41,568	| IOT055 |	This would be what
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,616	| IOT055 |	Okay let's
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:44,640	| IOT055 |	Talk really fast
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:46,432	| IOT055 |	Because there's a couple things that happened with Hue Lights
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,736	| IOT055 |	Fair is coming up next week
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,856	| IOT055 |	Light bulb
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,904	| IOT055 |	So we won't be complaining about lights
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:56,928	| IOT055 |	New radios hope
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,208	| IOT055 |	Hopefully CrossFit
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:23:59,744	| IOT055 |	But
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:03,072	| IOT055 |	What's happening is Philips Hue is actually they updated
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,608	| IOT055 |	Their app
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,888	| IOT055 |	And they did a couple things with it
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:07,168	| IOT055 |	1
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:07,936	| IOT055 |	They changed
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:08,448	| IOT055 |	Color
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,984	| IOT055 |	I will tell you why in a minute
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:12,800	| IOT055 |	2 they upgraded their security protocols
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:17,408	| IOT055 |	They basically did a token
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:19,456	| IOT055 |	Program with their third party
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,992	| IOT055 |	Partners partners
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:23,552	| IOT055 |	And most almost everybody
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:24,576	| IOT055 |	Has opted in
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:25,856	| IOT055 |	So
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:32,256	| IOT055 |	They've been working on this for a while so now what you got is basically a much more secure way for your Hue Lights to talk to any part
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,536	| IOT055 |	Cars that also use you like
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,584	| IOT055 |	Hue Disco
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:37,376	| IOT055 |	There's a real big popular one that
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:38,656	| IOT055 |	Next Syracuse to the
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:39,936	| IOT055 |	Apple
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:40,704	| IOT055 |	ITunes
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:41,984	| IOT055 |	Right now
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:45,056	| IOT055 |	So all of that
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:48,384	| IOT055 |	And the reason why it's happening is Hughes
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:50,432	| IOT055 |	About to launch a second-generation app
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:56,064	| IOT055 |	So that is why it changed the color this one now is going to be gray so your existing Hue app
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:59,136	| IOT055 |	And then your next gen Hue app
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,672	| IOT055 |	It's going to be
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,720	| IOT055 |	It's going to be
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:03,744	| IOT055 |	Knock knock
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,536	| IOT055 |	Not great
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:07,584	| IOT055 |	And you have either of those two
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:11,424	| IOT055 |	And I'm hoping this is coming soon and will find out more about it
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:13,984	| IOT055 |	But you know that's something to look forward to or
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:16,032	| IOT055 |	Deceiver I'm not sure
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,056	| IOT055 |	If you are a
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:17,568	| IOT055 |	Q
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:18,592	| IOT055 |	Aficionado
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:24,480	| IOT055 |	This is not the result of any attack exploit her insecurities it's just them being proactive right
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:25,504	| IOT055 |	Right I asked
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:29,600	| IOT055 |	Nope we're just
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:30,624	| IOT055 |	Just trying to get things
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,184	| IOT055 |	Good on that
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:34,976	| IOT055 |	So yeah it is good
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:36,768	| IOT055 |	Because the last thing you need is to have
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:38,560	| IOT055 |	Lions at these things out
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:42,144	| IOT055 |	The good news is that your kitchen
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:42,912	| IOT055 |	Secure
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:45,728	| IOT055 |	Yes yes my kitchen is the most secure
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,312	| IOT055 |	I shouldn't say if I will through the Brightside
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,944	| IOT055 |	All right
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:57,504	| IOT055 |	I think we should probably in the show

EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:29,152	| IOT055 |	I am really excited about all the programs
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:32,480	| IOT055 |	So you guys have time from the integration with the Amazon Echo 2
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:36,064	| IOT055 |	T-shirt leasing program in Austin
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:38,112	| IOT055 |	So
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:40,672	| IOT055 |	Let's talk about what do you do on a day-to-day basis
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:47,584	| IOT055 |	What's the leader for connected vehicles within the company I charged with overseeing
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:50,400	| IOT055 |	All aspects of that within our business
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:52,448	| IOT055 |	And so that involves
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,216	| IOT055 |	The
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:54,496	| IOT055 |	Consumer and understanding
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:58,592	| IOT055 |	You know where they looking for what kind of experiences can we deliver
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:04,992	| IOT055 |	I'm a vehicle side what kind of Hardware is necessary inside the vehicle to make sure that that takes plays Harley designs
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:06,016	| IOT055 |	Software
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:07,808	| IOT055 |	Communication systems
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:08,832	| IOT055 |	To take advantage of that
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:12,416	| IOT055 |	Then working with network providers in terms of
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:18,560	| IOT055 |	The data transport mechanisms for the cellular or Wi-Fi and then
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:21,632	| IOT055 |	Integrating app with our backyard it system
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:24,448	| IOT055 |	To both deliver services as well as
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:27,264	| IOT055 |	To receive data from Vehicles as well
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:28,288	| IOT055 |	Facilitating
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:29,824	| IOT055 |	Remote control vehicle
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,920	| IOT055 |	It keeps me busy throughout my day

EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:38,016	| IOT055 |	What's
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:39,296	| IOT055 |	Idea that
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:39,808	| IOT055 |	Ford
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:41,856	| IOT055 |	Has really kind of changed
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:44,928	| IOT055 |	Maybe for years
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:49,024	| IOT055 |	You guys have really moving from
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:50,816	| IOT055 |	You know thinking about
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:53,376	| IOT055 |	You know attaching a phone or something
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:55,680	| IOT055 |	It's not working with my phone in the car
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:57,472	| IOT055 |	Telematics
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:29:00,032	| IOT055 |	To this concept of Transportation as a service
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:04,640	| IOT055 |	How is your thinking evolved when did you guys
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,688	| IOT055 |	Yeah I die Che
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:11,296	| IOT055 |	If you had to 10 point in origin it might go back to
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:13,088	| IOT055 |	Want to talk
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:15,648	| IOT055 |	That built Ford gain at Mobile World Congress
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,416	| IOT055 |	2 years back
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:18,976	| IOT055 |	In Barcelona where he
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:20,768	| IOT055 |	Really in a sentence
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:21,536	| IOT055 |	Took
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:23,328	| IOT055 |	His great-grandfather's vision of
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:28,192	| IOT055 |	I'm open highways For All Mankind and so to the Model T was the
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:33,056	| IOT055 |	Single-point solution for that affordable transportation that was available and accessible to
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:35,104	| IOT055 |	You to everyone
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:42,016	| IOT055 |	And just kind of thinking and projecting forward and looking at some of the trends that are happening in terms of globalization and terms
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:45,344	| IOT055 |	Job organization along with that globalization in a few
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:46,880	| IOT055 |	Project forward hour
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:47,648	| IOT055 |	Kakarot
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:50,976	| IOT055 |	Vehicles are operating in a week There's roughly a billion vehicles
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:54,048	| IOT055 |	Better on the global roads today and he Protec forward
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:57,120	| IOT055 |	Even the growth rates of where we are and would be
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:30:03,264	| IOT055 |	You another billion Vehicles added by 2030 and they're just just isn't the infrastructure for that
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:05,568	| IOT055 |	We're also looking at
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:08,128	| IOT055 |	Changing Dynamics in terms of consumer
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:15,808	| IOT055 |	Looks at Albertson's coming together and thinking about our own business and the fact
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:16,576	| IOT055 |	We
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:20,928	| IOT055 |	Defense counsel the hardware and we're beginning to shift from
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:26,560	| IOT055 |	Kind of just that Hardware Focus to thinking about not just the vehicle of a single-point solution not Jeff
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:31,680	| IOT055 |	You know the only way that you can benefit from afford is to owner or lease it but
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:32,960	| IOT055 |	Really doing
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:34,240	| IOT055 |	The business ads
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:36,544	| IOT055 |	Not just providing Mobility
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:38,080	| IOT055 |	From that perspective
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,384	| IOT055 |	Let's talk about the hardware size
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:42,688	| IOT055 |	Because this is
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:45,248	| IOT055 |	Ford 500
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:46,272	| IOT055 |	49
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:48,832	| IOT055 |	Point five billion dollars
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,368	| IOT055 |	Right
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,392	| IOT055 |	Right
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:51,904	| IOT055 |	That is
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:55,744	| IOT055 |	It's a lot of
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:31:00,864	| IOT055 |	Switching from that kind of hardware
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:01,888	| IOT055 |	Investment
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:04,960	| IOT055 |	Because they're fat
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:07,520	| IOT055 |	At least in the near-term going to stop making cars
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:12,640	| IOT055 |	Very excited
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:15,200	| IOT055 |	How do you switch
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:18,528	| IOT055 |	From making Hardware in all the investment
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:21,856	| IOT055 |	This other
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:22,624	| IOT055 |	Investment in
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,672	| IOT055 |	Software and services
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,464	| IOT055 |	It's still managed to
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:28,000	| IOT055 |	You don't make your investors happy
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:31,584	| IOT055 |	Absolutely we need to make our investors happy in that
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:35,168	| IOT055 |	Yellow hundred forty-nine billion dollars of Revenue
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:38,240	| IOT055 |	It's certainly very important to us in end as
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:39,008	| IOT055 |	We
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:42,592	| IOT055 |	I'll look at these emerging businesses one thing that
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:46,176	| IOT055 |	That Mark has been very clear to us about Mark Barfield or CEO
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:47,968	| IOT055 |	Is that we cannot
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:48,736	| IOT055 |	Forget
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:50,528	| IOT055 |	Aqua business
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:53,344	| IOT055 |	That we see in this inflection point that were talking about
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:56,160	| IOT055 |	It will play itself out over time
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:59,232	| IOT055 |	It's so it's not as if two years from now
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:02,304	| IOT055 |	You know there aren't going to be any Automotive Sales
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:04,608	| IOT055 |	Did the projections that will continue to have
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:06,656	| IOT055 |	You're fairly consistent
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:08,192	| IOT055 |	5 to 6%
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:12,288	| IOT055 |	Grills and we go forward but none the less we do recognize that
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:13,824	| IOT055 |	Go forward
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:16,128	| IOT055 |	The landscape in that Matrix
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:19,200	| IOT055 |	Revenue and earnings opportunities
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:20,480	| IOT055 |	It will need to shift
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:23,040	| IOT055 |	One perspective that we have is if you look at the
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:24,832	| IOT055 |	China decor
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:27,136	| IOT055 |	How would you say the hardware
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:29,440	| IOT055 |	Automotive
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:30,976	| IOT055 |	2.3
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:34,048	| IOT055 |	A trillion dollars of a combined Global Revenue
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:35,840	| IOT055 |	And our share of that is roughly about 6
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:37,376	| IOT055 |	Sr global
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:43,520	| IOT055 |	Market share what we call transportation services
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:46,080	| IOT055 |	Any way of getting around short of
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:46,592	| IOT055 |	Jet travel
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:48,640	| IOT055 |	You know that's another
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:49,408	| IOT055 |	Five Point
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:50,176	| IOT055 |	4
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:51,200	| IOT055 |	Australian dollars
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,224	| IOT055 |	Of Revenue
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:54,528	| IOT055 |	In our share of that is 0
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:56,576	| IOT055 |	And so if you think about it
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:57,600	| IOT055 |	Dis
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:33:02,976	| IOT055 |	Core Business that we have continuing to be great at that continue 8 to deliver
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:06,816	| IOT055 |	Cheaper products that people love their funded dry great to look at
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:12,448	| IOT055 |	But also looking at the transportation services Landscaping understanding what role
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:14,496	| IOT055 |	You know could we possibly play there
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:18,592	| IOT055 |	Okay in a lot of companies are trying to do this right now so
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,360	| IOT055 |	You
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:20,640	| IOT055 |	Luckily Are Not Alone
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:24,992	| IOT055 |	How do you align your company and how do you think about
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:27,040	| IOT055 |	Management structures
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:27,552	| IOT055 |	Settings
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:31,136	| IOT055 |	Investing in these new areas Casino
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:34,208	| IOT055 |	Ford is a huge company but it doesn't have infinite resources
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:41,120	| IOT055 |	Yeah and it is a challenging and I don't want to minimize it by saying yeah we'll just grab Tommy's emerging opportunity
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:46,496	| IOT055 |	Put up what we call Ford smart Mobility as an umbrella
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:50,080	| IOT055 |	Or each of those activities but then we got a step further and said
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:51,360	| IOT055 |	Because
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:55,200	| IOT055 |	Some of these things are going to be so different
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:56,480	| IOT055 |	Then the core business
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:57,248	| IOT055 |	Right
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:58,784	| IOT055 |	Those processes
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:01,600	| IOT055 |	That I talked about earlier in terms of what it takes
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:08,000	| IOT055 |	To each your 30000 equal parts come together in a well-integrated high-quality way with a
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,280	| IOT055 |	Absolute safety
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:12,864	| IOT055 |	In with absolute Integrity right those processes
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:15,680	| IOT055 |	Don't necessarily s***
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:20,800	| IOT055 |	Me and some of these new emerging spaces because you do need to move a much more frequent
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:22,848	| IOT055 |	Or much more rapid Pace because
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:24,896	| IOT055 |	The ability to
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:27,712	| IOT055 |	Experiment in to learn into engine case
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:29,504	| IOT055 |	Alright it's okay
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:35,904	| IOT055 |	It's not okay to feel when you are putting an airbag inside a vehicle and you got to make sure that it operates right it's not
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:38,464	| IOT055 |	Okay to feel they're right until you got to have a rigorous process
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:42,048	| IOT055 |	It is okay to stay all potentially even in in the experiment
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:46,144	| IOT055 |	Instrument in Austin in learning about shared Leasing and learning about how do you
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:47,936	| IOT055 |	You know how do you slice up
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:54,336	| IOT055 |	I'll at least amongst different people how do you allocate who gets to use the vehicle how do you make sure that that process works
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:55,360	| IOT055 |	Right Where I Need to learn
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:57,920	| IOT055 |	Until what we decided to do is set up
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:35:00,224	| IOT055 |	Separate limited liability Corporation
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:02,016	| IOT055 |	I called Ford smart Mobility
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:05,600	| IOT055 |	Jim Hackett has been named as the chairman of that entity
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:09,952	| IOT055 |	He going to be putting together his own team beginning with the CEO and then others
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:15,584	| IOT055 |	Come inside our core business today that will move over underneath into that entity in lb
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:22,496	| IOT055 |	Actually probably a lot more that will come in from the outside and bringing in new ideas bringing in new ways of thinking
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:28,896	| IOT055 |	And the way that that organization moves and the way that it will be constructed will be much more nimble
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:32,480	| IOT055 |	How much more oriented toward Innovation experimentation
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:35,040	| IOT055 |	Learning moving quickly
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:39,648	| IOT055 |	And it's obviously going to have some investment associated with it and we kind of gone through
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:44,512	| IOT055 |	No one exercise to understand what's going to be critically important for us as we go forward in our business
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:50,144	| IOT055 |	Fortunately in terms of some of the things that we've been able to do in terms of cost control and efficiency
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:51,424	| IOT055 |	And being very
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:53,216	| IOT055 |	Intentional without corn dust
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:54,496	| IOT055 |	I'm looking at things
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:56,032	| IOT055 |	On a global basis
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:36:01,664	| IOT055 |	And you know reducing redundancies and driving those things that help us to be Capital efficient
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:03,200	| IOT055 |	You know we're able to allocate
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:07,552	| IOT055 |	Your money to this new element to be the emerging opportunities in, set up
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:09,344	| IOT055 |	Separate entity
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:12,672	| IOT055 |	Separate but still connected to the core business because
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:15,488	| IOT055 |	We want to benefit from the learning that happen there and their
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:18,304	| IOT055 |	Maybe something that happened in that emerging business.
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:24,704	| IOT055 |	Ultimately become part of our Core Business there may be something that happened in a merging business
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:25,472	| IOT055 |	She's as well but
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:27,520	| IOT055 |	But related
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:30,336	| IOT055 |	And want to set it up in a way that
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:31,360	| IOT055 |	We can
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,384	| IOT055 |	Forbidden city
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:34,432	| IOT055 |	From let's just say the
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:38,784	| IOT055 |	Stability of the mothership without being encumbered by the gravity of the Mothership
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:41,344	| IOT055 |	So on this
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:45,952	| IOT055 |	Spin out this new company for your Innovation what do you need
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:48,768	| IOT055 |	What kind of Technologies are you guys looking
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:49,280	| IOT055 |	4
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:53,888	| IOT055 |	So, technology standpoint in terms of the things that we think we need
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:54,912	| IOT055 |	CertainTeed
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:57,216	| IOT055 |	Continuity and all the aspects related
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:58,752	| IOT055 |	The conductivity in
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:37:00,032	| IOT055 |	Wireless communication
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:03,872	| IOT055 |	But you know the latest versions of Bluetooth and looking at
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:10,784	| IOT055 |	Things like dedicated short-range communication so now 5.9 gigahertz and
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:12,576	| IOT055 |	Things like vehicle-to-vehicle communication
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:19,232	| IOT055 |	Increase computer capability on board vehicle so more powerful microprocessors definitely
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:24,352	| IOT055 |	In terms of broad categorization and some of the things are happening in the tectonic technology front voice
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:26,400	| IOT055 |	Invoice based interaction
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:28,960	| IOT055 |	Increasingly important for us as you can imagine
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:30,240	| IOT055 |	When in a vehicle first
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:34,336	| IOT055 |	Safe and secure as your operating the vehicle
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:38,688	| IOT055 |	Continue to operate the vehicle today and then till we get to the day of fully autonomous but
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:43,040	| IOT055 |	Voice enables you didn't you know control and interact in a way that keeps your
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:45,856	| IOT055 |	Your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel and then
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:52,256	| IOT055 |	In addition to those technologies that are doing things that make sense
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:57,376	| IOT055 |	Coming out on the standpoint things like lidar and sensors cameras in
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:38:00,448	| IOT055 |	Being able to characterize on Burnet and react to it
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:03,776	| IOT055 |	You know you're in an appropriate way
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:10,688	| IOT055 |	All right and let's talk about some of the things you've already implemented so for example you guys did this integration
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:11,456	| IOT055 |	With the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:14,784	| IOT055 |	We named her on the show
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:18,368	| IOT055 |	We don't want to set up your Echo
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:19,392	| IOT055 |	You guys have done this
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:20,672	| IOT055 |	This was
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:24,000	| IOT055 |	Rate this was at CES everyone was excited
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,560	| IOT055 |	Can you talk about
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:31,936	| IOT055 |	How you think
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,216	| IOT055 |	Best way to do that
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:38,080	| IOT055 |	Sure it's so what we demonstrated at CES
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:42,432	| IOT055 |	When Amazon was around the Echo and
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:45,504	| IOT055 |	We out to actually be launching
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:46,272	| IOT055 |	Service
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:49,088	| IOT055 |	Where Amazon Echo later this year
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:52,672	| IOT055 |	In the whole idea is to just understand
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:54,720	| IOT055 |	How are people interacting with
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:57,024	| IOT055 |	The world around them in with their home
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:59,072	| IOT055 |	Book a music and with their services
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:02,400	| IOT055 |	Attracted up
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:04,192	| IOT055 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:06,496	| IOT055 |	What's the network that was being built up
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:09,056	| IOT055 |	Around Echo & the difference
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:10,592	| IOT055 |	Skills at work
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:14,688	| IOT055 |	That we would have access to just by connecting with Amazon in this network
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:17,504	| IOT055 |	Is a way for us to a build
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:19,808	| IOT055 |	Accessibility inside the vehicle
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:24,672	| IOT055 |	Without necessarily needing to Plum each of those individual kind of lines right itself
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:30,816	| IOT055 |	Certainly will do some things with Wayne can and will do things with others but if there's already
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:33,632	| IOT055 |	Then why not take advantage of that
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:37,984	| IOT055 |	So let's let's have some fun here let's talk about the future of the
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:39,008	| IOT055 |	The car because
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:39,520	| IOT055 |	I drive it
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:41,824	| IOT055 |	It is
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:43,616	| IOT055 |	Superfund because it
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:45,152	| IOT055 |	It's constantly changing
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:50,784	| IOT055 |	A huge learning curve for me because it is constantly changing
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:55,136	| IOT055 |	For some reason the temperature
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:56,672	| IOT055 |	Temperature moves around
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:58,208	| IOT055 |	Display
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:39:59,744	| IOT055 |	Now it's over here
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:04,096	| IOT055 |	I don't mind that but it is a little
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:06,912	| IOT055 |	It's a weird to get used to having a car that
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:13,056	| IOT055 |	That that like the car of the future
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:16,896	| IOT055 |	I should I should probably mention that
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:17,664	| IOT055 |	First
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:19,968	| IOT055 |	No I get it I get it
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:20,480	| IOT055 |	Fisher
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:24,576	| IOT055 |	Very futuristic today but I do
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:26,112	| IOT055 |	In a self-driving
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:27,904	| IOT055 |	Cars a lot of the automatic braking
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:28,928	| IOT055 |	Technology
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:32,256	| IOT055 |	You're going to feel really commonplace
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:33,536	| IOT055 |	Artuso
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:34,560	| IOT055 |	Where do you think
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:36,096	| IOT055 |	The future of the car is
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:37,376	| IOT055 |	Is it
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:41,728	| IOT055 |	You know right now I've got two in my garage I really love to only have one
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:46,592	| IOT055 |	You know I can't imagine giving up a dedicated car but I'm oldest so
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:50,688	| IOT055 |	I don't know
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,456	| IOT055 |	Where does where does
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:58,624	| IOT055 |	I think there are a number of different scenarios that that will play out and I think it will depend on
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:00,672	| IOT055 |	You know what your lifestyle is
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:01,952	| IOT055 |	And then where you live
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:03,488	| IOT055 |	So I can proceed
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:05,792	| IOT055 |	In urban environments for instance
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:08,864	| IOT055 |	And you know highly congested situations that
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:13,216	| IOT055 |	Or number of different reasons it it will make sense for people
EDL	00:41:13,216	00:41:16,288	| IOT055 |	Did not necessarily own a vehicle right they will
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:19,104	| IOT055 |	Potentially the biggest
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:20,640	| IOT055 |	Consumers of
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:22,176	| IOT055 |	Transportation as a service
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:23,456	| IOT055 |	Ansell
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:24,736	| IOT055 |	One of the things that
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:28,832	| IOT055 |	That we're working on within that within that context is how do we
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:31,136	| IOT055 |	Continue to deliver a Ford
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:31,904	| IOT055 |	Experience
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:38,304	| IOT055 |	When someone doesn't necessarily own a Ford vehicle when they may be a user or a passenger within a Ford V-8
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:41,376	| IOT055 |	And that's one of the reasons that we introduce fortaz
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:42,144	| IOT055 |	Which
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:43,936	| IOT055 |	Onyx face looks like just
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:47,008	| IOT055 |	Another mobile app but it's really a platform for us
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:50,592	| IOT055 |	To deliver Mobility Services and so whether that's
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:56,735	| IOT055 |	Using sync connect them in remotely connecting with a vehicle that you happen to all and and or
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:42:02,367	| IOT055 |	You know you're traveling but we got your profile information and so we understand what your commute is and we can
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:04,927	| IOT055 |	I'll help you with the best way to get
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:09,023	| IOT055 |	To you know for instance you are at your office on that day and so whether it's
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:11,583	| IOT055 |	You know taking a train and then a box
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:16,191	| IOT055 |	And they're doing a shared ride or today hey the shared-ride would be the best route for you
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:21,823	| IOT055 |	If you are you know that you're someone that lives in Suburbia and you got a family then
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:27,455	| IOT055 |	At least for the next few years I imagine it will be somewhat difficult to
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:32,575	| IOT055 |	Think about swapping car seats in and out of a number of different Vehicles riding so I think through it
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:36,927	| IOT055 |	The traditional ownership or leasing model wolf will still be prevalent there
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:39,743	| IOT055 |	In all of those situations what you'll have it in
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:46,655	| IOT055 |	Vehicles that will absolutely improve and get better over time I think there's actually a lot that we can learn from Tesla and turn to look
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:47,423	| IOT055 |	They're doing
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:48,959	| IOT055 |	Auburn soccer updates
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:52,287	| IOT055 |	In our case you know we want those updates to be at seamless
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:54,591	| IOT055 |	If possible and Adnan
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:57,151	| IOT055 |	Life interrupting that possible
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:58,687	| IOT055 |	And we had Josh
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:00,735	| IOT055 |	Gorman from the cavalry
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:04,319	| IOT055 |	On the show
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:06,367	| IOT055 |	It was 2014
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:09,183	| IOT055 |	It was all about
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:09,951	| IOT055 |	Protecting
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:11,999	| IOT055 |	Car is kind of a digital asset
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:15,071	| IOT055 |	And iiii will be curious
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:17,887	| IOT055 |	Has Ford
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:21,983	| IOT055 |	Are you guys looking at that and say hey we're going to take this
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:23,519	| IOT055 |	We've had a focus on
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:25,823	| IOT055 |	Security for quite some time
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:27,359	| IOT055 |	It's not something that will just
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:30,943	| IOT055 |	Waking up to you at this moment even even going back
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:37,343	| IOT055 |	To you know the early days of up to you at Century right we had rolling codes to protect Security even with
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:41,183	| IOT055 |	In 2007 write a firewall between
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:44,511	| IOT055 |	War of the information and
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:48,095	| IOT055 |	Entertainment area of a vehicle in the communication Boston
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:48,863	| IOT055 |	Separated
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:50,655	| IOT055 |	Typical firewall from the
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:52,191	| IOT055 |	More important
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:55,775	| IOT055 |	Vehicle control sidelight powertrain like the chassis
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:56,543	| IOT055 |	Control
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:44:00,639	| IOT055 |	And even as we move into this environment we're certainly
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:01,407	| IOT055 |	Surface
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:07,295	| IOT055 |	Is it worth growing in terms of increasing Connections in the vehicle both within the vehicle wirelessly and
EDL	00:44:07,295	00:44:09,855	| IOT055 |	Outside the vehicle on a cellular basis
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:16,511	| IOT055 |	We are very very conscious of putting mechanisms in place to protect the vehicle as a digital asset
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:20,607	| IOT055 |	The data as a as an asset that must be
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:21,631	| IOT055 |	Secured as well
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:24,703	| IOT055 |	And we are constantly evolving
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:29,055	| IOT055 |	And improving our systems were constantly looking at ways of with lyrics
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:31,103	| IOT055 |	Code signing encryption to
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:34,175	| IOT055 |	Firewall to understanding you know the various
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:37,503	| IOT055 |	Attacks that have been promulgated on others and
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:43,903	| IOT055 |	Not just saying Old Tube after that but looking at it and understanding exactly what happened and then going back and looking at our own system
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:46,975	| IOT055 |	I was just something that we would have been vulnerable to
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:51,071	| IOT055 |	Is there something that would be similar to this that would have presented a vulnerability to us
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:54,143	| IOT055 |	Bright plus after they hacked
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:59,007	| IOT055 |	Why are you were you were all over that
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:45:02,079	| IOT055 |	To understand exactly what they did and how they did it
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:02,591	| IOT055 |	And
EDL	00:45:03,103	00:45:04,383	| IOT055 |	Yeah we weren't again
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:07,199	| IOT055 |	Acceptable to that particular attack but
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:13,599	| IOT055 |	All they did cause us to look at some things that were doing and in the way that we'd engineered some of our Solutions and just
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:19,743	| IOT055 |	Add that extra bit of rigor in terms of of controls and end up some things that we could look at to say
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:22,815	| IOT055 |	And what vulnerable to this one but you know what
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:26,399	| IOT055 |	Here's something that we could look at it something that we could change
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:28,191	| IOT055 |	Security by obscurity for you guys
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:29,983	| IOT055 |	With your your billion cars on the road
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:33,055	| IOT055 |	Price of success
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:33,823	| IOT055 |	Okay yeah
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:34,591	| IOT055 |	True
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:38,175	| IOT055 |	So as connected era and you guys are
EDL	00:45:41,759	00:45:43,295	| IOT055 |	What is Fords
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:49,183	| IOT055 |	Adidas Advantage how does that shift from Manufacturing
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:51,487	| IOT055 |	2
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:53,279	| IOT055 |	How do you say
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:56,095	| IOT055 |	Biggest
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:45:57,375	| IOT055 |	Actually is our brand
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:58,399	| IOT055 |	And it's the truck
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:01,471	| IOT055 |	That we have with the Ford brand and
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:02,751	| IOT055 |	With
EDL	00:46:02,751	00:46:03,519	| IOT055 |	The
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:06,591	| IOT055 |	Relationship actually that consumers have formal enough
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:08,895	| IOT055 |	Going back more than a hundred years
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:11,967	| IOT055 |	The Challenge and the opportunity that we have is to
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:12,735	| IOT055 |	Turn those
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:19,135	| IOT055 |	Sort of infrequent get kind of explicit references in Gulfport at the time that
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:21,183	| IOT055 |	Potentially I buy my vehicle or
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:23,743	| IOT055 |	Time that I service my vehicle for instance 2
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:26,047	| IOT055 |	A couple different bats number one
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:32,191	| IOT055 |	The more than $900 a year that people spend inside their vehicle and the opportunity that we have to
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:36,287	| IOT055 |	Improve that experience to make it a more delightful experience in also
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:41,919	| IOT055 |	To learn and gather data from those experiences again with the informed consent of our customers
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:48,831	| IOT055 |	To help us not only prove the vehicle but again improve the things that they do in the vehicle right helping you interact with your home
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:49,599	| IOT055 |	Voltmeter Amazon
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:52,671	| IOT055 |	As well looking at
EDL	00:46:52,671	00:46:53,951	| IOT055 |	How can we
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:55,487	| IOT055 |	Become part of
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:58,303	| IOT055 |	A person's life if they don't necessarily own afford
EDL	00:46:59,327	00:47:05,727	| IOT055 |	Look for cash as a Mobility application understanding how we can facilitate Transportation even if you don't
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:07,007	| IOT055 |	Because we think
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:07,775	| IOT055 |	Again
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:12,639	| IOT055 |	That is actually our brand it's the truck that we have in our brand and that's what we've been able to deliver
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:16,223	| IOT055 |	And really kind of you relate to Consumers on that basis
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:17,503	| IOT055 |	Awesome
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:22,623	| IOT055 |	So much for coming on the show today I have learned a lot
EDL	00:47:22,623	00:47:24,415	| IOT055 |	Stacy it's been terrific to be with you
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:27,231	| IOT055 |	That's it for this week's show
EDL	00:47:27,231	00:47:29,535	| IOT055 |	Thanks for listening and we hope to see you next week
EDL	00:47:29,535	00:47:30,559	| IOT055 |	In the meantime
