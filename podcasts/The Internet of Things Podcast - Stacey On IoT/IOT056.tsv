EDL	00:00:08,704	00:00:09,984	| IOT056 |	Hey everyone welcome back
EDL	00:00:09,984	00:00:13,056	| IOT056 |	To The Internet of Things podcast Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:13,056	00:00:14,080	| IOT056 |	And this is my co-host
EDL	00:00:14,592	00:00:16,384	| IOT056 |	Kevin tofel we have
EDL	00:00:18,944	00:00:19,456	| IOT056 |	Care about light
EDL	00:00:23,552	00:00:24,832	| IOT056 |	Everyone cares about lighting
EDL	00:00:24,832	00:00:25,344	| IOT056 |	Without it
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:29,696	| IOT056 |	Alright so we're going to get started with
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:31,488	| IOT056 |	Smart home stuff for you because
EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:34,560	| IOT056 |	A big part of what whatever
EDL	00:00:34,560	00:00:36,352	| IOT056 |	There are
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:37,376	| IOT056 |	Three things happening
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:41,728	| IOT056 |	One is Phillips has updated its app we warned you in advance
EDL	00:00:41,728	00:00:43,264	| IOT056 |	This is going to happen
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:45,312	| IOT056 |	You don't have to use the new Philips Hue
EDL	00:00:45,312	00:00:46,080	| IOT056 |	New apps
EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:46,848	| IOT056 |	But if you want
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:51,456	| IOT056 |	What this Windows is basically turns the Philips Hue app into
EDL	00:00:51,968	00:00:58,368	| IOT056 |	I don't know an app that was good like 2 years ago it gives you all the functionality that you kind of expected the original Philips Hue
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:00:59,136	| IOT056 |	Got to have
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:03,232	| IOT056 |	So it's things like being able to divide your lights up in two rooms and control them
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:07,072	| IOT056 |	So it's very nice it's very
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:12,448	| IOT056 |	It's very fast on my Android phone so I am enjoying that I've got a test version of it so
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:13,728	| IOT056 |	I'm not sure if
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:14,240	| IOT056 |	The actual version
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:18,080	| IOT056 |	We spoke last week about the six
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:20,640	| IOT056 |	Security updates in the Philips app
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:22,688	| IOT056 |	Which kind was the precursor to
EDL	00:01:22,688	00:01:23,200	| IOT056 |	The new app
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:24,480	| IOT056 |	And even
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:30,880	| IOT056 |	Prior to that we talked about some permissions challenges on the Android side for the Philips Hue at those are already fixed as well so those are non
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:31,904	| IOT056 |	Known issues for this new app
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:35,744	| IOT056 |	Right in the security issues was basically
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:37,792	| IOT056 |	Third-party apps
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:38,304	| IOT056 |	Authenticate
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:39,584	| IOT056 |	Right so
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:41,632	| IOT056 |	Many of the third-party apps
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:42,912	| IOT056 |	That she was worked with
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:43,936	| IOT056 |	Most of our favorites
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:44,960	| IOT056 |	Have already done this
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:45,984	| IOT056 |	Proceso nothing
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:50,848	| IOT056 |	Should be back in changes nothing to see here
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:51,616	| IOT056 |	There are
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:53,152	| IOT056 |	Few apps that did not work
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:55,456	| IOT056 |	Phillips on this that will not have
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,736	| IOT056 |	Security token
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:58,272	| IOT056 |	It's like four of them
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,808	| IOT056 |	And two of them I've never even heard
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:02,112	| IOT056 |	So you can find all that until
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:05,440	| IOT056 |	But with the new app in the new features
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:06,720	| IOT056 |	So you can
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,512	| IOT056 |	Like I said there's there's rooms
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,280	| IOT056 |	So
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,048	| IOT056 |	Yay
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:15,424	| IOT056 |	There's also routines you could set alarms and timers in the original Phillips app
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:17,728	| IOT056 |	But you couldn't actually sit like full-on schedule
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:21,312	| IOT056 |	So now you've got they've made that process a little bit.
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:23,104	| IOT056 |	And there's a
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,152	| IOT056 |	A widget teacher that gives you
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,432	| IOT056 |	Access
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,200	| IOT056 |	From home screen
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,480	| IOT056 |	That you can
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:31,296	| IOT056 |	Program up to 10 scenes to do something like
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,576	| IOT056 |	Super fast like
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,368	| IOT056 |	All the lights in this room on or off
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:36,160	| IOT056 |	I actually cut
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:38,208	| IOT056 |	Created a bunch of those things using the Hue tap
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:41,024	| IOT056 |	The physical Hue tap device cuz it has
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:44,608	| IOT056 |	Five settings I believe four five settings
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:45,888	| IOT056 |	So you just press a button
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:48,192	| IOT056 |	So now you can do it
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:54,848	| IOT056 |	And that is good to hear on both counts scheduling I think it's very important for the lights and
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:56,384	| IOT056 |	I love love love widget
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,408	| IOT056 |	Sportsmart home
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,200	| IOT056 |	Controls that have the wink one
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:02,272	| IOT056 |	With all my shortcuts right on my home screen to one tap in your good to go
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:05,344	| IOT056 |	It also does home and away
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:07,136	| IOT056 |	Is it done geolocation
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:10,464	| IOT056 |	And then it also Phillips has a tie in with nest
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,768	| IOT056 |	A works with Nest integration that
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:15,072	| IOT056 |	Ideas to do home and away so
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,096	| IOT056 |	I didn't really
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,656	| IOT056 |	Feel a lack in the previous app
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:21,216	| IOT056 |	But you know it's nice for people who don't have all that
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:24,544	| IOT056 |	That the Philips Hue app is finally becoming
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:26,336	| IOT056 |	Really what it should have been in the beginning
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:32,992	| IOT056 |	That's the update there the other update is for those of you guys who really love colored lights
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:35,552	| IOT056 |	There is now a
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:37,088	| IOT056 |	Outdoor safe
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:38,880	| IOT056 |	Colored light from ilumi
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:45,536	| IOT056 |	And these are the guys that are doing Bluetooth lights they have an indoor BR30 and an indoor a19 which
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,304	| IOT056 |	Just a normal light bulb
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,840	| IOT056 |	And now this
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:49,120	| IOT056 |	Outdoor flood
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:55,008	| IOT056 |	I'm excited about this cuz I have a rooftop Deck with lights
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:59,616	| IOT056 |	I would love to be able to do some cool color changing kind of things up there when we have parties
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:01,920	| IOT056 |	The light bulb is $70
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,688	| IOT056 |	And it
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:04,480	| IOT056 |	Will begin shipping in summer 2016
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,528	| IOT056 |	So it's not a cheap lipo
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:13,440	| IOT056 |	Noble and to be honest when you first told me about it right before the show as I can with a lot of money it doesn't use a hug which means that uses and
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,768	| IOT056 |	Use Bluetooth on your phone through the app
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:20,095	| IOT056 |	And it wasn't too keen on it but you raised a good point that I think is worth reiterating
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:26,751	| IOT056 |	If you're having your party on rooftop deck and you're not going to give out like access to your yourhub so people control the lights outside
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:30,335	| IOT056 |	The rapper. So if you want to give them Bluetooth access
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,615	| IOT056 |	Stewby's lights you can do so
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,639	| IOT056 |	Pretty easily
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,919	| IOT056 |	And the fact that it's
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:36,223	| IOT056 |	Outdoors ip64 rated
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,527	| IOT056 |	46 rated I believe I can double-check
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:39,807	| IOT056 |	Stereo 60
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:44,671	| IOT056 |	So it's you know dustproof and and can handle water and all that I know
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:47,999	| IOT056 |	Don't like you said too many outdoor lights that you can control like this
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,303	| IOT056 |	WeMo actually had a string of outdoor lights
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:53,887	| IOT056 |	That was the only other one
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,983	| IOT056 |	This is actually this is disco lights
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,055	| IOT056 |	Super stoked
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,847	| IOT056 |	The other thing is I tried
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:08,735	| IOT056 |	I think somewhere in my Twitter page you can see a picture of my dog dancing
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:09,759	| IOT056 |	Colored lights
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:12,319	| IOT056 |	I'm in that was actually
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:15,391	| IOT056 |	And there's a setting on the app that lets you
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:19,743	| IOT056 |	You don't have them changed with the Beat of the Music that you're listening to which
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,023	| IOT056 |	You know it's kind of fun
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:27,167	| IOT056 |	I'm not sure which I'm more impressed by though that they lights can actually change their color and all to the beat of that or that your dog Acts
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:30,495	| IOT056 |	We should know
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:33,311	| IOT056 |	Okay then she is a dancing crazy.
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:36,127	| IOT056 |	I think these are Nate I am probably be
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,407	| IOT056 |	Because I'm a sucker for lighting
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:43,039	| IOT056 |	Smart Home Technology I'm probably going to buy one or two of these just a test them out
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,319	| IOT056 |	When they're out on the market
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,599	| IOT056 |	And I will let you guys know
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,903	| IOT056 |	And maybe shoot another video of my dog dance
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:49,695	| IOT056 |	Who knows
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,023	| IOT056 |	So
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:54,303	| IOT056 |	That's that
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:55,839	| IOT056 |	Check those out of here in the market
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:58,143	| IOT056 |	And the final thing is
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,423	| IOT056 |	I had talked about these
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,727	| IOT056 |	Lights about a month ago these are the stack light
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,007	| IOT056 |	From
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,031	| IOT056 |	Company called stack labs
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,055	| IOT056 |	And
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:08,895	| IOT056 |	They actually announced this week that they've got an a19 bulb
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:10,687	| IOT056 |	Which is again that normal bulb
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,991	| IOT056 |	Cool thing about the stack lights
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:17,087	| IOT056 |	Is there a design with the idea that you will never have to touch your light switch
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,623	| IOT056 |	They're what they called
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:19,135	| IOT056 |	Responsive
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,671	| IOT056 |	Or say anything
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,439	| IOT056 |	Or do anything
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:22,463	| IOT056 |	Yeah you just
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,487	| IOT056 |	Well you do have
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:28,095	| IOT056 |	Walk into the room that's correct. They have a presence in Decatur
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:30,655	| IOT056 |	They do they have a motion sensor in there
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:34,751	| IOT056 |	Both types of lights they have a BR30 that I've been testing out for over a month
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:38,079	| IOT056 |	And then they have the 819 both have emotion
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,103	| IOT056 |	Detection
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,895	| IOT056 |	They both have an ambient light sensor
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:44,991	| IOT056 |	Supper ideas if you walk into a well-lit room the lights just one
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:45,759	| IOT056 |	Turn on his break
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,551	| IOT056 |	The sitting you energy
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:53,183	| IOT056 |	In practice I didn't see a lot of that it had to be really super bright for the lights not to turn on at all
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:55,231	| IOT056 |	It is always awesome
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,023	| IOT056 |	And have the lights
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:02,399	| IOT056 |	Obviously they've been light switches with motion sensors in the decades
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,959	| IOT056 |	But this is actually moving at sensor to the bulb
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:10,591	| IOT056 |	Interesting thing here is and I think was I don't this was just announced today or recently
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,103	| IOT056 |	It was
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:15,711	| IOT056 |	Do you think basically an ultrasonic
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:17,247	| IOT056 |	I guess I'll call it a sensor
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,295	| IOT056 |	To act like radar
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,063	| IOT056 |	So
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:24,927	| IOT056 |	What that means is these lights can actually sense your presence even if there's a lampshade in the way
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:27,743	| IOT056 |	Right cuz most motion sensors are
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:28,767	| IOT056 |	Parc
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:29,279	| IOT056 |	Passive infrared
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:35,679	| IOT056 |	They send out sound waves
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:37,727	| IOT056 |	They basically like a bat
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:40,799	| IOT056 |	Figure out what's in front of them or what's around them based on
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:42,079	| IOT056 |	Sonic
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:42,591	| IOT056 |	Picture they're getting
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,639	| IOT056 |	Also like radar
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,663	| IOT056 |	Like you said
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:49,503	| IOT056 |	So I have not tried the a19 with the new type of sensor but
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:53,343	| IOT056 |	I'm very excited about this this is research that actually
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:55,903	| IOT056 |	A bunch like the University of
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,927	| IOT056 |	Has been doing a lot of
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:59,999	| IOT056 |	Things with this in Wi-Fi for understanding gesture-based commands
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:02,303	| IOT056 |	So it's possible that we could see
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,839	| IOT056 |	You know what a couple of years
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,887	| IOT056 |	Better gesture recognition for
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,423	| IOT056 |	In home control
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:09,215	| IOT056 |	Based on this technology
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,007	| IOT056 |	Excited
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,031	| IOT056 |	Replied so early
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:15,871	| IOT056 |	Another bit I mean this is kind of a new technology involves
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:19,967	| IOT056 |	What surprises me is that it's not adding a ton to the cost of the bulb
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:23,295	| IOT056 |	The standard a19 I believe it's $28 a bulb
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:29,183	| IOT056 |	The symphony 19 is $28 but these bulbs do have a hub so you got to buy a starter packet first
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:31,743	| IOT056 |	Oh, and the initial starter pack for
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,791	| IOT056 |	39 teens is 8999
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,839	| IOT056 |	And I could Chuchu bulbs
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,351	| IOT056 |	Github
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,655	| IOT056 |	If you want to do the BR 30s
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:41,727	| IOT056 |	Those that's a $10 more for the starter pack
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,751	| IOT056 |	And it's
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,519	| IOT056 |	$60 a bulb
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,591	| IOT056 |	Differential
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,871	| IOT056 |	Big difference
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,407	| IOT056 |	I should also note
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,943	| IOT056 |	The $28 is the pre-order price
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:52,991	| IOT056 |	But
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,783	| IOT056 |	I would say
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,551	| IOT056 |	Based on my
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,599	| IOT056 |	Using these lights
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,367	| IOT056 |	It's in
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,927	| IOT056 |	I actually want to get a couple of 819
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,207	| IOT056 |	Because
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,999	| IOT056 |	I want to install them in my
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:04,511	| IOT056 |	Closet
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:08,095	| IOT056 |	Rate for rooms where
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:11,167	| IOT056 |	They're closed off so I have an open floor plan of my house so these
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,447	| IOT056 |	Decent work super well
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:16,799	| IOT056 |	In those rooms but any room that's closed off like your office
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,567	| IOT056 |	The laundry room
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:18,847	| IOT056 |	The study
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,383	| IOT056 |	Oh that's also the office
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:24,223	| IOT056 |	Closet
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:25,759	| IOT056 |	Really well I thought for this so
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,295	| IOT056 |	In hallways
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:31,903	| IOT056 |	Everything was always because they have like a daytime mode in a nighttime mode so you can
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:40,607	| IOT056 |	They probably need walls to bounce off of an if you have like a very open concept floor plan it may not be the best area is what it sounds
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,167	| IOT056 |	Actually if it just that you
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:43,679	| IOT056 |	Trigger them all the
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:50,079	| IOT056 |	So they are really really good
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,127	| IOT056 |	It's just that like
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:54,175	| IOT056 |	I pace around a lot
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,967	| IOT056 |	My daughter Paces so ghetto
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:56,991	| IOT056 |	You're walking in front of
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:04,159	| IOT056 |	Curious and I'm sure you can't answer the question since you can get a chance to try that da9 teams
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:07,999	| IOT056 |	I'd be curious if you can modify the sensitivity of the Ultrasonics
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,535	| IOT056 |	So that way
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,119	| IOT056 |	Going to hit you are here
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:15,167	| IOT056 |	Right ahead and they're going to actually
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:15,935	| IOT056 |	Later on
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:19,007	| IOT056 |	Like newer versions of the BR30
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,031	| IOT056 |	Should have
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,055	| IOT056 |	Ultrasonic
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,335	| IOT056 |	Sensors in them
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,127	| IOT056 |	Chris just like
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,663	| IOT056 |	Hey we have this idea we might implement
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,199	| IOT056 |	It's great so
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:30,783	| IOT056 |	I am probably going to buy some
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,343	| IOT056 |	I'm not sure how many yet but
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,623	| IOT056 |	Once I figure out like
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,927	| IOT056 |	My whole home lighting plan on share it with
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,463	| IOT056 |	And the integrate
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:45,375	| IOT056 |	Thank you answer my question I don't want another Hub if I have to have it what else can I work
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:47,167	| IOT056 |	4 piece with this what I'm going to say
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:47,679	| IOT056 |	Right
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,983	| IOT056 |	Cuz without Bluetooth there's
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:53,823	| IOT056 |	Okay so
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:55,615	| IOT056 |	Music on four lights
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,151	| IOT056 |	But this week is like there
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,967	| IOT056 |	I forgot about that
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:01,759	| IOT056 |	How Could You Forget About Me
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:03,295	| IOT056 |	Should I tell you how could I
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:08,671	| IOT056 |	They also
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,951	| IOT056 |	Has a circadian rhythm
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:15,839	| IOT056 |	Whatever time of day do you trigger them they're going to be in their circadian rhythm for that time of day
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:16,863	| IOT056 |	Which is kind of me
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:17,375	| IOT056 |	If you're into
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,727	| IOT056 |	For the closet Maybe
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,287	| IOT056 |	Four bedrooms in offices
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,079	| IOT056 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:29,919	| IOT056 |	So what else do we have we have
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,431	| IOT056 |	Wearables
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,479	| IOT056 |	Wearables Nokia but
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:33,759	| IOT056 |	Whiting
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:38,623	| IOT056 |	It makes sense in hindsight most these things do but I was surprised when I heard the news
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,391	| IOT056 |	7
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:41,183	| IOT056 |	Nokia has done a lot of different
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:45,279	| IOT056 |	Things to try and get into the the Health Market in the past either through apps or
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:47,327	| IOT056 |	Or whatnot bedtime
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:50,143	| IOT056 |	Here it's just a flat-out acquisition of life things
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,679	| IOT056 |	And
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:58,591	| IOT056 |	I forget how much they paid with something like almost 200 million dollars I got 290
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,103	| IOT056 |	1
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:02,431	| IOT056 |	Yeah we're good for why things
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:06,527	| IOT056 |	They've always seemed like an underdog in the space and for people who are not familiar with the name
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,063	| IOT056 |	In today's
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:10,879	| IOT056 |	Health wearables section or sector
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,903	| IOT056 |	You can have a lot of
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:12,671	| IOT056 |	Digital
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,975	| IOT056 |	Smartphone e like type
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:15,743	| IOT056 |	Devices
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:17,791	| IOT056 |	Bicycle with with digital screens and so on
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:19,583	| IOT056 |	Why things takes a very analog approach
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:21,887	| IOT056 |	To all the tile tracking and
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,423	| IOT056 |	They make devices that look like
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,959	| IOT056 |	Traditional watches
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,007	| IOT056 |	4 things that you want to wear bracelets inside
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:30,079	| IOT056 |	And they just have like an indicator like a sweeping hand
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:31,615	| IOT056 |	4 steps for example work
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:36,991	| IOT056 |	Arepa calories burned it mean to have apps as well as I don't want to say they're completely analog cuz they're not but
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:39,807	| IOT056 |	It's just always thought there an underdog here
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:42,111	| IOT056 |	So I think why things feels like an underdog for
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,159	| IOT056 |	What is there French
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,607	| IOT056 |	50%
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:56,703	| IOT056 |	In in 2015 I believe it was that they said that about 50% of their sales come from
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:59,263	| IOT056 |	And then the rest
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,543	| IOT056 |	Come from your opinion
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:02,335	| IOT056 |	Like 10% comes from Asia
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:02,847	| IOT056 |	So
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,639	| IOT056 |	Right there you know
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:05,919	| IOT056 |	Probably
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:06,687	| IOT056 |	A bit more
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:09,503	| IOT056 |	Global in their scope but the other thing is
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:12,319	| IOT056 |	They have a lot more than just the activity K-pop
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,343	| IOT056 |	They have
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,111	| IOT056 |	Pulse
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:15,135	| IOT056 |	Which is
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:21,279	| IOT056 |	Activity tracker that also at the heart rate sensor and it was actually one of the first to have those of have a heart rate sensor on
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:22,559	| IOT056 |	Like that type of
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:23,071	| IOT056 |	Activity tracker
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:25,375	| IOT056 |	They have
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,399	| IOT056 |	A bunch of devices
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:28,191	| IOT056 |	Like a baby monitor
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:31,519	| IOT056 |	A smart scale for weighing your baby they have
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:32,799	| IOT056 |	A scale for weight
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,103	| IOT056 |	Normal people adults
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,151	| IOT056 |	They have a blood pressure monitor
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:39,455	| IOT056 |	And a couple of
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:43,551	| IOT056 |	It actually worked really hard like it getting FDA approval for their more medical devices
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:47,391	| IOT056 |	Are they actually at CES were showing off a new thermometer in New Canaan
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:48,415	| IOT056 |	Thermometer to
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:54,047	| IOT056 |	Broad range of products and and that makes it even
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:56,095	| IOT056 |	A better fit for Nokia in my opinion
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,375	| IOT056 |	Yes and that's what I was going to
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:03,519	| IOT056 |	Which I don't think they cornered the market in it all
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:07,359	| IOT056 |	Holistically about
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:09,663	| IOT056 |	Quantified Self data in there trying to get it
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:12,479	| IOT056 |	To where it actually abused for the medical
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:16,319	| IOT056 |	A profession where some of like Fitbit and Jawbone they're kind of like
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:22,463	| IOT056 |	We don't really care what David pay those companies tend not to want to deal with the FDA here in the states
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:25,791	| IOT056 |	Yeah and I also I think
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:27,327	| IOT056 |	You're not as focused on
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:29,119	| IOT056 |	Bridging the Gap
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,143	| IOT056 |	In-N-Out
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:32,191	| IOT056 |	4 V bucks in parables
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:39,103	| IOT056 |	Money in healthcare is for the insurance firms
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,895	| IOT056 |	To a point where things are FDA-approved
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,223	| IOT056 |	Simplethings
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:50,623	| IOT056 |	Yeah but probably better or more aggressively than most of the others in the in the space I would agree
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:52,159	| IOT056 |	It's all about the data
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,439	| IOT056 |	And what
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,743	| IOT056 |	You can do with it how accurate is it end
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:58,047	| IOT056 |	Frequent use it you know in healthcare industry
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:01,887	| IOT056 |	So I was kind of shy but the purchase price was a little small
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:08,799	| IOT056 |	Just to put that in context for a 2015 reported 1.86 billion
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,311	| IOT056 |	10 in Revenue
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,615	| IOT056 |	Not all of that
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,639	| IOT056 |	Miss from device sales
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:15,199	| IOT056 |	Diesel Service as well
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,015	| IOT056 |	Yeah so true if you think about that
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,551	| IOT056 |	From that perspective you know
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,087	| IOT056 |	190
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:22,367	| IOT056 |	Almost 200 million is
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:22,879	| IOT056 |	This is nothing
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:25,183	| IOT056 |	Thinking about their actual Revenue
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:25,695	| IOT056 |	Agreed
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:32,351	| IOT056 |	28 2015 they sold 21.4 million connected Health and Fitness.
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,143	| IOT056 |	So
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:37,727	| IOT056 |	They are the leader
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:41,567	| IOT056 |	That's kind of where we are
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:43,615	| IOT056 |	Here do you care to think about like
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,383	| IOT056 |	Nokia
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:45,919	| IOT056 |	Backing devices
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:51,551	| IOT056 |	Oh I mean it's in their DNA has been minnow for a while I'm in a company
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:54,879	| IOT056 |	What hundred sixty-seven years old and started out
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:56,415	| IOT056 |	With the
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,695	| IOT056 |	Yeah exactly
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:58,975	| IOT056 |	I just turned into
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,255	| IOT056 |	Youku
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,535	| IOT056 |	Conglomerate of many different
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,327	| IOT056 |	Businesses
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:06,399	| IOT056 |	But either they don't have a true device
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:09,983	| IOT056 |	Group you stay is considering the whole Microsoft purchasing
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:13,567	| IOT056 |	And all the phone business and so on so
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,871	| IOT056 |	That's more people there they have investment funds of money
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:18,687	| IOT056 |	And then enter the good folks
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,991	| IOT056 |	Don't know what to do I think
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:23,807	| IOT056 |	With Y things to add to continue growing it so
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:27,647	| IOT056 |	I think it's it's nice to see Nokia in a return to
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:31,487	| IOT056 |	A segment that gives them some play on the device side but also on
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:33,023	| IOT056 |	I'm on the outside as well
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:34,559	| IOT056 |	Got it and they said that Cedric
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:37,119	| IOT056 |	Hutchings who is currently the CEO of why things will lead
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:38,655	| IOT056 |	They're digital Health business
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,423	| IOT056 |	That will be great
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:44,543	| IOT056 |	Anderson proximately 100 R&D people that Nokia has working on digital health
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:45,567	| IOT056 |	MLB part of that
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,895	| IOT056 |	And I'm not going to say where he's probably going to be
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:49,919	| IOT056 |	Cuz I say it wrong
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:50,943	| IOT056 |	In Finland
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,711	| IOT056 |	Take the city
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:57,599	| IOT056 |	I want someone to actually put I know what a print of one of her listeners corrected me and now I forget
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:04,255	| IOT056 |	It might be us but like I forget but whoever it was thank you for correcting me
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:05,535	| IOT056 |	Yes we appreciate it
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:07,327	| IOT056 |	Even though we have not put that knowledge to
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:10,143	| IOT056 |	I'm not going to lie
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,679	| IOT056 |	Whatever you know Act
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:12,959	| IOT056 |	She sometimes
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:13,983	| IOT056 |	We like to get it right
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:17,311	| IOT056 |	The other story I thought worth mentioning this week
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,079	| IOT056 |	Questyle
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:20,127	| IOT056 |	Which I should just bought one
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:23,711	| IOT056 |	Tile is a Bluetooth tracker that you stick on things
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:24,991	| IOT056 |	And
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:30,367	| IOT056 |	That sounded like an ad did it because did you buy one because you lost one
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,391	| IOT056 |	No
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,951	| IOT056 |	If I spent $25 on my
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:34,975	| IOT056 |	My tile.
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:36,767	| IOT056 |	$12 water
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,815	| IOT056 |	That's what it was so
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:41,375	| IOT056 |	Lust
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,143	| IOT056 |	2 $12
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:42,655	| IOT056 |	Water bottles
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:46,239	| IOT056 |	What's the title run gymnastics
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,775	| IOT056 |	What's the title cost these days
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:52,639	| IOT056 |	The tile is $25 if you buy just one and 1750 per tile if you buy a
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:55,967	| IOT056 |	Triton T2 Bluetooth tag for folks are not familiar
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:57,247	| IOT056 |	Yes
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,527	| IOT056 |	To your phone
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:17:59,295	| IOT056 |	The cool thing about tile
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:02,111	| IOT056 |	And why were I'm so excited about it
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,391	| IOT056 |	Is that
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,439	| IOT056 |	It has the potential
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:08,511	| IOT056 |	It's kind of become a poor man's GPS
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,279	| IOT056 |	I think
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:12,863	| IOT056 |	I say this because what happens is when you lose
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:16,703	| IOT056 |	Your device or when you actually when you buy a tile you install the app on
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,215	| IOT056 |	On your phone
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:19,519	| IOT056 |	And from then on your phone becomes
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:22,079	| IOT056 |	Able to detect other tiles
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,871	| IOT056 |	So someone says
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:28,223	| IOT056 |	I lost my bike and there's a tile on it and so they Mark the tile
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:28,735	| IOT056 |	Is lost
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:33,087	| IOT056 |	If you're walking by that stolen bike without missing bike
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,111	| IOT056 |	With your
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,647	| IOT056 |	Phone in the tile apps on it
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,951	| IOT056 |	That your phone will actually
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:40,767	| IOT056 |	Seamlessly to you you don't see it happen will send a notice
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,535	| IOT056 |	Vacation out
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,047	| IOT056 |	To the service
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:47,935	| IOT056 |	It's like a crowdsourced device GPS thing hits
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:48,959	| IOT056 |	Weather in
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,263	| IOT056 |	It's great so
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:53,055	| IOT056 |	They actually do this not that I bought
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:57,663	| IOT056 |	The actual actually reported their revenue for the first time this week
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:19:02,527	| IOT056 |	And they in 2015 sold 43 million dollars worth of tiles
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,319	| IOT056 |	Salat times
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:06,111	| IOT056 |	A lot of Trials
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:11,743	| IOT056 |	When I looked on my app I had 15 almost 15000 Tiles near me
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:13,279	| IOT056 |	Which meant that there were
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,047	| IOT056 |	I know
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:15,583	| IOT056 |	Oh sorry no 1500
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:17,887	| IOT056 |	Still alive
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:20,703	| IOT056 |	What's a 15 + I'd say a lot but
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,983	| IOT056 |	Kitchen
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:24,031	| IOT056 |	Yeah so that's people Oliver Austin that if
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,823	| IOT056 |	You know I leave my water bottle
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:27,359	| IOT056 |	Somewhere maybe
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:31,455	| IOT056 |	I haven't left this water bottle
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,223	| IOT056 |	Anywhere yet just
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:34,015	| IOT056 |	The test this out but we'll see
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:34,783	| IOT056 |	I probably will soon
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:37,599	| IOT056 |	And is part of actually making money
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:39,135	| IOT056 |	They're kind of going
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:41,439	| IOT056 |	Not a different direction but they're adding on to their business
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:44,255	| IOT056 |	They could have deal with
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:46,047	| IOT056 |	Integrate tile into
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:46,559	| IOT056 |	The car
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:50,655	| IOT056 |	So this is interesting because now your car is basically like
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,447	| IOT056 |	A walking tile
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:20:01,151	| IOT056 |	SSO is this to help you find your car or is it for the car to remind you that your device with a tile
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,175	| IOT056 |	Is it with you
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:02,687	| IOT056 |	Both
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:04,991	| IOT056 |	Double bus
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:10,879	| IOT056 |	Mike Farley who is an executive
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:16,767	| IOT056 |	He told me that this next year tiles going to focus on these integration so you should see more
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:18,815	| IOT056 |	More tiles integrated
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:19,327	| IOT056 |	Other device
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:21,887	| IOT056 |	Actually with an umbrella in it
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:24,959	| IOT056 |	Which you know you'll never lose your brother again was kind of idea
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,263	| IOT056 |	I don't think that went
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:27,775	| IOT056 |	Very far
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:30,591	| IOT056 |	Because it was a very expensive umbrella
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,127	| IOT056 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:34,943	| IOT056 |	Yeah when you're talkin about adding tile to
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:38,015	| IOT056 |	The cost of an umbrella versus adding tile to the price of a car
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:38,783	| IOT056 |	Micardis
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:41,087	| IOT056 |	Sucks that price right into it so it's not a big deal
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,135	| IOT056 |	Seattle
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:46,719	| IOT056 |	I was excited by this I was excited by the fact that I get connected device come
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:47,743	| IOT056 |	He is making
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:48,255	| IOT056 |	That much more
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,351	| IOT056 |	Good on tile
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:54,143	| IOT056 |	Which brings us to
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:56,959	| IOT056 |	Tencent
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:58,751	| IOT056 |	If you want another in your life
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,799	| IOT056 |	Let's talk about what you should get
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:05,663	| IOT056 |	Has by golly I got an ass
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:06,943	| IOT056 |	Nest
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,247	| IOT056 |	Pebble
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,271	| IOT056 |	Pebble Hill
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:11,039	| IOT056 |	I don't know how
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:16,416	| IOT056 |	I think the Pebbles not a bad by because it's not that expensive and adds a lot of value
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,536	| IOT056 |	Well I mean
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:26,656	| IOT056 |	I mean the regular Pebble that I would say just
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:29,216	| IOT056 |	You know what gives you the basics it's not that expensive
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,496	| IOT056 |	Okay so the regular
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,008	| IOT056 |	Pebble
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,824	| IOT056 |	Alright then
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:34,592	| IOT056 |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:37,664	| IOT056 |	I have one
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:39,712	| IOT056 |	So you know it's out there
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:43,552	| IOT056 |	Is it like $75 can you get it for less than that I bet you could get
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:45,856	| IOT056 |	It's about right though
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:47,904	| IOT056 |	So so that's the basic Level Kevin
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,976	| IOT056 |	I was going to suggest a title
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:53,024	| IOT056 |	Because it's great to put on
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:54,048	| IOT056 |	Yorkies and it's like
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:54,816	| IOT056 |	25 bucks
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:56,096	| IOT056 |	And
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:58,912	| IOT056 |	Also if you're younger and you lose stuff
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,680	| IOT056 |	Often
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:02,240	| IOT056 |	You can actually like make your mom to have to look for it as often
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,776	| IOT056 |	Hypocrite
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:06,336	| IOT056 |	It's like the gift that you give yourself the gift to her
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:09,920	| IOT056 |	You know I I thought about you
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:13,504	| IOT056 |	Putting one in my purse or something like that though the other thing is from the app
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:15,552	| IOT056 |	Make the tile beep and it'll tell you where
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:16,064	| IOT056 |	Your stuff is
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:20,416	| IOT056 |	That's always nice it's nice if you are not the type of person who
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:21,440	| IOT056 |	Sister phone
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,720	| IOT056 |	My mom kind of is so so
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,256	| IOT056 |	That's wassup.
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:27,584	| IOT056 |	All right so other things for your mom
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,120	| IOT056 |	Do you think you buy your mama knows
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,192	| IOT056 |	Or Barb
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:32,704	| IOT056 |	Your wife who is also
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:35,776	| IOT056 |	I mean they don't really
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:36,800	| IOT056 |	Like we have a nest
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:38,592	| IOT056 |	If we didn't I would buy one
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:42,432	| IOT056 |	They wouldn't be like very enthused by it at all honestly
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:43,712	| IOT056 |	When they sent me that.
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,224	| IOT056 |	Campaign outside
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:45,504	| IOT056 |	You know
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:46,784	| IOT056 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:48,576	| IOT056 |	But if my family bought me a thermostat
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,344	| IOT056 |	For Mother's Day
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:49,856	| IOT056 |	Be kind of like
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:53,952	| IOT056 |	Yeah I don't I don't think that would go over too well
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:56,000	| IOT056 |	There are devices
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:57,536	| IOT056 |	Could go over
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,328	| IOT056 |	So if your mom likes
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:00,096	| IOT056 |	To cook
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:04,960	| IOT056 |	I'm going to recommend maybe one of the automated sous vide so the Anova sous vide is out there
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:05,728	| IOT056 |	And
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,008	| IOT056 |	That's pretty
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,544	| IOT056 |	Cool cuz they have both Wi-Fi and
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:10,592	| IOT056 |	About to drop scale
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:11,616	| IOT056 |	There's
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:14,176	| IOT056 |	That is actually $100
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:16,480	| IOT056 |	And it makes both
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:17,248	| IOT056 |	Cocktails
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:17,760	| IOT056 |	Aunt
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,552	| IOT056 |	Baked goods will any kind of
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:24,672	| IOT056 |	So the Anova cooker is about 180 bucks
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:26,208	| IOT056 |	So that's kind of expensive
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:27,744	| IOT056 |	But you know your mom she's nice
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,792	| IOT056 |	Let's see what else
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:30,816	| IOT056 |	The echo
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,864	| IOT056 |	I was going to say it
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:33,376	| IOT056 |	But
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:34,912	| IOT056 |	How you know
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:38,752	| IOT056 |	I don't want to overdo it cuz I know we tweak we are third fix fans of the echo
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:41,312	| IOT056 |	It's an easy-to-use consumer device
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,872	| IOT056 |	Cuz remember if you buy your parents
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:44,640	| IOT056 |	How to connect a device
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,432	| IOT056 |	You're going to support them
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:52,320	| IOT056 |	Would you would you actually go with an echo or would you go with something like the.
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,088	| IOT056 |	Ter
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:54,368	| IOT056 |	Roughly half the price
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,904	| IOT056 |	I would go with the echo
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:57,952	| IOT056 |	Because
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:00,256	| IOT056 |	Like a Sonos or something like that so I think my speaker
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:00,768	| IOT056 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,072	| IOT056 |	Gotcha
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:04,096	| IOT056 |	That's that's my rationale
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:05,376	| IOT056 |	Makes sense
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:07,936	| IOT056 |	They both do the same thing
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:16,640	| IOT056 |	If you're Stacy Bettis
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,920	| IOT056 |	Brings us full circle
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:22,784	| IOT056 |	Cuz my mom
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:23,808	| IOT056 |	She was established
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:24,320	| IOT056 |	Takashi super nice
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:26,624	| IOT056 |	And she's like
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:30,208	| IOT056 |	Cash like anything so the only other thing I would suggest for
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:32,768	| IOT056 |	Video doorbell
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:33,536	| IOT056 |	And
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,840	| IOT056 |	I'm going to say that because
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:39,680	| IOT056 |	You know if your mom is worried about like security she can see who's at the door
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,216	| IOT056 |	That's always nice
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:43,008	| IOT056 |	And
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:45,568	| IOT056 |	I don't disagree with you.
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:47,104	| IOT056 |	I was thinking to do
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:48,384	| IOT056 |	Dimension lights
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:50,432	| IOT056 |	There's a lot of moms out there who
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:57,344	| IOT056 |	You know they like to lie in bed and read or whatnot I actually don't know that we get a connected light but I would get a maybe I can I get switch like the
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,368	| IOT056 |	Inside switch
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:24:59,904	| IOT056 |	Oh
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,952	| IOT056 |	Because you can you know that
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,512	| IOT056 |	Region free phone and
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:06,560	| IOT056 |	Say shut off and it shuts off you can schedule it
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,376	| IOT056 |	1011 at night whenever you're done reading
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:10,656	| IOT056 |	If you were
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:16,032	| IOT056 |	Super generous and bought an echo as well as at the echo.and
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,312	| IOT056 |	Now Mom can say
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:18,592	| IOT056 |	Shutter down
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:20,384	| IOT056 |	Lights
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:22,432	| IOT056 |	Okay so I will go for that
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,712	| IOT056 |	Maybe you and your siblings
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,224	| IOT056 |	Can all get together
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:28,832	| IOT056 |	So those are kind of some things that we that we thought about from the bombing
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:30,368	| IOT056 |	That would be
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:32,672	| IOT056 |	Kind of nice connected devices
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:33,696	| IOT056 |	For your mom
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:39,584	| IOT056 |	Golf devices

EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,952	| IOT056 |	Wall Street did not like

EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,640	| IOT056 |	What street was
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,152	| IOT056 |	Was not impressed
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:30,688	| IOT056 |	So

EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:42,208	| IOT056 |	Let's start off with
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:44,256	| IOT056 |	What you saw coming when you saw it
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,792	| IOT056 |	And what you guys decided to do about
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:57,312	| IOT056 |	Until the next Generation the old networks in a little. But I think we
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:59,360	| IOT056 |	We thought it of course having a baby
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:02,688	| IOT056 |	The network switch deal is very important
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:16,512	| IOT056 |	Cloud it needed
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:19,328	| IOT056 |	Drake's net worth
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:28,800	| IOT056 |	Based on our anchor Core Business web developer Jason B students.
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:31,616	| IOT056 |	And of course honey much more soap franchises in Thailand
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:33,152	| IOT056 |	That was sort of that
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:34,176	| IOT056 |	Epaystub
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:39,552	| IOT056 |	Area
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:41,600	| IOT056 |	The structure that
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:43,648	| IOT056 |	Support
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:44,928	| IOT056 |	Okay
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:46,720	| IOT056 |	So judging by your results
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:49,280	| IOT056 |	This is a difficult transition
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:52,352	| IOT056 |	You're really trying to thread the needle here as your
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:54,144	| IOT056 |	Core Business Network
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:55,936	| IOT056 |	It stack meaning
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:58,752	| IOT056 |	It's their consolidation in the industry there
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:00,032	| IOT056 |	Traders are buying
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:03,872	| IOT056 |	Bus stuff they're transitioning to sdn which means they're going to require less
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:05,152	| IOT056 |	Of your gear
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:07,968	| IOT056 |	So how are you guys thinking about
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:10,272	| IOT056 |	Adding Services it how is that going
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:15,392	| IOT056 |	How to say I'm looking for structure
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:17,184	| IOT056 |	Market
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:39,968	| IOT056 |	Dramatic transformation
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:46,112	| IOT056 |	Then of course
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:49,184	| IOT056 |	Which one you think
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:55,072	| IOT056 |	Based on our strength on the telephone side

EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:40,288	| IOT056 |	The actual providing connectivity is going to be
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:42,080	| IOT056 |	A small part of
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:46,944	| IOT056 |	Curious
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:49,504	| IOT056 |	How you think your customers
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:51,808	| IOT056 |	As the carriers are going to kind of
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:58,464	| IOT056 |	Are these new businesses are they
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,816	| IOT056 |	Think about that

EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:56,064	| IOT056 |	I think
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,344	| IOT056 |	Ultimate doing yet
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:59,648	| IOT056 |	Cathay pacific application
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:02,720	| IOT056 |	Got it
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:04,768	| IOT056 |	Alright let's talk about 5G
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:06,304	| IOT056 |	Because everyone's keep
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:09,632	| IOT056 |	Throwing that term around and I've heard it apply to Wi-Fi to
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:11,168	| IOT056 |	Cellular
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:13,984	| IOT056 |	Even millimeter wave technology so
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:16,544	| IOT056 |	Tell me what you think of when you hear 5 G
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:23,456	| IOT056 |	Card games that are different
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:24,736	| IOT056 |	Define developed
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,552	| IOT056 |	That's nothing
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:29,600	| IOT056 |	5 years olds a different
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:33,696	| IOT056 |	Thinking of you the whole network
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:37,792	| IOT056 |	Where you need to orchestrate the whole network dealer in Utah
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:42,656	| IOT056 |	Let's say you have the wrong tonight or if I connect what's up with you girl
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:45,984	| IOT056 |	Let's say that you have another sniper
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:48,288	| IOT056 |	That is delivering a letter
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:58,016	| IOT056 |	Show on you can go with different type of slicing in the network
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:03,904	| IOT056 |	Four different type of
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:09,792	| IOT056 |	And when you talk about
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:17,472	| IOT056 |	We will embrace
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:22,080	| IOT056 |	What technologies are you most
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:24,128	| IOT056 |	Because right now there's
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:27,456	| IOT056 |	A dozen different kind of low-power wide area Networks
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:28,224	| IOT056 |	Running around out there
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:34,624	| IOT056 |	Millimeter wave stuff from like even Facebook and Google are getting it on this moron delivering actual
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:36,416	| IOT056 |	Backhaul and access
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:40,000	| IOT056 |	Players that are not traditional
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:45,888	| IOT056 |	I think that's the most exciting is that there this time
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:48,192	| IOT056 |	What you said
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:48,704	| IOT056 |	Very sexy
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:53,824	| IOT056 |	Even if
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:56,640	| IOT056 |	I need to compression
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:35:00,224	| IOT056 |	Tri-State mobile network in the world
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:02,272	| IOT056 |	Which is older
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,392	| IOT056 |	Because you guys
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:13,792	| IOT056 |	Are over in Europe and I always feel that Europe is way ahead of the US
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:14,560	| IOT056 |	Cities
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:18,912	| IOT056 |	Businesses between smart Manufacturing
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:20,960	| IOT056 |	Radio Networks
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:23,520	| IOT056 |	Businesses
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:26,848	| IOT056 |	Is that true do you view Europe still is kind of more advanced
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:31,200	| IOT056 |	Yeah I would like to compare like that but of course
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:36,576	| IOT056 |	We have seen them knowing that you were being in Baltimore
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:43,488	| IOT056 |	Everything problem
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:44,256	| IOT056 |	Even though
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:48,864	| IOT056 |	Development
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:55,008	| IOT056 |	They will have the best donuts
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:03,456	| IOT056 |	Marcus like the USA Korea
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:09,088	| IOT056 |	UEFA Euro
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:10,368	| IOT056 |	Adidas
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:13,440	| IOT056 |	To do these type of things
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:15,232	| IOT056 |	Should be worried about
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:21,120	| IOT056 |	Spectrum
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:27,008	| IOT056 |	Cellular
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:30,080	| IOT056 |	How should we be thinking about
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,872	| IOT056 |	Allocated Spectrum
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:33,664	| IOT056 |	And then
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:35,968	| IOT056 |	Between licensed and unlicensed bands
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:39,808	| IOT056 |	First of all I think that's all they needed
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,344	| IOT056 |	Both lights
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:46,976	| IOT056 |	And we build you can actually move a thing between them
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:50,816	| IOT056 |	I think that's going to be important.
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:52,608	| IOT056 |	Men of quarter Circle
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:56,960	| IOT056 |	Would make
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:36:58,496	| IOT056 |	Honda cheaper
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:00,288	| IOT056 |	Add devices sheet for essay
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:06,432	| IOT056 |	But that we will need to use
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:11,040	| IOT056 |	Accident 78 Highway
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:17,696	| IOT056 |	When we talk about slicing
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:19,232	| IOT056 |	Slicing and dicing
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:20,256	| IOT056 |	Wireless networks
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:21,024	| IOT056 |	Spore
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:22,560	| IOT056 |	Kinecta cars which needs
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:24,096	| IOT056 |	You know different application
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,632	| IOT056 |	Next Level service levels
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:26,912	| IOT056 |	So that versus
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:28,192	| IOT056 |	Voice call versus
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:31,776	| IOT056 |	You know delivering data from a sensor out in the middle of a field
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:34,848	| IOT056 |	Do you think this
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:35,616	| IOT056 |	Getting
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:38,688	| IOT056 |	The network neutrality debate started up again
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:42,784	| IOT056 |	I hope not because it benefits our society
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:49,696	| IOT056 |	Need some different type of used AC
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:51,488	| IOT056 |	I'm in that everybody should have access
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:53,792	| IOT056 |	Internet

EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:17,856	| IOT056 |	Forward for a long time
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:22,208	| IOT056 |	You're trying to prep and do something that's a long-term plan
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:25,024	| IOT056 |	Does Wall Street understand
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:26,816	| IOT056 |	Are you able to communicate or how do you
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:28,608	| IOT056 |	Communicate this to Wall Street
