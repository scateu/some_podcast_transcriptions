EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:29,856	| IOT070 |	You want to start with wearables
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:35,232	| IOT070 |	We can do that I was going to actually say something about traveling cuz I suspect you are traveling based on the
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:38,816	| IOT070 |	Audio feed coming from your side of conversation
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:40,096	| IOT070 |	You're right
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:41,632	| IOT070 |	So I am traveling
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:43,424	| IOT070 |	This week so apologies
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:45,216	| IOT070 |	Or weird sound quality
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:48,544	| IOT070 |	I promise I will be back in the studio next week
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:50,592	| IOT070 |	And I'm exploring different setup
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:52,384	| IOT070 |	Or making my travel
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:54,176	| IOT070 |	Rick a little bit more compact
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:56,480	| IOT070 |	So you really phoning it in this way
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:58,016	| IOT070 |	Literally literally phoning it in
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:00,320	| IOT070 |	Dunton
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:05,440	| IOT070 |	You can talk more this
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:09,536	| IOT070 |	I hope you got your coffee
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:12,352	| IOT070 |	Let's get started with
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:15,936	| IOT070 |	Phillips on
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:20,288	| IOT070 |	Is actually Monday or Sunday night introduced a bunch of new wearables
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:21,568	| IOT070 |	Which
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:24,640	| IOT070 |	Many of those are probably like really do I need a fitness tracker
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,408	| IOT070 |	Scale
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:27,712	| IOT070 |	Thermometer and blood pressure cuffs
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,224	| IOT070 |	Sam Phillips
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,016	| IOT070 |	The answer is
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:32,576	| IOT070 |	Yes if you wanted to be FDA-approved
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:38,976	| IOT070 |	Which is interesting because a lot of the wearables that are Health Focus
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:41,280	| IOT070 |	Typically not FDA-approved
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:44,608	| IOT070 |	She's not necessarily a bad thing but
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:48,448	| IOT070 |	It speaks to how accurate the devices may or may not be
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:51,008	| IOT070 |	So it's something to keep in mind when you're searching for
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:51,776	| IOT070 |	Health-related wearable
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:55,360	| IOT070 |	Exactly is really competing with wiping
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:56,896	| IOT070 |	Most of the devices
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:59,200	| IOT070 |	The same set of devices
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:00,992	| IOT070 |	Matheson Pocus witches
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,272	| IOT070 |	Actually getting
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:05,088	| IOT070 |	FDA approvals of doctors at Health Systems
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:06,112	| IOT070 |	Actually use them
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,648	| IOT070 |	In Phillips
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:10,976	| IOT070 |	Many of you may not be aware I don't know not only do they make Lee
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:13,536	| IOT070 |	Sonicare toothbrushes sales make list
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:17,120	| IOT070 |	Ultrasound machine veggies and other things that are actually
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:17,632	| IOT070 |	Hospital
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:23,264	| IOT070 |	Sophie devices are a little bit more expensive balance watches like $250 for
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,056	| IOT070 |	And
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:28,384	| IOT070 |	It's kind of a fitness band kind of a smartwatch
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,920	| IOT070 |	It does give you heart rate
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:31,456	| IOT070 |	I'm sleeping patterns
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:33,504	| IOT070 |	It goes down step-counting
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,784	| IOT070 |	Is basically offering like
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:35,296	| IOT070 |	Better actress
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:42,208	| IOT070 |	So it's not what I would call a smartwatch in the traditional sense of the term if there is the traditional sense
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,232	| IOT070 |	August
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:46,048	| IOT070 |	Definitely more of a health-focused and a higher grade
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,840	| IOT070 |	One more accurate
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:52,448	| IOT070 |	Device than what you would buy it in a typical Smartwatch that can do the same things
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:55,776	| IOT070 |	Working with
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:56,288	| IOT070 |	Hospital
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:57,824	| IOT070 |	And with
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,360	| IOT070 |	The insurance companies in
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,384	| IOT070 |	March
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:00,896	| IOT070 |	Squares
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,944	| IOT070 |	To try to get people to
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:05,248	| IOT070 |	I'm going to install these devices
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:07,040	| IOT070 |	Is that really you're just you're just wearing
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,088	| IOT070 |	I don't think they're going to try to
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,392	| IOT070 |	Branch out that way in
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:14,720	| IOT070 |	You know we talked to Michelle about having Fitness
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:15,744	| IOT070 |	Trackers
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:19,071	| IOT070 |	What wearables on your body provided by your employer insurance
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:19,583	| IOT070 |	Company
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:20,607	| IOT070 |	Until
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,143	| IOT070 |	Not I mean
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:24,191	| IOT070 |	Some people are fine with it some people are like
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,471	| IOT070 |	You know I really don't want
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:26,495	| IOT070 |	That day.
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,311	| IOT070 |	Those people
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:31,103	| IOT070 |	TT how this works out
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:34,431	| IOT070 |	It does have a really big potential impact
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,223	| IOT070 |	Precision Medicine Show
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:38,015	| IOT070 |	I'm really torn on how this
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:38,783	| IOT070 |	Should I play out
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:45,951	| IOT070 |	I think in general it's a pretty smart move I mean they're not just offering one product that's actually a suite of products as you mentioned there's a scale
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:47,999	| IOT070 |	Wearable
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,559	| IOT070 |	A thermometer at two different blood pressure
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,863	| IOT070 |	Coxswain for the upper arm on for the rest
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:56,959	| IOT070 |	So you have a whole Suite of products is I think more appealing to
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:58,751	| IOT070 |	People can just a one-off here and there
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:04,127	| IOT070 |	And also as you mention if they get in with employers or large companies
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:09,503	| IOT070 |	It's possible that could generate large sales quickly because those companies might be able to
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,527	| IOT070 |	I don't know if these are
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:16,159	| IOT070 |	Expensable type items because they're update approved their health-related and then there's there's a lot of different
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:19,231	| IOT070 |	Ways this could play out as opposed to the consumer Market
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,023	| IOT070 |	And I will let you guys know
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:23,583	| IOT070 |	Phyllis is sending me a
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:25,887	| IOT070 |	A bundle of them with everything except for the thermometer
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:28,703	| IOT070 |	Eventually I'll be able to let you know
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:35,615	| IOT070 |	I should say about Healthcare bundles I wanted to update you because I have been wearing the Under Armour
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:36,639	| IOT070 |	Under Armour Fitness box
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:40,991	| IOT070 |	Because I was going to ask I was going to ask about that
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,271	| IOT070 |	I don't love it
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,551	| IOT070 |	Okay
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:46,623	| IOT070 |	Pictures a box I got it for 300
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:48,159	| IOT070 |	This $300 cuz
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:51,231	| IOT070 |	But it's $400 it contains a
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,255	| IOT070 |	Scale
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:55,583	| IOT070 |	Weight body fat
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:58,143	| IOT070 |	It also contains a fitness band
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,935	| IOT070 |	Heart rate tracker
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:02,495	| IOT070 |	And then I get to use the Under Armour record app
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:04,799	| IOT070 |	Like it alot
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:09,407	| IOT070 |	Yeah I think this is where you being an avid Runner
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:13,247	| IOT070 |	And me being an avid let's do other things like coming to play so
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:16,063	| IOT070 |	AP we emphasizes
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:20,671	| IOT070 |	People who really want to get fit really tractor Fitness at a really high level
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,463	| IOT070 |	Is it really me
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:27,839	| IOT070 |	It's really kind of a little bit frustrating
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,887	| IOT070 |	Calibrate your stride
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,447	| IOT070 |	Toy that fitness tracker
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,471	| IOT070 |	If your butt
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:34,751	| IOT070 |	So it's like
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,079	| IOT070 |	No no calories
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:42,687	| IOT070 |	Right there's no GPS in the unit so that's very important thing
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:47,551	| IOT070 |	And then also they cream so much information on this band that I'm kind of like
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:52,415	| IOT070 |	Wow you have to go through a lot of menus to do things like set the alarm
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:56,767	| IOT070 |	I think that's three menu prices to set an alarm maybe even 5
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,583	| IOT070 |	And then
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,143	| IOT070 |	I can't get to some things on the band
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:02,911	| IOT070 |	But I want to
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:08,799	| IOT070 |	For like what I'm probably the biggest downside to me is that
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:10,335	| IOT070 |	It doesn't automatically
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,615	| IOT070 |	Register
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,151	| IOT070 |	What I'm doing for today
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:16,735	| IOT070 |	Maybe I'm spoiled because job
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,247	| IOT070 |	Batman
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:21,343	| IOT070 |	I forgot to track like half my workout
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:29,023	| IOT070 |	Yeah that's a fair point and there's a lot of devices that still don't do automatic tracking by sensing what exercise you're doing
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:31,071	| IOT070 |	That's one of the features that I actually
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:35,423	| IOT070 |	I love on my Fitbit Surge and that's exactly what's on my wrist right now and has been for
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:36,959	| IOT070 |	Two or three months
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:39,519	| IOT070 |	You know I've walked around New York City yesterday
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,543	| IOT070 |	To the office to the
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,823	| IOT070 |	Port Authority Bus Terminal
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:48,223	| IOT070 |	I didn't have to tell it I was walking it just later said hey you walk 24 minutes he was your heart rate he was your distance you or your steps
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:52,319	| IOT070 |	So that is a big bonus for people who are focused on on the health
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,599	| IOT070 |	Packing bits
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:55,391	| IOT070 |	As far as the
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:57,439	| IOT070 |	Getting two different things in the band yet
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,719	| IOT070 |	Like everything else
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:04,095	| IOT070 |	Mobiletech everything's a trade-off see fit a very small narrow screen on the band to keep the band
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,911	| IOT070 |	Abandonada giant watch or anything and
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:07,935	| IOT070 |	You can
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:14,591	| IOT070 |	You said so there's a lot of menu options just to get what you need because you have small a small screen to deal with so
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:16,895	| IOT070 |	Those are all very fair points and maybe it's
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,175	| IOT070 |	More Focus for
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:20,223	| IOT070 |	Somebody and I run everyday and that's
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:20,991	| IOT070 |	That's why I like that
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,271	| IOT070 |	It's Anza
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,039	| IOT070 |	Contrapoints
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,831	| IOT070 |	Yeah and I mean the scale is fine
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:27,647	| IOT070 |	T heart rate monitor works really well
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:30,463	| IOT070 |	It did take a little bit of time to get
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:35,583	| IOT070 |	Could you do a shift to actively track a workout
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,607	| IOT070 |	Heart rate monitor
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,935	| IOT070 |	Better
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:40,959	| IOT070 |	Right right
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:43,519	| IOT070 |	Not to add more to your budget but
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:49,663	| IOT070 |	If you want automatic tracking with that system they actually do offer it just not in the what's in the box
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:54,783	| IOT070 |	They do sell the Under Armour record shoes with a built-in sensor
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:57,087	| IOT070 |	You can use those for calibration
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:02,463	| IOT070 |	They're always on and always tracking so when you go for a walk it will actually
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:06,815	| IOT070 |	Track it for you when you go for a run it will do that for you cuz the shoes are already gathering information
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:12,959	| IOT070 |	So for what that's worth it's an option but it's another matter $240 or $150 to add so
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,751	| IOT070 |	That is a missing piece to the Box
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:17,823	| IOT070 |	Yes and a lot of my workouts are
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,615	| IOT070 |	Spin class
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:23,199	| IOT070 |	Pilates or things that do not involve
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:23,711	| IOT070 |	Joshua
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:26,783	| IOT070 |	Right I feel like this is great for runners
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:27,807	| IOT070 |	And
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:35,487	| IOT070 |	Experience since I've mentioned that a couple months ago and wanted to let you guys know
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,279	| IOT070 |	Moving back to wearables
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,047	| IOT070 |	I think
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,839	| IOT070 |	You was pulled on
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,607	| IOT070 |	Cooler
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,631	| IOT070 |	Using Android Wear
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:45,215	| IOT070 |	Yeah this is interesting your sister for the first
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:48,031	| IOT070 |	Long-time traditional GPS
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,079	| IOT070 |	Fitness companies
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,383	| IOT070 |	To actually adopt
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,687	| IOT070 |	Android they came out just
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:59,039	| IOT070 |	This week with their new Android Wear based m600 GPS sport watch
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:00,831	| IOT070 |	And
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:07,743	| IOT070 |	If anybody sees the polar device before they're actually pretty good for tracking running exercise and swimming and biking it's on
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:14,143	| IOT070 |	But if you want to know Smartwatch functions you were going to get that so what they did was they integrated
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:17,215	| IOT070 |	What builds their new watch around Android where week is Google's
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,263	| IOT070 |	Platform for wearables
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:20,543	| IOT070 |	And
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:27,711	| IOT070 |	That adds all the Smartwatch functions you may want if you do such as you know call notifications text
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:30,271	| IOT070 |	Google Now notifications app notifications
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,575	| IOT070 |	Music controls the whole shebang
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,855	| IOT070 |	Plus you can
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:36,159	| IOT070 |	You can add then Android Wear apps
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:41,535	| IOT070 |	To the polar m600 which is something you can't do with a traditional polar or Garmin or whatever
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:43,839	| IOT070 |	I know Garmin has their own app store and so on foot
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,631	| IOT070 |	How do you spell connect IQ
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:49,215	| IOT070 |	But regardless it is interesting to me because it's in a
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:50,495	| IOT070 |	Gps-enabled
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:56,383	| IOT070 |	Please music because it has Android Wear support which supports music playback directly on the on the wearable
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:59,199	| IOT070 |	6 LED heart rate monitor
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,991	| IOT070 |	Be curious to see how accurate that is
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:03,039	| IOT070 |	And
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:06,879	| IOT070 |	What's at the polar Flow app as well as all other Android Wear app so
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,695	| IOT070 |	It's an ice melting of of traditional
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:11,487	| IOT070 |	Exercise wearable with
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:16,863	| IOT070 |	Smartwatch functionality so it's literally just lost his new reviews out yet
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:19,167	| IOT070 |	It's 329 99 when it comes out
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:21,727	| IOT070 |	Next month I relieve gas September
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:26,079	| IOT070 |	So just interesting to see somebody else adopt Android where someone you wouldn't expect
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:26,591	| IOT070 |	To do so
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:30,175	| IOT070 |	But it's alright well that's useful shows consolidation
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:33,247	| IOT070 |	Is a little consolidation in this industry
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,527	| IOT070 |	Or maybe
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:40,927	| IOT070 |	All right and we already talked about
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,463	| IOT070 |	That's not funny has discovered
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:46,047	| IOT070 |	New Philips application at the SCC
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:48,863	| IOT070 |	And this one looks like it's for a motion sensor
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:50,911	| IOT070 |	Philips Hue
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:52,191	| IOT070 |	Ecosystem for life
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:53,727	| IOT070 |	And
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,007	| IOT070 |	This is actually
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:58,079	| IOT070 |	Really useful we talked about kind of Lights
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:01,151	| IOT070 |	Have motion sensors inside on the podcast so there's
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:01,919	| IOT070 |	Stock lights
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:06,527	| IOT070 |	Theater lighting company called comfilytes is also building dead
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,575	| IOT070 |	There's probably a lot more out there
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,367	| IOT070 |	Lights are everywhere
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:16,511	| IOT070 |	Philips Hue ecosystem means that you don't have to like
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:19,071	| IOT070 |	Do some sort of weird motion detection thing with a
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:19,839	| IOT070 |	Twitch
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,887	| IOT070 |	A lot of people who hate hugs
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:22,399	| IOT070 |	Appreciate
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:29,055	| IOT070 |	I just want multiple hubs and the fact that a hub is in one single spot
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:33,407	| IOT070 |	It's not going to really do anything when I'm not around it from a sensor standpoint so this
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:35,455	| IOT070 |	Looks to be like
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:38,271	| IOT070 |	Queen FCC submission that they found it a zigbee
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:41,087	| IOT070 |	Sensor. 2in Square
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,111	| IOT070 |	It actually sounds like
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:45,183	| IOT070 |	Person with my ecobee sensor which I'm looking at right now my office so
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:50,047	| IOT070 |	Obviously types of the ecobee thermostat keeps my office cool when I'm
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:52,095	| IOT070 |	Not near the ecobee thermostat sale
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:54,399	| IOT070 |	It may I have no idea what the
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,423	| IOT070 |	Inside the Phillips
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:57,471	| IOT070 |	Answer yet but if I were Phillips
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,751	| IOT070 |	I would say you know what
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:05,919	| IOT070 |	If I'm going to sell a standalone motion sensor I'm also going to put a temperature sensor in here I'm also going to put in ambient lights
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,199	| IOT070 |	Just because
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:08,479	| IOT070 |	That helps
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:13,599	| IOT070 |	And you already has a deal with
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,623	| IOT070 |	Yes and
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:17,439	| IOT070 |	These things are going to start working better at system
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:20,767	| IOT070 |	Studies is companies are thinking about Building Systems the system
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:23,327	| IOT070 |	And to do that
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:25,887	| IOT070 |	You're going to have to do some pretty deep integration
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:29,471	| IOT070 |	Especially like
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,239	| IOT070 |	Looks like
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:32,543	| IOT070 |	If this is how my sensor communicate
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:33,311	| IOT070 |	The following
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:36,383	| IOT070 |	Here's experiences intolerances
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:38,943	| IOT070 |	Nest would have to
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:42,527	| IOT070 |	Say OK based on that here's how I would use your sensor data
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:45,343	| IOT070 |	Suggested the temperature in
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:45,855	| IOT070 |	People's house
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:50,207	| IOT070 |	I agree and we don't know obviously what
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:56,607	| IOT070 |	Mary not be inside here at the FCC if anybody looks the FCC documents are not it's all for testing purposes.
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,887	| IOT070 |	You're not going to get the full
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:59,423	| IOT070 |	The full monty on what
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:01,215	| IOT070 |	Idevices capability is
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:01,983	| IOT070 |	But
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:05,055	| IOT070 |	I kind of agree I'd like to see them expand
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:05,823	| IOT070 |	Beyond lighting
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:09,663	| IOT070 |	But honestly I mean if it's just a motion sensor for lights to me and my
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:14,527	| IOT070 |	We can do so much more you know you don't need to put that much more in a little box 2
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:16,063	| IOT070 |	To get much more data
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:17,599	| IOT070 |	Create better Prada
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:20,415	| IOT070 |	Sprite for the long-term to
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:21,695	| IOT070 |	Right
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:24,255	| IOT070 |	I will say Trish one of my
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,535	| IOT070 |	This is super nerdy
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,583	| IOT070 |	Pictures of fun music
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:32,703	| IOT070 |	Cuz it's the most actually did because it got their medical grade wearables right and then they got their lighting stuff
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:34,239	| IOT070 |	Ski Safari parts list
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:36,031	| IOT070 |	People talking to each other
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:38,335	| IOT070 |	How awesome would it be
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,871	| IOT070 |	If you're trying to track your heart rate
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,663	| IOT070 |	If your lights

EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:52,927	| IOT070 |	You had a heart attack but there are all kinds of like
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:55,743	| IOT070 |	Fun things you can do or even highly utilitarian thing
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,535	| IOT070 |	You know I would love her
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,327	| IOT070 |	My heart rate tracker
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:14:59,839	| IOT070 |	Not be
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,143	| IOT070 |	I would love for HP
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,935	| IOT070 |	Tell me a little bit more Ambien
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:08,031	| IOT070 |	Yeah I mean that's that's a perfect example of mean if you're doing
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:11,615	| IOT070 |	Riding a recumbent bike in your basement or something you got your lights on
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,639	| IOT070 |	You can look at your
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:17,503	| IOT070 |	Smartwatch perhaps and see what zone you're in a heart rate but what if you could have the
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:22,367	| IOT070 |	The information go to the lights and then maybe they turn orange when your

EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:27,743	| IOT070 |	You have to look anywhere else it's just

EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:30,815	| IOT070 |	Yes
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:32,607	| IOT070 |	Also I would like party mode if I
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,911	| IOT070 |	On my scale
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:38,495	| IOT070 |	Full House was like yeah
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:40,799	| IOT070 |	Eat Mexican tonight just so we can have party mode again
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:44,383	| IOT070 |	So
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:48,479	| IOT070 |	You bring all these things into your life though and you've got to think about

EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,295	| IOT070 |	And we got cheese
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,319	| IOT070 |	Security stories this week
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:56,927	| IOT070 |	We're going to have a lot of it next week because this week is blackhat Defcon
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:59,999	| IOT070 |	And the iron is Hot Topic there
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,279	| IOT070 |	There are a lot
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:04,863	| IOT070 |	Companies and I think they said
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,959	| IOT070 |	50 companies
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:10,751	| IOT070 |	50 groups trying to hack
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,799	| IOT070 |	Iot devices
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,335	| IOT070 |	13 were accepted
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:17,151	| IOT070 |	Last year we had to hack
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:22,783	| IOT070 |	Jeep Cherokee I remember how they stopped in traffic
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:26,367	| IOT070 |	Is a big to-do I think it was wired that might have
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,903	| IOT070 |	Got in the car and
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:30,975	| IOT070 |	Patent like stall out or stop on the highway I remember
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:32,255	| IOT070 |	Yes
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,023	| IOT070 |	DPAC
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:34,559	| IOT070 |	And they're going to try to
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:35,583	| IOT070 |	Happy
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:37,631	| IOT070 |	Cheap end tables
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,935	| IOT070 |	And they want to do it
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:44,799	| IOT070 |	Apparently the last time they did it they told me stop the brakes on the car
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:46,591	| IOT070 |	Moving slower than 5 miles an hour
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:49,151	| IOT070 |	They're going to try to make a car go faster
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:49,663	| IOT070 |	Cancel
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:54,527	| IOT070 |	Really I do not want to be okay
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,039	| IOT070 |	No
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:57,087	| IOT070 |	I'm hoping there's a sun Trevor
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:58,111	| IOT070 |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:01,183	| IOT070 |	There's a lot of money involved with this too I know that the
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:05,535	| IOT070 |	Defense Advanced research projects agency at the Pentagon
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:09,887	| IOT070 |	According to journal they're sponsoring a three-hour all machine hacking tournament
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:13,727	| IOT070 |	The winning team Pockets a 2 million-dollar prize
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:18,079	| IOT070 |	Yeah well it makes sense
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:19,103	| IOT070 |	Yeah you really do
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:26,783	| IOT070 |	I'm playing original Atari 2600 games on a Raspberry Pi I should be hacking stuff instead
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,295	| IOT070 |	There you go
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:28,575	| IOT070 |	We can arrange for that
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:30,623	| IOT070 |	I will say that
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,671	| IOT070 |	Poor people who are great
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:36,511	| IOT070 |	There are best practices out there that company should be following
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:40,351	| IOT070 |	Please do not always follow them as in last week
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:42,911	| IOT070 |	I saw that people's Wi-Fi passwords
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,447	| IOT070 |	In plain text
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:44,959	| IOT070 |	Witches
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,239	| IOT070 |	Just
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,031	| IOT070 |	Like me opening my front door in
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:51,871	| IOT070 |	How do you know if MacBook Air is just right by the entryway
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,151	| IOT070 |	Come on
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:54,943	| IOT070 |	If you see it come take it
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:56,479	| IOT070 |	2
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:57,759	| IOT070 |	That
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:17:59,295	| IOT070 |	Not a good thing
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:17:59,807	| IOT070 |	But
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:01,855	| IOT070 |	Most of the Hawks year
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,135	| IOT070 |	Probably pretty
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,207	| IOT070 |	Vulnerability
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:08,511	| IOT070 |	The things that should be passed but
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:11,327	| IOT070 |	Hopefully most of them won't be as egregious
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,095	| IOT070 |	Things like that
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:14,399	| IOT070 |	That's the plan
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:16,959	| IOT070 |	And if you are worried
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:19,519	| IOT070 |	You should note that Georgia Tech just had a 9
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:21,055	| IOT070 |	Quick $4000000 krant
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:22,847	| IOT070 |	To study
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,639	| IOT070 |	How to monitor winsome
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:25,663	| IOT070 |	Compromised
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:26,687	| IOT070 |	The internet
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,735	| IOT070 |	They're actually
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:33,343	| IOT070 |	The research is based on the electromagnetic signals
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:34,879	| IOT070 |	Any device
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,927	| IOT070 |	Getting license when it's processing
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:39,231	| IOT070 |	What happens if they use machine learning
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:42,815	| IOT070 |	Check and see when something kind of goes out of whack
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:44,351	| IOT070 |	And if they
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:44,863	| IOT070 |	See that
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:47,679	| IOT070 |	Then they're like big investigate further to
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,447	| IOT070 |	Siesta devices
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:52,799	| IOT070 |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:53,567	| IOT070 |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:57,151	| IOT070 |	It's also interesting to me that that 9.4 million Grant guess where that came from
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,431	| IOT070 |	Chaka
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,735	| IOT070 |	DARPA
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:02,271	| IOT070 |	Clearly the government
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,551	| IOT070 |	The US government is
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:07,391	| IOT070 |	Trying to learn as much as possible in any way shape or form
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,159	| IOT070 |	About
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:09,951	| IOT070 |	Cyber-security hacking and so on
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:12,255	| IOT070 |	I think it's rather smarter than 2
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:17,375	| IOT070 |	Kind of put money out there for public and private companies and such to do so
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,399	| IOT070 |	There's a lot they can learn
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:19,679	| IOT070 |	By doing that
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,215	| IOT070 |	Yes
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:22,495	| IOT070 |	And we
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,007	| IOT070 |	Really
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:26,079	| IOT070 |	Really need this because we are connecting
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,359	| IOT070 |	So many things
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:27,871	| IOT070 |	And
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:30,687	| IOT070 |	It's stunning to me how much
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:37,087	| IOT070 |	I guess ambient information we're just about it everything that we're connecting gets off and how much
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:38,879	| IOT070 |	Now that we have a compute power you can in
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:41,951	| IOT070 |	Positively and negatively
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:45,023	| IOT070 |	Yay DARPA
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:45,791	| IOT070 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:46,815	| IOT070 |	Less broad topic
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,351	| IOT070 |	We can talk about
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:49,887	| IOT070 |	Water
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,655	| IOT070 |	Wonder
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,191	| IOT070 |	So I
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:53,215	| IOT070 |	Was sent
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:58,591	| IOT070 |	A Brita water pitcher something I haven't had since I last looked an apartment after college
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:02,687	| IOT070 |	But the cool thing about this one is it is part of the Amazon Dash
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,711	| IOT070 |	Metservice
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,503	| IOT070 |	And so
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:08,319	| IOT070 |	Basically it's got a wide side shift in the lid
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:08,831	| IOT070 |	And
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:11,647	| IOT070 |	I'm betting it's got an ultrasonic sensor in there too
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:13,183	| IOT070 |	Check water bottles and
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,231	| IOT070 |	At the end of
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:17,279	| IOT070 |	The useful Life Of The Brita filter
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:20,095	| IOT070 |	Another one is just going to automatically show up on my doorstep
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:23,935	| IOT070 |	I'll text the Amazon automatic
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:29,055	| IOT070 |	It's a kind of like that - built-in there's no button it just monitors
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:30,335	| IOT070 |	When that
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:32,895	| IOT070 |	Filter needs replacing I just ordered it for you
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,919	| IOT070 |	Info
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:38,271	| IOT070 |	I'm not at home right now so I can't split the plan is over the next week I'm going to
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,319	| IOT070 |	Basically water my plants
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,879	| IOT070 |	40 gallons of water just to see
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:45,439	| IOT070 |	Like how this process is I can tell you so far
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:47,999	| IOT070 |	There's two things that are worth noting
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:50,559	| IOT070 |	When this picture has a design
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:52,863	| IOT070 |	In that
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:59,007	| IOT070 |	It has a max fill line so you have to fill it every time to a certain level and you can't go about that level for it to cool
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:00,543	| IOT070 |	Against
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:02,079	| IOT070 |	I guess the gallons
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,199	| IOT070 |	Send a picture
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:08,991	| IOT070 |	So that line
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:11,295	| IOT070 |	Is black-on-black in the
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:13,343	| IOT070 |	Glossy finish in it
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:14,111	| IOT070 |	Artist
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,184	| IOT070 |	My first notice
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:17,952	| IOT070 |	Like I bake that easier
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:18,976	| IOT070 |	Import
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,024	| IOT070 |	Accuracy of the device
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:22,816	| IOT070 |	Menchu
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:29,984	| IOT070 |	This is a lot of fun this could be really fun to do and setting it up with a
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:31,008	| IOT070 |	We can freeze
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,800	| IOT070 |	You basically go through
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,568	| IOT070 |	You
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:35,104	| IOT070 |	Login for the picture which made
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:37,920	| IOT070 |	Really another app
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:38,944	| IOT070 |	I can't
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,992	| IOT070 |	But then it
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:41,760	| IOT070 |	You login
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:45,856	| IOT070 |	Automatically says do you want to connect it to your Amazon account
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:48,160	| IOT070 |	You log into your Amazon account
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:51,232	| IOT070 |	Amazon lets you choose what they replaced
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:52,256	| IOT070 |	Option is
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:54,048	| IOT070 |	There were multiple options in my case
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,328	| IOT070 |	And I chose
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:57,376	| IOT070 |	And then
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:22:01,216	| IOT070 |	I got an email from Amazon
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:02,496	| IOT070 |	And I'm done
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:05,312	| IOT070 |	Until I can't wait to see you like
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:07,360	| IOT070 |	Will this work but I actually liked
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:08,384	| IOT070 |	The fact that I could choose
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:10,688	| IOT070 |	Is that all the dash options that you chew
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,224	| IOT070 |	And then
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:14,272	| IOT070 |	I didn't like having another account
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:22,720	| IOT070 |	An Amazon process was super easy I mean I love with him that I was going through Amazon for anything because
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,232	| IOT070 |	It's just like
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:24,768	| IOT070 |	If we have everything
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:26,048	| IOT070 |	Just answer your
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,864	| IOT070 |	They do make that easy
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:33,472	| IOT070 |	You from a technical perspective I'm just actually looking at the system requirement says curious if you have to
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:35,776	| IOT070 |	Charge this thing I suspect. I suspect there's a
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:40,896	| IOT070 |	A battery inside a battery inside so it looks like a traditional
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:43,456	| IOT070 |	Filter if you flip up the lid up a picture
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:48,064	| IOT070 |	You'll see probably a 2 by 1 and a half inch square box
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:48,576	| IOT070 |	Underneath
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:52,928	| IOT070 |	And that box is where I'm assuming the Wi-Fi connection is
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,976	| IOT070 |	Ultrasonic sensor and
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:57,280	| IOT070 |	I'm assuming there's an ultrasonic sound
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:23:02,656	| IOT070 |	Sure I don't know
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,424	| IOT070 |	When you
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:04,192	| IOT070 |	Delta picture
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:07,776	| IOT070 |	So in the Wi-Fi cuz I was concerned about battery life
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:11,360	| IOT070 |	In my fridge so the wife I've actually always
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:14,176	| IOT070 |	It's going through basically a faraday cage
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,456	| IOT070 |	Can be hard on
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:16,224	| IOT070 |	Battery life
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:21,088	| IOT070 |	So
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:23,136	| IOT070 |	Monitoring but I don't know
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:28,512	| IOT070 |	Yeah I don't I don't think it'll be a problem and I'll tell you why because I look at the system requirements it
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:29,792	| IOT070 |	Says that you
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:36,192	| IOT070 |	Should activate the picture near the sink that you're refilling the picture and that your Wi-Fi router should not be more than 25 feet from
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,472	| IOT070 |	The saint that you're referring to picture
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:40,800	| IOT070 |	So I suspect it's only sending information
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:41,568	| IOT070 |	When it's
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:42,336	| IOT070 |	Being refilled
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:45,408	| IOT070 |	Yes
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,688	| IOT070 |	Yeah so it's not in the fridge
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:53,344	| IOT070 |	It certainly doesn't have a high-end Wi-Fi Radio based on the Range and they say it only works a 2.4 gigahertz network switch
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:56,416	| IOT070 |	I've been around for a long time so
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:58,208	| IOT070 |	So yeah I know I don't think it'll be a problem in your fridge
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:01,792	| IOT070 |	Did it say how much it is
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:04,352	| IOT070 |	$44.99
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,656	| IOT070 |	Time tracking heaven
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:08,192	| IOT070 |	How many gallons in putting through this thing
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:10,752	| IOT070 |	And we'll see if it's accurate and
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:13,056	| IOT070 |	CVS Pharmacy
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:14,080	| IOT070 |	My Brita replacement filter
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,128	| IOT070 |	I'll let you guys
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:19,968	| IOT070 |	And
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:24,576	| IOT070 |	I think we're probably good for this week while you think
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:28,672	| IOT070 |	Yeah we have our guest this week is oats Baldwin to his to see if plum
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:31,744	| IOT070 |	Club Mix de wifi-connected light pad
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:33,792	| IOT070 |	Everyone is always asking
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:37,376	| IOT070 |	About this one does have Janine konshens it also has multi-touch on it
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:39,168	| IOT070 |	Is a Touch tablet
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:42,240	| IOT070 |	And you can actually you don't do one finger tooth
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:44,032	| IOT070 |	All kinds of touches on it
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:45,312	| IOT070 |	Very fancy
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:47,616	| IOT070 |	Chokes we're talkin about
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:49,408	| IOT070 |	That

EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:29,504	| IOT070 |	Love
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:35,136	| IOT070 |	Andre Stacey thanks so much for having me
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:38,464	| IOT070 |	Super excited just a little note for everyone listening
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:41,024	| IOT070 |	I am recording this from Seattle
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:46,656	| IOT070 |	Make the sound of rain
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:50,752	| IOT070 |	Why don't you give us a little bit of your background
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:51,776	| IOT070 |	Because I think this is really important
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,568	| IOT070 |	Yeah that's
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:55,872	| IOT070 |	Connected home and
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:57,664	| IOT070 |	Electronic is really in my blood
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:00,480	| IOT070 |	I've been in the industry since it started
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:03,040	| IOT070 |	I called in a nice homes pulling wire when I was
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:03,552	| IOT070 |	School
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,344	| IOT070 |	Latest equipment racks
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:07,904	| IOT070 |	Call products into homes
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:09,952	| IOT070 |	Ultimately I owned and operated a
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:13,024	| IOT070 |	Systems integration business for about 15 years
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:15,072	| IOT070 |	I also served as the
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:17,632	| IOT070 |	The chairman and chief executive officer craspedia
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:22,752	| IOT070 |	Those who don't know that acronym it's a custom electronic design installation Association
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:27,872	| IOT070 |	It's the global trade organization that has represented the Connect Four
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,920	| IOT070 |	Over 27 years now
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:36,064	| IOT070 |	So why do people think that internet of things is in its infancy but I would argue it's more of a
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:39,136	| IOT070 |	Very awkward adolescent phase because there's so much change happen
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:43,744	| IOT070 |	This is great because your perspective
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:48,864	| IOT070 |	It's something that I feel like we miss a lot in the show because we focus a lot on the DIY
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:50,912	| IOT070 |	Solutions
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,448	| IOT070 |	The pro installers in their life
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:53,984	| IOT070 |	Stacy
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:57,056	| IOT070 |	Why aren't you talking about
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:00,128	| IOT070 |	And you know I've always been
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:01,152	| IOT070 |	Of the opinion that
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:04,224	| IOT070 |	That is a completely different business and its
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:06,016	| IOT070 |	It's reserved for kind of the upper echelon
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:10,624	| IOT070 |	You guys have designed the plum light switch this has been a song
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:12,672	| IOT070 |	We first talked about it
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:13,440	| IOT070 |	2013
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:19,840	| IOT070 |	As you guys were working on this perspective
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:22,400	| IOT070 |	Industry
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:26,496	| IOT070 |	The title of our story is the thrill and Agony of Hardware startups
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:29,056	| IOT070 |	With my background of a connected home
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:34,688	| IOT070 |	Obviously this I didn't have just an epiphany one night and a light bulb went off
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:35,712	| IOT070 |	In my head
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:36,736	| IOT070 |	Pardon the pun
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,808	| IOT070 |	After stepping on a Lego right my move into this
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:41,856	| IOT070 |	Venture was a bit more calculated
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:44,416	| IOT070 |	When I was running the Trade Organization
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,952	| IOT070 |	High commission several studies
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:48,512	| IOT070 |	To determine the size and scope of the
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:51,840	| IOT070 |	We'll call it the Legacy Market write professionally installed
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:54,400	| IOT070 |	Consumer electronic systems into
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,424	| IOT070 |	Three large estate homes
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:59,776	| IOT070 |	2013 numbers 14 billion dollar industry
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:03,104	| IOT070 |	As you mentioned it's for the upper echelon music
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:04,128	| IOT070 |	People living in very large
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:10,016	| IOT070 |	Is the third most popular sub system
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:11,808	| IOT070 |	In the connected home
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:15,904	| IOT070 |	Industry today behind your putting in a home theater media system
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:17,952	| IOT070 |	Or Distributing music for your home
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:22,048	| IOT070 |	And it has far greater utility than any other subsystem in your home
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:23,072	| IOT070 |	If you think about
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:28,704	| IOT070 |	How you interact at home the light switches be most used device write in a busy household
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:31,776	| IOT070 |	What interacts with it dozens if not hundreds of times a day
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:34,080	| IOT070 |	You have to really haven't been much
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,104	| IOT070 |	Innovation there
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:37,152	| IOT070 |	So our goal was to
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:38,176	| IOT070 |	Deliver all of the
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,968	| IOT070 |	Features and benefits of a
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:40,736	| IOT070 |	Traditional
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:43,040	| IOT070 |	System
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:44,320	| IOT070 |	Without all of them
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:44,832	| IOT070 |	Hardware
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:51,744	| IOT070 |	Without the complexity and obviously at a much lower cost and we looked at the current landscape of paw
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:55,328	| IOT070 |	Products that are out there and there are a couple of Cenote connected
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:57,376	| IOT070 |	Or smart light switches and dimmers
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:30:00,192	| IOT070 |	There are a couple that are Wi-Fi
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:02,496	| IOT070 |	And of course they are smart light bulbs
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:07,360	| IOT070 |	And we've made the determination we believe that the intelligence belongs in the light switch
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:09,152	| IOT070 |	We wanted the relationship
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:10,688	| IOT070 |	Between the consumer
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:12,736	| IOT070 |	And a device that was
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:13,504	| IOT070 |	Familiar
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:16,576	| IOT070 |	Which is the switch in the second dearly
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:17,856	| IOT070 |	T-Mobile app
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,136	| IOT070 |	We believe strongly that
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,672	| IOT070 |	You walk in and out of your kitchen
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:23,232	| IOT070 |	But you don't want to pull out your smartphone to turn on your lights
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,768	| IOT070 |	We focused on the switch
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:25,792	| IOT070 |	And we spent
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:27,072	| IOT070 |	Couple of years in development
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:29,888	| IOT070 |	Built our beta product got it out to
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:30,400	| IOT070 |	Select
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:33,472	| IOT070 |	An audience and tested for a good nine months
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:35,008	| IOT070 |	Learn from that
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:36,544	| IOT070 |	And we made
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:39,360	| IOT070 |	The decision to make some pretty key changes
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:42,688	| IOT070 |	So before we go on to the sad Saga of manufacture
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,736	| IOT070 |	I'd love to actually get your
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:45,760	| IOT070 |	Your perspective as a
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:48,320	| IOT070 |	Professional installer because
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:50,624	| IOT070 |	Minecraft
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:52,672	| IOT070 |	Morso insteon actually
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:57,280	| IOT070 |	In Savannah especially are coming kind of will call it down Market
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:59,328	| IOT070 |	So I'm curious how you view
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:03,168	| IOT070 |	They're kind of transition and do you think they can
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:04,704	| IOT070 |	Orchid
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:07,008	| IOT070 |	Work with all these other systems
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:10,848	| IOT070 |	I do and I actually think it's very good for the industry but
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:12,640	| IOT070 |	Companies like
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:14,176	| IOT070 |	Savant
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:15,968	| IOT070 |	Lutron
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:17,248	| IOT070 |	They proved
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:18,528	| IOT070 |	Years ago.
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:21,088	| IOT070 |	The city of channel was a great channel for them
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:22,368	| IOT070 |	Vet
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:24,416	| IOT070 |	And test products and iterate
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:25,440	| IOT070 |	Before they went
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:26,464	| IOT070 |	Mainstream
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:28,768	| IOT070 |	Companies like Savannah now releasing
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:29,536	| IOT070 |	Ngannou
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:31,584	| IOT070 |	Remote control or Lutron
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:32,352	| IOT070 |	Bridge
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:35,680	| IOT070 |	Are not only helping the Legacy marketing
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,216	| IOT070 |	Panthera Market
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:39,264	| IOT070 |	Opportunity Market
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:42,848	| IOT070 |	But they also have a great deal of experience
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:44,896	| IOT070 |	And what works and what doesn't
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:46,176	| IOT070 |	So they're approached
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:46,944	| IOT070 |	2
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:47,968	| IOT070 |	Reliability
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:50,272	| IOT070 |	And user experience
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:51,040	| IOT070 |	AR
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:51,808	| IOT070 |	Improving
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:53,344	| IOT070 |	And these products
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:55,392	| IOT070 |	I believe will do very well
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:57,440	| IOT070 |	A transition to
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:32:00,512	| IOT070 |	I want to see cross the chasm but start to reach a broader audience
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,048	| IOT070 |	And help
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:03,584	| IOT070 |	Startups
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:05,888	| IOT070 |	Innovate on some of those Concepts and ideas
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:12,800	| IOT070 |	And what would your advice be professional installers
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:15,104	| IOT070 |	Sounds like 2 hours a week
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:16,896	| IOT070 |	Impossible for me
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:23,552	| IOT070 |	Should they look to installing kind of some of these more established
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:26,880	| IOT070 |	I have no idea I don't know what to tell people when they're like I just needed to
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:28,160	| IOT070 |	Works
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:30,720	| IOT070 |	Yeah I think so the market is obviously second
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:35,584	| IOT070 |	There's going to be a group of consumers you and I and other technology enthused
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:36,352	| IOT070 |	Stat
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:40,960	| IOT070 |	Love the idea of bleeding edge technology we are more patient and tolerant
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:44,032	| IOT070 |	Soggy things because we want to try them
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:48,640	| IOT070 |	And we are also more patient is as it relates to
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:51,968	| IOT070 |	Interoperability challenges or or limitations
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:54,528	| IOT070 |	There's another group of consumers
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:55,296	| IOT070 |	That
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:59,904	| IOT070 |	Have a certain amount of disposable income in might not be living in largest state home
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:00,672	| IOT070 |	But they are
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:01,952	| IOT070 |	Subject
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:04,512	| IOT070 |	To some of these new technologies right desserts
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:07,840	| IOT070 |	Consumers who purchase the nest thermostat or Sonos
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:08,864	| IOT070 |	Better now
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:11,680	| IOT070 |	Being exposed to a company like ours
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:12,448	| IOT070 |	Plum
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:13,984	| IOT070 |	And interested in these types of
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:15,776	| IOT070 |	New technologies
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:17,824	| IOT070 |	But there are still limitations
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:18,848	| IOT070 |	In this new
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:20,384	| IOT070 |	Era of
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:21,152	| IOT070 |	Connected home
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:23,712	| IOT070 |	Flash iot products in
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:25,248	| IOT070 |	As a release interoperability
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:28,832	| IOT070 |	Right there is not a killer app that controls everything buried
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:29,600	| IOT070 |	Very well
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:31,648	| IOT070 |	Interoperability
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:34,464	| IOT070 |	Is one of the the key challenges to
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:36,000	| IOT070 |	The connected home internet of Things
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:37,280	| IOT070 |	Moving forward
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:42,144	| IOT070 |	Rent-A-Center type of customer or those that are living in
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:45,216	| IOT070 |	Large estate homes they are typically being driven
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:46,752	| IOT070 |	To making
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:47,776	| IOT070 |	Purchases
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:49,824	| IOT070 |	Related to Connected home and consumer products
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:55,456	| IOT070 |	Through an influencer a building professional like the architect or designer or Builder
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:56,480	| IOT070 |	Those are the ones that
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:34:01,600	| IOT070 |	95% of the time are being introduced to a systems integrator
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:04,416	| IOT070 |	Who handles everything from the design
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:08,256	| IOT070 |	The schematics the engineering the project management
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:11,072	| IOT070 |	And integrating to all of these other subsystems
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:12,864	| IOT070 |	A very large and
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:13,376	| IOT070 |	Sophisticated
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:16,448	| IOT070 |	I will be the first to admit that
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:20,544	| IOT070 |	If a homeowner is looking to integrate everything in their home
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:23,104	| IOT070 |	The most reliable
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:26,944	| IOT070 |	Way to get it done right to get a fully automated home today
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:28,736	| IOT070 |	I would still leave
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:29,248	| IOT070 |	Towards
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:33,600	| IOT070 |	A professional installer with a proven track record
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:34,880	| IOT070 |	That
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:39,232	| IOT070 |	Can deliver a full solution across-the-board otherwise there will be
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:41,536	| IOT070 |	Some limitations
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:44,608	| IOT070 |	14 points along the way in trying to
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:45,632	| IOT070 |	Piece together
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,400	| IOT070 |	A lot of disparity
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,448	| IOT070 |	No
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:49,728	| IOT070 |	The day is coming
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:51,008	| IOT070 |	Back pain point
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:51,776	| IOT070 |	Will disappear
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:53,824	| IOT070 |	Right week we know that the big players
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:55,872	| IOT070 |	Google Amazon Apple
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:57,408	| IOT070 |	Are all
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:34:58,176	| IOT070 |	Buying
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:34:58,944	| IOT070 |	So that position
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:01,248	| IOT070 |	Right and we will get to a point where
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:03,296	| IOT070 |	Devices will operate
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:05,088	| IOT070 |	Seamlessly in an ecosystem
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:07,648	| IOT070 |	And provisioning interoperability
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:09,440	| IOT070 |	Discussions will be a thing of
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:11,232	| IOT070 |	How far away
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:18,656	| IOT070 |	A question I don't think we're that far off honestly I think that within the next
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:19,680	| IOT070 |	5
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:23,776	| IOT070 |	The 10 years there will be much more ubiquity among
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:25,824	| IOT070 |	Connected devices and interoperability
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:27,616	| IOT070 |	I don't think it'll be
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:28,384	| IOT070 |	Completely liquid
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:31,456	| IOT070 |	Will certainly make a huge enrolled in the in the neck
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:40,672	| IOT070 |	So let's talk about you guys because
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:42,464	| IOT070 |	Speaking of an eternity
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:44,512	| IOT070 |	Actually
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:45,792	| IOT070 |	Released it
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:52,448	| IOT070 |	So you
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:54,752	| IOT070 |	That is completely different products
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:55,776	| IOT070 |	You definitely
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:36:01,152	| IOT070 |	Tell us your story
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,944	| IOT070 |	Maybe hopefully
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,712	| IOT070 |	Store
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:10,112	| IOT070 |	Companies in also a lot of company. Out there without getting it the first time
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:10,880	| IOT070 |	Industry so
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:12,416	| IOT070 |	Let's talk about what you guys did
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:13,952	| IOT070 |	You're right you know
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:16,000	| IOT070 |	Minimum viable product
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:17,280	| IOT070 |	Works fine with soft
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:20,864	| IOT070 |	White with mobile apps you can get the product out of dust you can't
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,656	| IOT070 |	Launch
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:23,680	| IOT070 |	A consumer
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:25,216	| IOT070 |	Product is a minimum
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:28,544	| IOT070 |	But you can't retract your Hardware in and start over
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,568	| IOT070 |	Just doesn't work
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:30,336	| IOT070 |	Aplomb
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:31,872	| IOT070 |	From day one
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:35,200	| IOT070 |	We were driven every business decision every design decision
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:36,480	| IOT070 |	Was
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:38,784	| IOT070 |	Prioritized based on user experience
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:41,600	| IOT070 |	The time I spent in the industry
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:47,488	| IOT070 |	Designing systems and integrating things and and developing new user interfaces on touch screen
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:51,840	| IOT070 |	I obviously learned a great deal about how consumers want and
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:52,352	| IOT070 |	Expecting rain
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:54,400	| IOT070 |	And not only
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:57,472	| IOT070 |	You know that the guy riding the checkbook to his
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:58,240	| IOT070 |	His wife
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:00,544	| IOT070 |	Teenage kids to visiting mother-in-law
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:01,568	| IOT070 |	And everybody who interact
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:02,592	| IOT070 |	These Technologies
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:07,456	| IOT070 |	Unfortunately the Legacy Market I would say is a bit guilty of
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:08,736	| IOT070 |	Chord
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:09,760	| IOT070 |	User experience
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:12,576	| IOT070 |	An older touch panels are
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:14,880	| IOT070 |	They look like Star Trek in their cluttered
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:18,464	| IOT070 |	I'm a big believer in less is more in than keeping it very simple
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:20,000	| IOT070 |	And so
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:21,792	| IOT070 |	When we decided to
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:23,072	| IOT070 |	Go through this endeavor
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:26,400	| IOT070 |	Are we really looked at the feature sets that were important
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:28,192	| IOT070 |	Particula Lounge
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:30,752	| IOT070 |	User experience like provisioning right making
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:34,080	| IOT070 |	The setup as easy as sending or receiving a text message
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:38,432	| IOT070 |	The look and feel of a technology in the mobile app we didn't want it
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:40,224	| IOT070 |	Present technology we wanted to
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:42,272	| IOT070 |	Something that everybody in the household
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:46,880	| IOT070 |	And we put together our team and begin to engineer this thing and
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:49,440	| IOT070 |	When the first units came in we were quite
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:51,232	| IOT070 |	Thrilled they were working
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:53,024	| IOT070 |	We started shipping amount
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:53,536	| IOT070 |	The field
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:55,072	| IOT070 |	But we
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:55,840	| IOT070 |	Quickly
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:57,120	| IOT070 |	Realize that
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:59,168	| IOT070 |	You know there were things that were not ready
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:01,216	| IOT070 |	And we could have chosen
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:01,728	| IOT070 |	2
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:05,056	| IOT070 |	Send our beta unit through agency
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:06,080	| IOT070 |	I getting a CCN
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:07,616	| IOT070 |	Safety test
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:08,896	| IOT070 |	Start shipping products
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:11,456	| IOT070 |	But we made a business decision
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:12,992	| IOT070 |	To postpone it
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:14,016	| IOT070 |	Little Things
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:18,112	| IOT070 |	Like the glow ring we have an LED glow ring that wraps around
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:18,880	| IOT070 |	The button
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:19,904	| IOT070 |	But the court touchpad
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:21,440	| IOT070 |	And the glow wasn't
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:25,024	| IOT070 |	Particular
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:27,072	| IOT070 |	But we knew
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:28,096	| IOT070 |	Status
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:30,400	| IOT070 |	How you do anything is how you do everything
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:30,912	| IOT070 |	And
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:33,984	| IOT070 |	We may changes to both of our boards
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:37,824	| IOT070 |	I mean bored and our power board we may change it to every single mechanical piece
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:39,360	| IOT070 |	How to that redesign
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:44,480	| IOT070 |	So when you say when you're made a few minor changes that's very kind of you we did
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:48,320	| IOT070 |	Essentially scrap that beta unit and start it over
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:50,624	| IOT070 |	But we knew that that was the right decision to make
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:52,160	| IOT070 |	So what was the
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:56,768	| IOT070 |	And then what was the effect on the company itself
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:57,792	| IOT070 |	Because it's not like
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:58,816	| IOT070 |	That's an expense
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:38:59,584	| IOT070 |	The proposition that you
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:01,376	| IOT070 |	Right
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:06,496	| IOT070 |	Did have a pretty significant impact on our timeline
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:07,008	| IOT070 |	And I believe
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:08,800	| IOT070 |	You covered us
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:12,896	| IOT070 |	When we won demo 7 Santa Clara and the fall of 2012
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,688	| IOT070 |	And had died
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:17,760	| IOT070 |	Touch base with us over the years as we went through development
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:23,392	| IOT070 |	And we are if not to one of the I think Z
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:24,672	| IOT070 |	Most delayed
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:25,952	| IOT070 |	Technology
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:28,512	| IOT070 |	Gadget Kickstarter project that's not something
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:29,280	| IOT070 |	Products
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:30,048	| IOT070 |	But
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:32,352	| IOT070 |	In hindsight we're very glad
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:35,424	| IOT070 |	That's the path we chose because the product that we've now delivered
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:40,288	| IOT070 |	As your business
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:44,128	| IOT070 |	So you you were stars
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:46,432	| IOT070 |	Because you
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:47,712	| IOT070 |	Starter
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:48,992	| IOT070 |	Without actually having
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:50,784	| IOT070 |	Physical product designer even on
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:53,088	| IOT070 |	Which I was like wow
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:55,392	| IOT070 |	Crazy no one would do that
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:57,696	| IOT070 |	So your Kickstarter ended when
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:40:00,256	| IOT070 |	April of 2013
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:01,024	| IOT070 |	Okay
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:02,560	| IOT070 |	Your first
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:09,472	| IOT070 |	It was signed in 2014. The summer of 2014
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:13,312	| IOT070 |	And then you pulled that back and now you shipped
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:14,592	| IOT070 |	People really seem to love
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:19,712	| IOT070 |	That's why we started shipping in December
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:21,248	| IOT070 |	So you know from
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:23,040	| IOT070 |	April 2013
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:26,624	| IOT070 |	To December of 2015
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:29,696	| IOT070 |	Was you know the challenges of a hardware startup
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:31,232	| IOT070 |	It's fascinating
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:33,792	| IOT070 |	Ear with the innovation
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:39,168	| IOT070 |	10 things like a development board Arduino and Raspberry Pi and beaglebone
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:40,960	| IOT070 |	3D printing technology
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:43,008	| IOT070 |	A startup is able to
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:45,312	| IOT070 |	Develop a proof-of-concept very quickly
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:49,920	| IOT070 |	Great Hardware startups and
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:51,200	| IOT070 |	Innovation in general
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:54,272	| IOT070 |	But there has been no major disruption in
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:56,832	| IOT070 |	Getting a product from a Prototype 2
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:57,856	| IOT070 |	Production it still takes
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:41:00,160	| IOT070 |	Years of time and millions of dollars
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:02,976	| IOT070 |	Which is why many Hardware startups
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:06,048	| IOT070 |	Or simply fall short of meeting
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:08,352	| IOT070 |	The expectation of user experience
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:10,400	| IOT070 |	So we're fortunate enough
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:14,240	| IOT070 |	You would mention that we didn't have a product or a designer on staff and it's
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:15,776	| IOT070 |	That is hardly true we did have
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:19,872	| IOT070 |	Are we did have a prototype when we launched our Kickstarter we hired a
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:22,688	| IOT070 |	A major odm based out of Taiwan
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:24,736	| IOT070 |	How to spell Tino
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:25,504	| IOT070 |	Millions
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:28,576	| IOT070 |	Electronics
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:31,648	| IOT070 |	And we had to invest start on dollars
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:34,720	| IOT070 |	About 30 prototype
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:35,744	| IOT070 |	But they were
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:36,768	| IOT070 |	Ugly Betty
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:41,120	| IOT070 |	And we originally thought that we would
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:43,424	| IOT070 |	Can you to engage with an odm and
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:49,568	| IOT070 |	Is a contract manufacturer that can handle all of the design
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:51,360	| IOT070 |	Are you product as well
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:53,663	| IOT070 |	And we thought we would remain very lean
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:55,711	| IOT070 |	Start-up organization
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:57,503	| IOT070 |	Outsource the engineering
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:58,783	| IOT070 |	Ana Manufacturing
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:41:59,551	| IOT070 |	And
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:00,831	| IOT070 |	Really manage
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:02,111	| IOT070 |	The design process
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:05,951	| IOT070 |	But that didn't work out
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:06,719	| IOT070 |	The way we planned
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:10,559	| IOT070 |	We have two separate or sever ties with that odm and that's when
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:12,607	| IOT070 |	We decided to begin raising
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:14,143	| IOT070 |	Investment dollars
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:16,191	| IOT070 |	Building our own engineering team
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:18,495	| IOT070 |	And the rest is history we started
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:19,775	| IOT070 |	Disability chronic in house
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:26,175	| IOT070 |	And contracted with the in-home very reputable contract manufacturer to to build a production version
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:28,735	| IOT070 |	Okay so you spent all this time develop
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:29,503	| IOT070 |	Penis product in
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:32,063	| IOT070 |	I'd love to hear
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:33,599	| IOT070 |	What you guys decided on because
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:37,951	| IOT070 |	You switched out the boards and this was all about providing more intelligence
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:39,487	| IOT070 |	In the home
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:41,791	| IOT070 |	And distribute around the home so it's
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:42,815	| IOT070 |	What kind of talked about
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:44,863	| IOT070 |	But you guys did there and
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:47,167	| IOT070 |	A little bit
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:51,519	| IOT070 |	We really started taking a look at the potential not only
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:52,031	| IOT070 |	Score
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:55,871	| IOT070 |	Penetrating the Home Depot Radcliffe reading Home Depot
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:56,639	| IOT070 |	Are we really
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:58,687	| IOT070 |	We really took a deep look at archived
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:01,759	| IOT070 |	And we made the decision to
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:03,551	| IOT070 |	Increase the processing power
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:05,343	| IOT070 |	Essentially each one of these light pads
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:08,159	| IOT070 |	Is a computer write its running at 400
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:08,927	| IOT070 |	Megahertz
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:09,951	| IOT070 |	Ar9
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:14,303	| IOT070 |	I in the firmware we chose is only called her Lane
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:16,351	| IOT070 |	Which is a distributed
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:21,727	| IOT070 |	System even though the light pad looks and acts like a dimmer what we really created us to
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:23,263	| IOT070 |	First distributed
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:25,055	| IOT070 |	Computing cluster in the space
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:27,615	| IOT070 |	Everyone iPad is
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:30,943	| IOT070 |	Contextually and situationally aware of every other light pad
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:32,479	| IOT070 |	Not to mention
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:35,551	| IOT070 |	Any other it enable device in the home
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,855	| IOT070 |	And they're sharing processing power
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:39,903	| IOT070 |	Everything is propagated
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:41,695	| IOT070 |	Down to every single device
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:44,767	| IOT070 |	Which opens up a world of opportunities
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:46,815	| IOT070 |	Wrong Turn 4
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:48,607	| IOT070 |	The connected home and Internet of Things
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:50,399	| IOT070 |	No question
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:54,239	| IOT070 |	Serrapeptase and contacts for people early MS
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:56,543	| IOT070 |	Distributed computing language that runs in
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:58,847	| IOT070 |	Data centers its is kind of
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:00,127	| IOT070 |	Very popular for
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:02,175	| IOT070 |	For what we think of his cloud
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:04,735	| IOT070 |	Picture so that bringing this into the home is just
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:08,575	| IOT070 |	I was kind of stunned to discover that so can you talk about
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:09,855	| IOT070 |	Why
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:12,671	| IOT070 |	You want to make every basically all of these like
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:15,487	| IOT070 |	A node in a distributed system
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:20,095	| IOT070 |	Yeah there was something not too long ago
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:20,863	| IOT070 |	About
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:23,935	| IOT070 |	The internet of things and critically the connected home
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:25,215	| IOT070 |	But it is not
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:26,495	| IOT070 |	Platform but an
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:28,799	| IOT070 |	And I couldn't agree with you more
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:30,079	| IOT070 |	Most experts in the
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:31,103	| IOT070 |	Field of iot
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:33,151	| IOT070 |	Truly believe that
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:37,759	| IOT070 |	Solution to iot asmongold fog computing
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:40,575	| IOT070 |	Which is especially when I getting more computer power
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:41,343	| IOT070 |	To the edge
EDL	00:44:42,367	00:44:44,159	| IOT070 |	With the number of devices
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:45,951	| IOT070 |	We believe we'll see in the home
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:48,255	| IOT070 |	Moving to a distributor
EDL	00:44:48,255	00:44:49,023	| IOT070 |	System
EDL	00:44:49,023	00:44:50,047	| IOT070 |	I believe sets
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:51,583	| IOT070 |	Stage 4 that Ubiquiti
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:52,607	| IOT070 |	But we all hope for
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:54,399	| IOT070 |	Meaning that there's
EDL	00:44:55,935	00:44:57,727	| IOT070 |	There was more analytics happen
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:44:58,495	| IOT070 |	Coming at the edge
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:03,871	| IOT070 |	We sedated so to speak having to go up to servers because more can happen
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:05,151	| IOT070 |	Locally
EDL	00:45:05,151	00:45:05,919	| IOT070 |	Another benefit is
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:08,223	| IOT070 |	Less dependency on the cloud
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:11,551	| IOT070 |	If you lose your internet connection with Apple iPad
EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:12,319	| IOT070 |	It's still function
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:14,367	| IOT070 |	Still control all of your lights
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:16,159	| IOT070 |	Over your local
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:17,183	| IOT070 |	Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:18,207	| IOT070 |	We are
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:20,767	| IOT070 |	Currently working on messaging are Bluetooth radio
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:24,095	| IOT070 |	Before you know redundant radio mechanism as well beyond
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:24,863	| IOT070 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:45:24,863	00:45:26,911	| IOT070 |	A host of
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:29,727	| IOT070 |	Advantages that moving to a distributed system
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:32,543	| IOT070 |	Will provide including supporting
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:33,823	| IOT070 |	Other Technologies
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:36,127	| IOT070 |	Because any company can
EDL	00:45:36,639	00:45:37,919	| IOT070 |	Run an application
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:39,455	| IOT070 |	Across our secure
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:42,271	| IOT070 |	Distributed Network in the home
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:45,087	| IOT070 |	Okay so let's talk about that let's say I make
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:51,231	| IOT070 |	Emotions
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:54,303	| IOT070 |	Sensor to work in conjunction
EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:55,327	| IOT070 |	With your
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:56,095	| IOT070 |	Light pad
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:58,143	| IOT070 |	How would that work
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:45:59,423	| IOT070 |	In the future
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:03,519	| IOT070 |	Your computer's what
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:06,079	| IOT070 |	I mean we're talkin Bill Cloud to Cloud integration
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:11,199	| IOT070 |	Walking through that ability is directly
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:12,223	| IOT070 |	Device to device
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:14,015	| IOT070 |	Rather than cloud-to-cloud or device
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:14,783	| IOT070 |	Cloud etcetera
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:17,087	| IOT070 |	A manufacturer of emotion
EDL	00:46:17,087	00:46:20,159	| IOT070 |	Sensor or a moisture sensor
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:21,439	| IOT070 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:24,255	| IOT070 |	Wouldn't necessarily have to create
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:27,327	| IOT070 |	Club on Gateway
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:28,351	| IOT070 |	They literally
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:30,399	| IOT070 |	Write an application that can
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:31,167	| IOT070 |	Run across our Network
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:33,727	| IOT070 |	And that provides them
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:35,519	| IOT070 |	The gateway to take
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:38,335	| IOT070 |	Garage sale
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:39,103	| IOT070 |	Locally
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:39,871	| IOT070 |	I would provide them
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:43,455	| IOT070 |	Autonomy or removing the dependency on
EDL	00:46:43,967	00:46:44,479	| IOT070 |	Cloud
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:45,759	| IOT070 |	I wish
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:46,783	| IOT070 |	Ultimately increases
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:50,111	| IOT070 |	The value to the user not user experience at
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:51,903	| IOT070 |	How much more
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:53,695	| IOT070 |	Security and privacy
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:57,535	| IOT070 |	Host of advantages to working in Arkansas
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:01,631	| IOT070 |	Distributed
EDL	00:47:01,631	00:47:03,423	| IOT070 |	And isolation from the cloud
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:04,447	| IOT070 |	Will when I say
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:05,983	| IOT070 |	If it's a hybrid right
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:09,567	| IOT070 |	Cloud and distributed systems I believe will will work
EDL	00:47:09,567	00:47:10,335	| IOT070 |	Together
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:11,615	| IOT070 |	To provide the most
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:13,151	| IOT070 |	Most value and
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:15,199	| IOT070 |	The highest degree of security and privacy
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:16,735	| IOT070 |	Okay so instead of
EDL	00:47:18,015	00:47:23,135	| IOT070 |	Worldview instead of doing an API
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:24,415	| IOT070 |	This
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:25,951	| IOT070 |	Instead is I'm building
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:26,463	| IOT070 |	A full-on
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:29,279	| IOT070 |	Does a lightweight up
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:30,815	| IOT070 |	No API needed you just
EDL	00:47:30,815	00:47:31,839	| IOT070 |	Loaded across our
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:34,655	| IOT070 |	Secure system and you're off and running
EDL	00:47:35,935	00:47:39,007	| IOT070 |	Really a viable proposition for a lot of these companies
EDL	00:47:39,519	00:47:41,055	| IOT070 |	What we're going to need to see is
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:43,359	| IOT070 |	Plum lightpads out there
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:46,943	| IOT070 |	What's your strategy for Conquering the world
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:47,967	| IOT070 |	Getting these
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:49,503	| IOT070 |	If you can go to sleep.
EDL	00:47:50,271	00:47:54,111	| IOT070 |	Bullet is about cobbossee critical mass but it doesn't just have to be
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:54,623	| IOT070 |	I like that
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:55,903	| IOT070 |	It's about the art
EDL	00:47:56,927	00:47:59,487	| IOT070 |	And this can be applied to any technology
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:47:59,999	| IOT070 |	Any device
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:01,535	| IOT070 |	It's really taking
EDL	00:48:02,047	00:48:02,815	| IOT070 |	A
EDL	00:48:02,815	00:48:04,095	| IOT070 |	New approach
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:04,863	| IOT070 |	2
EDL	00:48:04,863	00:48:06,143	| IOT070 |	The Internet of Things in the connected home
EDL	00:48:06,911	00:48:08,191	| IOT070 |	Far too long
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:10,239	| IOT070 |	The industry has been focused on
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:11,775	| IOT070 |	Central controller
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:13,311	| IOT070 |	Or hub
EDL	00:48:13,311	00:48:15,359	| IOT070 |	And we simply believe that
EDL	00:48:15,359	00:48:17,663	| IOT070 |	Bill Hobbs our solution for today's
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:19,199	| IOT070 |	Problem
EDL	00:48:19,199	00:48:19,711	| IOT070 |	And not
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:21,503	| IOT070 |	Forward-thinking
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:22,015	| IOT070 |	Enough
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:25,855	| IOT070 |	Every device in the home will eventually have the type of
EDL	00:48:25,855	00:48:27,135	| IOT070 |	Q Power
EDL	00:48:27,135	00:48:28,415	| IOT070 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:31,231	| IOT070 |	They will all simply be mashed
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:33,279	| IOT070 |	Together we are simply
EDL	00:48:33,279	00:48:34,047	| IOT070 |	First
EDL	00:48:34,559	00:48:35,839	| IOT070 |	To prove that that's possible
EDL	00:48:35,839	00:48:37,631	| IOT070 |	Wright real machine-to-machine communication
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:40,959	| IOT070 |	It's what we set out to prove and that's exactly what we're doing
EDL	00:48:41,471	00:48:43,775	| IOT070 |	And would you license is it
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:45,567	| IOT070 |	NOS I'm trying to think about like
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:46,847	| IOT070 |	Getting
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:51,711	| IOT070 |	It's one thing to be like hey this is an architectural we like it's another to get paid
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:52,735	| IOT070 |	People to adopt
EDL	00:48:52,735	00:48:53,247	| IOT070 |	Your version
EDL	00:48:54,271	00:48:54,783	| IOT070 |	Overall Market
EDL	00:48:55,807	00:48:57,343	| IOT070 |	It's certainly a possibility
EDL	00:48:57,343	00:49:00,159	| IOT070 |	We just started shipping 6 months ago 7 months ago
EDL	00:49:00,159	00:49:02,207	| IOT070 |	Our first priority is
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:03,999	| IOT070 |	To demonstrate that
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:07,327	| IOT070 |	That the feature-set and the user experience that we
EDL	00:49:07,839	00:49:09,887	| IOT070 |	I believe consumers
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:10,399	| IOT070 |	I would
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:11,423	| IOT070 |	Appreciate
EDL	00:49:11,935	00:49:13,727	| IOT070 |	He tried so hard
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:15,519	| IOT070 |	The game critical mass over the course of the next
EDL	00:49:16,287	00:49:17,567	| IOT070 |	12-24 months
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:19,103	| IOT070 |	And allow us
EDL	00:49:19,103	00:49:19,871	| IOT070 |	Learn
EDL	00:49:20,383	00:49:21,151	| IOT070 |	I'm not
EDL	00:49:21,151	00:49:24,479	| IOT070 |	Our device has a host of sensors in it and
EDL	00:49:24,991	00:49:30,367	| IOT070 |	We can begin doing some behavioral modeling and have a better understanding of their
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:32,671	| IOT070 |	Ihome's Network or
EDL	00:49:32,671	00:49:33,695	| IOT070 |	How they interact
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:34,463	| IOT070 |	Device
EDL	00:49:34,463	00:49:35,743	| IOT070 |	And we can make business
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:37,791	| IOT070 |	Decisions based off of what we learn
EDL	00:49:37,791	00:49:39,583	| IOT070 |	Dorado AR device but
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:40,607	| IOT070 |	Partnerships with
EDL	00:49:40,607	00:49:42,911	| IOT070 |	Third party companies that we are integrated with
EDL	00:49:43,935	00:49:45,471	| IOT070 |	Awesome
EDL	00:49:45,983	00:49:47,775	| IOT070 |	I'm very eager to
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:53,407	| IOT070 |	Try this out but also see how this distributed architecture works in the real world because you're right A lot of people seem to be
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:50:00,319	| IOT070 |	I'm trying to get to that direction which as a user I'm like yes please
EDL	00:50:00,319	00:50:00,831	| IOT070 |	To like
EDL	00:50:01,343	00:50:02,879	| IOT070 |	I guess have my lights rely on The Intern
