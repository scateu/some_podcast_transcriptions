EDL	00:00:28,160	00:00:30,720	| IOT014 |	I took a trip to Marriott Hotels to see what the
EDL	00:00:30,720	00:00:32,768	| IOT014 |	The hotel room of the future is going to look like
EDL	00:00:32,768	00:00:34,048	| IOT014 |	It will be talking about

EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:55,296	| IOT014 |	It's like
EDL	00:00:55,296	00:00:58,368	| IOT014 |	It's like it's last week all over again because our first topic is
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:00:59,904	| IOT014 |	Going to be Amazon
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:03,232	| IOT014 |	Yeah yeah I'm going to rub it in that I don't have an echo
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:05,536	| IOT014 |	See I didn't even know
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:06,304	| IOT014 |	Bring that up
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:08,864	| IOT014 |	You must be doing some serious angst because it's like
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:10,912	| IOT014 |	I'm going to make a bold proposition
EDL	00:01:11,424	00:01:13,216	| IOT014 |	This week amatar actually was last week
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:15,264	| IOT014 |	Amazon open.
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:17,056	| IOT014 |	It's voice SDK
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:19,104	| IOT014 |	And the kind of
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:20,384	| IOT014 |	Research and development in
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:21,152	| IOT014 |	Building
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:26,528	| IOT014 |	Voice recognition into the Echo and then it also opened up easy integration
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:27,808	| IOT014 |	To the echo for
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:28,320	| IOT014 |	Developers
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:31,648	| IOT014 |	Does a cherry on top of that Sunday
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:33,440	| IOT014 |	Created a hundred billion dollar fund
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:38,816	| IOT014 |	Support Alexa which is are startups using Alexa which is the AI brains
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:39,584	| IOT014 |	Can you find
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:40,096	| IOT014 |	The echo
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:43,936	| IOT014 |	Because makes
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:44,960	| IOT014 |	The echo
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:46,240	| IOT014 |	Actually better
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:49,568	| IOT014 |	Right now I think Amazon just outmaneuvered Apple
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,336	| IOT014 |	When it comes to the smart
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:54,432	| IOT014 |	You know what you told me that before the show and I sort of
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:58,784	| IOT014 |	Said I get your point but I'm not sure I agree but then you raise some really
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:02,624	| IOT014 |	Good points about people's recent experiences with Siri voice
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,648	| IOT014 |	Activation and
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:07,232	| IOT014 |	At home cat that just really haven't been up to par yet and
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:09,280	| IOT014 |	I think was
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:11,584	| IOT014 |	Frank Frank Fowler over at 2
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:12,352	| IOT014 |	He was returned
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:16,448	| IOT014 |	Yeah he was talking last week about how hung kittens
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:18,240	| IOT014 |	Siri together Air Canada
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,776	| IOT014 |	Just not all there
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:20,800	| IOT014 |	Just not all that
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:21,568	| IOT014 |	And
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:24,640	| IOT014 |	You got me thinking you might be right maybe Amazon has
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:26,688	| IOT014 |	Slowly but surely
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:28,480	| IOT014 |	Position himself really well
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:30,272	| IOT014 |	For the smart home with Echo
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,832	| IOT014 |	Here's my take on this and here's why I'm saying
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,856	| IOT014 |	Because I'm
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:36,160	| IOT014 |	I'm not I'm the furthest thing probably from an Apple fan
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:37,184	| IOT014 |	Fanboy out
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:39,744	| IOT014 |	I do respect
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:40,512	| IOT014 |	Stead
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:43,072	| IOT014 |	You know it has done an amazing job bringing
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:46,400	| IOT014 |	Really difficult technology to users and make it really simple
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:47,168	| IOT014 |	So
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,448	| IOT014 |	I was really hoping that
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:49,728	| IOT014 |	They would get there
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:52,032	| IOT014 |	I was really looking forward to
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,872	| IOT014 |	The issue with the smart home so far there's a couple
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:56,640	| IOT014 |	It's expensive
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,200	| IOT014 |	But it's also hard to
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:03,808	| IOT014 |	Get out of use each other you could put in one device
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:04,576	| IOT014 |	Two devices
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:07,904	| IOT014 |	That's hard
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,184	| IOT014 |	I mean that's what we spend
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,464	| IOT014 |	You know hours talking about of the show
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:17,376	| IOT014 |	What's going to happen to your and it's both like an integration standard issue but it's also a UI issue
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,912	| IOT014 |	Because you may be happy with
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:22,752	| IOT014 |	Carrying your phone around all day but I am most assuredly not
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:26,848	| IOT014 |	Before the show
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:28,896	| IOT014 |	Activate to wake up my nest
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:32,480	| IOT014 |	That was one problem but the same problem was
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:35,040	| IOT014 |	Physically left my desk
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:35,808	| IOT014 |	To do it
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:39,392	| IOT014 |	Because my phone was sitting next to me but it couldn't load the app faster
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,416	| IOT014 |	Then I could get up and
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,000	| IOT014 |	Which really is terrible
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,792	| IOT014 |	Slamming it that's got to be fixed
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,072	| IOT014 |	That is terrible
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:48,096	| IOT014 |	Maybe I'll reboot my phone
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,168	| IOT014 |	When you think about things like that
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:55,264	| IOT014 |	It's really just sucky to be a consumer right now this invoice
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,312	| IOT014 |	Is a wonderful way
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,872	| IOT014 |	For lazy people like me to stay in the chair
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,920	| IOT014 |	It's also a bit faster
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:03,968	| IOT014 |	To be like
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:04,736	| IOT014 |	Hey Alexa
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,528	| IOT014 |	Turn my Nest back on
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,088	| IOT014 |	All I need to do
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:12,160	| IOT014 |	And so what episode is done with Alexa
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:15,232	| IOT014 |	And then by opening it up it's created a platform
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,768	| IOT014 |	Where the standards don't matter
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,047	| IOT014 |	Because everything's going to go through
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:19,839	| IOT014 |	And
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:24,191	| IOT014 |	You control it all the invoice which is really intuitive and if you want you can
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,239	| IOT014 |	Get up off your butt and go
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:28,031	| IOT014 |	Musically or you can do it from
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,591	| IOT014 |	Eddie number of the apps on your phone but you don't
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:33,663	| IOT014 |	What the other biggie here is that
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:37,759	| IOT014 |	One device can be used by multiple people in the same house
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,039	| IOT014 |	To control whatever needs to be
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,855	| IOT014 |	So it's not like you have six
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:45,439	| IOT014 |	Smartphones everybody's got their own app and everything from nasty or whatever it may be
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:47,231	| IOT014 |	If you have one
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:49,023	| IOT014 |	Interface that you share
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,303	| IOT014 |	In this case voice
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:52,607	| IOT014 |	I mean that's that take a lot of complexity out of things
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,911	| IOT014 |	That's a brilliant point
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:58,495	| IOT014 |	I'm glad you that's why I'm that's why I'm here thank you
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:00,543	| IOT014 |	I'm so glad that I don't pay you to come
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,103	| IOT014 |	So
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:08,991	| IOT014 |	I talked to startups that are working with Amazon in the Echo Or Nah funded by Amazon
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:11,551	| IOT014 |	We're building these things
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:13,855	| IOT014 |	And we're going to see products coming out
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:16,671	| IOT014 |	Before the end of this year probably within you know a month or two
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:18,719	| IOT014 |	Discount alarm
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,487	| IOT014 |	Is one of them
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,255	| IOT014 |	What's a DIY
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:22,559	| IOT014 |	The orange chef
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:23,583	| IOT014 |	Which makes
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:28,447	| IOT014 |	Wait we actually talked about it makes a connected kitchen scale and it also makes a device called countertop
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:31,007	| IOT014 |	That you're going to be able to buy
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:31,775	| IOT014 |	I think next year
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:33,823	| IOT014 |	Waze off but
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:37,151	| IOT014 |	It's next to your Vitamix blender and some other things
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:38,431	| IOT014 |	Till like
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:42,783	| IOT014 |	Basically give you recipes and recommendations tied to like your job own app
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,319	| IOT014 |	So tied to your activity
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:47,647	| IOT014 |	What you have in your house and gives you recommendations I want to
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,951	| IOT014 |	Some other
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:52,255	| IOT014 |	Groups that are kind of interesting
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:54,815	| IOT014 |	AR
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:58,911	| IOT014 |	Dragon Innovation which is a company that works with a lot of startups
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,471	| IOT014 |	The CEO of Dragonair
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:02,495	| IOT014 |	Innovation
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:05,055	| IOT014 |	Scott Miller he's one of the
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,335	| IOT014 |	Founders of iRobot
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:14,527	| IOT014 |	I didn't even realize this at first but he was telling me one of the best things about what Amazon is done
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,295	| IOT014 |	Here's opened up
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,599	| IOT014 |	The physical Hardware the R&D day
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,903	| IOT014 |	Kind of created around building
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:23,743	| IOT014 |	The Echo and made it such a good voice recognition device
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:24,511	| IOT014 |	Cuz
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:28,607	| IOT014 |	I don't know if you guys remember but I've tried a lot of voice recognition devices in
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,631	| IOT014 |	Most of them aren't any good
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:35,519	| IOT014 |	So he's like hey of startups have access to this you can imagine you know somebody building a Roomba
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,543	| IOT014 |	That you can talk to
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,335	| IOT014 |	Heck yeah
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:38,847	| IOT014 |	I want that
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:43,967	| IOT014 |	It just doesn't listen
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,759	| IOT014 |	So again I think
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:48,831	| IOT014 |	I think this could be amazing I have no idea if like
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:50,367	| IOT014 |	What if you could get home kit India
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:51,647	| IOT014 |	I doubt it
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:54,719	| IOT014 |	Because I don't think so
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:57,535	| IOT014 |	But I'm excited
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,815	| IOT014 |	So that's that's the thought there
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,887	| IOT014 |	Yeah I think there's lots to be excited about and
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:06,239	| IOT014 |	And again I did not buy the echo because I didn't want to buy something for
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:09,823	| IOT014 |	Potential I saw the potential in it but back in November as like
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:11,103	| IOT014 |	Just doesn't do enough for me
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:17,247	| IOT014 |	And then they have the best DK come out in February and then we had if this then that support added a whole bunch of other things
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:20,319	| IOT014 |	As we talked about the WeMo support Phillips
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:22,879	| IOT014 |	Hue light bulb support now
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:27,487	| IOT014 |	And now they've got this Alexa skills kit which is really the SDK for for Alexa
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:28,511	| IOT014 |	And
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:32,095	| IOT014 |	Aside from the smart home aspect even on a mobile perspective
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:36,703	| IOT014 |	There's potential here in terms of apps I had read the Intuit StubHub
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:40,031	| IOT014 |	AOL and Citrix are already using the Alexa skills kit
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,567	| IOT014 |	I don't know what for but
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,103	| IOT014 |	This is to embed
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,407	| IOT014 |	Voice recognition I Summa to apps and services
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:47,455	| IOT014 |	Yes I can tell you what Citrix is
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,735	| IOT014 |	4 days
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:50,783	| IOT014 |	They bought a company called octo blue back in
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:52,575	| IOT014 |	December of last year
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:55,903	| IOT014 |	And they are actually enabling it so it will work with
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,439	| IOT014 |	Aqua blue is a
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,463	| IOT014 |	Code
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,255	| IOT014 |	See how do I describe October
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:04,095	| IOT014 |	It is cold that connects devices
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:06,399	| IOT014 |	Two other devices and devices to web service
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,959	| IOT014 |	So it's not it's like an if this then that
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:09,471	| IOT014 |	But it's actually
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,519	| IOT014 |	Code it's not
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,567	| IOT014 |	It's not a simple for the everyday user to use
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:16,127	| IOT014 |	But it's amazing it is it is very flexible
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,943	| IOT014 |	So they're using it to
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:21,759	| IOT014 |	Basically you tell Alexa you can say
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:23,807	| IOT014 |	Alexa allow octoblu
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,343	| IOT014 |	To check my calendar
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:26,879	| IOT014 |	In
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:28,927	| IOT014 |	And then it'll check your calendar for the day
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,463	| IOT014 |	It'll give you all that
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:34,303	| IOT014 |	So basically it opens up more services Enterprise
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,071	| IOT014 |	Glass services
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:35,839	| IOT014 |	Actually
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,863	| IOT014 |	Makes sense
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,143	| IOT014 |	But
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:42,239	| IOT014 |	They're also doing something with wit AI which is a startup that does
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,775	| IOT014 |	Speech recognition
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:47,871	| IOT014 |	And artificial intelligence around speech like getting
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,919	| IOT014 |	Computers to generate their own speech that
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:50,431	| IOT014 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,991	| IOT014 |	So they're actually
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:56,063	| IOT014 |	Running stuff that they tell the echo
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:58,879	| IOT014 |	And then the Echoes response back through with AI
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:03,487	| IOT014 |	In the idea there is to teach the echo via October
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:04,511	| IOT014 |	This is America
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,839	| IOT014 |	How to respond to better
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:09,375	| IOT014 |	How to better respond to Natural length
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:13,215	| IOT014 |	Cut that's all very far
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:16,543	| IOT014 |	Far-fetched but it's actually really exciting stuff I'm very excited in
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:17,567	| IOT014 |	I don't know
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:23,455	| IOT014 |	People who listen to The Show for a long time are going to remember that actually talk to Chris Matthews who is the founder
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:27,039	| IOT014 |	Who was the founder of October Lou way back in the day about what he was doing
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:29,343	| IOT014 |	It's really very flexible and very
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:34,719	| IOT014 |	Well I am looking forward to seeing this all develop and I said earlier I
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:36,511	| IOT014 |	Will probably buy the echo now inside
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:38,559	| IOT014 |	I put in a request
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:41,375	| IOT014 |	To get it and I had complained on on are the same
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:43,423	| IOT014 |	Well I blew it cuz now it's $149
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,447	| IOT014 |	The 99
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:47,263	| IOT014 |	Well once it came out for everybody
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:52,383	| IOT014 |	That request just got ignored and now it's 179 so I really missed out
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,919	| IOT014 |	The remote I didn't realize this
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,455	| IOT014 |	That's extra
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:59,295	| IOT014 |	Yeah and I I use the remote but it is a little iffy so if your house is really big
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:06,207	| IOT014 |	Cuz it's blue should be I don't think I even want the remote I think I'd rather have multiple echos because I don't
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:09,535	| IOT014 |	When I carry something else around or have something in every room
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:14,911	| IOT014 |	That makes sense if you get multiple echos because I'm very curious I've actually thought about it
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:16,703	| IOT014 |	Multiple echos on
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,007	| IOT014 |	Amazon
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:23,103	| IOT014 |	Does anything I hope so if any of our readers have multiple echoes
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:24,895	| IOT014 |	Let us know
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:28,223	| IOT014 |	Curious how it works together affect if it actually does
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:34,111	| IOT014 |	Yeah cuz like I know they don't have like a party load like Sonos does for all of your speakers to play the same songs at once
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,647	| IOT014 |	That's the only thing I know
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:37,183	| IOT014 |	So I know nothing Beyond
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:44,095	| IOT014 |	I think if there is there not working towards multiple echoes in a house I hope they do soon because I think it's going to be required for
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:45,119	| IOT014 |	Many many people
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:47,423	| IOT014 |	I agree there is there plenty of times
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,215	| IOT014 |	Dang it I whip
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,007	| IOT014 |	I wish I had an echo in the bathroom
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:51,519	| IOT014 |	I know that's over
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:57,919	| IOT014 |	But you know I owe you could instantly or you know order toilet paper when you're out
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:04,063	| IOT014 |	There is be ordering things like a lot of the stuff that you need to order is in the bath
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:07,391	| IOT014 |	They have to dash with the Oil of Olay products I'm all on that
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:09,951	| IOT014 |	Also you know you listen to music in the shower
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,231	| IOT014 |	You can
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,279	| IOT014 |	Add things to your shopping list
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:15,071	| IOT014 |	Think of a lot of good ideas in the shower I could
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:18,655	| IOT014 |	I actually used to have a shower crayon that I would write them on the walls with
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,471	| IOT014 |	Add this to my to do list
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:22,751	| IOT014 |	There's a lot of
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:29,407	| IOT014 |	I tell you I could see it now Sunday paper in the bathroom shopping at the same time no yeah
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,687	| IOT014 |	Cook
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:36,319	| IOT014 |	The bathroom
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:37,855	| IOT014 |	We're going to talk about a toothbrush
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:38,879	| IOT014 |	Oh goodie
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:42,975	| IOT014 |	Looks like one of the great segue there so we hadn't connected
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:45,535	| IOT014 |	Toothbrush company based out of Columbus Ohio
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:48,095	| IOT014 |	It's called Bean Technologies
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:50,911	| IOT014 |	Lesbianism Beam not being
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,191	| IOT014 |	And
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:52,703	| IOT014 |	What they
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,495	| IOT014 |	We may have talked about
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:58,591	| IOT014 |	Before for 2 years they sold a connected toothbrush that basically says
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,639	| IOT014 |	Is it's a toothbrush with Bluetooth
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,175	| IOT014 |	It's got an app the app is like
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,455	| IOT014 |	Hey you brush for 2
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,735	| IOT014 |	Minutes today good on you
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:10,111	| IOT014 |	Basically talk to the CEO Alex premiere
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:17,023	| IOT014 |	That was just a trojan horse to build an insurance company that can offer cheaper rates because they have access to more.
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:18,559	| IOT014 |	Data about how you brush
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,839	| IOT014 |	And because they
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:20,607	| IOT014 |	Build a lot of stuff
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:23,167	| IOT014 |	I'm more modern software infrastructure
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:24,703	| IOT014 |	You're so boring the cost by hosting stuff
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:26,495	| IOT014 |	So
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:27,519	| IOT014 |	That
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,543	| IOT014 |	Is pretty awesome
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:32,383	| IOT014 |	Yeah so I guess you would get discounted insurance rates
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:35,199	| IOT014 |	If you had their toothbrush and provided them information and so on so forth
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:40,575	| IOT014 |	You sign up for the dental insurance in he's basically promising that it's
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:42,623	| IOT014 |	It it's actually offered
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:43,903	| IOT014 |	So it's not offered
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:49,279	| IOT014 |	A company would sign up in the rates to offer the dental insurance
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,351	| IOT014 |	10 to 25% cheaper
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,143	| IOT014 |	And
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:54,911	| IOT014 |	In addition
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:57,983	| IOT014 |	They're changing the model a little bit by sending out
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:00,031	| IOT014 |	Every quarter a tuba toothpaste
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:03,615	| IOT014 |	Dental floss and a replacement brush head so they provide that for
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,151	| IOT014 |	Gotcha
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:07,455	| IOT014 |	And the idea is if they're doing that
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:09,503	| IOT014 |	And they're encouraging youth
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,551	| IOT014 |	Through gamification to brush
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,855	| IOT014 |	And then I see that you're visiting the dentist
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:14,623	| IOT014 |	They pay for the
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,903	| IOT014 |	Preventive stuff anyway
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:20,767	| IOT014 |	Should a pretty good sense of
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:23,071	| IOT014 |	That you're probably being healthy and
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:26,911	| IOT014 |	We're going to ask you little things throughout you know on the app you can ask
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,679	| IOT014 |	Ask you questions like
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:29,983	| IOT014 |	Hey
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,263	| IOT014 |	Sensitive teeth
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:33,823	| IOT014 |	And if they do we can make recommendations that will help improve
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,359	| IOT014 |	Outcomes for them
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:43,295	| IOT014 |	Can I see the game of vacation here the more you brush the more stars you collect and then you get rewards for different star levels such as
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:47,135	| IOT014 |	Healthy replacement heads or cashback on the plan
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:48,671	| IOT014 |	Yeah actually Our Guest
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:53,023	| IOT014 |	Are cast today later on in the show it was using a beam toothbrush and he said that
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:55,583	| IOT014 |	Keno brushes for 2 minutes just to get more stars
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,607	| IOT014 |	Four stars
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,143	| IOT014 |	All right
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:58,911	| IOT014 |	So
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:02,239	| IOT014 |	Bean is not the only company that's looking at taking kind of
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:05,823	| IOT014 |	The information from the internet of things and connected devices in
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:08,127	| IOT014 |	It helping users
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:09,919	| IOT014 |	Develop better habits will start there
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:12,735	| IOT014 |	Nest as we talked about last week
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:13,759	| IOT014 |	Has a program with
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,551	| IOT014 |	American family
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:16,831	| IOT014 |	Where
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:19,903	| IOT014 |	They give discounts they have a 5% monthly discount
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,439	| IOT014 |	A free Nest protect thermostat
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:23,231	| IOT014 |	Nest protect smoke detector
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:26,303	| IOT014 |	To their customers and
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:29,375	| IOT014 |	I want to get people to make sure there's smoke detectors are
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:31,167	| IOT014 |	Working so short
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:31,935	| IOT014 |	Just encourage them to
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,471	| IOT014 |	Custom once a month
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:35,263	| IOT014 |	Change the batteries when they're done
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:38,847	| IOT014 |	Is idea so it's not punitive it's just purely
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,663	| IOT014 |	I add an additive nice site
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:44,991	| IOT014 |	It's a good thing
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,015	| IOT014 |	So
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:49,599	| IOT014 |	That is what they're doing and then
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:51,135	| IOT014 |	A company called automatic
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:54,463	| IOT014 |	Which is they make an OBD Port so an onboard diagnostics
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:56,511	| IOT014 |	We got it right this time
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,535	| IOT014 |	Yeah I did
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:02,143	| IOT014 |	Yes Dondo that plugs into that port on your car to tell
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:07,263	| IOT014 |	Tell you information like hey driven this many miles are hey this is why your check engine lights on
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:09,055	| IOT014 |	I hate you speed too much knock it off
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:09,823	| IOT014 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:10,335	| IOT014 |	Hey stop speeding
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,871	| IOT014 |	Go easier on the brakes
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:15,711	| IOT014 |	They actually got
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,527	| IOT014 |	Strategic round with a raised 24 million last week and they
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:23,647	| IOT014 |	The investor that led the round was USAA which is an insurance
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,415	| IOT014 |	Company
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:25,951	| IOT014 |	Based in San Antonio Texas
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:31,071	| IOT014 |	And USAA is interested also in kind of building
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,607	| IOT014 |	Smarter and better insurance
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,399	| IOT014 |	Policies for
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:37,215	| IOT014 |	People Based on data from things like that automatic
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:39,263	| IOT014 |	And I think
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:44,383	| IOT014 |	Progressive actually has a little plug-in module like that as well that I don't for a while and I'll give you a discount.
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:46,943	| IOT014 |	You agree to plug that into your car
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:51,295	| IOT014 |	Let that information be you know sifted up to them I don't know what kind of discount you get butt
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:54,111	| IOT014 |	So they do that and they also do it
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:58,207	| IOT014 |	They only do it for six months so they collect the data for six months and then you send them
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:58,975	| IOT014 |	Stuff back
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:01,535	| IOT014 |	I miss how it worked
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:04,607	| IOT014 |	In Progressive is like really they don't want to be in that business
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:06,911	| IOT014 |	The CEO speak one back in
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:08,959	| IOT014 |	He was like you know I would love to get that data
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:10,495	| IOT014 |	Car manufacturers I hate
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:13,311	| IOT014 |	Being in a device business shipping it back
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:13,823	| IOT014 |	The 4th to people
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:19,199	| IOT014 |	Nothing to note though is none of the insurer so far talk about real-time price
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:20,735	| IOT014 |	This is not something there after
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:24,319	| IOT014 |	I should also know that the second generation of the automatic
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:25,087	| IOT014 |	Not the current one
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,391	| IOT014 |	The second generation will have cellular
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:29,439	| IOT014 |	Apparently really big 4
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:32,511	| IOT014 |	Oh yeah that way they don't have to worry about
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:37,631	| IOT014 |	Recipe not to send any device and plug it in and upload data it will just go
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:40,447	| IOT014 |	Set the current automatic WiFi on
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:41,471	| IOT014 |	Next gen
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:42,751	| IOT014 |	Have cellular
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:49,407	| IOT014 |	I think it's a really kind of cool way of using the internet of things to rethink the way people
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,175	| IOT014 |	Business
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,711	| IOT014 |	Especially being I I think that's
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:53,503	| IOT014 |	I have no idea that
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:54,783	| IOT014 |	But I loved
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,855	| IOT014 |	You just want the Stars
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:09,119	| IOT014 |	So last night I visited a Marriott Hotel here in Austin
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,399	| IOT014 |	I saw the future
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,191	| IOT014 |	Really
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:15,007	| IOT014 |	Little little sleep pods like at the Google
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:16,031	| IOT014 |	No knots
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,359	| IOT014 |	Be honest it's a little boring
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,639	| IOT014 |	Because
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:24,735	| IOT014 |	Hotels actually have to pay for all this stuff and they don't see an Roi just yet on a lot of
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:29,087	| IOT014 |	What they do see is
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:31,135	| IOT014 |	Netflix in the rooms on the TVs which I have
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:33,183	| IOT014 |	Canker sore for a while
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:33,951	| IOT014 |	Yay
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,463	| IOT014 |	That's an ounce
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,279	| IOT014 |	They will have
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:42,399	| IOT014 |	Starwood has them already in Mariana's testing Bluetooth door locks that
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:45,727	| IOT014 |	You know you turn that you put your phone up to the door lock and it automatically opens
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,495	| IOT014 |	End
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,519	| IOT014 |	It's like mobile check-in
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,055	| IOT014 |	Yep
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:51,615	| IOT014 |	So you basically you can check into the hotel
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,383	| IOT014 |	From your phone
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:54,943	| IOT014 |	And then you're like you go up to your room
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:57,759	| IOT014 |	About to check in on her to tell you which room is you go up there
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,551	| IOT014 |	And you flasher
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:00,575	| IOT014 |	Phone up there in
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:01,087	| IOT014 |	Inside
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:05,183	| IOT014 |	Yeah I think it's a Starwood you don't even have to go to the
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,463	| IOT014 |	Desk to Check Into Cash
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:09,279	| IOT014 |	Yeah I thought it's all done on the phone and
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:12,607	| IOT014 |	You unlock the room whichever motels between the app and you're done
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,119	| IOT014 |	Starwood's
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,143	| IOT014 |	Was hacked
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:16,447	| IOT014 |	The Marriott people were very
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:16,959	| IOT014 |	Very excite
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:19,775	| IOT014 |	Knowing that
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,543	| IOT014 |	Over it I believe it was
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,103	| IOT014 |	So
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:25,151	| IOT014 |	That's at the other thing and this is
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:29,759	| IOT014 |	This is way far down the road maybe 2016 but they're talking about bringing wireless charging into
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,295	| IOT014 |	Well that's
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:32,831	| IOT014 |	Probably a good
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:37,695	| IOT014 |	Time for it to happen I don't think it's happened yet because they're just been too many competing standards too many groups
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,975	| IOT014 |	But you've had the
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:41,535	| IOT014 |	I'll probably get this wrong but I'll say the wireless
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:43,583	| IOT014 |	Power Consortium and
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:47,935	| IOT014 |	Welchy's the standard and I think the alliance for wireless power a
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:49,215	| IOT014 |	4wp
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:52,031	| IOT014 |	I believe they agreed yeah we can use the
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:54,591	| IOT014 |	The Apache standard Qi it is chi
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:57,919	| IOT014 |	That's really what we need because right now
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:00,735	| IOT014 |	You got multiple standard still so you're not going to embed
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:02,783	| IOT014 |	Spend money in betting these charters in
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:07,135	| IOT014 |	Furniture we're not everybody's phone or tablet's going to work so
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:08,927	| IOT014 |	Getting closer to the standard
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:13,279	| IOT014 |	And I could see in 2016 people financing okay there's enough of us
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:17,119	| IOT014 |	Have a standard here that we can spend the money and offer this to our customers
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,655	| IOT014 |	Exactly in
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,423	| IOT014 |	Marriott is looking at the
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,471	| IOT014 |	Cool
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:22,239	| IOT014 |	Good good good
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:24,799	| IOT014 |	So that was exciting I thought as
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,335	| IOT014 |	Who stays at hotels often
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:29,919	| IOT014 |	Talk about how
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:34,783	| IOT014 |	People consumers will see The Internet of Things First and hotels this kind of makes me wonder about that
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,575	| IOT014 |	Because other than the connected door locks
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:39,903	| IOT014 |	There's no plans there are no plans for like fancy dimming lights
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,463	| IOT014 |	Automated thermostats
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,487	| IOT014 |	Blinds
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:47,071	| IOT014 |	Again return on investment isn't going to be there unless
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:53,471	| IOT014 |	Unless you're the only one doing that and people want that type of experience and eventually everybody will do it and
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:53,983	| IOT014 |	Therefore
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,519	| IOT014 |	It's just Anna
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:57,311	| IOT014 |	You'll be a common thing so
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,591	| IOT014 |	I don't I don't foresee that happening
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:19:59,615	| IOT014 |	So it's not
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:02,431	| IOT014 |	Alright so now it's time
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:03,455	| IOT014 |	Kevin said it
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:06,527	| IOT014 |	5 minutes
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:16,255	| IOT014 |	So
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:19,583	| IOT014 |	We've got whatever returning to I'm returning to the ring
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:24,191	| IOT014 |	Connected jewelry
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:25,727	| IOT014 |	OtterBox
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:31,103	| IOT014 |	I know no I mean I paid about $130 for it but it actually sells for between
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:34,943	| IOT014 |	I believe it's 195 + 260 depending on the stone
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:36,735	| IOT014 |	So
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,807	| IOT014 |	I got mine in December and I loved it
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:44,671	| IOT014 |	It's for those of you guys who don't know what's a ring that's connected to your phone via Bluetooth it's got an LED
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:45,951	| IOT014 |	And it's got a little
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:46,975	| IOT014 |	Kidney stone
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:47,743	| IOT014 |	Install
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:49,279	| IOT014 |	Or under the stone
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:52,351	| IOT014 |	Rather in the LEDs and then it's got to happen
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:52,863	| IOT014 |	Sexy back
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,143	| IOT014 |	I'm so
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,167	| IOT014 |	And there's no screen
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,703	| IOT014 |	It's it's something pretty
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:58,495	| IOT014 |	I was very excited about it B
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:01,311	| IOT014 |	I leave my phone in my bag all the time and I need to know what
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:05,663	| IOT014 |	But before my ringler actually 2 weeks after I got my Wrigley I got a pea
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:07,711	| IOT014 |	And
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:08,991	| IOT014 |	Having used both
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:13,087	| IOT014 |	I've decided that I found myself only using the ringly when
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:17,440	| IOT014 |	I couldn't get away with wearing the watch and most of my day I wear the watch
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:19,744	| IOT014 |	I like getting the screen notifications
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:23,840	| IOT014 |	I will say that the Ringley is nice because it links into things like Slack
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,120	| IOT014 |	Uber
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:25,888	| IOT014 |	That
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:26,656	| IOT014 |	You know I don't
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:28,192	| IOT014 |	I just need to know that someone's painting
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:30,496	| IOT014 |	Me right or you just need a signal you don't need
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,008	| IOT014 |	Data
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:32,288	| IOT014 |	Right so
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:34,592	| IOT014 |	If you wanted to wear both you
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,896	| IOT014 |	But I've actually had
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,688	| IOT014 |	A bit of a challenge
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:41,248	| IOT014 |	With Renly so my first Ringley after
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:43,040	| IOT014 |	The three weeks it just stopped working
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:44,832	| IOT014 |	And
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:47,648	| IOT014 |	I sent it back and they've been very nice about
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:49,440	| IOT014 |	An independent right nice to other
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:50,464	| IOT014 |	It's not like
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:55,328	| IOT014 |	Hell yeah we get that all the time
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:58,912	| IOT014 |	I went out for dinner last night on the iot podcast
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:00,192	| IOT014 |	And I heard your voice
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:02,240	| IOT014 |	No we're not that
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:08,640	| IOT014 |	Date they sent me a new one and they said that it was a it was a one-off Luke that my box
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:10,432	| IOT014 |	Broken
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:11,456	| IOT014 |	So
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:15,808	| IOT014 |	They sent me a new one the new one was the wrong size so
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:17,344	| IOT014 |	I sent that back that was just in Arabic
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:19,648	| IOT014 |	I was in a system is having two sizes
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:20,928	| IOT014 |	Not
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:22,720	| IOT014 |	So I got my third ring
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,256	| IOT014 |	And
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:25,024	| IOT014 |	That one
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:26,304	| IOT014 |	Oh man actually
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:29,632	| IOT014 |	Okay so English
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,192	| IOT014 |	Words for about
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:32,960	| IOT014 |	A couple weeks
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:34,496	| IOT014 |	And then it stopped
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:37,056	| IOT014 |	Same problem as the first
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:41,408	| IOT014 |	Different problem this went this time it wouldn't hold a charge and that was a common problem
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:45,504	| IOT014 |	So are a relatively common problem so we set it back I got a new one
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:46,784	| IOT014 |	Did that one
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,320	| IOT014 |	The Box
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,088	| IOT014 |	Sad
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,368	| IOT014 |	The USB
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,416	| IOT014 |	Micro USB port was
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:53,440	| IOT014 |	Messed up on the box
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:57,024	| IOT014 |	So you can actually plug it in to charge it to the ring work
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,560	| IOT014 |	Boxden
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:00,096	| IOT014 |	In the Box in the ringer actually
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,632	| IOT014 |	Affected
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:02,912	| IOT014 |	Think together
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:03,936	| IOT014 |	Be a serial numbers so they
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,472	| IOT014 |	I couldn't just
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:07,520	| IOT014 |	Sentence using a USB cable
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:11,360	| IOT014 |	What can use a new USB cable but the box is actually the charger
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,640	| IOT014 |	That is actually a
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,408	| IOT014 |	Battery
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:14,688	| IOT014 |	Inside I got you
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:16,480	| IOT014 |	You have to put the ring in the Box.
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:20,832	| IOT014 |	And you can't use a different box because of the serial number tie
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:21,600	| IOT014 |	Because they link
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,112	| IOT014 |	What's the boxes
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:26,208	| IOT014 |	So originally I was like swapping out the ring that I had that
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:26,976	| IOT014 |	Wasn't
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:27,488	| IOT014 |	Broken
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:30,048	| IOT014 |	At one point in time I literally had three boxes
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:32,352	| IOT014 |	And I was just like
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:34,400	| IOT014 |	I can't make them work
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:36,960	| IOT014 |	So I said that back and now
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:37,472	| IOT014 |	I am on
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,056	| IOT014 |	That's at least four
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:41,568	| IOT014 |	That's at least four
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,872	| IOT014 |	Number for
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:44,384	| IOT014 |	And
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:46,432	| IOT014 |	So far it's doing okay
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:47,968	| IOT014 |	So we're going to check back again and
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:49,504	| IOT014 |	Another month because it looks like
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:50,784	| IOT014 |	They had some quality
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:52,576	| IOT014 |	Controller yield issues
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:53,600	| IOT014 |	Epic
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:55,136	| IOT014 |	Which is not uncommon
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,160	| IOT014 |	This is something I bought off of
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:56,672	| IOT014 |	Kickstarter
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:57,952	| IOT014 |	But
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,720	| IOT014 |	A concern that
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:00,256	| IOT014 |	Quality control problems
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:02,048	| IOT014 |	Our problem
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:08,448	| IOT014 |	Very good about sending things back but I also feel like I may have passed it by with like the Apple watch
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:12,544	| IOT014 |	Coming out there's a lot of other things I could do the same thing and more
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,824	| IOT014 |	So and for Less
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:16,640	| IOT014 |	But I mean you can get a pebble for 99 bucks
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,408	| IOT014 |	Half the price
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:20,736	| IOT014 |	Right so that's that's the question is there still
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:22,272	| IOT014 |	A market of women
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:24,064	| IOT014 |	It's mostly women
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:26,880	| IOT014 |	Be interested in a cocktail ring
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:30,720	| IOT014 |	This is connected cuz it is beautiful I get compliments on it from people who have no idea that it's
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:36,352	| IOT014 |	Which is good I mean that's a win in my book if it doesn't work it doesn't really matter
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:41,472	| IOT014 |	So there it there's there's the update on the Ringling
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:43,008	| IOT014 |	And
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:44,544	| IOT014 |	With that I guess we should
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:46,592	| IOT014 |	Call it a day and go straight to Our Guest
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:47,872	| IOT014 |	Sounds good
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:51,968	| IOT014 |	All right so stay tuned everyone because our guess is Darren samuelsohn
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:58,112	| IOT014 |	He is a senior policy reporter at Politico and he's got talk to us about what Washington thinks about the Internet of Things

EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:24,480	| IOT014 |	Washington he's just a guy in Washington who happened to write
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:28,832	| IOT014 |	Most of a really big package from Politico
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:29,856	| IOT014 |	On how
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:32,416	| IOT014 |	Washington DC weather
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:34,208	| IOT014 |	Explaining the internet of things to watch
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,792	| IOT014 |	DC highly recommend it to all of you guys if your
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:38,560	| IOT014 |	Sitting there going
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:41,120	| IOT014 |	What are legislators reading about
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:41,888	| IOT014 |	What's the Internet of Things
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,936	| IOT014 |	So good job Darren
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:46,240	| IOT014 |	Let's get started by
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:52,128	| IOT014 |	So let's get started with a sense of
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:56,736	| IOT014 |	What did you know about the internet of things when you started the reporting for this
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:57,760	| IOT014 |	Be stories that you were
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:04,928	| IOT014 |	You know I really didn't know that much at all about the internet of things I got a lot of topics in Washington has covered the Pentagon has covered
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:05,696	| IOT014 |	Energy
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:09,280	| IOT014 |	Policy and climate change and I had a lighthouse beat for about a year
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:14,144	| IOT014 |	Subpoenaed to things was kind of new to me I've actually spent I should say a year
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:17,216	| IOT014 |	Covering a political campaign technology last year during the
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:19,264	| IOT014 |	I got to see how
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:23,872	| IOT014 |	Sophisticated the Democrats and Republicans are in using technology to win
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:25,664	| IOT014 |	Election or to connect with voters
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:28,736	| IOT014 |	But this was totally different yet I learned a lot
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:34,880	| IOT014 |	In that previous beat that really maybe help me sort of just to start to understand how much policymakers and lawmakers and
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:38,464	| IOT014 |	And the administration you know I was going to be used
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:40,256	| IOT014 |	Technology themselves
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:40,768	| IOT014 |	To get it off
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:47,424	| IOT014 |	This is kind of an example of how much they are using technology while in office I guess that's what made it at 7
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:48,448	| IOT014 |	Awesome
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:51,520	| IOT014 |	Now that you've reported out the story
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:54,080	| IOT014 |	What do you think about the Internet of Things
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:54,592	| IOT014 |	What's today
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:59,712	| IOT014 |	It's pretty amazing I certainly started quickly seeing things all around me
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:00,992	| IOT014 |	That
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:03,552	| IOT014 |	Were part of my life or you know I was being choked
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:10,208	| IOT014 |	Watching on television commercials just my wife and I were sitting on the couch during the Stanley Cup hockey game
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:15,328	| IOT014 |	We're just kind of floored by how many of the commercials related to the internet of things I can find the best example
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:19,168	| IOT014 |	Was I think it's an Audi commercial where the guy is driving me
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:24,544	| IOT014 |	Kind of a classic
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:27,616	| IOT014 |	It just kind of floored me how many things are around us
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,896	| IOT014 |	Are being advertised
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:29,408	| IOT014 |	Directed at us
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,712	| IOT014 |	It was weird me
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:34,272	| IOT014 |	One of the projects I had was to get his wired up his
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:34,784	| IOT014 |	Cuz I couldn't
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:36,320	| IOT014 |	On the Metro
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:42,208	| IOT014 |	And there was an advertisement for the nest thermostat right there like waiting for me when I got off the train one day at
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:44,512	| IOT014 |	I'm a little bit weird like they knew that I was
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:46,560	| IOT014 |	Starting to connect my life up to the intern
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:49,376	| IOT014 |	I would say before long
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:53,216	| IOT014 |	Started to become aware of this issue and then
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:56,032	| IOT014 |	Started reading reading reading as many
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:59,616	| IOT014 |	Pieces of literature that could have been discussed whether Congressional hearing transcripts
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:02,176	| IOT014 |	FTC report to the Homeland
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:04,224	| IOT014 |	Security reports have been done on the topic
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:08,576	| IOT014 |	And you before too long starting to become a little bit of a dangerous expert on it
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:09,856	| IOT014 |	I love those
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:10,880	| IOT014 |	Consider myself a dangerous EX
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:17,280	| IOT014 |	So we'll get to you and your your personal transformation and dude I believe it was super Robo reporter in a moment
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,304	| IOT014 |	But let's
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:20,608	| IOT014 |	Let's focus on DC because
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:22,400	| IOT014 |	The tecknity often does
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:25,984	| IOT014 |	They're just kind of our own things
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:30,336	| IOT014 |	Washington's going to have their light-touch regulation there too slow
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,896	| IOT014 |	They're going to look at this forever
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:36,480	| IOT014 |	Hopefully we can keep them off our backs that is very much the sense I get for
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:36,992	| IOT014 |	Can the people I talk
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:40,064	| IOT014 |	So in reading your story
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:43,648	| IOT014 |	I was kind of strapped it what you found so I'd love for you to talk to me
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,416	| IOT014 |	About
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:47,744	| IOT014 |	You going around and interviewing people at the Capitol in kind of
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:49,536	| IOT014 |	What your take is on how
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:50,816	| IOT014 |	Legislator
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:52,096	| IOT014 |	View the internet
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:55,168	| IOT014 |	She was really interesting I just
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:58,496	| IOT014 |	Has been up in the capital for 15 years covering a whole range of issues
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:00,544	| IOT014 |	This was one that
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:03,872	| IOT014 |	I was floored by just how many people I had to do some explaining
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:06,688	| IOT014 |	Once I should have presented the question to them
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:10,272	| IOT014 |	Typically with a member of Congress you know you just say a couple of keywords
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:14,624	| IOT014 |	And they latch Andre quickly and they have sound bites in their own head where they thinking
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:15,904	| IOT014 |	You know they can take it
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:19,232	| IOT014 |	With this one you know I would usually start off with
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:21,536	| IOT014 |	Excuse me Senator or Congressman I'd like to ask a couple questions
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:23,328	| IOT014 |	About the Internet of Things
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:28,448	| IOT014 |	And except for maybe five or six members I got in a blank stares
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,472	| IOT014 |	People who
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:33,824	| IOT014 |	You would think would be pretty technologically savvy there's a quote from Congressman Sean Duffy
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:36,128	| IOT014 |	Wisconsin Republican used to be on the real world
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:39,200	| IOT014 |	Couple years ago a reality TV star who
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:43,296	| IOT014 |	Is in Congress anyway I asked him a question and he looked at me and said what the hell is that
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:48,160	| IOT014 |	I don't explain him usually what I would do without a quickly will explain another you know drones and
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:52,768	| IOT014 |	Autonomous semi Thomas cars in probably two examples that you're probably familiar with
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:55,072	| IOT014 |	And then a lot of members are going to say okay okay okay
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:55,584	| IOT014 |	What you're talking about
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:59,168	| IOT014 |	There's only been one hearing Energy company that was
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:01,216	| IOT014 |	Corning Court internet of things related to
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:03,008	| IOT014 |	And then there was only one Hearing in the Senate
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:05,312	| IOT014 |	Commerce Committee earlier this year so
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:07,104	| IOT014 |	For 2015
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:10,688	| IOT014 |	No hearings with you know the internet of things as the main driver
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:13,248	| IOT014 |	And then you have this internet-of-things caucus
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,272	| IOT014 |	Before we get to the caca
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:17,088	| IOT014 |	The hearings have only
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:19,136	| IOT014 |	There's been no hearings in
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:21,184	| IOT014 |	Congress because there have been hearings
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,464	| IOT014 |	In front of the f
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:23,232	| IOT014 |	TCM
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:26,304	| IOT014 |	I think so cuz I just want to clarify that far listener
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:27,840	| IOT014 |	May not make the
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,144	| IOT014 |	Congress in the regular
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:32,448	| IOT014 |	So absolutely yeah sure
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:35,008	| IOT014 |	Back to the Internet of Things caucus
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:35,776	| IOT014 |	Just because
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:36,288	| IOT014 |	Is it
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:40,640	| IOT014 |	So he's a he's partnering up with Suzanne.
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:45,760	| IOT014 |	A Washington Democrat who used to work for Microsoft who's been in Congress I think about 3 terms now
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:48,576	| IOT014 |	Bipartisan caucus immuno keep this in mind with
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:49,600	| IOT014 |	Respect
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:50,880	| IOT014 |	Powerless
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:52,416	| IOT014 |	Organizations are basically away
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:55,232	| IOT014 |	Four members of Congress to me to get together and
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:57,536	| IOT014 |	And host a panel discussion or
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:59,328	| IOT014 |	Trying to gauge but
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:02,912	| IOT014 |	There's all kinds of caucuses in Congress has ones on Whiskey Drinking
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:04,448	| IOT014 |	Little League baseball
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:05,984	| IOT014 |	So keep that in mind.
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:07,008	| IOT014 |	Gina one
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:10,080	| IOT014 |	Easy thing that members of Congress can do but it doesn't really
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:13,408	| IOT014 |	They don't write legislation if you're in some sort of like a club
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:14,432	| IOT014 |	High School
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:20,320	| IOT014 |	Kind of like a social thing again very few members are aware of it
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:22,624	| IOT014 |	Those are a couple their licenses and Bill Bean
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,928	| IOT014 |	In the house and then over in the Senate
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:26,720	| IOT014 |	You have
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:27,488	| IOT014 |	Small
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:28,512	| IOT014 |	Group of
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:30,816	| IOT014 |	Kind of I would say backbench senators
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:32,608	| IOT014 |	With respect to
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:34,656	| IOT014 |	Deb Fischer from Nebraska
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:38,240	| IOT014 |	I was thinking about this issue because of Agriculture and all the trucks that are
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:40,032	| IOT014 |	Flowing through the state of Nebraska
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,568	| IOT014 |	You have the
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:43,616	| IOT014 |	Brian Schatz from Hawaii
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:46,944	| IOT014 |	A Democrat who's taking his leadership on this issue
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:52,064	| IOT014 |	I meant Cory Booker he's pretty well-known New Jersey Democrat Saturday
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:53,344	| IOT014 |	And he's been
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:56,416	| IOT014 |	Front and center the former mayor of
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:57,952	| IOT014 |	In New Jersey has been in the Sun
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:31:59,232	| IOT014 |	Couple years now
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:00,256	| IOT014 |	Again
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:01,280	| IOT014 |	There's no pushing
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:03,584	| IOT014 |	More education than legislation
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,888	| IOT014 |	Okay and it sounds like it
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,936	| IOT014 |	It's sorely needed I think
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:09,472	| IOT014 |	In your story you had
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:13,312	| IOT014 |	Representative Isis saying that there are 435 members of the House
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:15,872	| IOT014 |	100 members of the Senate and most of them don't know what the internet is
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:17,408	| IOT014 |	So
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:19,200	| IOT014 |	It's kind of Grimm news
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:21,248	| IOT014 |	It is not the Congressional level
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:24,064	| IOT014 |	So let's let's talk about
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:25,088	| IOT014 |	The regulatory
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:27,136	| IOT014 |	Kind of side of the house because
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:28,416	| IOT014 |	Side of things
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:30,720	| IOT014 |	Don't confuse the issue
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:32,768	| IOT014 |	The FTC
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:36,608	| IOT014 |	Is actually already issued a report and some of their conclusions
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:38,144	| IOT014 |	From the report talk about
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:40,448	| IOT014 |	Increase data privacy
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:44,032	| IOT014 |	Making sure that companies don't keep data Beyond a certain
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:45,568	| IOT014 |	Threshold
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:46,848	| IOT014 |	The report also asked
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:47,360	| IOT014 |	Spore
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:52,224	| IOT014 |	Keto companies to be a little bit more transparent about the data they're collecting and how it gets shared
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:53,760	| IOT014 |	They've also
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:54,784	| IOT014 |	Tencent
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:55,808	| IOT014 |	Censorship bar
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:57,856	| IOT014 |	Find companies for
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:00,160	| IOT014 |	Violations of consumer privacy
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:01,696	| IOT014 |	Related to connected device
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:09,376	| IOT014 |	There's also the FDA which is actually doing some research into connected medical devices I have read some stuff from
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:13,728	| IOT014 |	Then you mentioned the Department of Homeland Security which I thought of where I was so I
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:15,264	| IOT014 |	I'd love to get a sense because
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:18,592	| IOT014 |	I don't know if it was one of your stories but someone
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,872	| IOT014 |	Brought up in this
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:21,664	| IOT014 |	Package of stories
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:23,456	| IOT014 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:23,968	| IOT014 |	Covers
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:26,272	| IOT014 |	A wide swath of Industries
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:27,296	| IOT014 |	And Congress
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:33,440	| IOT014 |	Regulatory system doesn't look at things holistically it looks at things in a very siloed fashion
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:35,744	| IOT014 |	And I thought that was a really good point
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:37,536	| IOT014 |	For like when were thinking
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:39,840	| IOT014 |	Yeah that was something that
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,888	| IOT014 |	Domino's in my main story that I wrote
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:45,984	| IOT014 |	And it was something you asked earlier you know what did I learn and actually that was something
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:48,800	| IOT014 |	A baby and it's been about 6 or 7 weeks
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:49,824	| IOT014 |	Digging in on the topic
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,872	| IOT014 |	Midway through
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:53,664	| IOT014 |	Did it occur to me that that is
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:58,272	| IOT014 |	The case I'll tell you where I came to that conclusion from up denim covering Washington for a long time
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:03,904	| IOT014 |	I cover federal agencies of cover the energy Department in the EPA very closely in the Pentagon very closely
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:07,488	| IOT014 |	And everyone does things very vertically Within
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:08,256	| IOT014 |	Their ages
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:09,280	| IOT014 |	Think about what
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:10,048	| IOT014 |	What laws
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:13,120	| IOT014 |	Allow them to do what they're authorized to do Under
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:17,216	| IOT014 |	Under existing statutes and they don't tend to think too often about
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:19,008	| IOT014 |	What a neighboring agency might do
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:21,312	| IOT014 |	And it's the exact same thing in Congress
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:26,432	| IOT014 |	Can you create a you have the Judiciary Committee and it tends to think within its own balance of what
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:28,736	| IOT014 |	It wants to do and it will fight like hell
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:30,784	| IOT014 |	With another eight committee
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:31,808	| IOT014 |	Over jurisdiction
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:34,112	| IOT014 |	This happens over and over and over again
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:36,672	| IOT014 |	Can you just fascinating you have this battle going on in Washington
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:37,184	| IOT014 |	Hanover who is
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:39,488	| IOT014 |	I get the Internet of Things
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:42,048	| IOT014 |	Just kind of wiped out all of those walls
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:44,608	| IOT014 |	And is designed to sort of have
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:46,400	| IOT014 |	One thing talking to another thing talking
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:47,936	| IOT014 |	Do another thing that typically
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:49,472	| IOT014 |	In Washington we erect barriers
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:52,544	| IOT014 |	Rancho that openly ultimately leads you to the White House
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:56,384	| IOT014 |	And you know the lighthouse is supposed to be the place where all federal agencies
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:35:02,528	| IOT014 |	Trying to take their commands and their lead and and you know the buck stops with the president United States who's in charge of the entire Federal.
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:04,576	| IOT014 |	Dancer that was a question
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:06,368	| IOT014 |	I was closing to the White House was okay
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,136	| IOT014 |	What are you doing
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:12,768	| IOT014 |	Be kind of came back with a similar answer to what you hear from industry
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:14,048	| IOT014 |	We want to light touch we don't
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:15,840	| IOT014 |	Really want to get involved we kind of want to
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:17,632	| IOT014 |	Stand back and let
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:18,912	| IOT014 |	The rest of the
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:27,104	| IOT014 |	At the same time they are being warned by their own Homeland Security Department you got a small window of opportunity here.
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:28,384	| IOT014 |	Talking if you don't
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:30,944	| IOT014 |	You know there's going to be some serious serious consequences
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:32,736	| IOT014 |	Security and sell
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:35,808	| IOT014 |	The White House is well aware of what's going on
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:38,368	| IOT014 |	If the White House has been telling people which way to row the boat
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:42,464	| IOT014 |	The Russian news agency that Justin start rolling in 30 different directions
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:43,488	| IOT014 |	And that's trouble
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:49,632	| IOT014 |	With that idea because the idea that we need a holistic view for regulating The Internet of Things
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:51,424	| IOT014 |	Or legislating it
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:53,472	| IOT014 |	And if the white house isn't taking
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:55,264	| IOT014 |	Charge of this
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:56,544	| IOT014 |	As you said
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:57,568	| IOT014 |	Where we going to
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:36:00,384	| IOT014 |	Get weird who should be regulating this should it be
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:01,408	| IOT014 |	Should we
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:07,808	| IOT014 |	Elect a president who actually knows with the Internet of Things is in 2016 should we turn to regulators and
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:09,088	| IOT014 |	I hope that they get it right
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:10,112	| IOT014 |	Should be
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:12,160	| IOT014 |	Start buying Congressman I don't know like
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:14,720	| IOT014 |	Where is our best hope of Regulation that may
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:16,768	| IOT014 |	It's a
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:23,168	| IOT014 |	Great question mean there's there's there's this tension here between the two and you know when I set out to teleport the story I was
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:24,192	| IOT014 |	Trying to figure out
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:27,264	| IOT014 |	How much do Congress and how much should be Administration no and then
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:29,824	| IOT014 |	How much were they ready to do and obviously what
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:31,616	| IOT014 |	What is industry telling them
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:32,640	| IOT014 |	They like.
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:36,992	| IOT014 |	Don't be wrong Amino President Obama is
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:40,832	| IOT014 |	Is no dummy on technologies that he's been wearing once a couple of months now
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:44,416	| IOT014 |	She certainly aware of it and he has made a couple of
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:47,744	| IOT014 |	Allusions to sort of what the Fitbit is capable of
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:49,536	| IOT014 |	Energy Systems
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:53,120	| IOT014 |	And he hasn't used the words Internet of Things
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:55,168	| IOT014 |	Please talk to me about today
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:57,472	| IOT014 |	Prospects of what technology
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:58,240	| IOT014 |	Conducive
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,264	| IOT014 |	He knows what it is
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:03,872	| IOT014 |	Some of these people actually told me that he just doesn't like to use sometimes
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:05,152	| IOT014 |	The nerdy terms
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:10,272	| IOT014 |	You know that that you and I are very familiar with it cuz he wants to kind of speak to the laminin
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:12,832	| IOT014 |	Internet of things is something that
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:15,136	| IOT014 |	Nick Milana is still struggling with her quite candid
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:18,208	| IOT014 |	President Obama
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:19,488	| IOT014 |	Use the
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:21,024	| IOT014 |	Use those words per say
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:27,168	| IOT014 |	Going forward I mean I think this is going to continue moving forward
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:29,728	| IOT014 |	The way it kind of is right now I don't get a sense that there's any
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:33,056	| IOT014 |	Effort underway to create an Internet of Things
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:34,592	| IOT014 |	Apartment or Internet of Things
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:37,920	| IOT014 |	Pacific law
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:38,432	| IOT014 |	Probably
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:39,712	| IOT014 |	Payback
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:41,760	| IOT014 |	On this like the industry is urging him to do
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:45,344	| IOT014 |	At the same time as I mentioned before having a lot of you ladies are
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:46,880	| IOT014 |	Competing for
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:52,000	| IOT014 |	And starting to get engaged on this issue summer doing it more proactively like the SDA
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:53,792	| IOT014 |	The transportation department
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:58,144	| IOT014 |	The FAA with respected drones in a lot of these are can actually be issuing rules that are going to affect
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:00,192	| IOT014 |	Decisions made by businesses
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:00,960	| IOT014 |	Usher
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:04,288	| IOT014 |	It sounds like that it's more of the same will get piecemeal efforts
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:05,824	| IOT014 |	That
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:08,128	| IOT014 |	Embody that light-touch regulation
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:08,896	| IOT014 |	For the internet
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:12,736	| IOT014 |	And I think that's to be expected I think in one of those things
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:15,552	| IOT014 |	Editor's would ask me to do and I really enjoyed this part of the story
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:17,600	| IOT014 |	Honestly one of the very first questions
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:19,648	| IOT014 |	I was asking if myself when I started out with
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:25,024	| IOT014 |	What about other big technological innovations how long does it take Washington to respond
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:28,608	| IOT014 |	3
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:31,424	| IOT014 |	And the airplane and Telegraph
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:36,288	| IOT014 |	And the railroad will it be before that I went and I started asking historians will you know how long did it take
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:42,688	| IOT014 |	It was that case I mean the railroad is interesting example
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:43,456	| IOT014 |	70s men
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:44,992	| IOT014 |	It takes another
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:48,832	| IOT014 |	20 years before you get the Interstate Commerce Commission starts to regulate
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:55,232	| IOT014 |	On that front door automobiles the great again Henry Ford pumps out the Model T at the start of the 20th century
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:39:00,352	| IOT014 |	But doesn't actually for seatbelts in the cars until the 1960s 1970s
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:02,912	| IOT014 |	Yeah so it sounds like we're going to eat we might
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:09,824	| IOT014 |	I might be in for a rocky few decades with the Privacy then it sounds like I know is a consumer that's a big
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:10,592	| IOT014 |	Issue
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:11,104	| IOT014 |	4
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:13,664	| IOT014 |	People in the internet of things and I think
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:17,504	| IOT014 |	Is there anything to the idea that technology moves
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:21,856	| IOT014 |	So much faster today I mean you look at regulations for the internet I mean
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:24,672	| IOT014 |	Not that the railroad in the car we're not huge significant
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:25,184	| IOT014 |	And things
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:27,488	| IOT014 |	And intent of milestones in
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:30,816	| IOT014 |	Both are economic and you know social
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:31,328	| IOT014 |	Development
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:32,608	| IOT014 |	But
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:36,704	| IOT014 |	The internet for example is already disrupting things is 25 years old
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:39,520	| IOT014 |	We are still trying to adapt our laws to deal with
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:41,568	| IOT014 |	Kind of the holistic
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:42,336	| IOT014 |	World of
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:43,872	| IOT014 |	Everything being connected right
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:47,200	| IOT014 |	And so when you look at the internet of things which is
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:52,320	| IOT014 |	It's been 25 years but we're basically saying hey you know what let's take the internet and like
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:53,344	| IOT014 |	Put it into light
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:54,112	| IOT014 |	* 1000
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:40:00,512	| IOT014 |	Yeah yeah absolutely there hasn't been much regulation on the internet and I think that's maybe why
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:01,280	| IOT014 |	It is
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:04,096	| IOT014 |	Do transform society as much as it has and hasn't really blocked
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:06,656	| IOT014 |	That many Innovations over the last
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:08,704	| IOT014 |	Two and a half decades and seems to be
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:11,264	| IOT014 |	At this point the lesson that
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:13,312	| IOT014 |	Graphic policymakers in Washington
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:14,592	| IOT014 |	Have learned
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:15,360	| IOT014 |	Is
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:16,384	| IOT014 |	Hang back and
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:19,456	| IOT014 |	And don't get too engaged in and let the market
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:23,040	| IOT014 |	Sort itself out when you have a company going and then having a big privacy here
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:24,064	| IOT014 |	Security breach
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:28,160	| IOT014 |	And that's something I heard over and over that company will probably be headed for the exits
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:30,208	| IOT014 |	Has people turning their competitors
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:30,976	| IOT014 |	To buy up whatever
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:33,280	| IOT014 |	An alternative they can so
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:35,584	| IOT014 |	I mean I think there's going to be regulation
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,400	| IOT014 |	You know what is a pointed out of the Peace
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:44,288	| IOT014 |	If something big happens if there's some Calamity of some kind that we can't quite Envision in the moment
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:47,616	| IOT014 |	You know I should have asked people give me your doomsday scenarios while I was reporting it
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:50,432	| IOT014 |	Pick up all sorts of crazy things
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:51,456	| IOT014 |	People envision
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:53,504	| IOT014 |	Happening because of the Internet of Things
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:56,832	| IOT014 |	And maybe a crisis would wake Washington uphill of course Racine
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:41:01,440	| IOT014 |	In a big crisis has on a whole host of other issues with IP infrastructure and
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:03,488	| IOT014 |	You're not replacing the bridge after
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:06,304	| IOT014 |	She's not doing big things after we have a major Bridge collapses
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:08,096	| IOT014 |	In Minnesota
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:09,120	| IOT014 |	Or
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:12,192	| IOT014 |	You know the fiscal crisis that we faced and all those deadlines
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:14,240	| IOT014 |	Drive Congress to act either
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:19,616	| IOT014 |	So you know Washington is pretty broken it's been broken for the last couple of years
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:23,712	| IOT014 |	Legislative front for President Obama he's in he's obviously done a lot of things
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:26,784	| IOT014 |	Reviews on executive powers because Congress
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:27,808	| IOT014 |	Subdivided
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:32,672	| IOT014 |	So I think it's as long as Washington's broken as well just another factor to keep an eye on
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:34,464	| IOT014 |	We're not going to see much on the
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:35,488	| IOT014 |	Passage of new laws
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:37,792	| IOT014 |	And that leadeth into the agency
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:40,864	| IOT014 |	So then I will tell people carry on and watch out for the Aged
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:42,656	| IOT014 |	Add
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:45,216	| IOT014 |	In terms of you personally
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:48,288	| IOT014 |	How do you view this because you did
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:51,360	| IOT014 |	You bought the sea it looks like a Fitbit at Dropcam
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:55,711	| IOT014 |	What else did what else did you buy to connect yourself to The Internet of Things
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:57,247	| IOT014 |	And what did you think about your
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,527	| IOT014 |	Really fun I mean
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:02,623	| IOT014 |	It was an idea that we kind of came up with how many things can I get my hands on in like a week
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:06,207	| IOT014 |	I ended up with a Fitbit to Fitbit
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:10,303	| IOT014 |	Bought a nest thermostat about the smoke detector and the Dropcam
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:16,191	| IOT014 |	I Got a Car connect which was allowing let me sort of Texas temperature of my car as I was driving around
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:20,031	| IOT014 |	I'll see what else do they have electric toothbrush the beam
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:24,383	| IOT014 |	Toothbrush was told me that I was the smiley faces when I rushed for more than 2 minutes
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:30,527	| IOT014 |	So yeah I was doing all of these things at Mercedes Benz dropped off a car for the weekend I was able to drive a semi autonomous car for
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:33,855	| IOT014 |	Sweet machine
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:37,439	| IOT014 |	I will say this is fastening so the Mercedes sent the car over
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:41,279	| IOT014 |	The guy who delivered it we were you showing me everything
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:42,559	| IOT014 |	You know the dashboard
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:44,095	| IOT014 |	I was asking about the
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:47,679	| IOT014 |	The parallel parking assist any kind of looked at me since man I don't use that I like to parallel park
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:49,983	| IOT014 |	And I just thought it was
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:55,871	| IOT014 |	So true because I tried to do it a couple of times and ultimately I just I prefer to parallel park myself and maybe that's the generational thing
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:59,199	| IOT014 |	So which of these devices that you tried
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:43:00,223	| IOT014 |	Did you find any that
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:00,991	| IOT014 |	You couldn't live without
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:07,647	| IOT014 |	I will say that I really enjoy the nest that one we didn't get rid of forked over the cash for that myself and
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:11,743	| IOT014 |	I've started noticing that I can I probably could go back to what I already have
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:15,583	| IOT014 |	I've already had the wires for pretty complicated to pull it out
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:17,375	| IOT014 |	Pull the old thermostat out of the new one in
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:23,775	| IOT014 |	Dropcam was kind of fun we've been using a time really to watch a cat's back in the day
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:27,103	| IOT014 |	You know I could probably live without nutmeg. They're doing cuz I'm pretty much sleeping
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:29,407	| IOT014 |	Are the toothbrush obviously it's kind of
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:31,455	| IOT014 |	Something now that it has replaced my old toothbrush
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:34,271	| IOT014 |	In my bathroom and
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:40,671	| IOT014 |	Your other than that I'm happy with the old 2008 Subaru that I drive which is totally unconnected except for
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:44,767	| IOT014 |	I do not hook up my iPhone iTunes to it but that's pretty much it
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:45,791	| IOT014 |	On the car
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:49,119	| IOT014 |	So you know I think I'm uncomfortable living in in
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:49,887	| IOT014 |	20
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:52,703	| IOT014 |	2012 here in 2015 but
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:56,799	| IOT014 |	I feel like I'll so it's just a matter of time before when I start buying the Next Generation and everything
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:59,359	| IOT014 |	It's probably going to be in minesing Schenectady
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:03,967	| IOT014 |	Voltaren thank you so much for talking to me about this stuff I appreciate your
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:07,295	| IOT014 |	Your look at your look at Washington DC and a sense of
EDL	00:44:07,295	00:44:08,063	| IOT014 |	What
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:10,111	| IOT014 |	What the capital is doing about the internet of things which
