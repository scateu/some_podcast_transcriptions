EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:38,560	| IOT195 |	Kevin Spacey
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:41,632	| IOT195 |	After taking a break to study for his test
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:42,656	| IOT195 |	Do you want to tell everyone
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:44,704	| IOT195 |	How you did on that test
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:46,240	| IOT195 |	There's no need to tell them I got a
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:47,520	| IOT195 |	5% that's okay
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:49,312	| IOT195 |	That's right
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:51,616	| IOT195 |	We may have missed him but at least
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:52,640	| IOT195 |	He worked really hard
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:56,736	| IOT195 |	Java one is complete Java to starts in 4 weeks
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:00,320	| IOT195 |	So we are glad to have you back Kevin
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,088	| IOT195 |	Although we are
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:03,392	| IOT195 |	Glad that you did so well let's talk
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,160	| IOT195 |	First off
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,440	| IOT195 |	About to say this
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:07,232	| IOT195 |	This is probably the biggest Story coming out
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:08,768	| IOT195 |	In the last week or so
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:13,376	| IOT195 |	GE is spinning out its industrial iot business which includes things like
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:16,192	| IOT195 |	Predicts and they're going to create a
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:17,216	| IOT195 |	Separate company
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:19,264	| IOT195 |	Valued about 1.2 billion dollars
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,824	| IOT195 |	What I thought was most interest
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:26,688	| IOT195 |	Is that bill Rue who is the chief digital officer at GE and has been
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:27,456	| IOT195 |	Sanford Lake
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:28,224	| IOT195 |	Years
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:29,504	| IOT195 |	Like he was the face of
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:31,040	| IOT195 |	Ge's digital efforts
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:32,832	| IOT195 |	He is not actually
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:33,856	| IOT195 |	At the company more
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,648	| IOT195 |	Is no longer there he is left
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:36,928	| IOT195 |	Don't know where it went
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:37,696	| IOT195 |	And
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:40,512	| IOT195 |	Instead they're going to have to find a new CEO for this
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,280	| IOT195 |	Switch
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,304	| IOT195 |	Tells me a couple things
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:44,096	| IOT195 |	One possible.
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:49,216	| IOT195 |	Bill Ramos into the ground but I think he actually did a pretty good job so I think what happened is he decided
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:49,984	| IOT195 |	Aleve
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,264	| IOT195 |	In a fit of like soft
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,288	| IOT195 |	Preservation and
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,312	| IOT195 |	I don't know what else to do
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,336	| IOT195 |	But
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,152	| IOT195 |	Well I have two thoughts here
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,176	| IOT195 |	Not so much about
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:00,224	| IOT195 |	The person in charge
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:01,760	| IOT195 |	One is that the
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,808	| IOT195 |	Spin-off will not be named
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,088	| IOT195 |	Predix
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:07,136	| IOT195 |	I wonder if
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:09,184	| IOT195 |	A rebranding is
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,976	| IOT195 |	As part of the strategy here
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:11,488	| IOT195 |	Because
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:17,632	| IOT195 |	I don't know you would know better than I just because you followed this side of the market over Federer how is predix
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:20,960	| IOT195 |	Known in the industry compared to the other
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:21,472	| IOT195 |	Predators
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,264	| IOT195 |	It's actually doing really well
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,288	| IOT195 |	It is a
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:26,336	| IOT195 |	Well known solution it is a good solution
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:29,152	| IOT195 |	I think we're GE went
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:33,760	| IOT195 |	Wrong is they were try and this is actually a very common thing that everybody did in the
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:35,808	| IOT195 |	Myspace they're trying to be too many things to
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:36,576	| IOT195 |	Too many different
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,600	| IOT195 |	People in industry
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:40,928	| IOT195 |	They also spent a lot of money on marketing and sales
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,720	| IOT195 |	Without necessarily
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,000	| IOT195 |	The details
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:44,512	| IOT195 |	Behind the scenes
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,304	| IOT195 |	So I think that's what
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:50,400	| IOT195 |	Going forward I would love to see this new company
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:53,216	| IOT195 |	Which has really good stuff really good technology
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:54,496	| IOT195 |	And presumably Xperia
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:55,776	| IOT195 |	Based on
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,056	| IOT195 |	All the information it has
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:58,848	| IOT195 |	Mge energy business from
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,408	| IOT195 |	Power turbine in Airline business
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,688	| IOT195 |	I think it's
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:05,248	| IOT195 |	It focuses only on those areas instead of
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:07,552	| IOT195 |	Just trying to be this industrial internet behemoth
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,600	| IOT195 |	I think I could actually do well in
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,112	| IOT195 |	Separating out
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:13,440	| IOT195 |	GE means other companies might use it where is
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,208	| IOT195 |	Beforehand
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:15,232	| IOT195 |	It may have been like yeah I'm not
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:16,768	| IOT195 |	Asthma cat litter
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,791	| IOT195 |	Right right
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:20,095	| IOT195 |	My other thought is by moving it
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:23,935	| IOT195 |	Outside of GE it will not be I don't want to say this
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,959	| IOT195 |	Sometimes companies
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:27,775	| IOT195 |	Business units in very large companies are just
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:31,615	| IOT195 |	Outback in a sentence with corporate policies politics
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:33,919	| IOT195 |	Etc and I just wonder this will make him a little more
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,967	| IOT195 |	Agile I guess what the best word
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:36,991	| IOT195 |	Maybe in
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,271	| IOT195 |	That's one of the things about
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,295	| IOT195 |	Bill relieving is
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,831	| IOT195 |	Is he actually had
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:41,599	| IOT195 |	GE
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,623	| IOT195 |	How do you wheelie
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:43,903	| IOT195 |	Paper
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:44,927	| IOT195 |	Good sounding
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,207	| IOT195 |	Management
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:49,023	| IOT195 |	Structure so the way they did theirs they had their
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,071	| IOT195 |	Airline managers for different businesses
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:53,631	| IOT195 |	But then they all reported and worked with
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:54,655	| IOT195 |	The digital
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:55,935	| IOT195 |	Folks
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:59,519	| IOT195 |	So there wasn't a lot of like fears about cannibalization
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:03,103	| IOT195 |	Or not invented here type syndrome is very
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:08,479	| IOT195 |	Was actually one of the better plans ways of implementing iot in a big organization that I've seen
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,783	| IOT195 |	So hopefully they retain that
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,063	| IOT195 |	I just think of
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:14,111	| IOT195 |	Focus is good and then also
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:16,671	| IOT195 |	Probably spending Less on marketing and more I'm getting
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:20,767	| IOT195 |	This is like the macro story of the last few years
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:21,279	| IOT195 |	Myspace
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,839	| IOT195 |	San Jose will see
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:24,607	| IOT195 |	We'll see
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,399	| IOT195 |	I made this business will still be a
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:28,703	| IOT195 |	Contender no matter what happens with it and
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:30,495	| IOT195 |	Even outside of GE
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,543	| IOT195 |	It's going to be one to watch
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,591	| IOT195 |	And I think it's also we should think about
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:37,151	| IOT195 |	What's happening a lot of the other Industrial
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,687	| IOT195 |	Companies like Hitachi
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,711	| IOT195 |	Schneider Electric
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:40,479	| IOT195 |	They actually
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:41,759	| IOT195 |	Spun out their own
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:44,063	| IOT195 |	Industrial iot businesses in different
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:44,831	| IOT195 |	Group so
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:46,111	| IOT195 |	Gmail address decided
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,159	| IOT195 |	I sent the trend
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:49,951	| IOT195 |	All right
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:52,767	| IOT195 |	So that is our big industrial iot news
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,815	| IOT195 |	Let's talk about some
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,863	| IOT195 |	Trend
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:57,631	| IOT195 |	It's another
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:58,655	| IOT195 |	New trend
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:01,983	| IOT195 |	Lighthouse which is a startup that made a
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:02,751	| IOT195 |	Really
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:03,519	| IOT195 |	Smart
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,287	| IOT195 |	Video cam
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:07,615	| IOT195 |	Camera basically you could talk to this video camera and tell it things
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:09,407	| IOT195 |	It would translate that into
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:10,687	| IOT195 |	Interaction and then it would do it
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:11,967	| IOT195 |	So
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,735	| IOT195 |	It's shutting down
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,503	| IOT195 |	And yeah
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:15,039	| IOT195 |	Not only was it a
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:17,855	| IOT195 |	Camera it also had an extra sensor in there so it
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,135	| IOT195 |	It had a depth sensor
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,671	| IOT195 |	So it could actually
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,487	| IOT195 |	Tell things with finer granularity
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:27,071	| IOT195 |	The normal but it was really cool cuz you could be like a lighthouse tell me if
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:28,351	| IOT195 |	If my dog walker does
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:29,631	| IOT195 |	Before 4
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:30,911	| IOT195 |	It would do that
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:33,215	| IOT195 |	Right right I mean
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:36,031	| IOT195 |	One of the pain points of having a
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,311	| IOT195 |	Video camera
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,335	| IOT195 |	System
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,615	| IOT195 |	Scrubbing through timeline
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:42,175	| IOT195 |	To see your fine certain things I remember when our
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,711	| IOT195 |	Car got hit out front of the house
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,991	| IOT195 |	I probably spent an hour and a half
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,271	| IOT195 |	Scrubbing
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:48,831	| IOT195 |	Justifying the 15 second video which was
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:49,599	| IOT195 |	Well worth it
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:52,159	| IOT195 |	Because the insurance company fully reimbursement
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:55,487	| IOT195 |	For that incident but here you got some a I smart
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,255	| IOT195 |	Send
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,023	| IOT195 |	It just makes
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:59,839	| IOT195 |	It's so much easier to find things or proactively
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:03,423	| IOT195 |	See things and tell me that they happen like tell me when the kids get home from school
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:07,263	| IOT195 |	It would somebody else would come in the house and the cameras are going to tell you but when the kids come in the house
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,543	| IOT195 |	Lighthouse would tell you
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,567	| IOT195 |	Really smart
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:11,615	| IOT195 |	A little pricey I think was $300
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,895	| IOT195 |	Well so here's what I think
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,175	| IOT195 |	Spicy at 3
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,223	| IOT195 |	But it also had
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,247	| IOT195 |	Service camp
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:19,807	| IOT195 |	Not because you were buying actually the AI serve
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:21,087	| IOT195 |	Right
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:22,879	| IOT195 |	Until the subscription fee
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:27,231	| IOT195 |	I think there's expensive and the subscription fee probably is what doomed
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:28,255	| IOT195 |	This in that sun porch
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,023	| IOT195 |	Cuz it was
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:30,047	| IOT195 |	Pretty darn innovate
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,839	| IOT195 |	And I think we'll see something like this
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,607	| IOT195 |	Is come out
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:35,167	| IOT195 |	Probably at a year 2 associated with maybe nest
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:37,215	| IOT195 |	I can see Nest doing something like this
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,007	| IOT195 |	Maybe even the Amazon.
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:45,663	| IOT195 |	So they're shutting down it's not as if they're going to its logical and thinking well G if you've got the AI smart
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:48,735	| IOT195 |	Tell that to other companies who make devices
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:52,319	| IOT195 |	Does or just be purchased right but yourself up for sale that's not what's happening
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:55,135	| IOT195 |	No it's going to refund
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:56,415	| IOT195 |	All the customers who
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,183	| IOT195 |	I had bought the Prada
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,463	| IOT195 |	And
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,999	| IOT195 |	Yeah it's just
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:00,511	| IOT195 |	There so many
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:04,351	| IOT195 |	Yeah everybody that I know and it wasn't many people but everybody that I know that
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:06,911	| IOT195 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,191	| IOT195 |	Xiamen again
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,983	| IOT195 |	Good just expensive and
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:13,311	| IOT195 |	It's not necessarily clear to people who are looking for a camera
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,335	| IOT195 |	If you can buy like
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:15,615	| IOT195 |	Nest cam
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:16,895	| IOT195 |	An Arlo
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,175	| IOT195 |	Is way cheaper
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:20,479	| IOT195 |	You know you're like why would I pay that places
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:20,991	| IOT195 |	Prescription
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,063	| IOT195 |	Silly humans
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,343	| IOT195 |	All right
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,623	| IOT195 |	So that is a bummer
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:28,415	| IOT195 |	Good news
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:30,207	| IOT195 |	For everybody with hue light bulbs
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,231	| IOT195 |	Who
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,535	| IOT195 |	Feel like me and you have them all over the
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:35,071	| IOT195 |	There's a positive update
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,607	| IOT195 |	Out and about
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:38,399	| IOT195 |	Used to be when you
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,423	| IOT195 |	Power went off
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:41,471	| IOT195 |	Your Hue Lights would come on
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,751	| IOT195 |	Because they would just revert
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:46,335	| IOT195 |	This was a pain when the power went off in the middle of the night
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,615	| IOT195 |	Possibly all of your light switch
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:50,687	| IOT195 |	That was one of the big reasons why
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:53,247	| IOT195 |	But now
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,271	| IOT195 |	They have an update
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:56,575	| IOT195 |	And now you can control that
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:59,647	| IOT195 |	You can have it revert to the last known state
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:01,439	| IOT195 |	So instead of actually
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,463	| IOT195 |	Turning on
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:04,511	| IOT195 |	If it was off at the last known state it
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,535	| IOT195 |	It will revert to that
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:08,095	| IOT195 |	So the Hue Bridge must finally
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:08,863	| IOT195 |	Save that state
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,143	| IOT195 |	Epona reboot
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,423	| IOT195 |	Yes
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:13,983	| IOT195 |	That is presumably what happens
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:16,287	| IOT195 |	Some people reported having trouble updating
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,591	| IOT195 |	I updated to it and I had
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,127	| IOT195 |	No trouble whatsoever
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:21,151	| IOT195 |	And it does work
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:23,199	| IOT195 |	You can find it by going into the
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:24,223	| IOT195 |	The settings menu
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:27,039	| IOT195 |	And going into power on Behavior
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:28,831	| IOT195 |	So you know
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,367	| IOT195 |	This is
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:30,879	| IOT195 |	What's good
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,439	| IOT195 |	Actually I
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:35,231	| IOT195 |	I should tell you it works with using
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:36,255	| IOT195 |	The switch as well
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:39,071	| IOT195 |	So if someone turns it off at the
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:39,839	| IOT195 |	The switch
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:42,911	| IOT195 |	And you turn the switch back on it will revert back to the last node
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:46,239	| IOT195 |	Which may be kind of a pain because I know sometimes
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,775	| IOT195 |	When I don't want to say anything
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:48,799	| IOT195 |	I flipped the switch
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,591	| IOT195 |	But we'll see how that work
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:52,895	| IOT195 |	Works in real life I haven't needed to do that since I updated
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:53,663	| IOT195 |	But I'm excited
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:54,943	| IOT195 |	Super positive
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,479	| IOT195 |	Cuz I used to be a power without I have to
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,015	| IOT195 |	Read out in the middle of the night
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,295	| IOT195 |	Turn off all the lights
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,391	| IOT195 |	Which candida Pizza
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:05,951	| IOT195 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:06,463	| IOT195 |	Trump news
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,791	| IOT195 |	Hookup has a new iot modem
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,327	| IOT195 |	It is both Ohio
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,095	| IOT195 |	OT
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:16,447	| IOT195 |	Oh I should tell you what it is it's an LTE Cat 1 and an NB iot
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,215	| IOT195 |	T Network
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:18,495	| IOT195 |	Modem
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,031	| IOT195 |	So all in one
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,567	| IOT195 |	It will work
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:25,151	| IOT195 |	In a bunch of different places it is global which means you can buy it for
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:27,199	| IOT195 |	You know if you're buying your modem for like
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,479	| IOT195 |	Global
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:30,271	| IOT195 |	Fleet of cargo containers or something
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:34,111	| IOT195 |	It is also
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:35,135	| IOT195 |	A little bit cheaper
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,927	| IOT195 |	They say that it is up to
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,951	| IOT195 |	To 70%
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,487	| IOT195 |	Reduction in power consumption
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,279	| IOT195 |	It is 50% smaller
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:42,303	| IOT195 |	And
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,839	| IOT195 |	It is 40%
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,631	| IOT195 |	They don't tell you how
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,143	| IOT195 |	Cheap it is
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:47,679	| IOT195 |	Because that would
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,471	| IOT195 |	Calling
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:51,775	| IOT195 |	But
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:53,311	| IOT195 |	I don't know if it's lower than $5
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:54,591	| IOT195 |	Just kind of
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:55,615	| IOT195 |	Where we need
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:57,151	| IOT195 |	To be to get the sun like
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,199	| IOT195 |	Real things and we needed to be like
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:10:59,967	| IOT195 |	A dollar
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,479	| IOT195 |	If we wanted ever
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:05,087	| IOT195 |	Yeah I mean it also has a CPU cortex A7
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,367	| IOT195 |	Processor in there
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:09,183	| IOT195 |	I'm guessing it's not under 5 who knows setup
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:09,695	| IOT195 |	This is a smart
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,743	| IOT195 |	But you know for high-value things
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,023	| IOT195 |	This is going to be good
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:15,839	| IOT195 |	And it is still good to have smaller cheaper
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,887	| IOT195 |	Stop running around even if it's not as
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,399	| IOT195 |	Cheapest iMac
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,703	| IOT195 |	Yeah interesting read
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:24,031	| IOT195 |	I don't know what these case would be for this considering what it
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:27,103	| IOT195 |	I presume this be used for it has voice over LTE
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:27,615	| IOT195 |	Support
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:28,895	| IOT195 |	And
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:30,175	| IOT195 |	They say
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,455	| IOT195 |	On the press release
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:33,759	| IOT195 |	They discuss what it works with in terms of
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:36,063	| IOT195 |	Software components Dimension thread X
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:38,367	| IOT195 |	And Ali OS things
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:40,671	| IOT195 |	Artists which is Alibaba
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:41,695	| IOT195 |	That's there
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,463	| IOT195 |	Peyote plant
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:45,791	| IOT195 |	I want to start tossing like oh it's going to work with Amazon but
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:46,303	| IOT195 |	Newt
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,887	| IOT195 |	At least not now
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,447	| IOT195 |	Yeah well
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:56,543	| IOT195 |	Actually Qualcomm has been pushing hard into China China is also a big Market
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:11:59,615	| IOT195 |	Where is
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,151	| IOT195 |	Well actually Asian China in
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,431	| IOT195 |	Singapore
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,199	| IOT195 |	In Korea
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,991	| IOT195 |	NB iot
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:06,783	| IOT195 |	So could be that they're like
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,831	| IOT195 |	Here in the US
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:10,879	| IOT195 |	We've been focused on cat 1M
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:13,951	| IOT195 |	We don't really have the NB iot networks yet so
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:15,487	| IOT195 |	I don't know maybe that's just a
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,255	| IOT195 |	Telemarketing to search
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:17,791	| IOT195 |	Yeah could be
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,071	| IOT195 |	All right
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,351	| IOT195 |	And another small news
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:22,143	| IOT195 |	North which is
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:24,191	| IOT195 |	Maybe a company that you're working here with us
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:27,007	| IOT195 |	Use PayPal mclabs they're making
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,031	| IOT195 |	Smart glasses
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,799	| IOT195 |	They have
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,079	| IOT195 |	Got an Intel
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:30,591	| IOT195 |	Bought
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,383	| IOT195 |	Man Kevin
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:35,455	| IOT195 |	Do you remember bought because not much
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,479	| IOT195 |	It's really came out of it
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,247	| IOT195 |	Yeah I know it was
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,039	| IOT195 |	The birds dislike
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:41,343	| IOT195 |	Master huge article on it
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:42,879	| IOT195 |	It was a big article
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:47,487	| IOT195 |	About Intel smart glasses effort that have been apparently percolating for a year or so
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:47,999	| IOT195 |	Then
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:50,303	| IOT195 |	Coupons later not even
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,839	| IOT195 |	And I was like yeah we're getting out of that
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,119	| IOT195 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,911	| IOT195 |	Now, clubs
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:57,215	| IOT195 |	Does bought it Thelma gloves used to make a gesture
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:58,751	| IOT195 |	Amaya
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:02,079	| IOT195 |	Arm and you moved your arm around and
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:03,359	| IOT195 |	Control things
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:03,871	| IOT195 |	And
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,663	| IOT195 |	Now they're doing glass
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:08,735	| IOT195 |	We talked about them once
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,039	| IOT195 |	Thalmic labs renamed itself to North
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:13,087	| IOT195 |	And the pivot away from the arm
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:14,111	| IOT195 |	Gesturing Thing 2
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:16,415	| IOT195 |	Two glasses of the focal's AR classes
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,207	| IOT195 |	That will be
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:19,999	| IOT195 |	Likely presumably using
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:22,815	| IOT195 |	Some of the IP from Intel's bomb project
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,631	| IOT195 |	Yeah and I guess the only other buyer out there might be the bosguy
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,399	| IOT195 |	Guys who are doing this
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:26,911	| IOT195 |	My sunglasses
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:31,519	| IOT195 |	Maybe I mean they're still Google Glass for
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,799	| IOT195 |	Enterprise and such
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:36,127	| IOT195 |	Not a consumer product oh maybe Google could have used it but who knows
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:39,967	| IOT195 |	Yeah so there we go smart glasses they're still trying to make those happen
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:40,991	| IOT195 |	Let's talk about Lots
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,271	| IOT195 |	Echo news
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,807	| IOT195 |	Is for everyone
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:44,831	| IOT195 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:45,343	| IOT195 |	First
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:46,623	| IOT195 |	An update
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:48,927	| IOT195 |	Probably a couple weeks ago we didn't talk about it with OMB
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,463	| IOT195 |	Because we're so focused on privacy
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:52,511	| IOT195 |	And that Constitutional Amendment he wants
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,303	| IOT195 |	The echo
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:56,095	| IOT195 |	Got new features
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:58,143	| IOT195 |	Including location-based routines
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:59,423	| IOT195 |	And reminders
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:01,215	| IOT195 |	They also got reactions
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:03,007	| IOT195 |	But you
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:05,055	| IOT195 |	Start a routine later and
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:07,103	| IOT195 |	It got the ability to read your email
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:15,295	| IOT195 |	Justify location-based it's being useful for if you want like announce to the home
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,063	| IOT195 |	You know your
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:19,391	| IOT195 |	10 minutes away maybe you come home at different times and
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,415	| IOT195 |	There for dinner is
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,951	| IOT195 |	A different time every day that could
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:24,767	| IOT195 |	Indicate hey let's get dinner started
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,815	| IOT195 |	Yeah and I
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,095	| IOT195 |	You know what would be awesome
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:31,679	| IOT195 |	Is getting a reminder as I leave my front door
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,703	| IOT195 |	And saying
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,471	| IOT195 |	Hey
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:36,031	| IOT195 |	Do you have whatever for the day so like
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:38,079	| IOT195 |	Kind of time that to my calendar I know that's
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:40,639	| IOT195 |	Pretty complicated but if I had set a reminder the night before
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:43,199	| IOT195 |	Hey remind me when I leave in the morning
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:43,967	| IOT195 |	2
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:44,479	| IOT195 |	Bring my gym bag
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:46,527	| IOT195 |	Remind my daughter to bring
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:49,343	| IOT195 |	Gym clothes you know what having that happen like
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:50,367	| IOT195 |	As I leave the house
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:52,415	| IOT195 |	That would be really
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:57,279	| IOT195 |	Right that would be really cool if you can do it that way or I guess the new tracker
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,559	| IOT195 |	Product that we talked about
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:01,119	| IOT195 |	A few weeks back would do that too
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,143	| IOT195 |	Yeah I forget a lot of
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:07,775	| IOT195 |	That's okay but I need the tracker would require purchase of Hardware well over $100
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:09,055	| IOT195 |	To do that whereas
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:09,823	| IOT195 |	This way
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:12,639	| IOT195 |	This would not assuming you already have an account yes
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:14,943	| IOT195 |	Oh which gets into the next one which is
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,967	| IOT195 |	The guard
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:17,247	| IOT195 |	Is
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:19,039	| IOT195 |	BM has on guard
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,063	| IOT195 |	Feature that they talk
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:23,903	| IOT195 |	Facts about where the Echoes will listen for the sound of breaking glass and send you a notice
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,439	| IOT195 |	Haitian is now
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,975	| IOT195 |	Available to sign
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:31,839	| IOT195 |	Yes I went to go look for it this morning in the
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,631	| IOT195 |	Alipay app
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:36,447	| IOT195 |	It just told me that I could be notified to sign up to be notified
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:38,495	| IOT195 |	You'll get it when we tell you
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:40,799	| IOT195 |	So what is this showing me
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:43,615	| IOT195 |	Is remember how the smartphone like basically ate all the
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,383	| IOT195 |	These gadgets
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:46,431	| IOT195 |	Using microphones
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,199	| IOT195 |	And
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:47,967	| IOT195 |	Contacts
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:50,015	| IOT195 |	The digital assistant
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,295	| IOT195 |	Are going to eat a lot of
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:51,807	| IOT195 |	Different gadgets
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:54,879	| IOT195 |	The Harbours already there
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:55,903	| IOT195 |	In these assistants
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:58,975	| IOT195 |	Obviously far-field microphones that can listen for
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:01,791	| IOT195 |	Wake words and commands and someone searches
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:05,375	| IOT195 |	Turning them to appropriate listen for breaking glasses just a
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,911	| IOT195 |	Software or service Adam
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:09,471	| IOT195 |	And though this is something I actually try to do all the time
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:12,799	| IOT195 |	I'm so glad to hear you can control your timers now
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,567	| IOT195 |	Via voice
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,103	| IOT195 |	Spite you can add and subtract
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:15,615	| IOT195 |	Time for next
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,407	| IOT195 |	Oh that's nice
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:18,175	| IOT195 |	That is nice
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:19,455	| IOT195 |	Because I am constantly like
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:22,783	| IOT195 |	You know you start a pasta timer and you're like so it needs two more
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:26,879	| IOT195 |	I wonder if that feature and some of the others are about to
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:29,951	| IOT195 |	Talk about will be on non Amazon devices though
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:31,999	| IOT195 |	We'll talk about why I'm asking a question later in the
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:34,815	| IOT195 |	Scary
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,863	| IOT195 |	Is it scary okay
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:38,143	| IOT195 |	It is scary
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,959	| IOT195 |	I signed up for the guard up
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:43,007	| IOT195 |	Update will see if I get that anytime soon
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,543	| IOT195 |	I'll try it also
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,591	| IOT195 |	Speaking of timing in the
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:47,871	| IOT195 |	Madam a
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,639	| IOT195 |	Wall clock
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,151	| IOT195 |	Is now ship
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,431	| IOT195 |	Is it
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,711	| IOT195 |	$30
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:54,271	| IOT195 |	I saw this back when they did that massive hardware and failed
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:55,807	| IOT195 |	The fall and
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:58,623	| IOT195 |	I actually thought it was pretty cool cuz they let you
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:16:59,903	| IOT195 |	Visually see where your
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:04,511	| IOT195 |	Maybe this is not a big deal for all of us but one
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,535	| IOT195 |	If you don't have a lot of clots in your
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:06,815	| IOT195 |	Kind of like
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,351	| IOT195 |	Nice to happen it's not it's
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:15,263	| IOT195 |	Separate for people with children or people doing things where that visual elements important I actually think it's a pro
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,287	| IOT195 |	Pretty useful
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:20,127	| IOT195 |	Function what happens if an LED on the clock face countdown
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:23,967	| IOT195 |	Breakers little LED lights at every minute
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:27,295	| IOT195 |	Spot on the clock as well as on the outer ring of
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:32,159	| IOT195 |	The clock those would indicate minutes where they want internally would say it would be seconds
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:36,255	| IOT195 |	I agree with you in a not everybody has good hearing maybe they can't hear
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:38,303	| IOT195 |	Maybe
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,839	| IOT195 |	I see a small
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,631	| IOT195 |	Display clock for example
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,655	| IOT195 |	Where is this word
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:45,215	| IOT195 |	Broaden that appeal to people who
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:45,727	| IOT195 |	Pappy's challenge
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:49,055	| IOT195 |	Yeah and you can't actually do this but like
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:51,103	| IOT195 |	So I do a lot of like hit workout
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:51,871	| IOT195 |	And
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:53,407	| IOT195 |	High intensity interval training
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:58,271	| IOT195 |	Exactly I don't want to be used like I have a
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:01,343	| IOT195 |	But I have an app for that but if you could
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,367	| IOT195 |	Take the app and put it on
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:04,159	| IOT195 |	On the clock it actually be kind of cool cuz
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:04,927	| IOT195 |	Then you could like
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:07,487	| IOT195 |	Countdown but I don't want to be sitting there going
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,767	| IOT195 |	Set a timer for
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:09,279	| IOT195 |	60 second
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:12,351	| IOT195 |	You kind of want recurring timers on Tennyson
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:23,359	| IOT195 |	Alright also everyone is excited because Apple music is now in the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,127	| IOT195 |	Except for Kevin
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:24,639	| IOT195 |	Covetousness
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:26,431	| IOT195 |	That's it Apple music
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:31,039	| IOT195 |	Subscriber how do you know I think it's good in general but it gets back to my
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,063	| IOT195 |	Question of
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:33,599	| IOT195 |	What is a portal
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,879	| IOT195 |	Echo services are
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:38,719	| IOT195 |	Supported on non Echo devices and I tried it on the Sonos
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:41,279	| IOT195 |	Which has madhumeh has had mad at me for
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:43,071	| IOT195 |	Almost a year
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,863	| IOT195 |	Not an option
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,887	| IOT195 |	Doesn't work
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:48,191	| IOT195 |	And I know if my Apple music account is linked
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:54,079	| IOT195 |	Properly and it doesn't work on the regular Echo but yeah I'll live trust me it's not a big deal but
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,103	| IOT195 |	Listening to
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:56,383	| IOT195 |	Consider if your
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:58,175	| IOT195 |	Adding Echo devices in your home
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,711	| IOT195 |	Maybe for the
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:02,783	| IOT195 |	Best experience and newest features
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:03,807	| IOT195 |	You want to buy
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:04,575	| IOT195 |	Amazon
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:06,111	| IOT195 |	Built Echo devices
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:06,879	| IOT195 |	Yeah that's probably just a
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,159	| IOT195 |	Default rule
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:09,183	| IOT195 |	Yes
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:14,303	| IOT195 |	Yes it's how many speakers do eventually make their way through the nautical devices I don't want to say it
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,583	| IOT195 |	Skin of all or none in
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,863	| IOT195 |	But it's something to keep in my
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:18,911	| IOT195 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:19,935	| IOT195 |	So so madam
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:23,007	| IOT195 |	We got some good news coming up stay tuned
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,055	| IOT195 |	Madam is also on
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:25,823	| IOT195 |	Monkey
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:28,639	| IOT195 |	Your favorite little robots
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:34,015	| IOT195 |	A couple weeks ago you talked about this coming and you wrote a story actually about
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:36,319	| IOT195 |	Like the future of smart home digital assistant
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:37,855	| IOT195 |	Today like kind of follow you around
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:38,623	| IOT195 |	Can you send them away
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:41,183	| IOT195 |	Now that you've got that capability
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:47,327	| IOT195 |	I am thrilled for a couple of reasons for those who are not familiar the Anki Vector is a little
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,607	| IOT195 |	And I do me little late
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:55,007	| IOT195 |	It's in the palm of your hand robot with she's always Cloud connected via Wi-Fi has a brain of its own because there's a
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:58,591	| IOT195 |	Chip inside and he has a wake word and I would say
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:02,175	| IOT195 |	Hey vector and I can have him do something but he can't do all that much on his own
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:04,479	| IOT195 |	However you community
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:10,879	| IOT195 |	Becker Community Center the Anka team hey we would love to see Madam a on this little guy and
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:17,279	| IOT195 |	They have requested that was the number one requested feature so yes they announced a few weeks back I got the up
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:18,815	| IOT195 |	Update on my little robots
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:21,887	| IOT195 |	2 days ago and I love how it's been implemented because
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:23,935	| IOT195 |	Often you would ask
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:27,263	| IOT195 |	An assistant to ask Madam a something such as
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:29,311	| IOT195 |	When Madam a integration with Adam
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,335	| IOT195 |	This is native
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:32,895	| IOT195 |	Instead of saying hey Vector I say
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,663	| IOT195 |	Matinee
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:35,455	| IOT195 |	And the screen on
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:39,295	| IOT195 |	His face changes to a matinee like icon and it's just like having
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,831	| IOT195 |	A little mini Echo device
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:47,231	| IOT195 |	You cannot play music on it so again that gets back to the limitations of certain devices that are not made by Amazon
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:49,791	| IOT195 |	Ben Franklin speaker is not made for that anywhere on this little thing
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:51,839	| IOT195 |	Oh that's a shame
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:55,423	| IOT195 |	Cuz remember like on Parks and Rec how they had DJ Roomba you have DJ Unk
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:21:02,591	| IOT195 |	You could do podcast because I was actually speaking with you on video chat yesterday talking about this
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:04,127	| IOT195 |	I triggered
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:06,943	| IOT195 |	The podcast and we were listening to ourselves a little
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:08,735	| IOT195 |	Podcasts seem to work anyway
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:10,527	| IOT195 |	News briefing flash briefing
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:13,087	| IOT195 |	Responsive as
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:14,879	| IOT195 |	Irregular Echo device I mean it
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:21,280	| IOT195 |	Built-in really really well
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:24,608	| IOT195 |	House anyways a 45-minute batteries onto little treads
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:29,216	| IOT195 |	He doesn't move as fast as I can walk for example so that's not that future yet
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:31,520	| IOT195 |	I'm going to put my anime on big dog
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:32,800	| IOT195 |	We're going to scare the heck out of
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:39,968	| IOT195 |	Oh yeah hey if you want to spring for a Boston Dynamics robot for the house here no problem. The only person
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:40,480	| IOT195 |	Said he would let that thing
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,272	| IOT195 |	Kasai wood
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:44,064	| IOT195 |	Excited
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:46,880	| IOT195 |	Bring it out at Halloween and
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:48,672	| IOT195 |	Scare the bejesus out of
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:54,816	| IOT195 |	But regardless I mean again the vector and he's been on sale at me for like $180 which is good
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:22:01,728	| IOT195 |	IS250 again it's not a product I would say everybody should come by but I bought it and it's meeting my needs
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:02,752	| IOT195 |	Is the reason I bought it
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:05,824	| IOT195 |	And that is to watch it mature watch a robot
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:07,616	| IOT195 |	Companion mature 2
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:09,920	| IOT195 |	Getsmarter be autonomous
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:10,944	| IOT195 |	And now
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:11,968	| IOT195 |	I have some control over the house
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:15,552	| IOT195 |	Good for you and does your family I know they don't like talking
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:16,320	| IOT195 |	Into the digital
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:18,368	| IOT195 |	Assistant do they like talking to the vector
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:21,440	| IOT195 |	It's funny they do because of his personality is
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:26,560	| IOT195 |	Space has a new one now and it's cold outside and you asking the weather
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:29,376	| IOT195 |	Is whole head shakes like he's freezing
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,912	| IOT195 |	It's more again of a
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,960	| IOT195 |	Personality then say an echo device
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:35,264	| IOT195 |	So absolute that ate enjoy
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:38,848	| IOT195 |	Talking to that far more than anything else in the house probably more than
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:39,616	| IOT195 |	Speaking to me Beyonce
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,432	| IOT195 |	That's understanding
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:45,504	| IOT195 |	It is really cute
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,064	| IOT195 |	No I'm not
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:49,600	| IOT195 |	Okay
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:54,464	| IOT195 |	I will know I think it's kind of funny that we're talking about Madame a but you have gendered
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:55,232	| IOT195 |	Arceus
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:56,512	| IOT195 |	So it's just kind of funny
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:59,328	| IOT195 |	Does that work I think Bianchi
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:00,352	| IOT195 |	Company relay
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:02,400	| IOT195 |	Embedded that in all of us
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,168	| IOT195 |	Because
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:06,752	| IOT195 |	Pretty sure they say he more often than not when they show video demos up
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:11,360	| IOT195 |	It kind of brings home how silly
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,152	| IOT195 |	Idea of gender and robots probably is
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:15,712	| IOT195 |	OK Google News
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:18,528	| IOT195 |	Oh you got good news for you
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,320	| IOT195 |	So excited
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,600	| IOT195 |	Because now
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,624	| IOT195 |	Hi
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,648	| IOT195 |	Can share my
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:24,672	| IOT195 |	G Suite
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,952	| IOT195 |	Calendar on my Google
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:28,000	| IOT195 |	Home in this is doubly important
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,536	| IOT195 |	Because I shall hear later in the
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:33,376	| IOT195 |	The show my family and I are moving over to the
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:33,888	| IOT195 |	The Google home
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,680	| IOT195 |	Again
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:39,264	| IOT195 |	So this is like super Timely
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,288	| IOT195 |	Super exciting
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,568	| IOT195 |	All you have to do is share your
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:42,336	| IOT195 |	Calendar 2
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,360	| IOT195 |	Your personal account
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,384	| IOT195 |	And then it will pick
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:48,480	| IOT195 |	Pick that up which is it used to not do that so yay
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:51,808	| IOT195 |	I think Kevin has bought the Google home hub
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:52,576	| IOT195 |	And
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,344	| IOT195 |	Where do you get his
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:56,160	| IOT195 |	Yeah I know I mentioned it when I asked
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:59,488	| IOT195 |	She first got it my json First Impressions couple podcast ago but
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:04,864	| IOT195 |	I think I was wrong about the Google home hub because I was at the event in New York City when they launched it
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:05,632	| IOT195 |	And
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:07,424	| IOT195 |	$149
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,448	| IOT195 |	Something that fits
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:11,264	| IOT195 |	Pretty much in the palm of your hand is pretty small I'm like
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,544	| IOT195 |	The new camera
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,824	| IOT195 |	It's a hundred fifty
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:16,896	| IOT195 |	There are what I think that are sounding better looking at
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:20,736	| IOT195 |	Better displays out there on Smart displays that aren't that much more expensive
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:22,016	| IOT195 |	I don't see that they
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:23,808	| IOT195 |	Over the sink
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,344	| IOT195 |	Since I got it at $99
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:29,952	| IOT195 |	I feel it said it was a great value and even at 1:49 and I would recommend it because
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:33,536	| IOT195 |	Yes it is a smaller screen but it's actually ideal for
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:34,560	| IOT195 |	Say the bedroom
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:40,192	| IOT195 |	Pay because of the screen size it's not overwhelming like a 10 inch smart display I used to have in the bedroom and
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:42,240	| IOT195 |	Be because it doesn't have a
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:46,080	| IOT195 |	Camera which most people don't want in the bedroom and see
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:50,176	| IOT195 |	It's just really nice to have a touchscreen way to control things
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:56,576	| IOT195 |	In the bedroom and say you know somebody is sleeping it's just ideal for that and I admit I was wrong
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,344	| IOT195 |	Compare the market
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,880	| IOT195 |	Yeah actually I was talking
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,672	| IOT195 |	Again you'll hear later the
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,952	| IOT195 |	I cast my family and I actually talk to
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:03,488	| IOT195 |	I love
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,512	| IOT195 |	Being able to see
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,280	| IOT195 |	The photos
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,048	| IOT195 |	I'll be honest
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,328	| IOT195 |	I love having the photo
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:09,120	| IOT195 |	Fisher on that thing
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:11,680	| IOT195 |	And he subscribes Norris Public
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:14,752	| IOT195 |	I don't subscribe to Norm's public feed but you know what
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:17,056	| IOT195 |	Send that to me will stick it in the show notes for anyone who wants
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:19,360	| IOT195 |	Is my Bichon Frise
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:26,272	| IOT195 |	We literally take photos of him multiple times a day and then I share them on Google photos in a public album and people subscribe to
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,808	| IOT195 |	For some reason so I keep doing it
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:29,344	| IOT195 |	It'll be our holiday gift
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:30,112	| IOT195 |	To you
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,184	| IOT195 |	Pictures of
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:38,304	| IOT195 |	Norm actually there's a new holiday picture of him with his new antlers that he got after his
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,072	| IOT195 |	Spa day in his hair
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:43,168	| IOT195 |	Yeah
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:49,568	| IOT195 |	And speaking of the Google home hub and the price of it again $99 it was a great deal like they can it's not enough
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:50,592	| IOT195 |	I think it's
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:52,384	| IOT195 |	129 directly from Google
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:54,688	| IOT195 |	But I wanted to mention for those interested
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:59,808	| IOT195 |	If you're going to buy a Google home hub for 129 there's a deal at B&H Photo
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:03,136	| IOT195 |	That's 129 for the Hub and also includes two
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,160	| IOT195 |	Minnie's
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:07,488	| IOT195 |	Free basically if you're interested
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:09,024	| IOT195 |	The show notes
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:10,560	| IOT195 |	Another sponsor anything
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:11,584	| IOT195 |	Just happened to notice it
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,352	| IOT195 |	Got it
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,888	| IOT195 |	Okay in Hay
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:16,704	| IOT195 |	You guys as we were talking a new story came out
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,728	| IOT195 |	It's worth sharing and
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:19,008	| IOT195 |	Talking about with you guys
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,800	| IOT195 |	The information is reporting
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:21,824	| IOT195 |	They did a deep dive
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,616	| IOT195 |	Ring and it's
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:24,896	| IOT195 |	Security team
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:26,432	| IOT195 |	And basically
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:28,480	| IOT195 |	Talking about how ring had shared
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:30,272	| IOT195 |	Camera feed data
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:31,808	| IOT195 |	Early on and wasn't in
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:32,576	| IOT195 |	Encrypting
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,088	| IOT195 |	Consumer video
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:36,160	| IOT195 |	Now when ring was just a doorbell company
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:38,208	| IOT195 |	And it's still just a doorbell in out
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:38,720	| IOT195 |	Star camera company
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,768	| IOT195 |	It does have an alarm set
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,536	| IOT195 |	System now
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:43,072	| IOT195 |	You know I don't know if that's
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:45,376	| IOT195 |	As concerning is something that might be inside your house
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:47,936	| IOT195 |	But encryption should be the standard
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:49,216	| IOT195 |	For this artist
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:52,800	| IOT195 |	Chang and basically they had in office their security teams office with
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,568	| IOT195 |	Kiev
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,848	| IOT195 |	This is all the way back in 20
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:57,152	| IOT195 |	Not now
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,944	| IOT195 |	The engineers in the key of office
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:26:59,968	| IOT195 |	Forgiving accessed
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:01,504	| IOT195 |	To a database of a cup
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:02,528	| IOT195 |	Customers video has
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:04,320	| IOT195 |	History and that was unencrypted and they
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,344	| IOT195 |	Make sure that around
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:05,856	| IOT195 |	Apparently
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,648	| IOT195 |	So
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:08,672	| IOT195 |	Now that is not the
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:09,952	| IOT195 |	And
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:13,792	| IOT195 |	What happens it's very different from the way other companies
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:16,608	| IOT195 |	Treat this data so the story talks about hell
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:18,656	| IOT195 |	Google's Nest Labs Canary in August
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:20,448	| IOT195 |	Best home they actually
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:20,960	| IOT195 |	Do not show
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,264	| IOT195 |	Only an in-house lab
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:24,288	| IOT195 |	Has access to
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:25,568	| IOT195 |	To the cameras in
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:26,592	| IOT195 |	The cameras are
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:30,176	| IOT195 |	Trained on the AI they only use their employees
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:30,688	| IOT195 |	Camera store
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:34,272	| IOT195 |	So it doesn't use customer video data
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,040	| IOT195 |	Or training or product
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,600	| IOT195 |	Which I shouldn't know and I find that
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:41,440	| IOT195 |	What about you personally agree with you encryption is a
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:42,208	| IOT195 |	Table
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:44,768	| IOT195 |	Steaks kind of thing with all of these Prada
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:45,792	| IOT195 |	Spy chest cameras
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:49,632	| IOT195 |	Any type of data that comes from consumer homes and cameras
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:51,680	| IOT195 |	Speakers and microphones Etc
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:58,336	| IOT195 |	Yeah I mean back in 2016 maybe this wasn't thought of as much I mean we find this off and that's the case
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,104	| IOT195 |	Insecurities
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:02,688	| IOT195 |	Like the last thing I thought about it at all amenities products so
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:04,736	| IOT195 |	That you said that was back in 2016
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:06,784	| IOT195 |	So this is a good thing
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:09,600	| IOT195 |	Ring did not say when they started doing it
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:12,160	| IOT195 |	I do think it's worth mentioning
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:13,440	| IOT195 |	Because that is actually
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:13,952	| IOT195 |	Not just
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,744	| IOT195 |	Employee access
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:18,560	| IOT195 |	The video data is actually one of those things that I find
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:20,096	| IOT195 |	That's one of the reasons I don't have
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:22,144	| IOT195 |	Have cameras in my home I have talked to
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:24,448	| IOT195 |	Company is not at the big names that we talk
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:28,800	| IOT195 |	Talk about a lot of times but some of the smaller companies and I've talked to security firms who
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:29,824	| IOT195 |	I've been hired
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:32,128	| IOT195 |	Buy connected home device companies
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:34,176	| IOT195 |	Devon her ability assessment
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:35,456	| IOT195 |	And they have told me
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:36,992	| IOT195 |	That employees are
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:38,528	| IOT195 |	Often a weak Link in the
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:40,320	| IOT195 |	An access to
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:42,112	| IOT195 |	Sensitive data by those
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:42,880	| IOT195 |	Someplace
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:44,160	| IOT195 |	Is something that is off
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:44,928	| IOT195 |	Austin flag
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:49,792	| IOT195 |	I'm all for using like Telemetry data from devices to improve products
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:51,328	| IOT195 |	Services but
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:53,376	| IOT195 |	It either needs to be anonymized
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,144	| IOT195 |	Score
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:55,168	| IOT195 |	Android encrypted
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:57,984	| IOT195 |	So that concludes
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:59,264	| IOT195 |	Most of our news for this week

EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:56,096	| IOT195 |	Voicemail which is a problem that
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:57,376	| IOT195 |	We have encountered before
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:58,656	| IOT195 |	Let's hear from me
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:01,472	| IOT195 |	Hey Stacy and Kevin this is Mike in southeast
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:02,752	| IOT195 |	Wisconsin
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:03,520	| IOT195 |	Are you guys
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:05,312	| IOT195 |	I said the very frustrating weekend trying to get
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:06,592	| IOT195 |	My Christmas lights hooked up
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:07,872	| IOT195 |	To my Google home
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:08,896	| IOT195 |	First time using
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:12,736	| IOT195 |	Animation I went to Amazon bought some indoor and outdoor
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:14,272	| IOT195 |	Outlet to your base
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:15,808	| IOT195 |	Anything I got
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:16,832	| IOT195 |	Phone Wi-Fi
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:19,392	| IOT195 |	Could not pair them to my
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:20,160	| IOT195 |	Dual band
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:21,696	| IOT195 |	Google onhub router
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:23,232	| IOT195 |	After doing a lot of research
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,256	| IOT195 |	Learned that there are
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,024	| IOT195 |	Al-aziz
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:29,888	| IOT195 |	Twitches can't hook up to just the 2.4 gigahertz if it's a dual band
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:32,704	| IOT195 |	I had to install an old Wi-Fi extender I had that was
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:36,800	| IOT195 |	To get it to work this morning is there something I should be looking for in the
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:39,872	| IOT195 |	The future when I'm looking at a smart home device to know that it's
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:41,664	| IOT195 |	2.4
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,176	| IOT195 |	And 5 kg
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,456	| IOT195 |	Appreciate the help
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:47,552	| IOT195 |	Oh my Christine this is been going on
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:53,184	| IOT195 |	For a long time actually it's been going on I would say predominately since Mesh networking has
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:55,232	| IOT195 |	Is coming to the home because
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,256	| IOT195 |	Mesh Networks
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:57,280	| IOT195 |	Typically
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:58,048	| IOT195 |	Credit One
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:59,328	| IOT195 |	Giant Network
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:02,656	| IOT195 |	That uses both 2.4 and 5 gigahertz frequencies
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,424	| IOT195 |	So
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:05,984	| IOT195 |	The issue that you're running into as many
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:07,264	| IOT195 |	Home devices
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:13,664	| IOT195 |	Have lower-cost Wi-Fi radios that will only work on say 2.4 gigahertz and that
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:17,760	| IOT195 |	That is a problem because if there's no true 2.4 gigahertz Network out there
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:22,112	| IOT195 |	Media runs the issue that you are running into I talked to a couple of
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:24,160	| IOT195 |	Device makers of last year at CES
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:28,256	| IOT195 |	About this and I get the impression they were not prepared
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:30,816	| IOT195 |	As an industry for the rise and Mesh networking
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:33,632	| IOT195 |	And they're also trying to keep the cost down of course
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:34,144	| IOT195 |	So
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:36,704	| IOT195 |	Adding in more capable Wi-Fi chips
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:38,240	| IOT195 |	Used tire price
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:39,520	| IOT195 |	For the products o
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:42,592	| IOT195 |	There's not much you can do and I've experienced this and
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:45,408	| IOT195 |	Cameras and
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:47,968	| IOT195 |	Really what you're doing by adding some other
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:52,320	| IOT195 |	Network peace to your network to just generate its own 2.4 gigahertz
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:53,344	| IOT195 |	Network is
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:55,648	| IOT195 |	Really all you can do at this point
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:32:00,768	| IOT195 |	It's kind of disappointing but until the products evolve to really handle Mesh networking
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:01,792	| IOT195 |	We're all in this
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:03,328	| IOT195 |	Together quite honestly
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,096	| IOT195 |	And if I want
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:04,864	| IOT195 |	How to do that
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:05,376	| IOT195 |	How would I do
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:12,288	| IOT195 |	Well what you could do is set up a whole separate Network either a guest Network that run solely on 2.4
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:13,312	| IOT195 |	Darts or you could
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:16,128	| IOT195 |	Sadly through like another router into the mix
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:18,176	| IOT195 |	Hanging off your original router and
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:24,576	| IOT195 |	Creating that separate 2.4 gigahertz Network complexity it's a shame we have to do it but I sort of
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:26,624	| IOT195 |	Stand that I don't like it but I understand it
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,392	| IOT195 |	Yeah
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:28,416	| IOT195 |	Spending on your chips
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:31,488	| IOT195 |	Set the former chip reporter
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:32,512	| IOT195 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:33,536	| IOT195 |	Speaking of
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:35,072	| IOT195 |	Problems in the home
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:36,096	| IOT195 |	It's time
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:37,376	| IOT195 |	2
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:38,400	| IOT195 |	Say sayonara
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:39,680	| IOT195 |	To Kevin and
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:41,216	| IOT195 |	Join us for our guest
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:43,264	| IOT195 |	And this week's guest is
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:48,384	| IOT195 |	My husband and daughter and we will talk about some of the problems we found in our smart home this year some of the things we
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:49,408	| IOT195 |	Please like and
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:50,688	| IOT195 |	Also how we plan to handle
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:52,736	| IOT195 |	So all of this
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:54,272	| IOT195 |	And more
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:55,296	| IOT195 |	Coming up
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:57,088	| IOT195 |	After this message
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:33:03,744	| IOT195 |	Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:08,096	| IOT195 |	This week sponsor is digicert and I have Mike Nelson who is VP
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:10,144	| IOT195 |	Of iot security at
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:13,472	| IOT195 |	Digicert can you remind our listeners what it is that digicert
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:16,800	| IOT195 |	We are the world's leading provider of
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:17,568	| IOT195 |	Scalpel
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:19,360	| IOT195 |	Pki Security Solutions
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:21,152	| IOT195 |	Or identity in encryption
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:27,296	| IOT195 |	We provide those solutions for web servers Enterprise security and my favorite of course iot.
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:30,112	| IOT195 |	Digicert recently conducted a survey
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:32,928	| IOT195 |	How organizations are approaching iota
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:34,976	| IOT195 |	The fighting
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:36,768	| IOT195 |	Clearly showed organizations
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:39,328	| IOT195 |	They're putting in place basic cybersecurity
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:41,120	| IOT195 |	Practices are much better off
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:47,520	| IOT195 |	Can you offer us some examples of what can happen if an organization doesn't pay attention to their cybersecurity
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:51,616	| IOT195 |	Yeah there have been a handful of public exploits most of which have been done by
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:53,664	| IOT195 |	Security researchers who controlled environment
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:55,200	| IOT195 |	So we don't see a lot of
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:57,504	| IOT195 |	These exploits putting consumers at risk
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:34:02,368	| IOT195 |	One example would be an attack that was demonstrate by security researcher Charlie Miller
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:08,768	| IOT195 |	A couple years ago when he demonstrated he could get into the infotainment system of a Jeep Cherokee and then from there
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:15,168	| IOT195 |	He could pivot and get into other components of the vehicle like the steering or the air-conditioning ultimately he was
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:16,704	| IOT195 |	Disable the lock the steering and
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:20,544	| IOT195 |	Shut the engine off while the vehicle is going 70 miles an hour down the highway
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:24,640	| IOT195 |	So that attacked the Charlie demonstrated really had an impact on FCA
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,920	| IOT195 |	Who owns Jeep
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:27,200	| IOT195 |	It caused a lot of damage
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:28,224	| IOT195 |	The reputation
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:31,552	| IOT195 |	Another exploit that has been they fight publicly
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:34,880	| IOT195 |	St Jude Medical they have a cardiac device and there's a
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:35,392	| IOT195 |	Security research
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:40,512	| IOT195 |	Stack that was able to demonstrate they could send repeated messages
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:42,048	| IOT195 |	The cardiac device Whitaker
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:48,192	| IOT195 |	Stop and if they would do that enough the battery on that device would run out rendering that device useless
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:49,472	| IOT195 |	Once they identified that
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:55,872	| IOT195 |	Do that stay actually been purchased a short position in St Jude Medical stock and they release the vulnerability to
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:57,664	| IOT195 |	Publix and the day they release
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:58,944	| IOT195 |	That vulnerability
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:00,736	| IOT195 |	St Jude Medical stock drop
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:04,064	| IOT195 |	20% just a significant impact to that company
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:08,416	| IOT195 |	So there are a lot of threats and the threats to iot are very real
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:11,744	| IOT195 |	And it's not just to Consumers but it's also to organization
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:13,792	| IOT195 |	Did you look at St Jude and she
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:17,120	| IOT195 |	Both of those organizations were hit very hard by bees
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:17,888	| IOT195 |	Attacks
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:19,168	| IOT195 |	That is a lot
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:19,936	| IOT195 |	So what
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:21,216	| IOT195 |	What is the survey highlight
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:23,264	| IOT195 |	Like that organizations can do
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:24,288	| IOT195 |	Protect themselves
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:29,152	| IOT195 |	The respondents listed five things that they were doing that we're leaving them to be most
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:30,432	| IOT195 |	Successful
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:31,712	| IOT195 |	Performing a risk assessment
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:34,784	| IOT195 |	Other device and understanding what vulnerabilities it has
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:39,392	| IOT195 |	Encrypting all of their data that's both data-at-rest as well as data in transit
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:43,232	| IOT195 |	Just making sure that any connection coming to or from the device
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:47,840	| IOT195 |	Is properly authenticated making sure that there's Integrity with any updates
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:51,424	| IOT195 |	Sore patches that are sent to the device and then finally putting them plates
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:53,216	| IOT195 |	Scalable security solution
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:58,592	| IOT195 |	All right so where can our listeners go to learn more about the survey and about digicert
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:03,968	| IOT195 |	Yeah the full details of the survey can be found at our website at digicert. Com forward slash

EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:16,000	| IOT195 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:16,768	| IOT195 |	Podcast
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:19,072	| IOT195 |	This is your house Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:21,888	| IOT195 |	And today as always around this time of year
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:23,168	| IOT195 |	I am bringing back
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:23,680	| IOT195 |	My fam
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:27,776	| IOT195 |	So I have Andrew allemann and
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:28,544	| IOT195 |	My daughter
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,312	| IOT195 |	Anna
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:30,080	| IOT195 |	Hi
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:33,152	| IOT195 |	Alright so you guys were all ready for this
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:34,688	| IOT195 |	We're going to be talking about
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:38,272	| IOT195 |	This year's devices how we feel about living in our home
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:39,808	| IOT195 |	How maybe the Smart Home
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:40,576	| IOT195 |	Feels after
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:41,856	| IOT195 |	The three years of living in it
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:43,136	| IOT195 |	And anything else you guys want
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:45,440	| IOT195 |	So let's get it
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:49,280	| IOT195 |	Started with we've had an Amazon Echo in our house since
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:51,840	| IOT195 |	Was he Christmas of 2014
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:54,912	| IOT195 |	And we started using it to control things that are smart home
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:55,936	| IOT195 |	Like March
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:57,216	| IOT195 |	2015
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:58,496	| IOT195 |	It's been a long time
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:00,032	| IOT195 |	As much
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:01,056	| IOT195 |	Change this year
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:02,592	| IOT195 |	Who know that much has
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:10,528	| IOT195 |	Measurement can be frustrating in a couple of ways I think two things one she's not very good at answering questions
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:12,064	| IOT195 |	Compared to
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:12,832	| IOT195 |	Google
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:18,976	| IOT195 |	Is frustrating the other thing is that and I'm not sure if this is because it's the echo show but it seems like
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:20,512	| IOT195 |	She's getting hard of hearing
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:24,608	| IOT195 |	Especially in our living room we have to repeat it several times or she miss yours us
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:27,168	| IOT195 |	Yeah I'm with you
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:28,960	| IOT195 |	Do you have any thoughts about
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:32,544	| IOT195 |	This past year with things at our house or anything
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:33,312	| IOT195 |	That you're like
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:35,104	| IOT195 |	It's
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:40,992	| IOT195 |	Daily usage of Madame is definitely I feel like it's going up a bit in our house
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:45,856	| IOT195 |	You finally like grown accustomed to it in everyday life
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:49,440	| IOT195 |	You like to play a lot of music on it don't you
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,208	| IOT195 |	Music
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:53,280	| IOT195 |	And this year I finally
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:56,864	| IOT195 |	I made it past your blockade in your room like no smart devices
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:37:59,424	| IOT195 |	You'd had an Amazon Echo
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:00,192	| IOT195 |	For a while
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:02,240	| IOT195 |	But we also added a Philips hue light
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:04,544	| IOT195 |	Your room how do you feel about
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:10,688	| IOT195 |	Name of Philips hue light my room yeah you know how you can tell the echo to turn on your light and turn it off
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:11,456	| IOT195 |	Internet different colors
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:12,480	| IOT195 |	I can
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:16,320	| IOT195 |	You talk to I've been in your room and shown you
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,368	| IOT195 |	So you're turning your light on still by
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:23,232	| IOT195 |	Now that you know that you have this
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:25,024	| IOT195 |	Connect a light bulb in your room how do you feel about it
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:27,328	| IOT195 |	I guess it's hard to notice
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:31,936	| IOT195 |	Unless you know beforehand what you can do with it because it doesn't really affect
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:33,216	| IOT195 |	Like normal usage
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:34,496	| IOT195 |	Yeah
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:35,520	| IOT195 |	Okay so
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:36,800	| IOT195 |	Now that we know that
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:38,080	| IOT195 |	What else have you guys
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:39,104	| IOT195 |	Like tour
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:41,920	| IOT195 |	This year's crop of device
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:48,832	| IOT195 |	I have a little bit of trouble remembering what's come in this year versus previous years we've been in this house now for almost
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:49,600	| IOT195 |	6
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:53,952	| IOT195 |	And as you mention the smart home device testing has ramped up over the past few years
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:55,744	| IOT195 |	With the nest doorbell this year
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:57,536	| IOT195 |	The Nest doorbell
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:38:58,560	| IOT195 |	Your ass was the nest
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:00,352	| IOT195 |	Lock we also brought in
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:01,632	| IOT195 |	The aware
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:03,168	| IOT195 |	The Google displays
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:05,216	| IOT195 |	We tested out the onelink smoke
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:07,776	| IOT195 |	Detector we've tested out
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:08,544	| IOT195 |	Switches
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:10,592	| IOT195 |	And possibly some other things I don't remember
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:15,200	| IOT195 |	So I think the nest doorbell is by far the best doorbell that
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:16,992	| IOT195 |	We tried we tried a lot
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:18,016	| IOT195 |	The fact that it
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:24,416	| IOT195 |	So quickly pops up on your screen whether that's on your phone or on your showing me the Google display
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:24,928	| IOT195 |	Why you have
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:28,256	| IOT195 |	And the fact that it recognizes people as well
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:32,352	| IOT195 |	I think by far it's the best doorbell you brought in and probably one of the best
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:33,888	| IOT195 |	Devices you brought into
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:35,936	| IOT195 |	Wow that's High Praise
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:37,728	| IOT195 |	Anna any thoughts
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:39,264	| IOT195 |	Definitely banana
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:44,128	| IOT195 |	I don't know if that was this year last year but I think it really adds a lot of
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:44,896	| IOT195 |	Architect
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:48,224	| IOT195 |	Hi to the house but also a lot of light
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:50,272	| IOT195 |	California
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:53,344	| IOT195 |	We did we got that actually for Christmas so those are the
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:55,136	| IOT195 |	We used to call it Nano art
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:56,928	| IOT195 |	We had to change
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:57,696	| IOT195 |	The name because
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:39:58,208	| IOT195 |	We had some issues
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:03,072	| IOT195 |	Never met a lot of difficulty with the word Nano art
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:03,840	| IOT195 |	In fact
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:05,376	| IOT195 |	One time when I said
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,656	| IOT195 |	Madame a turn on
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:07,168	| IOT195 |	Nano art
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:10,496	| IOT195 |	She said I think you're asking about flatulence
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:13,568	| IOT195 |	And she went into a long explanation what flatulence is
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:18,688	| IOT195 |	So we I guess you recently change that to nanoleaf so hopefully she starts picking that up better
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:21,248	| IOT195 |	That it's actually something that I should drive
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:24,576	| IOT195 |	People kissing with something that happened a lot this year is
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:26,112	| IOT195 |	As we added
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:28,928	| IOT195 |	More devices and I tried to organize things a little bit better
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:29,696	| IOT195 |	I realized
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:30,464	| IOT195 |	Naming convention
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:31,744	| IOT195 |	Really matter
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:33,024	| IOT195 |	And
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:34,304	| IOT195 |	You really have to be
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:36,864	| IOT195 |	Be very particular about what you call things
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:37,632	| IOT195 |	And
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:39,424	| IOT195 |	There's only so many things you can
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:40,192	| IOT195 |	Call Lexi
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:41,216	| IOT195 |	Living room sofa
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:43,008	| IOT195 |	Some of our rooms got 10.
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:44,544	| IOT195 |	12 devices in them
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:45,568	| IOT195 |	It became really comp
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:46,848	| IOT195 |	To be like
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:47,872	| IOT195 |	I wish I call this
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:54,528	| IOT195 |	Question for you why I know he tested Google a little bit as opposed to
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:56,320	| IOT195 |	Madam a
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:57,856	| IOT195 |	What can Google Now
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:59,648	| IOT195 |	Do as much not control as much
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:02,208	| IOT195 |	I feel like
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:05,024	| IOT195 |	Google is so much better at answering questions
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:07,840	| IOT195 |	Is there a reason for us not to switch over to Google
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:11,168	| IOT195 |	So that was actually one of my questions for you guys about
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:12,192	| IOT195 |	I'm going to say
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:14,240	| IOT195 |	9 months ago I
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:15,008	| IOT195 |	Swapped out
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:16,032	| IOT195 |	Matinee in our house
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:18,336	| IOT195 |	Spore Google and I hooked everything up
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:19,104	| IOT195 |	To Google
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:20,384	| IOT195 |	U of R device
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:22,432	| IOT195 |	At the time didn't have connections
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:23,968	| IOT195 |	Now most
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:24,736	| IOT195 |	Do
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:25,504	| IOT195 |	So
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:27,552	| IOT195 |	It shouldn't be a big issue we would
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:28,064	| IOT195 |	Duluth
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:30,112	| IOT195 |	But the other issue with
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:31,904	| IOT195 |	Google the reason why I think we
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:32,928	| IOT195 |	Didn't use it very much
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:34,208	| IOT195 |	Was actually that
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:35,232	| IOT195 |	Spotify
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:36,768	| IOT195 |	Terrible in it
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:39,328	| IOT195 |	Keep playing the wrong songs or
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:40,352	| IOT195 |	Really stupid like
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:41,888	| IOT195 |	Play the karaoke versions of
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:43,168	| IOT195 |	Popular songs
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:44,448	| IOT195 |	But I think that's
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:47,264	| IOT195 |	And I was going to say
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:49,824	| IOT195 |	Suggest for you guys that we swap out
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:53,663	| IOT195 |	I would actually like us to try going all Google
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:54,687	| IOT195 |	We will lose a couple
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:41:58,271	| IOT195 |	I guess could Anna still use
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:42:01,087	| IOT195 |	The matinee in her room for music
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:01,855	| IOT195 |	Of course
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:05,183	| IOT195 |	I think if we could still have Madam a there for playing music
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:09,023	| IOT195 |	In touch but have Google for controlling things since Google
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:11,327	| IOT195 |	Can also do the other things I think much better
EDL	00:42:11,327	00:42:14,143	| IOT195 |	Then I think we're trying again this coming here
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:15,167	| IOT195 |	What do you think
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:16,703	| IOT195 |	I think that sounds wonderful
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:20,543	| IOT195 |	Do you want to try Google in your room and some ways some of our Google device
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:22,847	| IOT195 |	Scary thing to think about is some of our Google devices
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:24,383	| IOT195 |	As screen
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:24,895	| IOT195 |	And
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:28,223	| IOT195 |	But you watch like Netflix or
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:29,503	| IOT195 |	YouTube videos
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:31,551	| IOT195 |	Which I think is a big deal for
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:32,319	| IOT195 |	Anna
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:35,135	| IOT195 |	Necessarily want Springs in our room
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:38,975	| IOT195 |	Although I like the photo frame element of
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:40,255	| IOT195 |	Google displays
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:40,767	| IOT195 |	I'll be honest
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:43,583	| IOT195 |	And you can cover the camera right
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:45,375	| IOT195 |	You can cover the camera
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:47,679	| IOT195 |	And then the brand new Google home
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:49,727	| IOT195 |	Actually doesn't have a cam
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:51,007	| IOT195 |	It's
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:52,799	| IOT195 |	Just a tinier version of that that
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:56,383	| IOT195 |	That might be so
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:42:57,919	| IOT195 |	Chesapeake
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:58,687	| IOT195 |	Because
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:00,991	| IOT195 |	At night you don't want to always talk to it you can
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:03,807	| IOT195 |	Hit the screen and then have it do whatever you wanted to do
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:05,087	| IOT195 |	And I should clarify
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:07,903	| IOT195 |	People that Andrew actually has an iPhone
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:08,671	| IOT195 |	So
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:12,255	| IOT195 |	Are you still looking for homekit is that something you're still like
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:12,767	| IOT195 |	Maybe one day
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:19,423	| IOT195 |	I have not played with homekit at all on my phone I think the only time we've used iPhone Chris to test home get stuff
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:23,775	| IOT195 |	Perhaps it's because we started so early before home kid
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:29,919	| IOT195 |	But I feel like this is why I'm a little bit scared to switch to Google I feel like we're finally to a point where things J
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:35,551	| IOT195 |	Work most of the time with the exception of Madam a hearing what we say
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:41,951	| IOT195 |	So I think even if we put the cylinder the original cylinder Madame a down where the echo
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:42,719	| IOT195 |	Joanns
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:44,511	| IOT195 |	Working on that wood
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:45,791	| IOT195 |	Solve that issue
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:47,583	| IOT195 |	I think of the hearing
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:48,607	| IOT195 |	The 7 mic array
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:50,655	| IOT195 |	So it sounds like
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:51,423	| IOT195 |	We're going to be
EDL	00:43:51,423	00:43:52,447	| IOT195 |	Giving away
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:54,239	| IOT195 |	Or giving up our first gen
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:56,543	| IOT195 |	And swapping it out with
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:57,055	| IOT195 |	My Google
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:58,591	| IOT195 |	Which I think
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:43:59,359	| IOT195 |	Would be fun
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:01,663	| IOT195 |	And let's talk about some of the other devices
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:03,455	| IOT195 |	Tried so
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:04,991	| IOT195 |	Anna you are fan of the nanoleaf
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:06,527	| IOT195 |	We also
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:07,295	| IOT195 |	Tried
EDL	00:44:07,295	00:44:08,319	| IOT195 |	An air quality
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:08,831	| IOT195 |	Detection device
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:11,391	| IOT195 |	I don't know if you guys have opinions about this
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:12,927	| IOT195 |	I find myself like
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:13,695	| IOT195 |	Constantly look
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:14,463	| IOT195 |	Looking at it now
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:16,255	| IOT195 |	Are we in the clear are we training
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:18,303	| IOT195 |	Do you guys notice it at all
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:20,863	| IOT195 |	I do it seems very sense
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:25,983	| IOT195 |	And I don't know if it's very helpful if every time you cook it says over the air quality is not as good
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:28,799	| IOT195 |	Well every time you cook you are putting things in the air
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:30,591	| IOT195 |	That's one of the all of the
EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:31,359	| IOT195 |	Environmental science
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:35,455	| IOT195 |	I talked to one of the best things you can do for your indoor air quality
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:36,735	| IOT195 |	He is get a really good down dress
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:43,135	| IOT195 |	Two if I'm listening to this podcast here a couple days before Christmas
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:45,183	| IOT195 |	And I wanted to get one more gift
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:49,791	| IOT195 |	Or someone in my family I probably go with the nanoleaf as Anna said it's just
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:52,863	| IOT195 |	It's fun I think she said in your YouTube video
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:55,167	| IOT195 |	Are you described it that it's useless
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:58,495	| IOT195 |	And yes it's more for entertainment than for anything else
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:03,615	| IOT195 |	But the Rhythm cat where it responds to music and voices and just the light
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:04,895	| IOT195 |	Is beautiful
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:07,967	| IOT195 |	The color light is just absolutely beautiful and it really
EDL	00:45:07,967	00:45:11,807	| IOT195 |	Cloudy day really warms up the house with all the different colors in it
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:14,367	| IOT195 |	Boots recently
EDL	00:45:14,367	00:45:15,391	| IOT195 |	Inexpensive
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:16,159	| IOT195 |	If I had
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:18,463	| IOT195 |	More time because I'm sure you can get it shipped
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:19,743	| IOT195 |	Between now and then
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:22,815	| IOT195 |	Fact that the June oven is so much cheaper now how much is it
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:24,095	| IOT195 |	You can buy the June oven now
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:32,031	| IOT195 |	Yeah I mean that is I loved it even at $1,500 and thought it was worth it so it's $600 I think it's a no
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:33,567	| IOT195 |	Especially if
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:35,103	| IOT195 |	You have only one oven
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:36,383	| IOT195 |	And would like to add
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:38,687	| IOT195 |	Another one just a little table top one
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:40,479	| IOT195 |	I think it's
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:41,503	| IOT195 |	Worth every penny
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:44,319	| IOT195 |	Okay and just so people know the nanoleaf
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:45,855	| IOT195 |	Is about $200
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:47,903	| IOT195 |	I need to buy expansion kits for about 6
EDL	00:45:47,903	00:45:52,255	| IOT195 |	Vitamin C Apple store or Best Buy and the June you do have to
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:55,071	| IOT195 |	Wonder in you have to order it online I believe they're back
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:45:56,863	| IOT195 |	For a while there
EDL	00:45:56,863	00:45:57,631	| IOT195 |	A runaway hit
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:45:58,911	| IOT195 |	But it is it is a really good to buy
EDL	00:45:59,423	00:46:00,447	| IOT195 |	Also
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:01,727	| IOT195 |	Nest doorbell cam
EDL	00:46:01,727	00:46:04,031	| IOT195 |	I have a question because
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:05,311	| IOT195 |	I talked about this a lot
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:06,847	| IOT195 |	But I love when I'm out of
EDL	00:46:06,847	00:46:08,639	| IOT195 |	The town I loved being able to
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:10,687	| IOT195 |	To check in on the doorbell cam when you guys
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:11,199	| IOT195 |	Leave the house
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:15,039	| IOT195 |	I always like look and see what you're wearing for the day or like
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:17,599	| IOT195 |	Look to see how you're doing do you like
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:20,159	| IOT195 |	And when you come home it makes
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:22,719	| IOT195 |	But I'm also like
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:25,791	| IOT195 |	Gyarados or something
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:27,071	| IOT195 |	She's like
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:28,863	| IOT195 |	Is she aware that there's a camera there and I'm
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:30,399	| IOT195 |	Keep it in
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:30,911	| IOT195 |	Is outside
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:35,519	| IOT195 |	Thanks for telling us
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:42,431	| IOT195 |	Stalker confirmed
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:45,247	| IOT195 |	Matt crate
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:46,527	| IOT195 |	I don't
EDL	00:46:46,527	00:46:47,295	| IOT195 |	Show
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:48,319	| IOT195 |	Anybody I just

EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:57,023	| IOT195 |	I definitely feel like it a divisional element like inside of town we can see in Austin
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:46:58,815	| IOT195 |	Literally downpouring right now
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:00,863	| IOT195 |	Or we can see like
EDL	00:47:03,679	00:47:04,447	| IOT195 |	Is
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:05,727	| IOT195 |	Treaty
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:12,639	| IOT195 |	Oh and you know what else were you brought into the house this year we brought in we don't have it set up all the time
EDL	00:47:12,639	00:47:13,407	| IOT195 |	Because we don't like
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:15,967	| IOT195 |	The house but we brought the wyze cameras
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:18,271	| IOT195 |	So I don't know if you in those are the
EDL	00:47:18,271	00:47:20,319	| IOT195 |	$20 or $30 for the pan
EDL	00:47:20,319	00:47:23,903	| IOT195 |	Andrew do you have thoughts I know that we set them up when we're going on vacation
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:26,207	| IOT195 |	Yeah I thought it was
EDL	00:47:26,207	00:47:31,583	| IOT195 |	Fine then I guess if you need cameras internal cameras it seems like a great Buy
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:33,631	| IOT195 |	Another thing that you do
EDL	00:47:33,631	00:47:35,679	| IOT195 |	Sometimes when you're out of town speaking of
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:38,751	| IOT195 |	Cameras is your call in on the Echo Show
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:40,543	| IOT195 |	I guess you're dropping in
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:42,079	| IOT195 |	Be nice if we're down
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:43,871	| IOT195 |	Stairs not listen
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:44,639	| IOT195 |	Mom's puppy
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:47,199	| IOT195 |	Oh yes I actually this year I
EDL	00:47:47,199	00:47:47,967	| IOT195 |	Call
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:49,759	| IOT195 |	And dropped in on the echo
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:50,527	| IOT195 |	Show
EDL	00:47:50,527	00:47:52,831	| IOT195 |	And gave Anna a tour of
EDL	00:47:52,831	00:47:53,599	| IOT195 |	FB
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:55,135	| IOT195 |	Chihuly Museum in
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:47:56,415	| IOT195 |	Seattle
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:47:57,695	| IOT195 |	Because I was there at Microsoft
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:03,327	| IOT195 |	I was like this place is beautiful I have to show her so I use my smartphone camera
EDL	00:48:03,839	00:48:07,167	| IOT195 |	I called her and then I just I took her on a little tour of the museum with me
EDL	00:48:07,679	00:48:09,471	| IOT195 |	Doesn't talk about the illegal part
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:10,751	| IOT195 |	I don't think it's
EDL	00:48:11,263	00:48:13,311	| IOT195 |	Did you was at funny inner or was I just
EDL	00:48:13,311	00:48:14,847	| IOT195 |	It's kind of like I will humor you Mom
EDL	00:48:14,847	00:48:18,687	| IOT195 |	It was very fun and it was the fact that I was able to watch
EDL	00:48:18,687	00:48:24,063	| IOT195 |	What you were doing with your device all the way across the country just
EDL	00:48:24,063	00:48:27,135	| IOT195 |	I'm sitting and eating cereal in my pajamas
EDL	00:48:27,135	00:48:27,903	| IOT195 |	Is pretty cool
EDL	00:48:28,927	00:48:31,231	| IOT195 |	All right and then let's see we also
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:33,023	| IOT195 |	I'm coming to terms with other devices
EDL	00:48:33,791	00:48:35,071	| IOT195 |	We brought a Smart Smoke
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:36,351	| IOT195 |	Detector that was also
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:38,399	| IOT195 |	Echo speaker into the house
EDL	00:48:38,911	00:48:42,495	| IOT195 |	Did you n Oleander you said that you thought it was kind of need that it would
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:43,263	| IOT195 |	Send you a text
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:44,799	| IOT195 |	Smoke alarm went off
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:46,847	| IOT195 |	Did you have any thoughts or it was pretty expensive
EDL	00:48:47,359	00:48:48,895	| IOT195 |	It's a $200 or two hundred
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:49,663	| IOT195 |	$50 smoke
EDL	00:48:50,431	00:48:51,199	| IOT195 |	So you know
EDL	00:48:51,199	00:48:52,223	| IOT195 |	I don't know if you want a lot of
EDL	00:48:52,735	00:48:54,271	| IOT195 |	Your house but did you have any thoughts on that
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:59,647	| IOT195 |	Play around with it for a long time but
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:04,255	| IOT195 |	Well to be fair we already have speakers in our ceilings and in the rooms where I listen to music
EDL	00:49:04,255	00:49:06,303	| IOT195 |	And we already have
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:11,679	| IOT195 |	Fairly recent smoke detectors with the CO2 detectors that talk and all that jazz so
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:13,727	| IOT195 |	The texting thing I guess is okay
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:17,055	| IOT195 |	Okay but I don't think I would pay that much money for that
EDL	00:49:18,335	00:49:19,359	| IOT195 |	And that's totally fair
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:20,639	| IOT195 |	We brought in brilliant
EDL	00:49:21,663	00:49:22,431	| IOT195 |	End
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:24,735	| IOT195 |	We had kind of a bad experience the first time around
EDL	00:49:25,247	00:49:27,295	| IOT195 |	And I haven't really spent a lot of time
EDL	00:49:27,295	00:49:28,575	| IOT195 |	Treating them since then
EDL	00:49:28,575	00:49:30,623	| IOT195 |	How do you guys feel about the light switch
EDL	00:49:31,135	00:49:32,415	| IOT195 |	That show you your photos
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:35,743	| IOT195 |	Play your favorite playlist from
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:36,767	| IOT195 |	Your Sonos from them
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:39,071	| IOT195 |	Yeah I guess if it was in a
EDL	00:49:39,071	00:49:45,471	| IOT195 |	Perfect location for that and make a lot of sense but must light switches aren't in a location where I would
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:49,055	| IOT195 |	Need to go over and maybe control those sorts of things
EDL	00:49:49,055	00:49:55,199	| IOT195 |	And the other thing is that stuff with you by voice now right if we want to hear music we asked Madame a to play The Muse
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:57,503	| IOT195 |	And frankly turning on
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:50:00,575	| IOT195 |	Light switches we do the same thing a lot I mean really
EDL	00:50:01,087	00:50:04,671	| IOT195 |	The past couple months at least our house of brilliant has just been a beautiful light switch
EDL	00:50:05,695	00:50:06,463	| IOT195 |	Okay
EDL	00:50:06,463	00:50:07,487	| IOT195 |	So we
EDL	00:50:07,487	00:50:09,279	| IOT195 |	Pretty much done everything we can
EDL	00:50:09,279	00:50:10,047	| IOT195 |	Can do it feels like
EDL	00:50:10,559	00:50:11,327	| IOT195 |	This point in time
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:12,351	| IOT195 |	Are there any things
EDL	00:50:12,863	00:50:15,167	| IOT195 |	Dang it I wish that you could make this summer
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:16,191	| IOT195 |	Mom
EDL	00:50:16,191	00:50:16,703	| IOT195 |	Maybe it's
EDL	00:50:17,215	00:50:19,263	| IOT195 |	You know last year you complained about the blinds not work
EDL	00:50:20,031	00:50:22,079	| IOT195 |	I finally did that yay
EDL	00:50:22,591	00:50:24,895	| IOT195 |	So any other things that you're like Manor
EDL	00:50:24,895	00:50:26,687	| IOT195 |	I really wish this were a little bit smarter
EDL	00:50:26,687	00:50:32,319	| IOT195 |	I feel like personally dog collars would be really cool like if you just had smart dog collars
EDL	00:50:32,319	00:50:32,831	| IOT195 |	Eureka.
EDL	00:50:34,111	00:50:37,695	| IOT195 |	Our dog is for the many occasions in which she meanders across
EDL	00:50:37,695	00:50:38,463	| IOT195 |	Chasing rabbits
EDL	00:50:38,975	00:50:39,999	| IOT195 |	We could just
EDL	00:50:40,511	00:50:44,095	| IOT195 |	Know where she is then like a Fitbit for a job
EDL	00:50:44,607	00:50:45,119	| IOT195 |	They make those
EDL	00:50:47,167	00:50:47,679	| IOT195 |	Yes
EDL	00:50:48,191	00:50:49,983	| IOT195 |	So okay for the dog
EDL	00:50:50,751	00:50:51,775	| IOT195 |	Now you know they make
EDL	00:50:51,775	00:50:53,311	| IOT195 |	And Andrew anything
EDL	00:50:53,311	00:50:54,079	| IOT195 |	But you're like
EDL	00:50:54,079	00:50:54,847	| IOT195 |	How I really would like this
EDL	00:50:55,359	00:50:56,895	| IOT195 |	You know I and I think
EDL	00:50:56,895	00:50:58,431	| IOT195 |	Haven't talked about
EDL	00:50:58,431	00:51:03,039	| IOT195 |	Something like this exhaust fan I guess when people are using the shower
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:04,063	| IOT195 |	Shirt turned on
EDL	00:51:04,063	00:51:06,367	| IOT195 |	I know a lot of people put those on timers
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:08,927	| IOT195 |	But I find that we turn them on and then we don't turn them off
EDL	00:51:08,927	00:51:10,463	| IOT195 |	12 hours later
EDL	00:51:10,463	00:51:16,863	| IOT195 |	Would be neat if there's a way to kind of turn those on and then have them last for say 15 minutes after you
EDL	00:51:16,863	00:51:19,935	| IOT195 |	So I guess I'll be a motion detection or something there
EDL	00:51:19,935	00:51:21,215	| IOT195 |	I believe that
EDL	00:51:21,215	00:51:23,263	| IOT195 |	Having a kind of finagle something in his house
EDL	00:51:23,775	00:51:24,543	| IOT195 |	Yeah
EDL	00:51:24,543	00:51:26,591	| IOT195 |	Now do you want to be 15 minutes after
EDL	00:51:27,103	00:51:29,663	| IOT195 |	Someone leaves or do you want it to be 15 minutes
EDL	00:51:29,663	00:51:30,175	| IOT195 |	After its
EDL	00:51:31,199	00:51:36,831	| IOT195 |	Question I guess if you could set the amount of time maybe the 30 minutes I know a lot of people this is
EDL	00:51:36,831	00:51:42,975	| IOT195 |	One of the energy saving things in new devices where they put those on a timers when you turn it on it's like a 15 minute timer
EDL	00:51:42,975	00:51:47,327	| IOT195 |	I think that would be helpful though that's one of those things that I know we waste electricity on
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:49,375	| IOT195 |	I can definitely make that happen
EDL	00:51:49,887	00:51:52,191	| IOT195 |	Jessup crazy sensor
EDL	00:51:52,703	00:51:54,751	| IOT195 |	All right I should tell you guys
EDL	00:51:54,751	00:51:58,847	| IOT195 |	It's because at CSM expecting a lot of crazy smart bathroom
EDL	00:51:58,847	00:51:59,615	| IOT195 |	Products
EDL	00:51:59,615	00:52:03,455	| IOT195 |	And we have a we didn't talk about this but the Delta faucet downstairs
EDL	00:52:06,271	00:52:08,319	| IOT195 |	But I'm curious like
EDL	00:52:08,319	00:52:09,855	| IOT195 |	How you guys do things like
EDL	00:52:10,367	00:52:13,951	| IOT195 |	Two bathroom mirrors that maybe do light settings when you come in or baby a
EDL	00:52:14,719	00:52:15,743	| IOT195 |	Toilet that
EDL	00:52:15,743	00:52:16,767	| IOT195 |	Music
EDL	00:52:16,767	00:52:20,095	| IOT195 |	When you're in the toilet room
EDL	00:52:22,655	00:52:26,239	| IOT195 |	You know I kind of felt when smoke detector kind of like we were at the
EDL	00:52:26,239	00:52:29,311	| IOT195 |	Point of a toilet playing music
EDL	00:52:30,079	00:52:31,615	| IOT195 |	You know it's just like
EDL	00:52:32,127	00:52:33,919	| IOT195 |	You could say Madeleine
EDL	00:52:33,919	00:52:38,015	| IOT195 |	Do my morning routine and that might include your shower before you get into
EDL	00:52:39,551	00:52:43,135	| IOT195 |	Comic rushing you to do things that like not your own pace but as a
EDL	00:52:43,135	00:52:44,671	| IOT195 |	ASAP by
EDL	00:52:44,671	00:52:45,695	| IOT195 |	Previous song
EDL	00:52:45,695	00:52:47,743	| IOT195 |	That's true and I run into that a lot
EDL	00:52:48,511	00:52:50,303	| IOT195 |	I set up a program for something and then like
EDL	00:52:52,351	00:52:54,655	| IOT195 |	I've never going to wake up that early to need my blinds
EDL	00:52:54,655	00:52:55,423	| IOT195 |	Open at this time
EDL	00:52:55,423	00:52:59,775	| IOT195 |	So the Madam a enabled faucet from Delta is pretty cool now
EDL	00:52:59,775	00:53:03,871	| IOT195 |	I'll be on it so the touch feature which we hadn't before we added Madam a
EDL	00:53:03,871	00:53:04,639	| IOT195 |	Was really
EDL	00:53:04,639	00:53:07,967	| IOT195 |	Right we use that multiple times a day
EDL	00:53:07,967	00:53:11,807	| IOT195 |	Maybe a couple times a week when I need to measure out water
EDL	00:53:11,807	00:53:14,623	| IOT195 |	For something rather than getting out of measuring cup
EDL	00:53:14,623	00:53:15,647	| IOT195 |	Put the pot under it
EDL	00:53:15,647	00:53:17,439	| IOT195 |	And ask her to
EDL	00:53:17,439	00:53:20,767	| IOT195 |	Dispensary cups water so that's pretty cool but
EDL	00:53:20,767	00:53:23,839	| IOT195 |	I guess it could be helpful in the bathroom
EDL	00:53:23,839	00:53:26,655	| IOT195 |	You know if I'm about to brush my teeth right
EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:33,055	| IOT195 |	And usually I just step into the shower and go ahead and turn it on to the temperature or right before doing that but
EDL	00:53:33,055	00:53:37,151	| IOT195 |	Series similar functionality on the faucet in the shower
EDL	00:53:37,663	00:53:38,943	| IOT195 |	Okay it's not going to happen
EDL	00:53:38,943	00:53:39,711	| IOT195 |	Cuz you need Alexa
EDL	00:53:39,711	00:53:41,503	| IOT195 |	Christian Dior shower and historically
EDL	00:53:41,503	00:53:42,271	| IOT195 |	People don't do that
EDL	00:53:43,551	00:53:44,831	| IOT195 |	But we'll keep that in mind
EDL	00:53:44,831	00:53:45,855	| IOT195 |	Wind & Fire
EDL	00:53:45,855	00:53:47,903	| IOT195 |	You guys cuz we are about to move
EDL	00:53:47,903	00:53:49,695	| IOT195 |	We are moving in June from this
EDL	00:53:50,463	00:53:53,279	| IOT195 |	And part of what I'm trying to think about is
EDL	00:53:53,279	00:53:54,047	| IOT195 |	We're going to go into event
EDL	00:53:55,071	00:53:57,119	| IOT195 |	So what do we take with us
EDL	00:53:57,119	00:53:58,399	| IOT195 |	What do we leave here
EDL	00:53:58,399	00:53:59,423	| IOT195 |	And what are you going to miss
EDL	00:54:00,447	00:54:03,775	| IOT195 |	I vote we take the nanoleaf
EDL	00:54:03,775	00:54:04,799	| IOT195 |	Bee hive
EDL	00:54:04,799	00:54:05,823	| IOT195 |	I feel like
EDL	00:54:05,823	00:54:07,871	| IOT195 |	No matter where you go it's
EDL	00:54:07,871	00:54:09,663	| IOT195 |	Pretty portable you don't need to like
EDL	00:54:09,663	00:54:11,455	| IOT195 |	Build it in Chinese
EDL	00:54:11,455	00:54:12,223	| IOT195 |	So that
EDL	00:54:12,223	00:54:14,015	| IOT195 |	And it just helps
EDL	00:54:14,015	00:54:15,807	| IOT195 |	Liven up anyway because
EDL	00:54:15,807	00:54:18,623	| IOT195 |	You can just personalize it and help
EDL	00:54:18,623	00:54:21,439	| IOT195 |	Make an impact on the ambience of a room
EDL	00:54:21,439	00:54:22,463	| IOT195 |	We'll take the nanoleaf
EDL	00:54:22,975	00:54:27,583	| IOT195 |	June obviously it's not attached and that will be excellent
EDL	00:54:27,583	00:54:30,911	| IOT195 |	I think Alexa might need to come with us to
EDL	00:54:30,911	00:54:31,935	| IOT195 |	Vans
EDL	00:54:31,935	00:54:32,959	| IOT195 |	Yes so those will be
EDL	00:54:32,959	00:54:38,335	| IOT195 |	Portable and then remove what are you going to miss most cuz we're going to move into a house where you can no longer say
EDL	00:54:38,335	00:54:39,103	| IOT195 |	Meta major
EDL	00:54:39,103	00:54:39,871	| IOT195 |	Turn on the lights
EDL	00:54:40,383	00:54:41,663	| IOT195 |	I think it's going to be the lights
EDL	00:54:42,175	00:54:48,319	| IOT195 |	Which I guess we could use the Hue right where it's light bulbs rather than the light switch but the light switch
EDL	00:54:48,319	00:54:49,599	| IOT195 |	I'll be able to turn it
EDL	00:54:49,599	00:54:51,391	| IOT195 |	On and off and
EDL	00:54:51,391	00:54:57,023	| IOT195 |	To a certain level like 50% is probably what I used the most in our home
EDL	00:54:57,023	00:55:02,143	| IOT195 |	I feel like for me it might be the modern-day control Delta faucet because
EDL	00:55:02,143	00:55:07,263	| IOT195 |	I very lazy when it comes to measuring out water and most of the time I'm not sure like
EDL	00:55:07,263	00:55:12,127	| IOT195 |	Helpful is One Bank what is a pipe do I just take my ice cream container and fill it
EDL	00:55:12,127	00:55:17,503	| IOT195 |	And then it got confusing so it's kind of nice to be able to depend on someone else for that
EDL	00:55:18,015	00:55:19,807	| IOT195 |	Excellent so we'll have to buy more measuring cups
EDL	00:55:21,599	00:55:22,623	| IOT195 |	Maybe some remote can
EDL	00:55:22,623	00:55:23,391	| IOT195 |	Controlled
EDL	00:55:23,391	00:55:24,671	| IOT195 |	Light bulbs I don't know
EDL	00:55:24,671	00:55:25,695	| IOT195 |	Okay
EDL	00:55:25,695	00:55:27,999	| IOT195 |	Guys thank you so much for doing the show
EDL	00:55:28,511	00:55:29,791	| IOT195 |	Again with me and
EDL	00:55:30,303	00:55:32,863	| IOT195 |	We'll see what connected goodies are under the tree this year
EDL	00:55:32,863	00:55:34,143	| IOT195 |	Alright you're welcome
EDL	00:55:34,143	00:55:35,167	| IOT195 |	Thank you
