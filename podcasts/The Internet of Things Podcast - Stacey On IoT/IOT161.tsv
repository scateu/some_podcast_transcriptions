EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,736	| IOT161 |	Actually big news last week
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,016	| IOT161 |	I think was last
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:59,296	| IOT161 |	Amazon
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:00,064	| IOT161 |	Announce
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:00,576	| IOT161 |	Blueprints
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:02,368	| IOT161 |	Basically this is
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:04,928	| IOT161 |	Templates that allow you to make
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:06,464	| IOT161 |	Custom skill
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:08,256	| IOT161 |	And I would do this and I was like
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,840	| IOT161 |	The rest of you guys made
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:12,864	| IOT161 |	Maybe like this is stupid
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:14,400	| IOT161 |	But what you can do is
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,936	| IOT161 |	You basically set one of these
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:18,240	| IOT161 |	Quiz template
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,008	| IOT161 |	And you can
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:20,288	| IOT161 |	Build your own quiz game
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:22,592	| IOT161 |	You can also do a fairytale one
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:23,872	| IOT161 |	You can do it
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:24,384	| IOT161 |	Trivia one
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:25,664	| IOT161 |	And
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,944	| IOT161 |	You can actually even do like
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:29,504	| IOT161 |	Cards for like foreign languages or anything else
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,552	| IOT161 |	I chose
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:32,832	| IOT161 |	The template for
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,344	| IOT161 |	Houseguest
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,904	| IOT161 |	To try to help them understand
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:36,928	| IOT161 |	My connected
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:38,464	| IOT161 |	So it's
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,744	| IOT161 |	Very easy it walks
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:40,256	| IOT161 |	Through every
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:42,560	| IOT161 |	You are limited by the types of quest
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:44,352	| IOT161 |	Selwyn house
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:46,912	| IOT161 |	Where can I find
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:51,008	| IOT161 |	Whatever you wanted them to find
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:51,520	| IOT161 |	And then
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,312	| IOT161 |	Anime with answers
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:55,872	| IOT161 |	They also had how do I
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:56,384	| IOT161 |	Was one of the eye
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:57,664	| IOT161 |	And then I had a car
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:02:59,712	| IOT161 |	So
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,480	| IOT161 |	I filled out
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:02,016	| IOT161 |	One I did notice
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:02,528	| IOT161 |	That
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,320	| IOT161 |	It's very hard to guess what someone
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:05,856	| IOT161 |	So
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,392	| IOT161 |	I did a very generic
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:11,488	| IOT161 |	How do I turn on the lights cuz I didn't want to do 20 commands for turning on all the lights
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,280	| IOT161 |	Variations of a
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:16,096	| IOT161 |	And how do I work the thermostat
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,656	| IOT161 |	The other thing I noticed is that
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,448	| IOT161 |	When it came time to name my skill cuz
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,264	| IOT161 |	Would actually using
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,288	| IOT161 |	This would actually go in
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,336	| IOT161 |	Madam
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,104	| IOT161 |	Open
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:27,616	| IOT161 |	I wanted it to be
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,408	| IOT161 |	Stacy's helpful house
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:30,688	| IOT161 |	But
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,968	| IOT161 |	Was way too complicated for
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,480	| IOT161 |	Madam
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,016	| IOT161 |	And it warned me
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,040	| IOT161 |	So I just called at my house
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,600	| IOT161 |	If you walk into my house
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:38,368	| IOT161 |	And you say
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:40,416	| IOT161 |	Turn on my helpful house
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:44,000	| IOT161 |	You'll get this prompt from Madam and you can customize this
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,280	| IOT161 |	It says hi
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,048	| IOT161 |	Valpo house
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,352	| IOT161 |	What can I do to you can ask me
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:48,864	| IOT161 |	The following
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,168	| IOT161 |	So
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,448	| IOT161 |	It took me all of five minutes
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:55,776	| IOT161 |	It wasn't like the most well considered skill probably
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:56,800	| IOT161 |	But very easy
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:59,360	| IOT161 |	And I don't know if it's going to help people or not
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,384	| IOT161 |	Well I think
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:06,784	| IOT161 |	I don't know if it's going to help people or not but obviously the potential is there and I think it's brilliant of Amazon to make it easier to create
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:08,064	| IOT161 |	Skills mean
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:10,624	| IOT161 |	Anything they can do to add more smart
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:17,024	| IOT161 |	Sandra personalization to these devices is going to help and now they don't have to rely on developers to do that when you can do this
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:19,071	| IOT161 |	Is yourself in a relatively easy format
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:25,471	| IOT161 |	The houseguest one is a perfect ones probably the one I would have started with two because I remember my dad whenever he would be at my house look like
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:28,287	| IOT161 |	Hey before you go like he would watch the house when we went out
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,823	| IOT161 |	He would say how do I change the channel
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:35,967	| IOT161 |	Because of the technology we had in the house that he didn't have any these are the kinds of things that can really
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:37,503	| IOT161 |	Add benefits of
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:43,391	| IOT161 |	It's all about personalization and expansion of the echo ecosystem from a service standpoint I think it's
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:45,695	| IOT161 |	Again very very smart ass Amazon
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,231	| IOT161 |	Agreed and I wonder
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:51,327	| IOT161 |	Because as they get into business they're actually letting businesses do
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,351	| IOT161 |	Their own custom
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,375	| IOT161 |	Skills for a business
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:53,887	| IOT161 |	When is this is
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,167	| IOT161 |	India similar
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:55,935	| IOT161 |	Format for that
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:05:02,847	| IOT161 |	It could be I mean just because it's simple and easy but I suspected businesses maybe they don't have an IT department
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:04,895	| IOT161 |	Probably yes businesses that do have
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,943	| IOT161 |	A lot of Technical Resources
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:09,759	| IOT161 |	They'll probably just use the regular skills apis and such
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:14,111	| IOT161 |	Because you can program them very easily and those folks would understand how to do that so
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,391	| IOT161 |	Yeah makes sense
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,951	| IOT161 |	Well I got excited about
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,463	| IOT161 |	Blueprints
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:20,511	| IOT161 |	Amazon has also
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:22,047	| IOT161 |	Bloomberg actually discovered that
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,351	| IOT161 |	Building
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,375	| IOT161 |	Robot
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,655	| IOT161 |	Making Kevin and I
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,423	| IOT161 |	Super psychic
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,447	| IOT161 |	Cuz we were just talking about
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:30,751	| IOT161 |	Tell us a little bit about
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,775	| IOT161 |	Amazon Vesta
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,543	| IOT161 |	Well that's
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:37,663	| IOT161 |	We don't know much for sure this is all reporting out of Bloomberg as you mentioned a code name of the robot
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:39,199	| IOT161 |	Effort is Vesta
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:45,343	| IOT161 |	Which is the Roman goddess of Hearth home and family so that kind of gives you an indication of hopefully where Amazon is heading here
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:48,927	| IOT161 |	Appears that this will be a mobile
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,951	| IOT161 |	Roving type
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:55,327	| IOT161 |	Robot that can navigate self navigate actually among different rooms based on early prototypes
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:59,423	| IOT161 |	I would imagine it has it's exactly what I said to two or three weeks
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,959	| IOT161 |	Exactly exactly
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:07,871	| IOT161 |	And people may think this is a little crazy but to be honest Amazon bought a robotics company
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,663	| IOT161 |	Back in 2012 I think it's called
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:10,943	| IOT161 |	Kiva systems
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,735	| IOT161 |	Yeah it is
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:17,087	| IOT161 |	775 million dollars and Navy use that investment to create
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:18,111	| IOT161 |	Robots in their warehouse
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:19,391	| IOT161 |	Does any have
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,159	| IOT161 |	As of
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:23,487	| IOT161 |	Early 2017 have 45000 of these
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:26,815	| IOT161 |	Amazon design build robots that
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:32,447	| IOT161 |	Move pallets around the warehouse is in such they're not picking items for delivery because they don't have the fine motor
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,471	| IOT161 |	Skills to do that
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:34,495	| IOT161 |	And I don't think
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:40,639	| IOT161 |	The best iRobot will do that either and I know that makes you sad Stacy because two weeks ago you said I want a robot with arms
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:44,479	| IOT161 |	I agree with you I do too many think we're there yet I don't see this as a
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,015	| IOT161 |	Task-based robot
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,063	| IOT161 |	The fold laundry and iron your clothes
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:50,623	| IOT161 |	I see this is more than informational
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:53,439	| IOT161 |	Robot that could help with presence detection in the house
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,975	| IOT161 |	Customize
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:55,743	| IOT161 |	Different
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:57,535	| IOT161 |	Settings in the home for you
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:59,327	| IOT161 |	Expected will have a camera with
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,607	| IOT161 |	Computer vision
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:03,935	| IOT161 |	And it'd be an information source that can do no
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,215	| IOT161 |	Follow me around and
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:08,799	| IOT161 |	I don't mind a camera in the house provided I have control over it
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:14,943	| IOT161 |	I don't want a camera in every room though so this to me is perfect as I can say robot go away I don't want you looking in here
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:17,503	| IOT161 |	Sitting here in my
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,039	| IOT161 |	PJ's watching TV whatever
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:21,855	| IOT161 |	I'm excited by the potential of us that's all I
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,367	| IOT161 |	Inside right now
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,927	| IOT161 |	Sure
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:27,231	| IOT161 |	You know how's it going to handle
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,743	| IOT161 |	Stairs
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,023	| IOT161 |	Facebook
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,327	| IOT161 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,631	| IOT161 |	I'm not as excited as possibly Kevin
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:35,423	| IOT161 |	That's not
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:36,959	| IOT161 |	Actually kind of funny
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,799	| IOT161 |	Kevin was not a fan of the original Echo
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:41,823	| IOT161 |	And then
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,871	| IOT161 |	Okay I can see this being is
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:46,943	| IOT161 |	The original Echo had very little
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:52,831	| IOT161 |	Final bit of news on the echo
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:54,367	| IOT161 |	There is now a
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,903	| IOT161 |	New Amazon Echo
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,927	| IOT161 |	Kids edition
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:02,559	| IOT161 |	I've used the Kindle Freetime app when my daughter is younger on
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,607	| IOT161 |	Kindle Fire tablet
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,911	| IOT161 |	And that was the most aggravating
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:07,935	| IOT161 |	Confusing interface
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:09,215	| IOT161 |	I think I've really ever
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,519	| IOT161 |	So I don't know if I'm thrilled about this
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:18,687	| IOT161 |	Yeah I did my kids are older so we don't use any of the free time type things on the Amazon devices but you know
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,735	| IOT161 |	This is an $80 Echo.
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,015	| IOT161 |	It said I got a case on it
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:25,087	| IOT161 |	It also includes the free time
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,623	| IOT161 |	I'm not as bad as you would said
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:30,463	| IOT161 |	If you want you can actually just add
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:34,303	| IOT161 |	Free time on near existing. For $3 a month
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,863	| IOT161 |	She don't want to buy the new.
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:37,631	| IOT161 |	Basically
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:39,423	| IOT161 |	What does is ad
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:44,543	| IOT161 |	Specific content that kid friendly such as certain skills audible books and other things
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,311	| IOT161 |	You can
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,335	| IOT161 |	Keep track of
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:49,407	| IOT161 |	Limit their music in a knot
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:52,735	| IOT161 |	Share explicit tunes and so on and so forth
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:53,759	| IOT161 |	It's from the anime
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:09:02,207	| IOT161 |	Will a lot of your right and a lot of the echo focus it presupposes that you're a a Prime member bu
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:06,047	| IOT161 |	Subscribe to everything that Amazon offers and so on so forth so
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:12,447	| IOT161 |	Yes it does it could be though that you could limit adjust the Amazon music service as part of the parental
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,471	| IOT161 |	You know
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:16,287	| IOT161 |	South exit is a logical extension of what
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,335	| IOT161 |	Amazon already has with the echo
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:23,199	| IOT161 |	I don't think they needed to come out with a new device cuz it's really the same device just with a little case on it
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:29,599	| IOT161 |	But it's a way for them to customize it for a different market segments they've been very specific about the privacy
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,391	| IOT161 |	That's obviously an issue when it comes to kids
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:38,303	| IOT161 |	They said that no data is collected for advertising purposes the only date it that's used is used to make the product
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,351	| IOT161 |	Better I still wonder about that from a
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:42,143	| IOT161 |	Copper standpoint here in the US
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,935	| IOT161 |	But they haven't said anything about that
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,983	| IOT161 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,263	| IOT161 |	And now moving on to her
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:48,799	| IOT161 |	What caused the university be
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,079	| IOT161 |	Because we've got some
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:50,847	| IOT161 |	Some crazy fun news
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,639	| IOT161 |	First step is
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:56,223	| IOT161 |	Smart walls from Chris Harrison who is a professor with a human can
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:56,991	| IOT161 |	Computer interaction
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:58,783	| IOT161 |	Carnegie Mellon
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,343	| IOT161 |	He's got two projects out
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:02,879	| IOT161 |	One is a digital interact
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,391	| IOT161 |	Out of paper
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:04,927	| IOT161 |	But the second one
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:05,695	| IOT161 |	Is something I could
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,207	| IOT161 |	Sienna smart
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,255	| IOT161 |	It's called wall
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:08,767	| IOT161 |	Plus plus
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,559	| IOT161 |	And basically it
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,839	| IOT161 |	Turns your wall into a
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| IOT161 |	Positive
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,119	| IOT161 |	Touchstone
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:15,167	| IOT161 |	In the cost for this
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,703	| IOT161 |	So far they estimated
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,727	| IOT161 |	Just about $20
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:18,751	| IOT161 |	Per square meter
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,031	| IOT161 |	So it's not exactly cheap
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,567	| IOT161 |	But it's not like in
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,335	| IOT161 |	Insanely expensive
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:24,127	| IOT161 |	And you can do without tools so you just
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:24,639	| IOT161 |	Put the substance
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,431	| IOT161 |	On wall and then yuan
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,735	| IOT161 |	Paint over it and then you attach sensors to the baseboard
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,783	| IOT161 |	And your wall becomes this
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,295	| IOT161 |	Capacitive touch
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:33,087	| IOT161 |	From there you can
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:33,599	| IOT161 |	Can build
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:37,695	| IOT161 |	Psoriasis on top of it like apps that will say hey I'm touching the wall here this may
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,463	| IOT161 |	Means that
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,999	| IOT161 |	It can figure out
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,535	| IOT161 |	What electronic
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:44,095	| IOT161 |	Objects are in a room and if they're on or off like lights
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,655	| IOT161 |	Computers are televisions and
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:50,239	| IOT161 |	This just seemed to really intriguing it was not where I thought of Summer
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,263	| IOT161 |	Smartwall would go
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:56,127	| IOT161 |	I can see that so you can just walk in and slap your wall and turn things on
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:56,895	| IOT161 |	Or you could
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,919	| IOT161 |	Touch your wall
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:59,967	| IOT161 |	I got to say that I do not like the other PDF
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:02,783	| IOT161 |	But
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:09,695	| IOT161 |	Yeah you don't have to actually touch the lobby so you get finer resolution in terms of the sensors if you are touching them all but you're so
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:11,487	| IOT161 |	Standing close enough to it it can actually do
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,791	| IOT161 |	Determine your pose and so on and so forth
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:17,887	| IOT161 |	It's an interesting approach to mean basically these are little squares
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:20,959	| IOT161 |	That each one is a pixel essentially like a pixel in a display
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:23,007	| IOT161 |	And you just
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:29,407	| IOT161 |	Set these up in a crisscross pattern and then connect them all up with some wire in the sensor then you got a touch-sensitive Wallen
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:35,039	| IOT161 |	I agree with you this didn't go the way I thought it would I didn't think the smart why would be a sensor I thought I'd be more of a display
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:37,855	| IOT161 |	Lick with a projector or something like that but
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:38,879	| IOT161 |	This was
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:41,951	| IOT161 |	Kind of interesting and I'd be curious to see what people can do with it
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,719	| IOT161 |	Yeso
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:44,511	| IOT161 |	Will put his link to that in the show notes
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,023	| IOT161 |	And
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,303	| IOT161 |	Can a baby with Chris
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,327	| IOT161 |	Montauk in the shower
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,351	| IOT161 |	The fun project
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:51,167	| IOT161 |	Alright other crazy news
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:54,239	| IOT161 |	In the University of Washington has created a
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,263	| IOT161 |	A way to train
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,031	| IOT161 |	Transmit video
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,311	| IOT161 |	Using
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:57,823	| IOT161 |	Less power
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:00,639	| IOT161 |	Basically what they've done is
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,151	| IOT161 |	They're using
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,967	| IOT161 |	Backscatter and I should tell you the University of Washington
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:06,527	| IOT161 |	Has a really impressive Wireless wreath
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,319	| IOT161 |	So
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,087	| IOT161 |	They have
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:11,391	| IOT161 |	Done research on light detecting wear
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,159	| IOT161 |	People are in a room
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:13,695	| IOT161 |	The destruction
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,207	| IOT161 |	Your body's make
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,231	| IOT161 |	NRS
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,791	| IOT161 |	Dickinson other cool things around the
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:18,815	| IOT161 |	Wireless power
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,351	| IOT161 |	Transmission so
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,375	| IOT161 |	These people
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:22,655	| IOT161 |	University of Washington
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,935	| IOT161 |	They got their Wireless down
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,215	| IOT161 |	So basically what you
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:26,751	| IOT161 |	You can do is send
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:27,775	| IOT161 |	Full color HD
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,543	| IOT161 |	The signal is
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,311	| IOT161 |	60 frames per second
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:30,847	| IOT161 |	For less than a y
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,127	| IOT161 |	What is still huge
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,175	| IOT161 |	Samsung 4 battery power
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,991	| IOT161 |	But you can also send a 7:20
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,783	| IOT161 |	Image at 10
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:40,319	| IOT161 |	Per second that can be sent
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,343	| IOT161 |	4 under 80 microwave
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,135	| IOT161 |	And that gets a lot closer to
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:45,695	| IOT161 |	So maybe it's like
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:46,975	| IOT161 |	Grainger doorbell
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:50,047	| IOT161 |	Shoot the video from the doorbell
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:51,071	| IOT161 |	To screen
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:51,839	| IOT161 |	Without having
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:52,607	| IOT161 |	Go
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,119	| IOT161 |	To the cloud
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,143	| IOT161 |	Swepco
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:13:00,031	| IOT161 |	And because it's low power it could be a battery powered device at that point
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:01,823	| IOT161 |	Yeah there's some really cool things
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,103	| IOT161 |	The tech is already lights
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,383	| IOT161 |	Jeeva Wireless
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,431	| IOT161 |	So you might be able to see this
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:07,455	| IOT161 |	Intake
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,295	| IOT161 |	Woo
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,343	| IOT161 |	And final cool Universal
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:14,623	| IOT161 |	Princeton
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,135	| IOT161 |	University
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:16,415	| IOT161 |	Was kind of a letdown
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:24,095	| IOT161 |	I mean it's a letdown to me only in that I can actually use the tool that they came out with its called the IRT
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:25,119	| IOT161 |	Inspector project
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:32,287	| IOT161 |	Basically the project tries to figure out what your attitude devices talk to what information is gathered
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,823	| IOT161 |	And are the devices hacked
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:34,847	| IOT161 |	12 very important things
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,895	| IOT161 |	Fortunately they're going to
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,687	| IOT161 |	Open source this tool
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:43,551	| IOT161 |	To let you inspect your own iot devices and you have to email them to join a waitlist but
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:46,879	| IOT161 |	I mean that's the only let down to me is that I can't get it right now I'm just curious what
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:47,903	| IOT161 |	Information provides
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:51,999	| IOT161 |	And when I find out
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:57,119	| IOT161 |	Hopefully we'll be able to tell you more about
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,143	| IOT161 |	Play my devices
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:01,215	| IOT161 |	But you guys try not to
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:02,495	| IOT161 |	All right
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:03,519	| IOT161 |	News
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,335	| IOT161 |	There is a social media law
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:07,871	| IOT161 |	Brought to
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,663	| IOT161 |	And
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,175	| IOT161 |	I read it
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,455	| IOT161 |	I'm sad
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,479	| IOT161 |	I'm sad because this is
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:15,039	| IOT161 |	Sewickley for online platforms
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:17,343	| IOT161 |	And it doesn't look like it's going to help people
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:20,159	| IOT161 |	In the iot it doesn't look like it's going to deal with collecting I
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:20,927	| IOT161 |	Iot data
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:23,999	| IOT161 |	So the rule will deal with covered online platforms
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:24,767	| IOT161 |	And that means
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,303	| IOT161 |	An online platform that collects
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:29,631	| IOT161 |	Data during the online behavior of a user
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,399	| IOT161 |	The online platform
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:31,679	| IOT161 |	Which
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:33,215	| IOT161 |	I'm not online with my nest
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:33,983	| IOT161 |	Collecting data about me
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:35,007	| IOT161 |	Meandering
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:36,799	| IOT161 |	I'm not online
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,079	| IOT161 |	Where am I
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:44,991	| IOT161 |	You are not that your devices are like when you're asleep for example and things are being sensed and recorded in motion is.
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:47,551	| IOT161 |	Detective because the dog walk past a camera
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:51,391	| IOT161 |	The device like I said is online that is online you are not
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:52,671	| IOT161 |	So yeah
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:55,743	| IOT161 |	In the term online platform use any public face
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:57,023	| IOT161 |	Website web application
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,815	| IOT161 |	Digital application
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:00,095	| IOT161 |	Including a mobile
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,375	| IOT161 |	Includes
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,143	| IOT161 |	The Social Network
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:02,911	| IOT161 |	Add Network
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,935	| IOT161 |	Mobile OS
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:04,703	| IOT161 |	Search engine
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:05,215	| IOT161 |	Email service
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:07,775	| IOT161 |	Again
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:09,567	| IOT161 |	I want some clarity here for iot
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,103	| IOT161 |	I think they belong in the
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:13,407	| IOT161 |	Digital
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:14,687	| IOT161 |	Protection
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:16,735	| IOT161 |	The rights in here are not great
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,783	| IOT161 |	Basically saying look at
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:22,879	| IOT161 |	What you're collecting
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,415	| IOT161 |	And give them a chance
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,463	| IOT161 |	Opt out if they opt out
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,999	| IOT161 |	They just no longer they don't have to
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:32,607	| IOT161 |	Which is different from the gdpr because I believe you can opt out of data collection
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,119	| IOT161 |	Still use
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,167	| IOT161 |	Which
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:36,959	| IOT161 |	Or just different
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,263	| IOT161 |	So this
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:40,543	| IOT161 |	Proposed legislation
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,591	| IOT161 |	Is very far from
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,615	| IOT161 |	Coming along so we may never
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:46,431	| IOT161 |	It seems like the beginning of
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:47,967	| IOT161 |	Gdpr effort
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:48,991	| IOT161 |	Us
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,271	| IOT161 |	See where it goes
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,039	| IOT161 |	And hopefully
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:54,367	| IOT161 |	Anywhere
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:55,647	| IOT161 |	Comcast
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,671	| IOT161 |	Just a little update
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,207	| IOT161 |	Because they reported earnings they now have
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:58,719	| IOT161 |	One point
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:15:59,743	| IOT161 |	2
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:00,767	| IOT161 |	In Xfinity
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:02,047	| IOT161 |	Subscriber stats
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:03,327	| IOT161 |	About 44%
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:04,863	| IOT161 |	End
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,655	| IOT161 |	That's really all I have to say about that
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:10,495	| IOT161 |	Xfinity home
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:12,543	| IOT161 |	Custom is one of the larger players
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:19,711	| IOT161 |	They're making progress I have a feeling a lot of it has to do with potential bundling of service
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:22,783	| IOT161 |	I don't have anything more to say about it than that other than
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:25,087	| IOT161 |	Not the fact that they can do that as an advantage for them
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:26,111	| IOT161 |	Yes it is actually
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:27,903	| IOT161 |	Ashley helping them even if they lose cable
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:28,671	| IOT161 |	Subscribers
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,951	| IOT161 |	Their revenue
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:31,231	| IOT161 |	Producer is still up
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:32,767	| IOT161 |	So looking for
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:34,047	| IOT161 |	Increase broadband
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:35,071	| IOT161 |	But also
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:37,119	| IOT161 |	Opposite to me
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,935	| IOT161 |	Same or more
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,215	| IOT161 |	Money-making ability as
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:44,543	| IOT161 |	Right so Canary
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:52,223	| IOT161 |	I don't know how many Canary users there are out there but I am one so I just want to mention to ask Canary folks that
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:56,575	| IOT161 |	Recently Canary devices got person detection that I think it was back in February
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:58,879	| IOT161 |	Now with the latest Apple update
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:02,207	| IOT161 |	You can set your devices to record all motion
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:08,607	| IOT161 |	Just people only or not to record it all and motion alerts themselves can be configured for all motion people on Leon
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:09,375	| IOT161 |	Or nothing so
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:13,983	| IOT161 |	This kind of cleaned up some of the noise in the canary timeline and notifications
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:18,591	| IOT161 |	Systems the people detections actually pretty good although it still recognizes nor my dog is up first
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,127	| IOT161 |	But that's right
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,663	| IOT161 |	Donut he is
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:23,455	| IOT161 |	I can't argue with that
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:26,527	| IOT161 |	Alright other little gadgety updates
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,295	| IOT161 |	Google
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,319	| IOT161 |	Assistant.
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,087	| IOT161 |	Two new partners
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:30,111	| IOT161 |	Sensi the Sensi home
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,647	| IOT161 |	Stat from Emerson
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,927	| IOT161 |	Sun and and also
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:33,951	| IOT161 |	After I
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:35,231	| IOT161 |	Complain about it two weeks ago
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,767	| IOT161 |	Tradfri lights from
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,559	| IOT161 |	Ikea are now also
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,095	| IOT161 |	Supported by
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:40,607	| IOT161 |	Google home
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,143	| IOT161 |	Probably should have to
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,983	| IOT161 |	I was just going to ask you're going to put them back
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:46,495	| IOT161 |	I am
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:47,775	| IOT161 |	What kind of begrudgingly
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:50,079	| IOT161 |	I'm not turning back in my husband's bed
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:50,591	| IOT161 |	Side table lamp
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:51,871	| IOT161 |	That really makes them
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,943	| IOT161 |	All right
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,223	| IOT161 |	Let's see there is a
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:58,271	| IOT161 |	Really popular chip out there
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:01,087	| IOT161 |	Now that people are using for building iot device
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,879	| IOT161 |	Expressive
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:03,903	| IOT161 |	ESP
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:04,415	| IOT161 |	82
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:08,767	| IOT161 |	So this is a chips that a lot of hackers and fun
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:09,279	| IOT161 |	People kind of you
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:10,815	| IOT161 |	Can I play around with
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:12,863	| IOT161 |	End
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:14,143	| IOT161 |	Harry Potter
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:16,959	| IOT161 |	And it just the new version of it has now Wi-Fi mesh
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,471	| IOT161 |	Networking
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:21,055	| IOT161 |	So now you can use mesh WiFi stuff for your Gadget
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:21,823	| IOT161 |	Is that your building with
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:23,103	| IOT161 |	And it is
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:24,383	| IOT161 |	Makes it a little bit more
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:27,711	| IOT161 |	I don't have much to say Beyond this but I know there's a certain subset of our list
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,783	| IOT161 |	So excited
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,575	| IOT161 |	And finally
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,367	| IOT161 |	Who's has a new mesh Wi-Fi assist
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:36,415	| IOT161 |	And it's got built-in
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,439	| IOT161 |	Insecurities from Trend Micro
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:41,535	| IOT161 |	I think so I mean the fact that
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,303	| IOT161 |	It has begun
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:43,839	| IOT161 |	Security through trends
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:50,239	| IOT161 |	Micro work basically hits their Cloud database of known malware sites and Sachin else protect you from them witches
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:50,751	| IOT161 |	Constantly updated
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,031	| IOT161 |	Which is nice
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:58,175	| IOT161 |	You have that service for the lifetime of the products or it's not like a subscription it's not like you get for 3 months
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:00,991	| IOT161 |	You have for lifetime of the product which I think is very nice
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:07,391	| IOT161 |	These are kind of interesting mean we seen Odyssey mesh Wi-Fi routers and access points before
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:09,951	| IOT161 |	These are a little unique in that they almost look like
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:14,303	| IOT161 |	Cheese irons that you would use to iron your clothes there like a pyramid in fact
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:19,423	| IOT161 |	And the reason there a pyramid is because the antennas are aligned to send the signals
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,447	| IOT161 |	Horizontally
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:26,335	| IOT161 |	And vertically so that helps with multi-level homes this is also three-by-three mymo which
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:30,431	| IOT161 |	Is 3 antennas in each unit so that should help with coverage as well
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:33,759	| IOT161 |	299 on pre-order at Amazon
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:36,831	| IOT161 |	And I'm trying to see when I think they come out in May
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,111	| IOT161 |	We don't have long
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:41,695	| IOT161 |	All right
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,207	| IOT161 |	And now
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,743	| IOT161 |	I have been waiting for
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,279	| IOT161 |	Kevin Hayes
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:45,791	| IOT161 |	It's made
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,839	| IOT161 |	Well
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,607	| IOT161 |	I'm not up
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,655	| IOT161 |	Set about my home
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:53,215	| IOT161 |	Smart home right now but I'm not happy with it
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:57,311	| IOT161 |	All the unhappiness aim for me to start when I went over to SmartThings
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,079	| IOT161 |	And we just
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:58,847	| IOT161 |	Talk about
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:19:59,359	| IOT161 |	You know which
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:06,015	| IOT161 |	Smart home hubs are available which ones are the best which ones are the ones we recommend for most people and we typically do recommend either
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:11,647	| IOT161 |	SmartThings or wink and I've had both that I know you've had booked Stacy I'm going back to wink
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:12,415	| IOT161 |	Because
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:14,463	| IOT161 |	The SmartThings software just
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:19,327	| IOT161 |	Doesn't if not as responsive as waiting for one thing it just seems like it always has to refresh
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,887	| IOT161 |	For 2 seconds every time I open the app and check
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:23,679	| IOT161 |	Device States and so on and so forth
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:26,239	| IOT161 |	Even if the app is open in the background
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:32,639	| IOT161 |	I don't know I know you can do more with SmartThings if you want to get into device handlers and custom things have but I'm over that
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:39,039	| IOT161 |	So I think I'm going to move everything back to wink which is kind of a shame because I just moved everything over to SmartThings couple weeks ago
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:41,599	| IOT161 |	So I don't know what maybe it's just me what do you think
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:46,719	| IOT161 |	Could you please. Yeah I think you're actually right so and you actually did you some of the device Handler
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:47,231	| IOT161 |	To play with some
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:50,303	| IOT161 |	I think for
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,839	| IOT161 |	Everybody who does not want
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:54,399	| IOT161 |	If you don't have some weird device you're trying to say
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,679	| IOT161 |	Support or some
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:57,215	| IOT161 |	Grandiose automation
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:59,775	| IOT161 |	This game that you're trying to support wink is the way to go
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,055	| IOT161 |	I just worry
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:03,359	| IOT161 |	Now that it's owned by William
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,895	| IOT161 |	I don't know what's going to happen
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:06,687	| IOT161 |	Do it but it's a great platform
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,711	| IOT161 |	I'm still for
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:08,735	| IOT161 |	Everybody
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:11,295	| IOT161 |	Yeah we've had concerns about wink as a
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:13,343	| IOT161 |	Product line for a while because
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:16,672	| IOT161 |	They were kind of in limbo and yeah they were
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:20,256	| IOT161 |	Quirky + GE and then sold there still around
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:26,656	| IOT161 |	So I mean that doesn't mean any for the future but maybe maybe we were worried about it for nothing I don't know I should also point out and
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:27,936	| IOT161 |	State Cinema if you saw this
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:28,704	| IOT161 |	We
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:33,056	| IOT161 |	Got a comment on our Facebook page about the news
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:37,920	| IOT161 |	SmartThings app cuz they do have two apps right now they have classic and then the newer one
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:40,480	| IOT161 |	And in the new one it's
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:41,248	| IOT161 |	Says
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:43,808	| IOT161 |	In the FAQ is that you cannot
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:46,112	| IOT161 |	Connect Madam a Google home
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:48,160	| IOT161 |	Or Cortana if you try to connect
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:49,952	| IOT161 |	And even for the first time using smart
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:51,744	| IOT161 |	This is under the new app
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:56,608	| IOT161 |	If you've already been connected with those digital assistants in the classic app and then you update
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:58,400	| IOT161 |	You can use those devices
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:00,192	| IOT161 |	I don't know if that means
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:05,312	| IOT161 |	They're getting rid of that support once you get for new users on the new app or not
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:08,640	| IOT161 |	Okay so I sent an email to Alex Hawkinson
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:09,920	| IOT161 |	Who's the CEO of SmartThings
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:10,432	| IOT161 |	When I saw that
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:12,480	| IOT161 |	I sent him a comment and I was like
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:13,248	| IOT161 |	What
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:15,040	| IOT161 |	Is this really true and he says
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:16,832	| IOT161 |	It's definitely not true
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:20,672	| IOT161 |	He says we are planning to be even more open
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,208	| IOT161 |	And he promised to talk to me
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:24,256	| IOT161 |	Now I am in Sweden so it's very difficult to get ahold of
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:27,840	| IOT161 |	So I will have more clarity
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:28,864	| IOT161 |	Before you guys on this
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,144	| IOT161 |	Next episode
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:30,912	| IOT161 |	Cuz I saw that I was
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:32,192	| IOT161 |	What what
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:34,240	| IOT161 |	I think that was your like bread-and-butter say
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:34,752	| IOT161 |	Samsung loves being
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:38,080	| IOT161 |	So guys take that with a grain of
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:41,408	| IOT161 |	That's good news I mean
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:43,968	| IOT161 |	It kind of sounded like they were just going to go to Bixby
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:44,992	| IOT161 |	And that is not
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:47,040	| IOT161 |	Obviously not open and not what
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:47,808	| IOT161 |	Everybody wants
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,856	| IOT161 |	The odd thing to me is
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:53,696	| IOT161 |	It's right there in the app if it uses I double checked it myself so
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:55,488	| IOT161 |	They can resolve their own issues right away by
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,280	| IOT161 |	Fixing that FAQ page
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:58,304	| IOT161 |	I agree with you
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:02,400	| IOT161 |	That's why we're to have a follow-up conversation when I'm back from Sweden
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:04,448	| IOT161 |	So stay tuned on
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,216	| IOT161 |	Bat
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:05,984	| IOT161 |	Right

EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:44,640	| IOT161 |	PlayStation Kevin
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,688	| IOT161 |	This is Dan from North Carolina
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:49,760	| IOT161 |	I'm a longtime listener but a first-time caller we're having a
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:52,064	| IOT161 |	Complete kitchen makeover done this summer on our house
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:54,880	| IOT161 |	Including knocking over wall new cabinets
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:55,904	| IOT161 |	Appliances everything
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,952	| IOT161 |	I'm a SmartThings user with about
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,976	| IOT161 |	20.
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,000	| IOT161 |	Two things currently
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:01,280	| IOT161 |	Besides considering
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,048	| IOT161 |	Smart Appliance
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,840	| IOT161 |	This is like the June oven and others
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:05,376	| IOT161 |	What are the top few ice
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:07,168	| IOT161 |	Do things you'd recommend I do in the kitchen
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,216	| IOT161 |	Given that I'm in that uniques
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:11,264	| IOT161 |	Situation of a clean slate to work
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:15,104	| IOT161 |	Smart switches on overhead lighting are a definite for me
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:16,128	| IOT161 |	Summer to do that
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:17,152	| IOT161 |	Do you have any other recommendations
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:18,176	| IOT161 |	Thanks again
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:19,456	| IOT161 |	Oh
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,736	| IOT161 |	Dan I
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:21,248	| IOT161 |	So
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:22,784	| IOT161 |	So envious of
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,576	| IOT161 |	Love you I hope you're going for one of those big farmhouse
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:27,136	| IOT161 |	Because personally when we did our kitchen
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:27,904	| IOT161 |	I said
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:29,184	| IOT161 |	No I don't need anything like that
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:31,232	| IOT161 |	Credit everyday
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,768	| IOT161 |	Don't let this happen
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:34,560	| IOT161 |	Do you accept on your smart stuff B
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:36,608	| IOT161 |	Because I guarantee in five years you're going to be like
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:38,400	| IOT161 |	Probably made the wrong choice
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,168	| IOT161 |	Just because it's strange
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,472	| IOT161 |	My first recommendation
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:42,752	| IOT161 |	Into you is
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:44,288	| IOT161 |	Yes smart switches
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:47,104	| IOT161 |	Pick your favorite I'm going to offer to you
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:50,432	| IOT161 |	If your kitchen is an open floor plan cuz you mentioned you were
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,712	| IOT161 |	Knocking out a wall
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:54,784	| IOT161 |	I might actually take that opportunity to try the noon
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:55,552	| IOT161 |	Smart
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:57,856	| IOT161 |	Home lights because I've been really intrigued in this
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:00,160	| IOT161 |	The product it designs the lights
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:00,672	| IOT161 |	It's for you
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:03,488	| IOT161 |	It detects what kind of lighting you have and then
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,768	| IOT161 |	Built-ins around
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:06,048	| IOT161 |	Before you automatically
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,584	| IOT161 |	I think it's kind of compelling
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:11,424	| IOT161 |	And kind of expensive but wrapped in a Renault it could definitely work
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:11,936	| IOT161 |	And
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:13,984	| IOT161 |	It all depends though if you're doing
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,264	| IOT161 |	Open
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:18,848	| IOT161 |	If not then go with the straight up I recommend Lutron because
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:20,640	| IOT161 |	They're my favorite you will need a hub
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,152	| IOT161 |	But
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:23,968	| IOT161 |	I would also install some smart Outlets
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:25,504	| IOT161 |	With USB ports in
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:29,344	| IOT161 |	If you're going to go with a smart outlet a zigbee or Z-Wave should be just fine
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:32,160	| IOT161 |	You may depending on your current host
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:33,952	| IOT161 |	System chooses a day because
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,792	| IOT161 |	Their support for it from like the Amazon Echo has
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:38,560	| IOT161 |	Automatic
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:39,328	| IOT161 |	Recipes for dinner
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:40,864	| IOT161 |	But I don't think it really matters
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:43,680	| IOT161 |	And that way you don't have to have these Outlets cramming
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,704	| IOT161 |	Things up
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:46,496	| IOT161 |	Still have that ability to turn Appliance
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:49,312	| IOT161 |	How to charge your car
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:50,080	| IOT161 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:50,848	| IOT161 |	Yay
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,128	| IOT161 |	Casper Smart Appliance
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:53,408	| IOT161 |	This is
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:53,920	| IOT161 |	Hard for me
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:55,200	| IOT161 |	Because I
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:57,504	| IOT161 |	You know I would love for you to install the June oven
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:59,808	| IOT161 |	It's awesome and they do have a in wall oven
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,088	| IOT161 |	But
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,880	| IOT161 |	There's a lot of compelling
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:04,416	| IOT161 |	Use cases are arguing
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:05,184	| IOT161 |	Commence for
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:05,952	| IOT161 |	Buying
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:07,232	| IOT161 |	Appliances all for one
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:09,024	| IOT161 |	And that kind of makes me feel gross
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:15,680	| IOT161 |	I don't know but they didn't match in that comes in big as a nice looking for you has good resale ability so
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,472	| IOT161 |	GE has
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:20,032	| IOT161 |	Probably worked the hardest
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:22,080	| IOT161 |	I'm building out like
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:22,592	| IOT161 |	Integration
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:26,176	| IOT161 |	And thinking about the kitchen is an in
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:26,688	| IOT161 |	Integrated whole
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:29,504	| IOT161 |	So they've done a good job
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:31,296	| IOT161 |	I don't particularly know about there
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:34,368	| IOT161 |	Quality though and I don't think you should
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,648	| IOT161 |	You should choose your Appliance
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:36,672	| IOT161 |	Is based on
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:38,208	| IOT161 |	How well they function is there me
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,000	| IOT161 |	Main function not is how well they
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:40,512	| IOT161 |	Play function with
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,560	| IOT161 |	Smart stuff
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,888	| IOT161 |	So that's a ten
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:46,912	| IOT161 |	Kevin anything else
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:47,936	| IOT161 |	You would install
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:51,520	| IOT161 |	I don't know that I would install it but I'm very disappointed Stacy
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:54,336	| IOT161 |	Because you did not mention the one thing I thought you were going to mention
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:56,128	| IOT161 |	Ceiling mounts for MS
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:58,688	| IOT161 |	Ace
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,456	| IOT161 |	Smart
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:00,224	| IOT161 |	Faucet
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:00,992	| IOT161 |	For your sake
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:02,272	| IOT161 |	I forgot about that
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:06,112	| IOT161 |	Okay two things
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:07,648	| IOT161 |	Because you're putting it into the delta
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:09,184	| IOT161 |	Capacitive touch
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:09,696	| IOT161 |	To its touch
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:11,744	| IOT161 |	2 hour touch O2 faucet
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,280	| IOT161 |	Speaks to
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:14,816	| IOT161 |	Because it's
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,864	| IOT161 |	And if you don't want to do that
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:21,216	| IOT161 |	Just going to capacitive touch faucet your first couple days you could be like why did I do this
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:23,776	| IOT161 |	This is weird and then you're never going to want to turn on your closet any other
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:24,800	| IOT161 |	This is my
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:25,824	| IOT161 |	Pledge to you
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:27,360	| IOT161 |	Santo Rosario
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,664	| IOT161 |	I do I kept you around for
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:31,200	| IOT161 |	Yes
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:34,528	| IOT161 |	All right
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:36,064	| IOT161 |	So those are thoughts there Dan
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:37,600	| IOT161 |	Wish you luck
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:39,392	| IOT161 |	I'm sad that I can't think of any other off
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:44,768	| IOT161 |	But there's a number of smart scales and
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:46,560	| IOT161 |	Smart pots and smart
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:48,096	| IOT161 |	Other devices
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:50,400	| IOT161 |	They're all stand-alone kind of thing for the most part
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:55,008	| IOT161 |	Maybe some smart blinds
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:57,568	| IOT161 |	You know sometimes I like to wash dishes at night and then
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,592	| IOT161 |	People looking at me
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:27:59,360	| IOT161 |	Okay

EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:23,168	| IOT161 |	Before

EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:37,760	| IOT161 |	Message from
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:42,880	| IOT161 |	One of our sponsors and to hear more about designing products that are connected and sustainable
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:49,792	| IOT161 |	And a bit of more about the keys product we are taking a break from the internet
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:56,192	| IOT161 |	The thing is podcast for a message from our sponsor cuz we sponsor is for trop and we are going to talk about privacy
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:58,240	| IOT161 |	Is brand Equity with Ben Goodman
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:01,056	| IOT161 |	VP of strategy and innovation
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:03,872	| IOT161 |	Ben first off let's remind people what for truck
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:05,920	| IOT161 |	Is it
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:09,504	| IOT161 |	Send our scale of flexibility let's our customers
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:11,296	| IOT161 |	Movie on the traditional
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:16,416	| IOT161 |	Identity use cases that people use me Enterprise so things like provisioning employee access
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:17,184	| IOT161 |	We do a lot more
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:18,976	| IOT161 |	One of our biggest difference
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:21,792	| IOT161 |	Is that we've focused really heavily on
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:22,560	| IOT161 |	Privacy
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:23,328	| IOT161 |	So we have
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,352	| IOT161 |	Craft the standard
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,632	| IOT161 |	Call user managed access
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:29,472	| IOT161 |	Which helps users gain control of who has access
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:30,496	| IOT161 |	Personal data
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:32,800	| IOT161 |	We were the first commercially available products
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:33,568	| IOT161 |	Incorporated
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:35,104	| IOT161 |	Uma really is a
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:37,152	| IOT161 |	Great framework for building
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:38,432	| IOT161 |	Privacy and consent program
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:41,248	| IOT161 |	And I can help customers with things like
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:42,016	| IOT161 |	Gdpr
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:42,784	| IOT161 |	Compliance which is a
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:46,112	| IOT161 |	Standard in the European Union for privacy and consent
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:50,208	| IOT161 |	We haven't talked to you in the last few weeks about Cambridge analytica and what it means to
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:55,584	| IOT161 |	Give consent to the use of your data you explain to me that you actually think this was a breach when a lot of
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,864	| IOT161 |	People are trying to make the de
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:57,376	| IOT161 |	Distinction that it
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:30:01,728	| IOT161 |	Yeah I think it's time that we really reimagine what makes up a bridge
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:06,336	| IOT161 |	I mean if someone gets access to our data in a way that we didn't
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,616	| IOT161 |	Anticipate
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,640	| IOT161 |	Consent to
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,664	| IOT161 |	That is a breach
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:14,272	| IOT161 |	For example just because Cambridge analytica was working with in Facebook's terms
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:15,040	| IOT161 |	Service
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:16,320	| IOT161 |	It doesn't mean it wasn't a breach
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:20,416	| IOT161 |	When someone misleads me to do something like taking online trivia test
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:23,232	| IOT161 |	And uses that to harvest my personal data
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,768	| IOT161 |	And the date of my friend
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:26,048	| IOT161 |	How can I be anything but
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:29,888	| IOT161 |	This really is a modern social media version of a phishing attack
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:32,960	| IOT161 |	Okay so do you think this is going to change how
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,728	| IOT161 |	Consumers
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:35,264	| IOT161 |	View consent
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:37,056	| IOT161 |	I hope that this really does
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:38,592	| IOT161 |	Create an Awakening in the end
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:39,360	| IOT161 |	Consumer
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:42,432	| IOT161 |	I think for the first time people realize that
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:43,712	| IOT161 |	If they're getting a service
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:47,552	| IOT161 |	Jeffrey dende and their data are the actual product
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:50,880	| IOT161 |	Respect that people are going to suddenly start reading 50
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:53,440	| IOT161 |	Epays terms of services or end-user license
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:55,744	| IOT161 |	What I do expect
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:31:00,352	| IOT161 |	Text is that there's that now collect a lot of data are going to have to find ways to
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:05,984	| IOT161 |	Surface what they're doing with people data in a way which is much easier for them to consume and understand
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:06,752	| IOT161 |	And how does
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,264	| IOT161 |	Ford truck help
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:09,568	| IOT161 |	We believe that identity is a
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:11,104	| IOT161 |	Privacy
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:16,480	| IOT161 |	You know you really have to understand a person and their attributes in order to provide privacy
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:18,528	| IOT161 |	As I mentioned the beginning
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:24,160	| IOT161 |	Was really designed from the ground up to be a key supporting technology
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:24,928	| IOT161 |	Before any further
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:28,256	| IOT161 |	And we were the first commercial product
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:29,536	| IOT161 |	It support this user managed access
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:31,584	| IOT161 |	Which citizenship
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:33,632	| IOT161 |	Privacy and consent dashboards
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:36,448	| IOT161 |	That can be added into our customer
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:38,752	| IOT161 |	Products to help them as a brand
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:42,592	| IOT161 |	Who's quickly to show that they care about a customer's privacy
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:43,616	| IOT161 |	Protection

EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,248	| IOT161 |	Sounds good
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:50,528	| IOT161 |	So where can we go to find out more
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:51,808	| IOT161 |	Define amorous
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:52,576	| IOT161 |	Pacifically about
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:54,112	| IOT161 |	Stufful doing with privacy

EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:14,336	| IOT161 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today I have not one but two
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,616	| IOT161 |	I am here at
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:17,920	| IOT161 |	Kids headquarters in Elmhurst
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,432	| IOT161 |	Sweden
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:22,528	| IOT161 |	And I am learning the correct pronunciation for trustee and eating meatballs
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:26,624	| IOT161 |	So let's get this started we got to guess we got Rebecca
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:28,416	| IOT161 |	Tori man who's in charge of the
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,952	| IOT161 |	Tradfri products
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:32,000	| IOT161 |	Okay I will let her say it
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:33,280	| IOT161 |	Wow
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:34,560	| IOT161 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:38,144	| IOT161 |	And then after we talked to her for a little bit we're going to talk to
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:38,912	| IOT161 |	Rihanna
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:43,264	| IOT161 |	Call back who is in charge of Designing and Manufacturing products
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:46,592	| IOT161 |	So I am super pumped about all of this
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:49,920	| IOT161 |	So Rebecca by the end of this maybe I pronounce this correctly
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:53,760	| IOT161 |	Alright so
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:55,808	| IOT161 |	I purchase the lights and
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:56,576	| IOT161 |	Apparently
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:59,392	| IOT161 |	A couple weeks ago I put mine away for awhile.
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:00,160	| IOT161 |	Twerking
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:05,536	| IOT161 |	But for all of those if they've been out in the market for a year so let's talk about what you've learned
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,816	| IOT161 |	Since they've been out in the market
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:09,376	| IOT161 |	Our customers finding them
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:11,680	| IOT161 |	Do they come in asking for them at the store or do they just cut it
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:13,216	| IOT161 |	Buy them by
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:14,752	| IOT161 |	Running across them what is that process
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:17,056	| IOT161 |	I think when we start to develop
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:19,360	| IOT161 |	Bismarck shooting range
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:20,128	| IOT161 |	Two feet
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:26,528	| IOT161 |	The normal Eye Care customer that is also take gate usually and that's also we're about all of this technology that that exist
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:27,808	| IOT161 |	And we learn
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:29,344	| IOT161 |	Is that we attract
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:30,112	| IOT161 |	Many new type of
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:35,232	| IOT161 |	So many customers that I love Ben and I care for a couple of years and now they have actually read
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:39,840	| IOT161 |	That we have something that is connected and they are coming but we are also that in the track
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,120	| IOT161 |	Our normal
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:46,496	| IOT161 |	The one that doesn't know that there is something that is called zigbee or connected lighting
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:47,520	| IOT161 |	It just once
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:48,032	| IOT161 |	Steam daylight
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:51,872	| IOT161 |	I have been very fun to see that
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:53,920	| IOT161 |	We got traction from both of those types of
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:59,552	| IOT161 |	Because that is so wasted just a cold Manchester
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:00,576	| IOT161 |	Try and
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:01,344	| IOT161 |	Work
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:07,744	| IOT161 |	And they also said a lot about Sarah because people also want to be able to steer their products away via
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:11,840	| IOT161 |	Of course also when you get to get to get the connection supplement and Amazon
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:15,424	| IOT161 |	Google so I'll spread to all of our customers
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:19,776	| IOT161 |	And you have a sense of how many customers
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:23,104	| IOT161 |	Hi their stuff back to Amazon or Google or
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:31,296	| IOT161 |	So when customers buy these from the store
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:35,392	| IOT161 |	How do you educate them about what they can do how are you selling this
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,160	| IOT161 |	In the market
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:36,928	| IOT161 |	Exactly
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:42,304	| IOT161 |	We have an education package.
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:49,216	| IOT161 |	Wheels have of course location in the store so she can do and then if you have by the age and of course browser
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:51,776	| IOT161 |	To do we don't have so many things yet
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:58,176	| IOT161 |	We have of course individual steering we have the ability for stability
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:34:59,200	| IOT161 |	To do timers
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:01,248	| IOT161 |	And then they seem to get ratified
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:04,320	| IOT161 |	The back is fine but then of course when it comes to these equations
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:05,344	| IOT161 |	Now we talk
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:10,976	| IOT161 |	Both into storage sign of course our partners also talked about that now it's possible to go connect to switch
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:12,512	| IOT161 |	Flights to this in this area
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:14,816	| IOT161 |	So you guys are done lighting so far
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:16,864	| IOT161 |	You've done wireless charging that everyone
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:17,632	| IOT161 |	So excited
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:19,168	| IOT161 |	And you done
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:21,216	| IOT161 |	New Bluetooth speakers what's next
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:21,728	| IOT161 |	4
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:23,264	| IOT161 |	HomeSmart
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:26,336	| IOT161 |	Yasso lighting is very important
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:28,384	| IOT161 |	Important so we're adding on
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,408	| IOT161 |	Products and features
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:31,968	| IOT161 |	So when we are then them
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:34,784	| IOT161 |	Hopefully morning in the whole month of our customers
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:37,856	| IOT161 |	We're also not to say we have also launched the Bluetooth
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:38,624	| IOT161 |	Speakers
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:40,928	| IOT161 |	Cannabis
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:43,744	| IOT161 |	Sound that's what it's like to use a very
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:44,256	| IOT161 |	Important
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:46,304	| IOT161 |	Components to create a go.
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:48,352	| IOT161 |	So it would also then
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:51,168	| IOT161 |	Continue the journey towards some plastic sound
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:53,216	| IOT161 |	And we're doing back with some of them.
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:55,520	| IOT161 |	What are you doing with soda
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:35:59,104	| IOT161 |	So many secrets you guys
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:00,384	| IOT161 |	Cheer in Sweden
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:04,992	| IOT161 |	Okay and what are other areas that you're excited about
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:07,808	| IOT161 |	There's sound obviously you mentioned earlier hell
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:14,464	| IOT161 |	Insecurity is another kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:15,232	| IOT161 |	Perspective
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:18,304	| IOT161 |	You know we're looking into them what could either area
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:22,912	| IOT161 |	But we're not entering those areas if it is not soda profound very good music
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:29,568	| IOT161 |	Surfers looking at the customers racing okay what are the pinpoints what do they want to have and then we are creating then
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:37,248	| IOT161 |	Preston sport. NECC security maybe not so much for us while the safety National cleaning safe
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:38,528	| IOT161 |	Very important
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:39,552	| IOT161 |	Peace of mind
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:41,344	| IOT161 |	Could be about 10
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,624	| IOT161 |	Aunt is also set
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:45,952	| IOT161 |	Very interesting process if we could do sings there when it comes
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:47,232	| IOT161 |	Free sample to sleeping
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:54,144	| IOT161 |	Esther how could we support people to do that so there are very many interesting areas so we're looking into it doesn't have
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:56,192	| IOT161 |	To be with connected products
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:59,520	| IOT161 |	Shouldn't say easier but that but without the types of products
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:02,080	| IOT161 |	Package to the point that you have
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:04,128	| IOT161 |	Just hammered home with me today it's
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:05,408	| IOT161 |	Smart doesn't mean
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:08,736	| IOT161 |	So in some cases smart could be
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:09,504	| IOT161 |	I don't know
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:10,784	| IOT161 |	Wireless charger
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:13,344	| IOT161 |	Wireless charging that's smart without really being connected to
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:16,160	| IOT161 |	To make something smart what are your attempt design
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:18,720	| IOT161 |	What does it mean to make something
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:24,096	| IOT161 |	Yeah we are at all of those talks about their under the umbrella
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:29,984	| IOT161 |	And when we traded HomeSmart we didn't create smartphones we're going to tell smart so we put the home first very important for us
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:32,288	| IOT161 |	So I think in order for us to pray
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:34,080	| IOT161 |	HomeSmart products or a smart car
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:36,896	| IOT161 |	When you should take King
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:41,760	| IOT161 |	I think Moana to component that we are done tweaking a normal eye care product
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:43,552	| IOT161 |	Way to be better
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:46,624	| IOT161 |	So then would like thing we added on
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:48,672	| IOT161 |	Connectivity migas Dan you have
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:51,488	| IOT161 |	Many other ways that you can atop otherwise
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:55,328	| IOT161 |	Stair Lighting in to have the Fantastic atmosphere that we want people to be able to
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:58,400	| IOT161 |	So another
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:38:00,448	| IOT161 |	Music it that we couldn't do otherwise
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:01,984	| IOT161 |	And that's why we think that it's mine
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:05,312	| IOT161 |	When you think about Partnerships with other companies
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:07,616	| IOT161 |	In this area how do you evaluate your
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:08,384	| IOT161 |	Partnerships what do you look
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:11,200	| IOT161 |	Pressing stat
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:16,064	| IOT161 |	We are not doing currently at the other people or other partners than are doing back there
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:18,880	| IOT161 |	So for some people working with Sonos gives us
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:19,904	| IOT161 |	Company.
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,672	| IOT161 |	Nose
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:24,000	| IOT161 |	Unlocked and have a great experience into sound and the really gives
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:30,912	| IOT161 |	Working with our partners in Amazon and Google and I put of course gives our customers the ability to
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:34,752	| IOT161 |	Two boys are the products of course I don't have the types of products that we don't have
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:37,056	| IOT161 |	And to have that they go system if they want
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:41,408	| IOT161 |	So it's to create other types of music is it that we aren't currently offering them
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:45,760	| IOT161 |	Alright guys I was Rebecca
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:50,368	| IOT161 |	One day
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:54,976	| IOT161 |	Okay let's move to Liana perkovich
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:55,744	| IOT161 |	Men
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:39:01,120	| IOT161 |	I am so disappointed right now and iot because we are just not talking about to me the big issues where this could really help
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:04,960	| IOT161 |	So we'll start with Ikea obviously
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:05,728	| IOT161 |	Picture
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:09,824	| IOT161 |	One of the challenges and Ikea Ikea has been a really innovative
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:11,104	| IOT161 |	Company about managing
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:12,896	| IOT161 |	Supply chain in designing its products
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,944	| IOT161 |	To recycle to reclaim
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:18,528	| IOT161 |	What is the philosophy at Ikea just big nature around us
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:23,648	| IOT161 |	I think first of all is starts with the design actually and because the sign will also its
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:30,048	| IOT161 |	Precept a lot of the other environmental impact or the social impact for that matter where you actually producer products
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:34,656	| IOT161 |	We have an approach where we say everything is within democratic
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:41,056	| IOT161 |	Define democratic design for Ikea is that everything you do we have to think about five Dimensions is for its
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:41,824	| IOT161 |	Function
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:44,896	| IOT161 |	Is low prices quality energy sustainability
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,432	| IOT161 |	And it is actually Define
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:47,968	| IOT161 |	The perfect solution there
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:51,552	| IOT161 |	Sustainability is part of the design principles right away
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:53,088	| IOT161 |	Which attempt receptive course
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:53,856	| IOT161 |	What is
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:55,136	| IOT161 |	What we call
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:59,488	| IOT161 |	I'm building sustainability is what comes for the Prada
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:01,792	| IOT161 |	It's the material you select
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:05,632	| IOT161 |	It's how you produce it's how you transported them everything around it
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:08,960	| IOT161 |	Then we have the function which is also a sustainable Park
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:10,752	| IOT161 |	And that function could actually be
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:16,384	| IOT161 |	Perfectly improving your life or it could actually make you become more sustainable or it could use
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:18,688	| IOT161 |	Alot of energy and it could be the opposite
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:21,760	| IOT161 |	So when you look at it you really have to look at it
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:25,088	| IOT161 |	I should ask for everyone listening that Ikea put
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:29,440	| IOT161 |	Security and a focus on security as part of their quality
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:30,464	| IOT161 |	Part of that design
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:31,744	| IOT161 |	No everyone wondering like
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:33,536	| IOT161 |	But are they secure
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:34,304	| IOT161 |	Apparently so
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:37,376	| IOT161 |	Given that that's your design process
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:41,472	| IOT161 |	What are the risks of adding technology to everything
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:42,240	| IOT161 |	Is
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:43,264	| IOT161 |	Some of these
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:45,312	| IOT161 |	Materials are toxic or not
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:49,408	| IOT161 |	So how do you think about designing those into products
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:52,224	| IOT161 |	My ultimately feel a little disposable event
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:57,088	| IOT161 |	First of all I think it's extremely important to look at it both from an input point of view
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:41:03,232	| IOT161 |	So when you design the product actually decide what are the materials that should be in the product as such
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:09,120	| IOT161 |	There's a lot of things that could be done there just very being smart in your selection of the materials also in electronic components
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:12,448	| IOT161 |	Antibiotics that you're using and everything around it
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:18,336	| IOT161 |	So think about it from the beginning then on the other hand you can't really decide if the material is
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:21,664	| IOT161 |	Switch from a sustainability point of view if you don't know the function
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:25,760	| IOT161 |	You always have to look at the function and sustainability at the same time please
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:30,624	| IOT161 |	Smile about it because we say that you know if you would only look at the materials you would end up to have it
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:34,720	| IOT161 |	Kitchen sinks out of paper and the other types of materials that wouldn't really
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:37,792	| IOT161 |	Function at all
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:41,632	| IOT161 |	But they are highly recyclable but not very durable and long-standing
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:42,400	| IOT161 |	For the function
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:47,520	| IOT161 |	But I think when it comes to enter Electronics you are pointing out a very critical
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:50,080	| IOT161 |	Discussion first of all if you embed
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:56,223	| IOT161 |	And the electronic part in a piece of furniture we need to think about whether this is a platform where you could actually
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:57,759	| IOT161 |	Exchange it and which part
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:41:59,295	| IOT161 |	Is actually living longer
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:01,343	| IOT161 |	It's not necessarily so
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:07,743	| IOT161 |	Parts it could be that the battery lives longer than the lamp and another cases is the laptop live longer than the battery
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:14,143	| IOT161 |	Because the life length of some of these factories are very long now so how you design it will depend on course how long
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:15,167	| IOT161 |	Is the lifeline
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:19,263	| IOT161 |	The product and then also what is the biggest satellite most likely
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:20,799	| IOT161 |	Solution for it at the end of life
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:22,079	| IOT161 |	Okay so
EDL	00:42:22,079	00:42:23,615	| IOT161 |	Let's hit the battery-powered lamp
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:26,175	| IOT161 |	I don't have any battery power
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:28,735	| IOT161 |	What is this thing she's talking about
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:35,135	| IOT161 |	But that were thinking about the if you have solar panel if you have any other kind of rechargeable at you can actually have a
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:39,231	| IOT161 |	Battery in that it's more the possibilities than our backs you making sure that
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:39,999	| IOT161 |	After you recycle
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:45,887	| IOT161 |	So in this case it would be the battery would last longer than the lamp so that the battery
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:47,423	| IOT161 |	Recyclable is part of
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:49,727	| IOT161 |	You make it to Quick come if you don't
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:52,031	| IOT161 |	Remove the very small battery that disappears
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:58,431	| IOT161 |	Very easily at from the recycling so but you actually maintained it in the lamp so it's taken care of at the end of life
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:05,599	| IOT161 |	Use of thinking that the battery is the one that's going to be changed it
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:06,367	| IOT161 |	Thanks many times
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:09,951	| IOT161 |	But you actually have to look at it and some cases it's the opposite
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:13,279	| IOT161 |	When the light blinks becoming very long and in that case
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:14,559	| IOT161 |	I would just return it
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:15,327	| IOT161 |	2
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:18,143	| IOT161 |	Ikea or is there a recycling programs that
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:19,423	| IOT161 |	That's the other thing
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:24,287	| IOT161 |	Right now I haven't really have a big old bag in my closet
EDL	00:43:25,055	00:43:26,847	| IOT161 |	And I bring it to
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:30,943	| IOT161 |	My electronic recycling center and I don't know what happens to it
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:35,807	| IOT161 |	When we start thinking about like your lamp example if I brought the lamps of them they probably just be like
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:43,231	| IOT161 |	They should take care of it everything but that's just
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:49,631	| IOT161 |	But no I think the trust of course the infrastructure of recycling in many countries since we're a global company.
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:56,031	| IOT161 |	There is a many different possibilities of the infrastructure some of its really good and some still ways to go and will you have it
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:44:00,895	| IOT161 |	Different setups depending on where we are globally to support that in some cases it the enforcer
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:06,527	| IOT161 |	Picture is so good that we are supporting they Society the recycling system in another we actually collected ourselves
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:11,391	| IOT161 |	But maybe the most important part 2 also is to enable the possibility of our products
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:17,535	| IOT161 |	To actually be prolonged in society and right now we are designing the products according to what we call the circular principal
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:24,447	| IOT161 |	So what is the material that is it possible to repair the product is it possible to make it this is
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:30,591	| IOT161 |	Assembled and make it possible so that we have a lot of these design principles that were thinking into the product design right
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:33,407	| IOT161 |	When dealing with technology
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:34,943	| IOT161 |	I have to imagine that
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:36,223	| IOT161 |	The life of Technology
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:38,271	| IOT161 |	Matters is part of this design
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:42,623	| IOT161 |	How do you think of like your lamp example kind of throws me because I like
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:46,719	| IOT161 |	What the battery lasting longer than that lamp itself that's crazy talk so
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:50,815	| IOT161 |	If I'm thinking about more traditional technology that I'm putting in things that might last
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:52,863	| IOT161 |	25 or 30 years
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:54,143	| IOT161 |	How do you design
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:55,423	| IOT161 |	For that summer
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:56,959	| IOT161 |	Modularity seems to be
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:45:00,543	| IOT161 |	Modularity is key and also to prepare for that day
EDL	00:45:00,543	00:45:01,567	| IOT161 |	Could be completed
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:07,199	| IOT161 |	Technology of course it was interesting though I think is that the life length of a project when you talk
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:13,599	| IOT161 |	Do Ikea is by Italy you have everything from something in the paper napkin that lasts very shortly
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:15,135	| IOT161 |	Sterilize things
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:21,535	| IOT161 |	Table or a couch that maybe last 400 years depending on what it actually is so of course again you have to
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:22,815	| IOT161 |	Looking to where is
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:25,631	| IOT161 |	Is the application where is the function and how does this fit
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:32,031	| IOT161 |	Atlanta it can be a very long living loud like we should also think about it that it could be a short
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:36,383	| IOT161 |	If it is a bit shorter lifelinks we have less material invested in it
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:37,407	| IOT161 |	And it should be highly recycle
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:38,943	| IOT161 |	Okay and how does
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:42,015	| IOT161 |	Bradley not just in products for the consumer home
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:44,575	| IOT161 |	How does IKEA think about using
EDL	00:45:44,575	00:45:46,111	| IOT161 |	Iot to help
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:48,415	| IOT161 |	Push sustainability or push efficient
EDL	00:45:48,927	00:45:53,023	| IOT161 |	I think it's really interesting journey and I think we're really in the beginning on this one
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:58,143	| IOT161 |	And I think if you look at it where we are right now it's been a lot in the talks about
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:45:58,911	| IOT161 |	Efficiency
EDL	00:45:58,911	00:46:02,239	| IOT161 |	So the starting point of course efficiency we talked about health
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:04,031	| IOT161 |	Safety
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:05,567	| IOT161 |	But you can also look at
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:08,383	| IOT161 |	If you start to look at that that's a better product solution
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:11,199	| IOT161 |	Investor home
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:17,343	| IOT161 |	We're now starting to see how this connects to behavior in the home and if you start to think about behavior in the home assistant
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:19,135	| IOT161 |	Consumption Nissan
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:20,671	| IOT161 |	Lifestyle
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:23,743	| IOT161 |	There's a whole other perspective into what this could do
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:25,023	| IOT161 |	And there were just looking into
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:26,047	| IOT161 |	At the moment
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:31,679	| IOT161 |	See with the two Dimension though all the time not to be mixed up there is
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:37,823	| IOT161 |	Disability and sustainability agenda that we will be very strict on we will not compromise on our efficiency and our way
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:41,919	| IOT161 |	Designing products with the materials we select and how we produce them
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:45,759	| IOT161 |	We will also look at the function and the combination of that
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:48,575	| IOT161 |	Could be the greatest possibility when you log into new homes
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:52,671	| IOT161 |	So is my smart lights I can never expect my smart lights from Ikea to be like
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:56,767	| IOT161 |	Burn more fuel stay on all the time I'm looking for more things that
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:47:01,119	| IOT161 |	We were brainstorming things like 5 minutes
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:03,167	| IOT161 |	Things I'd like help you
EDL	00:47:03,167	00:47:07,775	| IOT161 |	What is your process for trying out new technologies is it developed in Alice to go to Partners
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:14,687	| IOT161 |	Are we both I mean we're not doing I think the interesting thing now is of course looking into the whole creation of Pi
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:19,807	| IOT161 |	Possibilities not only think that we are the one that can solve everything but actually go great with others
EDL	00:47:20,319	00:47:23,903	| IOT161 |	Open up alot to see you a kind of everything from how we mix
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:30,303	| IOT161 |	New materials and find out new production technology for recycling for example to a function of a product
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:34,911	| IOT161 |	Two ideas in good ideas so it's opening up I think a lot and it's
EDL	00:47:34,911	00:47:35,423	| IOT161 |	Synopsis
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:39,263	| IOT161 |	Awesome alright so thank you so much thank you
