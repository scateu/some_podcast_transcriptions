EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:55,616	| IOT215 |	What a week
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:58,432	| IOT215 |	I already tired and we haven't even started
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,480	| IOT215 |	And it's not just because I'm traveling
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:03,040	| IOT215 |	I'll let everyone know that I'm recording this week from a hotel room
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:06,112	| IOT215 |	So any weirdness in the sound that is my fault
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,136	| IOT215 |	And
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,416	| IOT215 |	You can
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:11,232	| IOT215 |	Certain send me emails telling me all about how you don't like it
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:12,768	| IOT215 |	Or how you do like
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,536	| IOT215 |	Whichever
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,328	| IOT215 |	It won't change anything but you can send this
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,888	| IOT215 |	You can tell me how you
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:20,704	| IOT215 |	So let's talk about
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,984	| IOT215 |	Google IO
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,008	| IOT215 |	Cuz this week
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:23,776	| IOT215 |	We had two big Tech
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,824	| IOT215 |	Is Google IO and Microsoft bills
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:32,480	| IOT215 |	Both are really important in our space so we'll start with
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,504	| IOT215 |	Google because
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,368	| IOT215 |	So much yes there's so much
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:41,952	| IOT215 |	Yes I actually watched the live Keynote
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,000	| IOT215 |	Providing commentary on
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:46,304	| IOT215 |	Watching it
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:50,656	| IOT215 |	There was a ton obviously some of it does not apply to this particular show
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:52,960	| IOT215 |	But if you're not aware there are new pixel phones that are
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:55,776	| IOT215 |	Half the price of the current ones and still have all the
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,312	| IOT215 |	Good photo qualities etcetera
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:00,640	| IOT215 |	What's a fungi always
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:08,576	| IOT215 |	For our purposes there are at least three or four
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,624	| IOT215 |	Key aspects I just want to bring up
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,136	| IOT215 |	Today
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:15,744	| IOT215 |	And I want to emphasize how privacy and security was
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,559	| IOT215 |	Underline message
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,607	| IOT215 |	Google IO for the Keynote
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:22,911	| IOT215 |	And that's that's obviously important to our listeners
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,447	| IOT215 |	For all their connected devices
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:26,495	| IOT215 |	So in that regard
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:29,055	| IOT215 |	Google demonstrated and discussed
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:30,079	| IOT215 |	How they're doing
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,871	| IOT215 |	Natural language
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:32,383	| IOT215 |	Process
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:36,223	| IOT215 |	This is mainly taking place on the phone
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:36,991	| IOT215 |	Today
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,551	| IOT215 |	Google said they basically compressed like
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:42,111	| IOT215 |	A language down from the learning model rather from
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,903	| IOT215 |	100 GB
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,183	| IOT215 |	Down to
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:47,743	| IOT215 |	I have a gig which fits on a phone obviously
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,791	| IOT215 |	And what that does is it
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:54,399	| IOT215 |	Brinks privacy when you're speaking to devices that have on device NLP
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,703	| IOT215 |	Presume this will be coming to the
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:59,519	| IOT215 |	Approximately in the near future but it's for phones right now
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:02,079	| IOT215 |	Protect your privacy because the
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:06,431	| IOT215 |	Things you say don't go to the cloud it's all happening on device because
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:08,223	| IOT215 |	Already there
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:09,503	| IOT215 |	So that is important
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:12,575	| IOT215 |	Additionally Google is talking about their next
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,599	| IOT215 |	Generation
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,367	| IOT215 |	Assistant
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,135	| IOT215 |	Of course
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,159	| IOT215 |	In the home
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:18,463	| IOT215 |	People that Google Home Products that's very relevant
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:22,303	| IOT215 |	Discussion again was around on device processing
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:24,607	| IOT215 |	Also what they're doing with the assistant
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:27,679	| IOT215 |	Last year they had duplex were they
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:31,519	| IOT215 |	Yeah you can speak
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,543	| IOT215 |	Reservations
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:33,823	| IOT215 |	Which you can do that now
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,847	| IOT215 |	I took about a year
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,127	| IOT215 |	Blowout etcetera but it's here
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,919	| IOT215 |	In actually
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:38,943	| IOT215 |	Just a quick
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:42,527	| IOT215 |	I didn't realize this duplex like full duplex
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:45,087	| IOT215 |	Conversations basically mean a conversation where
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:47,903	| IOT215 |	Highest person can say something and then
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:49,951	| IOT215 |	Another person responds so it's a
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,719	| IOT215 |	Actual Back info
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:53,279	| IOT215 |	So I had no idea that's where the name Duke
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:57,631	| IOT215 |	Oh yeah I mean I thought about it from like modem
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,935	| IOT215 |	Yes I don't know why I didn't make that connection
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:01,983	| IOT215 |	That's okay
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,007	| IOT215 |	Back to the 80s
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,799	| IOT215 |	Anyway
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:06,847	| IOT215 |	So they're bringing duplex to the web
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:09,919	| IOT215 |	And they showed off how you can book a car
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:12,479	| IOT215 |	Next trip for example you're on a trip
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:15,807	| IOT215 |	Google on a trip because you probably have email saying that right
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:20,415	| IOT215 |	Yes Google knows where I'm staying at night how I'm getting there when I'm getting there
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,183	| IOT215 |	Yes
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,487	| IOT215 |	So what you could do in the demo anyway
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:26,047	| IOT215 |	Sho Nuff you could say hey G
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,607	| IOT215 |	Book a car with national for my next trip
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:33,727	| IOT215 |	Instead of going through all the steps in on the way International app
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,519	| IOT215 |	The assistant
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:40,639	| IOT215 |	Refills in all the information based on where you are when you're going to need a car
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:44,991	| IOT215 |	What car you might have enjoyed using last time etcetera because has that
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,039	| IOT215 |	So it can
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:50,879	| IOT215 |	Free fill everything in and can say okay I've got your car books
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:52,671	| IOT215 |	Do you want to pick up class
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,207	| IOT215 |	Chose this class last time
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:56,511	| IOT215 |	And literally make a reservation happen
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,023	| IOT215 |	4 Yuan
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:02,143	| IOT215 |	That's really cool to be even cooler if I can save book the cheapest car and it can go find
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,447	| IOT215 |	I would not surprise me if
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:07,007	| IOT215 |	I always want more Kevin
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:15,455	| IOT215 |	Also they should work on switch
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:16,991	| IOT215 |	However
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:19,295	| IOT215 |	Because again Google has this information
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:23,647	| IOT215 |	Later this summer you're going to see on Smart displays a new feature called pics
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,671	| IOT215 |	For you not
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:26,207	| IOT215 |	Pictures for you but pics
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:30,047	| IOT215 |	Such as suggestions of recipes events and podcasts
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:33,119	| IOT215 |	Which is fantastic because podcast Discovery is a
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:33,631	| IOT215 |	Huge cow
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,191	| IOT215 |	Yes why aren't more people listening to
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,007	| IOT215 |	I didn't go there but yes
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,311	| IOT215 |	All over the place
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:43,103	| IOT215 |	All right
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,639	| IOT215 |	We got gesture control
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:51,039	| IOT215 |	Gesture controls in the home and I wrote a post about this not that long ago
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:53,343	| IOT215 |	Isn't all that when it comes to the home
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:57,183	| IOT215 |	There are times you want to do things without waking somebody up or shouting to speaker
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,999	| IOT215 |	An amazing new
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:00,511	| IOT215 |	Google
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:01,791	| IOT215 |	Nest
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:04,351	| IOT215 |	Hubmax will talk about short languages
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,887	| IOT215 |	Their next smart display
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:08,191	| IOT215 |	It has a camera and that camera has
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,983	| IOT215 |	Face match
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:12,287	| IOT215 |	Meaning if you allow it to
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:14,079	| IOT215 |	Recognize faces you have to train it
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:20,991	| IOT215 |	When people sit in your house they will save their calendar information pop-up which is rather interesting
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,295	| IOT215 |	From a Jester standpoint when it's
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,063	| IOT215 |	Laying
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:27,391	| IOT215 |	Music or something like that maybe your phone rings you want to stop
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,927	| IOT215 |	You don't have to shout out hey
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:33,791	| IOT215 |	Instead you can just wave your hand or put a talk to the hand gesture out there
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:34,559	| IOT215 |	It will stop playing
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,607	| IOT215 |	Now I kind of wanted to do that automatically
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:39,935	| IOT215 |	With yonomi
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,983	| IOT215 |	Once I discovered my devices
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:45,311	| IOT215 |	Actually automatically whenever my phone would ring
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,591	| IOT215 |	It would stop on my Sonos
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,663	| IOT215 |	It was kind of cool but it did kind of
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,711	| IOT215 |	I had to take my daughter Sonos out
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:53,247	| IOT215 |	She got really mad when my phone
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,527	| IOT215 |	In her music interview
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,039	| IOT215 |	Greenwood stop
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:56,575	| IOT215 |	However
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:00,927	| IOT215 |	Pennisi privacy implication again
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:04,511	| IOT215 |	What Google is doing is it is switching
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,047	| IOT215 |	The learning models for language
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:10,399	| IOT215 |	And switching to the edge so what happens now or will happen
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:15,519	| IOT215 |	The learning model happened on your phone or your Google assistant device
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,311	| IOT215 |	And only the
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,591	| IOT215 |	Model itself
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:22,431	| IOT215 |	Will go back up to the cloud to make everyone's model better
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:26,527	| IOT215 |	So your date is going to stay local you won't be sending it to the cloud goes we sending
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:28,319	| IOT215 |	Model information
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:31,391	| IOT215 |	Excellent and going back to your own device natural language
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,951	| IOT215 |	This is something I wrote about unless
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,487	| IOT215 |	Swix newsletter I talked about
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:38,047	| IOT215 |	With something like this and a microphone
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:41,631	| IOT215 |	People could actually build voice control devices that aren't connected to
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:45,471	| IOT215 |	The cloud exactly now this will only work for Less sophisticated
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,775	| IOT215 |	Things like you're obviously not going to go
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,311	| IOT215 |	Here we go full duplex
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:51,871	| IOT215 |	With some of it isn't cloud-connected but
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:54,431	| IOT215 |	There are lots of things where you could actually
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:55,967	| IOT215 |	Have
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,015	| IOT215 |	Functioning NLP model Plus
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:58,783	| IOT215 |	Sense of
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,831	| IOT215 |	Commands available to the device
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:02,111	| IOT215 |	It would make a lot of sense.
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,415	| IOT215 |	So a washing machine
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:04,927	| IOT215 |	One of my favorites
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,207	| IOT215 |	Because
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:09,535	| IOT215 |	Little complicated you're like I've got a bunch of sweaters or jeans
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,583	| IOT215 |	If you could just tell it
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,375	| IOT215 |	I'm washing a load of jeans
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:15,679	| IOT215 |	It could actually pick the settings
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,191	| IOT215 |	For you
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,263	| IOT215 |	Yeah without the cloud
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:22,079	| IOT215 |	That seems like a really good use cases
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,615	| IOT215 |	Reducing
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,895	| IOT215 |	The intellectual load
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,407	| IOT215 |	For the person
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:28,223	| IOT215 |	And also enabling a computer
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,247	| IOT215 |	Voice control to make it
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,271	| IOT215 |	Easy to do something
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:36,671	| IOT215 |	Kind of help can I get the sense from Google IO that that's where they're heading with all of this which is wonderful because
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:40,255	| IOT215 |	Today everything has to be connected for a Google home
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:41,279	| IOT215 |	If you don't have
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,303	| IOT215 |	Internet connection
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,863	| IOT215 |	Google home as useless as our other products
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,655	| IOT215 |	Eczema products such as mathematics
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,703	| IOT215 |	You have to wonder though
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:51,007	| IOT215 |	Google's big revenue is it sad business
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:54,335	| IOT215 |	So where does an inn we don't need to answer this today
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,359	| IOT215 |	I don't think we're going to but
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:57,663	| IOT215 |	My overarching question
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:59,455	| IOT215 |	Google is going to be
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:01,503	| IOT215 |	I know that they're using data to build
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,015	| IOT215 |	Better products
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,319	| IOT215 |	Siddharth said
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:05,855	| IOT215 |	At some point in
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:07,647	| IOT215 |	Time if you're not advertising
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,415	| IOT215 |	Sing what are you do
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:14,303	| IOT215 |	And it makes sense everywhere and you don't have screens everywhere you do have to flip
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,119	| IOT215 |	So just keep that in my
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,471	| IOT215 |	Home Products are going to get better in one way
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,775	| IOT215 |	And yet they're going to get worse in another
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:26,847	| IOT215 |	So Google has killed
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,383	| IOT215 |	It's works with Nest program
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,919	| IOT215 |	Or rather it is killing it
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:34,527	| IOT215 |	After June 25th you'll be asked to migrate your
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:36,063	| IOT215 |	Nest accounts
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:37,855	| IOT215 |	It sounds like your Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,415	| IOT215 |	Google
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:40,927	| IOT215 |	Home
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,279	| IOT215 |	Yes because it's kind of vicious
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,047	| IOT215 |	There's a lot of
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:47,327	| IOT215 |	Duplicity there
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:49,119	| IOT215 |	Duplicity that's lying
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:55,263	| IOT215 |	There's a lot of vacations there has been a long week
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,591	| IOT215 |	3200k
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,639	| IOT215 |	So you're basically
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,919	| IOT215 |	In some ways this makes sense
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,455	| IOT215 |	So what's happening
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,735	| IOT215 |	Is there killing their works with me
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:08,319	| IOT215 |	You will be asked to migrate Your Nest account
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:11,135	| IOT215 |	Your Google Wi-Fi account all of this into one
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,159	| IOT215 |	Google home
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:13,439	| IOT215 |	Google assist
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:19,583	| IOT215 |	And the reason they're doing this is because they're changing the way the nest device
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,631	| IOT215 |	Historically
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:24,959	| IOT215 |	Developers have been able to use apis to call for info
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,007	| IOT215 |	Information from Nest devices so like
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:30,079	| IOT215 |	I might have my hue light bulbs talk to Nest to say
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:31,871	| IOT215 |	Is Stacey home or away right now
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:34,431	| IOT215 |	And if I go away it will actually change my lighting
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:40,575	| IOT215 |	Because I'm away and it's nice that makes my house look more lived-in and secure even if I'm on vacation
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:41,855	| IOT215 |	So
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,135	| IOT215 |	That is going to change
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:46,463	| IOT215 |	No longer will devices be able to grab
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,231	| IOT215 |	Data
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:47,999	| IOT215 |	From Nest device
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:51,327	| IOT215 |	So if you are another Smart Home
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:51,839	| IOT215 |	Company
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,887	| IOT215 |	Or a service such as if
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:55,935	| IOT215 |	Etc
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:57,983	| IOT215 |	You will now have to go through Google home
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,519	| IOT215 |	To talk to Nest device
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,311	| IOT215 |	And you won't
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,079	| IOT215 |	Be able to get
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:02,591	| IOT215 |	Data from
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,151	| IOT215 |	So instead of
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:06,431	| IOT215 |	I look at it like
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:07,967	| IOT215 |	In the older
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:12,575	| IOT215 |	System all of my Nest devices in my Google devices they work together through
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:14,111	| IOT215 |	Formal integration that I did
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:14,879	| IOT215 |	My Nest devices
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:17,183	| IOT215 |	Other devices through formal integration
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:20,511	| IOT215 |	And basically every device had a brain
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:21,535	| IOT215 |	And many of them
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:27,423	| IOT215 |	What's going to happen is all of my Nest devices are basically losing their brain
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:27,935	| IOT215 |	Inability to
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:29,983	| IOT215 |	They're only going to talk to
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:33,311	| IOT215 |	And the implications of this are
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:36,639	| IOT215 |	If you have Nest devices those Integrations will break
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,663	| IOT215 |	As of the end of
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,431	| IOT215 |	August
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,967	| IOT215 |	And that means if you got
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:40,991	| IOT215 |	Thermostats at
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:41,759	| IOT215 |	Store
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,807	| IOT215 |	Are any of that all of that goes away
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,343	| IOT215 |	Some of them
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,367	| IOT215 |	Will be reinstated
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:47,903	| IOT215 |	But not all of them
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:49,951	| IOT215 |	Google actually
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:50,719	| IOT215 |	Had been
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,487	| IOT215 |	Very
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,023	| IOT215 |	Considered
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:55,071	| IOT215 |	About how it used its API so
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:58,143	| IOT215 |	It actually limited the API calls on Nest devices
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:00,191	| IOT215 |	Is it wouldn't actually give you video
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:01,471	| IOT215 |	Turn Nest devices to other
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,775	| IOT215 |	Video capable screams unless they were Google
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:05,823	| IOT215 |	So
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:07,359	| IOT215 |	Some of this week and moving toward
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:10,431	| IOT215 |	But there's a bunch of applications
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:11,455	| IOT215 |	Consumers
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:13,759	| IOT215 |	So let's talk about
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,551	| IOT215 |	What is
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,831	| IOT215 |	Every smart home now
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:19,647	| IOT215 |	Needs a hug that's the model we have clearly moved
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:23,231	| IOT215 |	So in Google's world it wants it to be the Google home
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:25,023	| IOT215 |	In Amazon's World it wants
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:25,535	| IOT215 |	To be madame
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,839	| IOT215 |	The funny thing is we
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:32,191	| IOT215 |	This is kind of reverse ending for the past I'd say year I've kind of been
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:33,727	| IOT215 |	Giving up on hubs
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,263	| IOT215 |	NSYNC
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,055	| IOT215 |	I want a hug
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,335	| IOT215 |	But I guess
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,615	| IOT215 |	Market dozen
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:40,639	| IOT215 |	Now the market soccer
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:43,967	| IOT215 |	Right
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:47,039	| IOT215 |	So this begs the question hey what happens to
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:51,647	| IOT215 |	Companies that have acted as like virtual hubs or physical Hub so like a SmartThings
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:52,671	| IOT215 |	Wink
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:53,951	| IOT215 |	You know me
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,231	| IOT215 |	Etcetera
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:56,767	| IOT215 |	I look at
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:57,791	| IOT215 |	Dislike
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:59,327	| IOT215 |	SmartThings will probably
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,863	| IOT215 |	Now go
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,655	| IOT215 |	Talk to Nest devices through the goo
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:03,935	| IOT215 |	I see that
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:07,263	| IOT215 |	It'll be an interesting test for WIC
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:09,311	| IOT215 |	To see how really on top of things they are
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:10,591	| IOT215 |	Because
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:12,383	| IOT215 |	This is going to be a development of
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:14,687	| IOT215 |	There's going to be a pool here that you have to make
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,735	| IOT215 |	And I don't know if link is going to do it
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,271	| IOT215 |	And then
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:21,599	| IOT215 |	With a company like you know me which is all virtual
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:22,367	| IOT215 |	Don't know how this is
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:25,695	| IOT215 |	I am very eager to talk to them
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:26,719	| IOT215 |	Send out some emails
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:28,511	| IOT215 |	End with ant if
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:30,303	| IOT215 |	It says that it will not hurt it at all
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:32,095	| IOT215 |	Rishi Chandra
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,631	| IOT215 |	Who is
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:35,167	| IOT215 |	Ahead of Hardware over at
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,935	| IOT215 |	Google
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:38,239	| IOT215 |	He actually spoke to a colleague of ours yonko
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:39,263	| IOT215 |	Add variety
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:41,055	| IOT215 |	And he basically said
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:41,567	| IOT215 |	This kills
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:42,847	| IOT215 |	Didn't basically
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,895	| IOT215 |	You said it will break
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:45,663	| IOT215 |	It
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:47,455	| IOT215 |	So that's
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,735	| IOT215 |	Not great news for EFT
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:54,623	| IOT215 |	When people who really rely on if they mean there's going to be a lot of upset people with they haven't heard this news already
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:55,647	| IOT215 |	Yes
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:56,927	| IOT215 |	So
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,463	| IOT215 |	You're like oh my gosh
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,999	| IOT215 |	I love my smartphone
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:00,767	| IOT215 |	What should I do
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:04,607	| IOT215 |	Well the scorched-earth protective gear
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,399	| IOT215 |	Google to the curb
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:08,447	| IOT215 |	But this is going to be happening
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:10,751	| IOT215 |	Everywhere because what's happening is
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:14,079	| IOT215 |	Your Hardware devices are providing valuable data
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:18,431	| IOT215 |	They're also providing that dated other places and it's become too hard for a cup
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,199	| IOT215 |	Company to control
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:21,247	| IOT215 |	So long with fist
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:23,295	| IOT215 |	Announcement Google is actually put out
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,575	| IOT215 |	Really good
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,855	| IOT215 |	Guidelines for
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,391	| IOT215 |	What sensors are in it
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:27,903	| IOT215 |	Devices
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:29,695	| IOT215 |	Hello sensors are used
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:30,719	| IOT215 |	And
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:32,767	| IOT215 |	How the data from the
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,279	| IOT215 |	Centers are you
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:37,375	| IOT215 |	That's not something it could do if it was actually sending this out 2/3
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,143	| IOT215 |	Parties
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:40,191	| IOT215 |	So in some ways this taking back up
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:41,983	| IOT215 |	Control benefits you as a
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:42,751	| IOT215 |	As a user
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:43,775	| IOT215 |	Better perspective
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:45,567	| IOT215 |	Understanding
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,591	| IOT215 |	Who has your data in
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:48,383	| IOT215 |	Now
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,407	| IOT215 |	As a consumer
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,199	| IOT215 |	Sort of hate
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,967	| IOT215 |	I get why it's at
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:55,551	| IOT215 |	I do hate the fact that now all my Nest devices are
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:57,343	| IOT215 |	That they're no longer like
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:59,903	| IOT215 |	I don't know if they're going to work in Google's going to do it
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:00,927	| IOT215 |	Man
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:02,719	| IOT215 |	Integration right Nest at 1
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,743	| IOT215 |	Will Google
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:04,255	| IOT215 |	No idea
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,279	| IOT215 |	So
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,559	| IOT215 |	That
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,839	| IOT215 |	Could be a problem
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,631	| IOT215 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:11,679	| IOT215 |	There are plenty of smart thermostat
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:13,727	| IOT215 |	Out there in the world there are plenty of sick
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:14,751	| IOT215 |	Security systems out there
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:17,311	| IOT215 |	It may be that
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:19,359	| IOT215 |	If you go all in on Google
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,383	| IOT215 |	You get to seamless
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:22,175	| IOT215 |	Apple like experience right
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,711	| IOT215 |	And a lot of people like
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:25,759	| IOT215 |	And they don't mind being that limited
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,551	| IOT215 |	So they will keep that
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:30,111	| IOT215 |	Imagine a lot of our listeners will
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:32,159	| IOT215 |	Probably steer closer to
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,439	| IOT215 |	Another device
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:35,743	| IOT215 |	Maybe it's the ecobee thermostat
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,767	| IOT215 |	That is really awesome
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,815	| IOT215 |	Maybe they do something with Honeywell
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:41,631	| IOT215 |	2 works with both Google and madam
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:42,911	| IOT215 |	End
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:43,679	| IOT215 |	Siri
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,727	| IOT215 |	So they're still options if
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,239	| IOT215 |	If you want to have fun
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:47,519	| IOT215 |	Multi-Device
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:48,543	| IOT215 |	Household
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,079	| IOT215 |	You're going to have to
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,895	| IOT215 |	To go independent and you're going to have to work a little harder
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:59,551	| IOT215 |	That's the downside of meanness make things more difficult in the decision-making and setup process
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:03,391	| IOT215 |	Planning process it's going back to a side load model
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,671	| IOT215 |	Wish app
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:06,719	| IOT215 |	Has pretty much a solid model
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:10,303	| IOT215 |	Now looks like Google's going that way in yet
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,071	| IOT215 |	They don't
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,863	| IOT215 |	Truly have like a multi radio
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:16,703	| IOT215 |	And one thing it was not announced was that next gen
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:18,239	| IOT215 |	Google WiFi product
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:22,079	| IOT215 |	All-in-one with a Mesh networking and potentially
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,383	| IOT215 |	As a hub that I've been talked about
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,151	| IOT215 |	Before
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:26,943	| IOT215 |	Mr. All That device is still in the works
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:29,759	| IOT215 |	So is there a Google home
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,807	| IOT215 |	True upcoming I don't know
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,367	| IOT215 |	Yeah me either
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,135	| IOT215 |	So
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:41,535	| IOT215 |	That's pretty much all we have time for but we'll we'll probably keep talking about this as more information comes out and where vendors are
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:46,399	| IOT215 |	And in a lot of it you're going to see in your home a lot of emails over the next few days telling you
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:49,471	| IOT215 |	This particular device is going to change his functionality
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:51,007	| IOT215 |	We didn't even get into like the idea of
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:53,823	| IOT215 |	How device functionality changes but will do that later
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:58,175	| IOT215 |	Okay before we get away from Google I O I just want to
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:00,735	| IOT215 |	7/32 invention that Google
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:02,527	| IOT215 |	Nest hubmax which is a new product
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,575	| IOT215 |	It's a 10 inch smart display very
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,879	| IOT215 |	It's identical to the smaller
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,927	| IOT215 |	What used to be called Google home hub
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:09,951	| IOT215 |	It's now called the
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,719	| IOT215 |	Nest hub
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:15,071	| IOT215 |	This has one more prone to tweeters for Better Sound it's got a camera
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:17,375	| IOT215 |	What you can turn off electronically not with a shutter
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,423	| IOT215 |	And
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,703	| IOT215 |	That camera can be used
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:23,007	| IOT215 |	Like a nest cam to monitor
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,055	| IOT215 |	The room around it
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:27,615	| IOT215 |	Got a security feature as well
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,895	| IOT215 |	The original
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:29,919	| IOT215 |	Google home hub
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:31,455	| IOT215 |	Yes
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,503	| IOT215 |	I should probably dig into the Google privacy
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,015	| IOT215 |	Palisades
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,295	| IOT215 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,831	| IOT215 |	Look for my newsletter it's going to be
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,343	| IOT215 |	Full of exciting
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:40,159	| IOT215 |	All right moving along
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:44,511	| IOT215 |	Not very far just to the next digital assistant over Madam a
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:46,047	| IOT215 |	Amazon's digital assistant
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,071	| IOT215 |	Do we calm anime because
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:47,839	| IOT215 |	Cuz we don't want to set everyone
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:55,263	| IOT215 |	Jeff Eller over at the Washington Post did a wonderful deep dive on his Madam a
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:58,079	| IOT215 |	Differences these are the things you say or every time that
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:58,847	| IOT215 |	Madam
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:19:59,871	| IOT215 |	Wakes up
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:01,407	| IOT215 |	And says yes
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:06,783	| IOT215 |	It starts recording so he went and listened to all of his recordings over the years of living with
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:10,111	| IOT215 |	And what he found is
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:10,623	| IOT215 |	A lot of
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:12,671	| IOT215 |	Totally normal
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,951	| IOT215 |	Interactions where he's like
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:14,719	| IOT215 |	Turn on the lights
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,231	| IOT215 |	Play the song
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:16,511	| IOT215 |	Set a timer
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:22,143	| IOT215 |	Videos about a lot of times where it was mistakenly activated and lots of fragments of conversations that
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,935	| IOT215 |	Should have never been recorded
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:24,703	| IOT215 |	Much less
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:26,239	| IOT215 |	Tencent up to the cloud for bras
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:27,519	| IOT215 |	So
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:31,103	| IOT215 |	People read this and he said he is actually dumping his
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,639	| IOT215 |	Amazon Echo and his Google.
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:34,431	| IOT215 |	He's like yeah I'm done
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,711	| IOT215 |	Not doing it
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,991	| IOT215 |	I know this is how she
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:42,367	| IOT215 |	And I went through and I actually on my Google device change the way
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:45,183	| IOT215 |	It works because you can go in on your Google devices
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:46,463	| IOT215 |	Pause the
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:46,975	| IOT215 |	Recordings
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:51,327	| IOT215 |	So it won't actually record your utterances when
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,095	| IOT215 |	You say something
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:52,607	| IOT215 |	Like a g
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,143	| IOT215 |	Now
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,423	| IOT215 |	That means it won't go
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:57,471	| IOT215 |	Get better so that is the trade-off your make
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:58,239	| IOT215 |	Getting there
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,519	| IOT215 |	However I was like yeah I'll make that
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,031	| IOT215 |	Straight up at school
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:02,335	| IOT215 |	There's not an option
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,359	| IOT215 |	Palazzo
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:05,407	| IOT215 |	I don't know what do you think Kevin I'm like should I
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,431	| IOT215 |	Don't matter to me
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:08,223	| IOT215 |	And I know this is happening
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:13,343	| IOT215 |	It's a very personal choice on it so I can't make a blanket statement telling people what to do
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:17,440	| IOT215 |	I think you have the right approach you have a good understanding of
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:20,512	| IOT215 |	What it says what it sends to the cloud
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:23,840	| IOT215 |	And you're making that choice you know between convenience and privacy
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:28,704	| IOT215 |	Don't use a madhumeh my house is outfitted with Google products
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:30,240	| IOT215 |	Cause
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:34,080	| IOT215 |	I just prefer those products in the way they work it has nothing to do with the privacy
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:35,360	| IOT215 |	So
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:41,760	| IOT215 |	I don't know I mean this is not something I mean I don't think anybody should be terribly surprised by this
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:44,576	| IOT215 |	4 years putting a microphone and or cameras in your house
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:46,112	| IOT215 |	Ways to privacy
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:47,392	| IOT215 |	Challenges and
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,416	| IOT215 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:52,768	| IOT215 |	If that's the kind of environment you want to live in where you have the convenience
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:54,560	| IOT215 |	Of the features that these bring them
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:57,120	| IOT215 |	You're going to have to live with those privacy application
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:00,704	| IOT215 |	Right and as part of that or maybe it was
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,216	| IOT215 |	Was totally into
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:04,032	| IOT215 |	Over a taxi ozena freed who is
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:04,544	| IOT215 |	Excellent
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:09,664	| IOT215 |	Said or did an article on what Amazon knows about you
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:12,224	| IOT215 |	And it's pretty astonishing
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:12,736	| IOT215 |	I mean
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:15,296	| IOT215 |	It's not astonishing
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:15,808	| IOT215 |	You know if you
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:19,136	| IOT215 |	Oh yeah Amazon
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:21,696	| IOT215 |	Video
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:26,304	| IOT215 |	Or what how many books are read on my Kindle including for me my library books because I get
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,072	| IOT215 |	A lot of library books
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:30,144	| IOT215 |	Hand with key
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,424	| IOT215 |	Amazon go in nose
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,240	| IOT215 |	And it was
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:37,312	| IOT215 |	It was a pretty good overview some of the link to that so you can have
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:39,104	| IOT215 |	More educated decision
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:41,664	| IOT215 |	I didn't really talk about Amazon's credit cards
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,688	| IOT215 |	Chase Bank
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:45,504	| IOT215 |	I have one of those along with many other people in
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,808	| IOT215 |	Look at those quite a bit about that too
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:51,392	| IOT215 |	Nina also has Links at the bottom of that
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:54,976	| IOT215 |	With similar articles about what Google knows about you Facebook
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:57,792	| IOT215 |	Tesla Etc and they are also well worth the read
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:00,352	| IOT215 |	Alright here's some
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,376	| IOT215 |	Little Amazon product
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,424	| IOT215 |	Amazon has
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:07,776	| IOT215 |	Dependents man of a ring integration with person detection alerts
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,824	| IOT215 |	About time
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:16,224	| IOT215 |	Yeah so this is a new feature you can find in the settings for your ring camera just
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:17,248	| IOT215 |	Disabled person
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:18,016	| IOT215 |	Detection
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:21,344	| IOT215 |	And I assume it works similar to like the nest hello person detect
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:27,232	| IOT215 |	She better notification that tells you who's at your door or in the middle
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:30,304	| IOT215 |	I don't even have to open
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,328	| IOT215 |	I just need to know Kevin
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:34,912	| IOT215 |	Amazon is also a blink XT
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:36,960	| IOT215 |	T2 camera
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:38,496	| IOT215 |	Is a battery powered
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,288	| IOT215 |	Camera Amazon bought blink
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:41,312	| IOT215 |	2 years ago
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:43,104	| IOT215 |	Link head
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:47,200	| IOT215 |	Been a chip company that had a really cool image processing chip that
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,480	| IOT215 |	Was very low power
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:49,248	| IOT215 |	And
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:54,624	| IOT215 |	That didn't sell very well or didn't sell it high enough margins for them so they decided they were going to make a camera
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,160	| IOT215 |	And I sold the camera
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:58,976	| IOT215 |	And it's worked really well and Amazon bought it so they got a
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:01,280	| IOT215 |	A camera company but they also got a really cool
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,816	| IOT215 |	Silicon provider
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:03,328	| IOT215 |	As part of that
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:05,120	| IOT215 |	Background of Link
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:05,888	| IOT215 |	The blink
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:07,936	| IOT215 |	Xt2
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:10,752	| IOT215 |	Is an indoor outdoor battery-powered 1080
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:13,312	| IOT215 |	PhD video camera
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,848	| IOT215 |	Two-way audio
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:18,432	| IOT215 |	It's going to be 90 bucks with free cloud storage and no monthly fees
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:19,456	| IOT215 |	I will say
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:21,760	| IOT215 |	We got a lot of requests for a
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:22,528	| IOT215 |	Wireless
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,040	| IOT215 |	Outdoor cam
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:24,320	| IOT215 |	This
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:28,416	| IOT215 |	It does amazed at the battery life they claim
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:29,696	| IOT215 |	Two double a batteries
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:32,512	| IOT215 |	Would last up to 2 years of battery life
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:36,096	| IOT215 |	That is the medical power of optimized silicon
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:37,632	| IOT215 |	Yep
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:40,448	| IOT215 |	So I'm going to get one of these cuz
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:40,960	| IOT215 |	Why not
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:43,520	| IOT215 |	Wireless outdoor camera in $90
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:46,080	| IOT215 |	Is that why is kimchi
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,616	| IOT215 |	No but it's not crazy
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:48,640	| IOT215 |	Much less
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:51,200	| IOT215 |	Soho k
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:52,992	| IOT215 |	Moving on to the next big Tech
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:54,528	| IOT215 |	Compass Microsoft
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:55,552	| IOT215 |	Also happening this
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:59,136	| IOT215 |	And a lot of stuff on the industrial sites
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:02,208	| IOT215 |	Things We Should Know Windows 10 iot
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:05,280	| IOT215 |	They actually are making it a lot
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:05,792	| IOT215 |	Easier
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,328	| IOT215 |	To get your old
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:10,144	| IOT215 |	I don't include industrial but you're old
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:14,496	| IOT215 |	Stuff that's running older versions of Windows like Windows CE
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:16,288	| IOT215 |	Over to Windows iot
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,056	| IOT215 |	Windows 10
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:20,128	| IOT215 |	So that migration was really important
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:22,944	| IOT215 |	Because there's tons of old stuff out there
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:25,504	| IOT215 |	It is susceptible to all kinds of security flaws
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:27,040	| IOT215 |	We just need to tell
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:30,880	| IOT215 |	But you can't kill something that you spent $1000000 on it runs like some highly
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,648	| IOT215 |	Proprietary process
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:33,696	| IOT215 |	But now you can migrate it
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,464	| IOT215 |	Yay
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:36,512	| IOT215 |	Microsoft also announced
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:39,328	| IOT215 |	Rather it's AI in robotics
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:40,096	| IOT215 |	Cool kid
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:41,888	| IOT215 |	Any limited preview for Windows
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:47,776	| IOT215 |	So you can
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:48,800	| IOT215 |	And as your tools
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:51,104	| IOT215 |	Physical systems
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,384	| IOT215 |	Yay
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:56,992	| IOT215 |	Now basically this is the really embedded part of
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:57,760	| IOT215 |	The internet
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:59,296	| IOT215 |	Things in Microsoft
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:03,136	| IOT215 |	There's ways to get them running a modern secure operating system
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,416	| IOT215 |	That will conveniently
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:05,440	| IOT215 |	Tie back into a cloud
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:06,720	| IOT215 |	All right
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:09,536	| IOT215 |	Also at build twilio
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,840	| IOT215 |	Announced that they will have
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:14,144	| IOT215 |	Some of their iot SIM cards
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:18,240	| IOT215 |	Will Ty and very easily to Microsoft azure iot
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:23,616	| IOT215 |	SKB part of Microsoft iot plug-and-play connectivity effort in
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:24,384	| IOT215 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:31,040	| IOT215 |	Way way way back in the day when you actually connected your printer and keyboards and stuff to your computer they had a plug and play poker
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,600	| IOT215 |	So you didn't have to download driver
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:37,184	| IOT215 |	Microsoft Word with all these device manufacturers that they were like
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,464	| IOT215 |	Where can I build everything we need
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:41,792	| IOT215 |	So someone can just come in and plug in a printer to this machine
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:47,424	| IOT215 |	That's basically what they're doing with iot plug and play but they're working with manufacturers
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:49,216	| IOT215 |	Devices into the Azure cloud
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:50,496	| IOT215 |	So
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:51,776	| IOT215 |	Similar
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:52,800	| IOT215 |	Concept
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,568	| IOT215 |	Slightly different index
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:56,128	| IOT215 |	And so these are smart Sims
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:27:00,736	| IOT215 |	Run by twilio I think this is going to be a big deal for people who want to
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:01,760	| IOT215 |	Plugin brand
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,040	| IOT215 |	Two devices
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:06,624	| IOT215 |	So large scale
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,160	| IOT215 |	And deploy large
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:09,440	| IOT215 |	Yes
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:12,512	| IOT215 |	The other two things that are worth noting is
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:15,328	| IOT215 |	Microsoft also launched better conversational skills
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,096	| IOT215 |	Cortana
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:17,888	| IOT215 |	And again while
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:20,192	| IOT215 |	Google and Amazon are very focused
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,216	| IOT215 |	Smart home Microsoft
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:21,984	| IOT215 |	Very focused
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,264	| IOT215 |	Enterprise
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:25,312	| IOT215 |	It's doing a lot of the same thing
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:27,104	| IOT215 |	NLP on device
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:30,432	| IOT215 |	Thinking about privacy and basically trying to figure out how to deploy
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:33,248	| IOT215 |	Conversational based agents throughout offices
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:36,832	| IOT215 |	If you think about this this is a really great area for my
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:39,392	| IOT215 |	Microsoft understands that
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:40,672	| IOT215 |	Hey
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:41,440	| IOT215 |	You can't
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:44,000	| IOT215 |	Who does advances because it might be someone's like
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:45,280	| IOT215 |	Secure earnings
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:46,816	| IOT215 |	Who are other data
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:49,888	| IOT215 |	So Enterprises are very concerned about this
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:50,400	| IOT215 |	Sorts of things
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:55,008	| IOT215 |	So looking for Microsoft to do a lot of cool stuff there
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:56,032	| IOT215 |	We're seeing a
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:56,800	| IOT215 |	A couple of last year
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:59,360	| IOT215 |	I was at build and I saw a really
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:27:59,872	| IOT215 |	Awesome demo
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:03,968	| IOT215 |	We're basically this device in the middle of a table
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,736	| IOT215 |	R MTG
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:05,760	| IOT215 |	Tok notes
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:07,040	| IOT215 |	Flag action items
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:08,576	| IOT215 |	Concentra portal
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:09,344	| IOT215 |	Everyone who is a
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,880	| IOT215 |	The meeting this is the kind of
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:11,392	| IOT215 |	Technology that
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:13,184	| IOT215 |	Fairy Tail
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:14,464	| IOT215 |	So
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:16,512	| IOT215 |	Yay looking forward to that
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:19,072	| IOT215 |	And then there's one that everyone was talking about
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:20,096	| IOT215 |	On Twitter
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:23,168	| IOT215 |	Was a demonstration of recommendation engine
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:24,448	| IOT215 |	Interpolated drive-thrus
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:24,960	| IOT215 |	Starbucks
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:26,240	| IOT215 |	It was very cool
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:29,056	| IOT215 |	I'm not going to go into that because you know Microsoft just bought a compass
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:30,080	| IOT215 |	Neither does the same thing
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,128	| IOT215 |	I fully expect recommendations
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:33,408	| IOT215 |	Everywhere I am
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:34,432	| IOT215 |	Anyting
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:35,712	| IOT215 |	But
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:37,504	| IOT215 |	What's cool about the Starbucks demo
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:38,528	| IOT215 |	1
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:41,856	| IOT215 |	They're putting iot and all sorts of Starbucks gear
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:44,416	| IOT215 |	For the predictive maintenance and making sure everything's
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,184	| IOT215 |	Running
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:45,952	| IOT215 |	Well in the
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:46,720	| IOT215 |	Physical stores
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:49,024	| IOT215 |	But also they're using
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:51,072	| IOT215 |	Azure sphere to do it
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:53,376	| IOT215 |	Azure sphere Grew From
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,656	| IOT215 |	Microsoft Project sober
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:55,936	| IOT215 |	A couple years ago
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:58,496	| IOT215 |	This is Microsoft sway
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:28:59,520	| IOT215 |	Keurig iot
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:01,568	| IOT215 |	It involves a secured ship
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:05,408	| IOT215 |	That talks to the cloud and gets data from the cloud
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,432	| IOT215 |	Certified as being
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:07,968	| IOT215 |	What it's supposed to be
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:11,808	| IOT215 |	And all of the information passing between the devices
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:12,320	| IOT215 |	McLeod isn't
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:14,112	| IOT215 |	And
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,392	| IOT215 |	It's in the cloud
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:17,696	| IOT215 |	Checking for vulnerabilities as they
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:18,464	| IOT215 |	Come up and then
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:19,488	| IOT215 |	Letting
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:21,792	| IOT215 |	Updating the chip and letting the
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:23,072	| IOT215 |	Manufacturer
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:24,864	| IOT215 |	So this is kind of like an ongoing
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:26,656	| IOT215 |	Physical 2
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:27,424	| IOT215 |	To Cloud
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:28,192	| IOT215 |	Security solution
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:32,544	| IOT215 |	Microsoft just talked about for a while but I haven't actually seen anyone using
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:33,824	| IOT215 |	But now I have
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:37,408	| IOT215 |	And that's good because for a while
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:40,480	| IOT215 |	When they announced it a lot of people are very skeptical they're like
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:42,016	| IOT215 |	Yeah I don't think this is really
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:43,296	| IOT215 |	I know it is
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:44,320	| IOT215 |	Okay
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,624	| IOT215 |	Few other stories to get to
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:47,904	| IOT215 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:49,952	| IOT215 |	The Bluetooth Sig
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:51,488	| IOT215 |	Special interest group
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:54,560	| IOT215 |	Has released a report will link to it in the show notes
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:56,864	| IOT215 |	Basically it's telling us that
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:58,144	| IOT215 |	There is a lot of blue
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:00,448	| IOT215 |	For example
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:02,240	| IOT215 |	There are now
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:04,800	| IOT215 |	34465
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:06,848	| IOT215 |	Bluetooth Sig members
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:07,872	| IOT215 |	That is a
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:09,408	| IOT215 |	70%
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:10,432	| IOT215 |	Birth rate in Alaska
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:11,200	| IOT215 |	5 years
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,224	| IOT215 |	Witches
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:16,576	| IOT215 |	In 2018 there now 3.7
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:19,648	| IOT215 |	Billion Bluetooth devices shipped
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:22,208	| IOT215 |	A dumper they expect to grow
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:23,488	| IOT215 |	25.4 billion
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:24,768	| IOT215 |	By 22
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:26,816	| IOT215 |	That's per year
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:29,376	| IOT215 |	Well that's not cumulative that's amazing
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:30,400	| IOT215 |	Yeah
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:36,288	| IOT215 |	Okay so there's a lot of really good information in here like
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:39,616	| IOT215 |	Hey of those shipments how many are for audio streaming
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:40,640	| IOT215 |	Versus
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:42,176	| IOT215 |	Just straight up
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:44,992	| IOT215 |	Sensors and health and wellness in others
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:46,784	| IOT215 |	So we'll dig into that a little bit more
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:48,320	| IOT215 |	The newsletter
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:50,880	| IOT215 |	You can read the report
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:52,160	| IOT215 |	From the links in the show notes
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:56,768	| IOT215 |	Okay in the update to a story we talked about last week we talked about
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:59,072	| IOT215 |	Tenants in a New York apartment building
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:02,400	| IOT215 |	Suing their landlord who wanted to put latch
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:03,424	| IOT215 |	Deadlox
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:04,448	| IOT215 |	The building
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:06,752	| IOT215 |	In that case is now settled
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,264	| IOT215 |	So
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:09,312	| IOT215 |	The results of the settlement
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:09,824	| IOT215 |	NR that
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:11,104	| IOT215 |	Tenants
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:13,408	| IOT215 |	Get physical keys
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:15,712	| IOT215 |	If they want that they argued that their privacy issues
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:16,736	| IOT215 |	Play etcetera
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:18,528	| IOT215 |	The downside is this is a settlement
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:20,064	| IOT215 |	This isn't any sort of legal
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:21,088	| IOT215 |	Decision solution
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:22,624	| IOT215 |	President being set here really
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,672	| IOT215 |	Except for other
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:25,696	| IOT215 |	Kudzu in
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:26,464	| IOT215 |	Point of this settlement
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:27,488	| IOT215 |	I guess
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:29,024	| IOT215 |	But
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:31,072	| IOT215 |	This is bad news for latch
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:36,704	| IOT215 |	Or maybe it's bad news for landlords who want to cheap out and buy only electronic systems
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:38,752	| IOT215 |	Without physical keys because latch actually does
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:40,032	| IOT215 |	Offer a physical keys
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:42,848	| IOT215 |	And so in the settlement
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:43,872	| IOT215 |	The judge said that
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:46,944	| IOT215 |	Hey physical keys are a required service for landlords
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:48,992	| IOT215 |	So a smart entry system
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:50,016	| IOT215 |	It's not considered
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:54,112	| IOT215 |	A required service so at the landlord doesn't provide physical keys
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:56,416	| IOT215 |	The tenants could bring this to court
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,184	| IOT215 |	Again so
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:58,976	| IOT215 |	Keep that in mind you guys if you
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:01,536	| IOT215 |	You're getting a smart lock system in your apartment building and
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:02,304	| IOT215 |	You don't
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:03,072	| IOT215 |	Want to give up
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:03,584	| IOT215 |	Physical key
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:09,472	| IOT215 |	Yeah it's not just a privacy the people concern within one particular person in the
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:11,264	| IOT215 |	And the case is 93 years old
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:16,128	| IOT215 |	Says he's not capable of using a phone anytime self trapped in his home because the Smart Lock
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:19,200	| IOT215 |	Yep that's the sort of thing people love to read about
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:21,504	| IOT215 |	All right

EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:17,312	| IOT215 |	Open close sensors and one motion sensor
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:18,848	| IOT215 |	All of these
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:20,128	| IOT215 |	Work with a wise
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:23,456	| IOT215 |	The bridge plugs into the back of the wise
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:24,224	| IOT215 |	Cameras
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:27,040	| IOT215 |	So basically what you're looking at is for
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:28,320	| IOT215 |	4250 bucks
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:30,624	| IOT215 |	You get this like me
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:31,648	| IOT215 |	Security system
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:33,952	| IOT215 |	It is not monitored
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:37,792	| IOT215 |	So keep that in mind but it is a really convenient way
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,328	| IOT215 |	To set up
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:42,656	| IOT215 |	You should call it security maybe we should just call it information
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:45,728	| IOT215 |	I mean it's nice nice to know
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:49,056	| IOT215 |	When people are coming and going in my house so I set this up
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:50,080	| IOT215 |	In about 15 minutes
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:51,360	| IOT215 |	Plugged in
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:55,456	| IOT215 |	The camera I put the bridge and I said everything up but got a comprehensive
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:55,968	| IOT215 |	Review on this site
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:58,528	| IOT215 |	The bridge goes into the actual camera
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:01,600	| IOT215 |	It does so Kevin eat this is a bridge you would not mind
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:05,440	| IOT215 |	Exactly cuz it's not another box sitting somewhere on a table
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:06,976	| IOT215 |	And I put in my camera at the
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:07,744	| IOT215 |	Front door
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:08,512	| IOT215 |	My apartment
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:10,048	| IOT215 |	And I stuck the
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:15,680	| IOT215 |	Open close sensor on there and every time I set it up so every time that door opens it record the snippet of video
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,448	| IOT215 |	And
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:17,216	| IOT215 |	It works
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:20,032	| IOT215 |	I don't know how to say actually since I'm traveling
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:22,848	| IOT215 |	I've used it to check on my dog who spends all day by the front door waiting
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:24,896	| IOT215 |	I decided
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:28,736	| IOT215 |	I'm not going to lie it's really sad to watch
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:29,760	| IOT215 |	And I said
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:34,112	| IOT215 |	Another sensor I set it up on the back door and then I set up a motion sensor
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,648	| IOT215 |	At the back window
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:36,928	| IOT215 |	Because we got
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:39,488	| IOT215 |	Paint it it looks over the balcony that we have
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:40,768	| IOT215 |	Pick up painters on the balcony
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:41,280	| IOT215 |	A psychologist
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:42,560	| IOT215 |	Wanted to
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:44,352	| IOT215 |	I'll keep an eye on them
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:49,216	| IOT215 |	For that setup though I would need another camera where I guess I would do the pancam to go pay on where the motion was
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:51,264	| IOT215 |	I don't know if it actually does that
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:52,288	| IOT215 |	Cuz I don't have a pan
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:53,824	| IOT215 |	Nuts
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:55,104	| IOT215 |	Okay
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:35:00,992	| IOT215 |	It works I don't know how else to say it. Latency is incredibly low these are sensors that only work with wise there on a
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:03,552	| IOT215 |	Totally proprietary sub gigahertz frequency
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:05,856	| IOT215 |	They're small
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:08,672	| IOT215 |	I cannot emphasize to you guys house small
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:09,696	| IOT215 |	The sensors are
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:11,488	| IOT215 |	Bear less than an inch
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:12,768	| IOT215 |	It is
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:13,280	| IOT215 |	Crazy to me
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:16,864	| IOT215 |	Haven't worked with these like to install motion sensors
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:22,496	| IOT215 |	Also crazy is the price what you're getting for your 20s
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:23,776	| IOT215 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:28,384	| IOT215 |	Granted you have to have a $20 wyzecam so case was for 40 bucks to really use it
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:29,920	| IOT215 |	But still
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:31,200	| IOT215 |	I get a camera
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:31,968	| IOT215 |	Motion sensor
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:34,272	| IOT215 |	To open close sensors
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:40,160	| IOT215 |	And have that kind of functionality for literally 40 bucks you have nothing to wise products now
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:44,512	| IOT215 |	That is crazy cheap cuz I just one motion sensor can easily cost you
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:46,048	| IOT215 |	20 bucks if not more
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:46,816	| IOT215 |	Oh yeah and
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:48,352	| IOT215 |	This is quality Care
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:51,424	| IOT215 |	I obviously have not been testing it for a year longer
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:53,216	| IOT215 |	So I can't tell you how the battery life
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:54,240	| IOT215 |	Going to work
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:55,264	| IOT215 |	I can tell you
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,056	| IOT215 |	It comes
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:59,872	| IOT215 |	The tape already on the back so you don't have
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:00,896	| IOT215 |	Mess with that
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:01,664	| IOT215 |	Having tested
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:02,688	| IOT215 |	Dozens
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:04,992	| IOT215 |	These sorts of devices over the last few
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,528	| IOT215 |	Sears this is easily
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:07,808	| IOT215 |	Up there in build
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:09,856	| IOT215 |	Lovely
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:12,416	| IOT215 |	The other thing that people who are privacy-focused my
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:15,488	| IOT215 |	Want to know about his wife lets you record everything to an SD card
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:16,000	| IOT215 |	On the camera
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:18,816	| IOT215 |	And yes
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:24,192	| IOT215 |	But you don't have to have the SD card if you do the event-based recording it will go to the cloud
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:25,216	| IOT215 |	So you need to know that
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:25,984	| IOT215 |	And
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:30,080	| IOT215 |	They use encryption on the device they have two-factor authentication which we love
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:30,848	| IOT215 |	Because
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,640	| IOT215 |	Two factors the way to go
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:33,920	| IOT215 |	End
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:35,456	| IOT215 |	Yeah
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:39,296	| IOT215 |	I did this just to play with it
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:42,368	| IOT215 |	It's also a great gift graduation is coming up here
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:44,672	| IOT215 |	Your kids are going to be moving the college are moving to
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:45,696	| IOT215 |	Apartments
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:48,768	| IOT215 |	Something like this is a really nice way to get them
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:51,584	| IOT215 |	Okay
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:52,864	| IOT215 |	So
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:54,400	| IOT215 |	The show has been crazy long
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:56,704	| IOT215 |	Going longer still
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:57,984	| IOT215 |	Please
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:59,520	| IOT215 |	Stay tuned for our guest
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:04,384	| IOT215 |	Kiva all good who is the brand new head of iot and Automotive at Erickson
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:05,664	| IOT215 |	We're going to be talking about
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:07,456	| IOT215 |	IG
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,992	| IOT215 |	We're also going to be talking about
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:12,064	| IOT215 |	Why the industrial internet-of-things has not
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:13,344	| IOT215 |	Got me adoption
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:13,856	| IOT215 |	It deserves
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:15,392	| IOT215 |	And a lot more
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:16,928	| IOT215 |	So stay tuned for her
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:18,720	| IOT215 |	And for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:21,280	| IOT215 |	This week sponsor is Dell Technologies
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:29,984	| IOT215 |	Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:33,568	| IOT215 |	Dell Technologies and we are here with bask Iyer who is
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:39,456	| IOT215 |	And general manager for Edge and iot at Dell Technologies
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:42,784	| IOT215 |	Bascule bikini next week at iot world
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:44,064	| IOT215 |	And one of the big
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:46,880	| IOT215 |	Is how organizations
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:48,672	| IOT215 |	Can learn to be digital organization
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:50,464	| IOT215 |	Do you have any insights
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:51,744	| IOT215 |	To offer our audience on that
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:53,024	| IOT215 |	Yeah
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:57,632	| IOT215 |	Digital is not just technology it's about people process and Technology
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:38:00,960	| IOT215 |	And we found that in all this is the time to hire good talent
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:04,800	| IOT215 |	People who actually understand digital who actually understand real time
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:08,128	| IOT215 |	You know your business excetera you cannot just Outsource this
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:11,456	| IOT215 |	And we going to talk about process we going to steal a few things from
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:17,600	| IOT215 |	The world of software development and introduced the concept of the edge I'm not just for software development but the whole company
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:21,440	| IOT215 |	And then obviously technology as a big play
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:23,744	| IOT215 |	So it's not just technology but equal
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:30,144	| IOT215 |	So we talked about people across the same technology and culture the culture is a culture of innovation culture of doing
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:33,472	| IOT215 |	Something trying out and if it fails come back very quickly
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:36,800	| IOT215 |	Concert is going to be very important in this world of moving to digital as well
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:39,360	| IOT215 |	And I understand you're going to be bringing a case study
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:40,640	| IOT215 |	Along with you
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:41,664	| IOT215 |	Can you tell me more about that
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:46,528	| IOT215 |	Sure this is going to be exciting we going to bring an actual case study we going to
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:52,928	| IOT215 |	Showcase the city of Las Vegas how they're trying to improve the efficiency and safety and drive Innovation obviously
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:55,744	| IOT215 |	BM Arendelle Technologies and her partner
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:56,512	| IOT215 |	ATT
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:39:00,608	| IOT215 |	And how we create an ecosystem of large-scale iot and its solution
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:02,912	| IOT215 |	So Cal Technologies
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:07,264	| IOT215 |	Is working with a lot of companies in building ecosystems
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:11,104	| IOT215 |	So where does Dell Technologies and VMware play in that
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:12,384	| IOT215 |	When should folks call you
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:16,224	| IOT215 |	We actually believe that we want to encourage is ecosystem
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:20,576	| IOT215 |	You know we don't believe one player can dominate or should dominate this whole Space
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:23,136	| IOT215 |	Iot and Edge is very big it's going to benefit
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:25,440	| IOT215 |	All of human society worldwide
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:27,488	| IOT215 |	Strongly believe that didn't
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:30,304	| IOT215 |	Believer ecosystem
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:32,864	| IOT215 |	Please show that before BMX well-known
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:39,008	| IOT215 |	To promote multiple ecosystems multiple partners multiple storage vendors multiple Drive cloud
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:42,848	| IOT215 |	We call ourselves the multi-cloud multi-application Multi-Device company
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:48,992	| IOT215 |	So that's why the ecosystem is important and quite honestly the people we're going to be working in iot and Edge are people
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:58,464	| IOT215 |	People such as Honeywell Siemens MSI such as NDT Emerson
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:01,792	| IOT215 |	Tillotson and Allen Bradley and so on and so on and so on
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:05,888	| IOT215 |	Ecosystem for all it players all OT players
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:09,728	| IOT215 |	And all system integrators so we can provide what is Right Seneca
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:12,800	| IOT215 |	Excellent so where can we go
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:14,592	| IOT215 |	To learn more about Dell technology
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:20,992	| IOT215 |	Well you could come to the Dell Technologies, iot and we'll have a lot of information
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:33,536	| IOT215 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:37,120	| IOT215 |	Is Kiva Allgood who is the head of iot and Automotive
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:39,680	| IOT215 |	Akita how are you
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:41,472	| IOT215 |	I'm great sweetie how are you
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:42,752	| IOT215 |	Excellent
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:44,800	| IOT215 |	It's all right so you recently
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:51,200	| IOT215 |	Joint efforts now so let's talk about
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:52,480	| IOT215 |	How you look at the iot
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:56,064	| IOT215 |	Yes all things iot and Automotive
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:59,648	| IOT215 |	So you know anything that's not a handset I'm super excited to be part of the air
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:04,256	| IOT215 |	Family and team and from my point of view iot is a slightly over
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:07,584	| IOT215 |	Word internet of things or industrial internet
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:08,608	| IOT215 |	The reality is it
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:10,400	| IOT215 |	The platform of the future
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:11,168	| IOT215 |	The way I look
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:15,264	| IOT215 |	So all the transformation that we've seen over the last 10 years
EDL	00:41:15,264	00:41:18,336	| IOT215 |	Connecting People via phone so you no longer attached
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:21,920	| IOT215 |	To the wall you can go anywhere globally and that really means everything
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:22,944	| IOT215 |	He says you think about
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:25,248	| IOT215 |	Transitioning from a analog world
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:28,320	| IOT215 |	To a digital world that's happening in your car
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:29,856	| IOT215 |	What's happening in Europe
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:30,880	| IOT215 |	Appliances
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:31,648	| IOT215 |	Happening
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:32,160	| IOT215 |	Industrial
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:33,696	| IOT215 |	Dance floor
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:34,720	| IOT215 |	That's happening
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:38,816	| IOT215 |	Turn thermostat elevators you think about anything we start to touch
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:41,376	| IOT215 |	It is being transformed by connectivity
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:42,656	| IOT215 |	And so
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:43,936	| IOT215 |	From my point of view
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:47,264	| IOT215 |	It's a it's a perfect place to be because they're going to be driving the
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:48,288	| IOT215 |	Forefront of that change
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:55,199	| IOT215 |	I agree with you actually I am very much that iot is a platform of light Broadband was kind of like the mobile
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:42:01,599	| IOT215 |	The internet was having everything be connected and having data streams from all of them is going to enable entirely new ecosystem
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:02,879	| IOT215 |	Systems services
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:03,903	| IOT215 |	Is it going to be
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,671	| IOT215 |	But
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:05,951	| IOT215 |	We're not there yet so
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:07,487	| IOT215 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:13,887	| IOT215 |	You worked at Qualcomm which is on the chip side doing building that actual infrastructure u42 GE which is very applied
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:16,703	| IOT215 |	And now you're on the kind of networking site at Erickson so
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:18,239	| IOT215 |	Given that you have this
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:21,567	| IOT215 |	Wide-ranging view of what we need to make iot
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:22,335	| IOT215 |	T possible
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:24,383	| IOT215 |	Let's run through some of the big challenges
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:27,455	| IOT215 |	A lot of people talk about there being like a billion connected to
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:30,527	| IOT215 |	Devices switch feels like a lot but even if we want to get to you know
EDL	00:42:30,527	00:42:31,295	| IOT215 |	100 million
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:36,671	| IOT215 |	We're still dealing with some basic challenges of scale
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:37,951	| IOT215 |	Which ones
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:38,463	| IOT215 |	Are you thinking
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:43,071	| IOT215 |	In order for that Internet of Things
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:44,351	| IOT215 |	Become truly that
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:44,863	| IOT215 |	Format p
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:47,167	| IOT215 |	Can design develop
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:48,447	| IOT215 |	Tree ecosystem
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:52,543	| IOT215 |	Become the next millionaire off of we are going to need to strive for
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:54,079	| IOT215 |	Interoperability
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:55,871	| IOT215 |	And interoperability will drive
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:56,639	| IOT215 |	Scalability which
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:43:00,479	| IOT215 |	Without the combination of those two things
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:01,503	| IOT215 |	It's really difficult
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:02,015	| IOT215 |	Get to that prophet
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:05,343	| IOT215 |	I also think one of the key things that
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:06,623	| IOT215 |	Is bullying thing
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:07,903	| IOT215 |	Holding
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:09,951	| IOT215 |	Say it isn't technology
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:10,719	| IOT215 |	It's human behavior
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:15,071	| IOT215 |	So if you think about where we're starting to connect things it's on a plant floor
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:16,863	| IOT215 |	The factory already exists
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:18,911	| IOT215 |	There's in billions of dollars spent
EDL	00:43:18,911	00:43:19,679	| IOT215 |	How to build backpack
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:21,471	| IOT215 |	Now we're going to retrofit and
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:24,799	| IOT215 |	Connected wirelessly with 5G cuz you can
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:26,335	| IOT215 |	The latency and the
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:28,127	| IOT215 |	Performance is the same as if it was wired
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:32,991	| IOT215 |	Plus you get a whole bunch of other productivity cuz you could rework the the factory floor
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:33,759	| IOT215 |	In a day
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:36,063	| IOT215 |	But a plant manager is going to be resistant
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,367	| IOT215 |	Because they're so used
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:42,975	| IOT215 |	Kind of the way things are and the way the factories laid out today to tell them
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:45,023	| IOT215 |	They could reconfigure their floor in a day
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:46,303	| IOT215 |	They would be
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:48,095	| IOT215 |	No way because they're the ones
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:48,863	| IOT215 |	Responsible for the outfit
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:50,655	| IOT215 |	Plus there's a lot of
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:52,959	| IOT215 |	Systems and things designed in Ms
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:55,263	| IOT215 |	Example that industrial example
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:56,543	| IOT215 |	That would have to also be flat
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:44:01,663	| IOT215 |	You have to keep your OSHA ratings you have to have documentation how things work
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:02,687	| IOT215 |	How to keep your eyesight
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:03,711	| IOT215 |	Certification
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:04,991	| IOT215 |	Sport in the
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:10,111	| IOT215 |	Wireless space we were just replacing a phone on the wall and putting it in your pocket and then it became a soup
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:11,391	| IOT215 |	Computer
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:12,671	| IOT215 |	Standards bodies like
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:16,255	| IOT215 |	3gpp and others that were working collectively together
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:19,839	| IOT215 |	Bring those things to Market we have to start to see that in the internet
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:22,911	| IOT215 |	There's a lot of work being done and gone 3gp
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:29,311	| IOT215 |	AEP and other standards bodies but now they have to find their way into other forms and other places that people work
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:35,711	| IOT215 |	So that's like the National Association for water utilities Naruto or the electrical certification contortion
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:37,503	| IOT215 |	Since he's got all of these standards
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:39,807	| IOT215 |	And standards bodies that also have to be in school
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:42,111	| IOT215 |	Understand the value
EDL	00:44:42,111	00:44:45,183	| IOT215 |	That wireless connectivity can bring in the iot can bring
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:48,511	| IOT215 |	And I was this year at Hanover I'll tell your personal story
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:50,047	| IOT215 |	The 5G was at the Forefront
EDL	00:44:50,559	00:44:51,327	| IOT215 |	Insecure you've got this
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:53,375	| IOT215 |	Historic event
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:55,167	| IOT215 |	That's I've had the pleasure of being
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:56,703	| IOT215 |	An attendee at
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:58,239	| IOT215 |	Over probably the last six
EDL	00:44:58,239	00:45:01,823	| IOT215 |	Yours and connectivity with a component of it but it wasn't at
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:03,871	| IOT215 |	Forefront of the show and this year it really was
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:09,759	| IOT215 |	Searching for starting we're at the tip of that transition where the people's behavior and recognizing that
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:12,831	| IOT215 |	You can do it differently is going to start to change people's behavior
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:13,855	| IOT215 |	Start to change
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:17,695	| IOT215 |	Kisses but you have to get to interoperability to get to
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:18,719	| IOT215 |	The scalability
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:20,511	| IOT215 |	To get to profitability in the eye
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:22,559	| IOT215 |	To space and that means people are going to have to change the
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:26,143	| IOT215 |	The Technology's finally there it's available
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:27,679	| IOT215 |	So it's not a technical issue
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:30,751	| IOT215 |	At the people performance and positioning issue
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:31,263	| IOT215 |	In my opinion
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:32,799	| IOT215 |	Okay
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:34,847	| IOT215 |	I also agree with you on the standard size
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:35,615	| IOT215 |	End
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:38,687	| IOT215 |	I would say what is interesting about iot
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:41,759	| IOT215 |	And there are parallels is
EDL	00:45:41,759	00:45:45,343	| IOT215 |	That this is something that's going to be adopted unevenly across differ
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:45,855	| IOT215 |	Industries
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:47,135	| IOT215 |	In
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:49,951	| IOT215 |	We don't actually have bass technical standards yet
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:51,231	| IOT215 |	Which I think are really important
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:54,047	| IOT215 |	Forgetting things at the
EDL	00:45:54,047	00:45:56,351	| IOT215 |	Network layer to talk to each other
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:45:58,143	| IOT215 |	Standards around security
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:46:00,959	| IOT215 |	Babies in interoperability around certain types of devices
EDL	00:46:01,471	00:46:04,543	| IOT215 |	But I also think we're going to have them at the industry level and
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:11,455	| IOT215 |	I'm curious if you think the industry is going to adopt standards around iot faster than maybe they
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:13,247	| IOT215 |	They did around mobile or even
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:13,759	| IOT215 |	Broadband
EDL	00:46:14,527	00:46:19,135	| IOT215 |	I would hope so I mean I I think to your point if we do a double click this on battery life
EDL	00:46:19,647	00:46:20,927	| IOT215 |	To me that's not a
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:22,207	| IOT215 |	Technical issues forum
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:23,231	| IOT215 |	Can't be solved
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:25,791	| IOT215 |	And that's how I think about it's a matter of
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:27,583	| IOT215 |	A lot of times we don't understand the use
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:30,911	| IOT215 |	I'll give a good example of a water
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:34,239	| IOT215 |	Project in Australia where
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:38,079	| IOT215 |	Company was spending millions of dollars sending people out text out to measure Lakes
EDL	00:46:38,591	00:46:40,639	| IOT215 |	Because they had to for a commitment to build a building
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:41,919	| IOT215 |	And
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:43,711	| IOT215 |	In part because they felt like they
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:46,527	| IOT215 |	Couldn't use wireless for some reason even though it was actually
EDL	00:46:46,527	00:46:47,039	| IOT215 |	Fully covered
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:49,599	| IOT215 |	And it was because
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:54,207	| IOT215 |	The people who were tried to sell them a product it was sending a signal every 15 seconds
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:57,535	| IOT215 |	Will they only send a person out there once a month to measure the depth
EDL	00:46:57,535	00:46:58,303	| IOT215 |	The lake
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:47:03,423	| IOT215 |	So you could put in software that would say hey if they're like one above or below this
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:05,983	| IOT215 |	Then send a signal Center reports
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:09,055	| IOT215 |	And I took the battery life from basically a week
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:09,823	| IOT215 |	5 years
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:10,591	| IOT215 |	So I think
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:13,151	| IOT215 |	You have to really really really understand
EDL	00:47:13,663	00:47:15,199	| IOT215 |	How the technology is going to be
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:15,711	| IOT215 |	Applied
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:17,759	| IOT215 |	And then figure it out
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:19,295	| IOT215 |	I think there's been a lot of ice
EDL	00:47:19,295	00:47:20,319	| IOT215 |	I'd say false
EDL	00:47:20,319	00:47:21,599	| IOT215 |	Oh that will never work
EDL	00:47:21,599	00:47:26,463	| IOT215 |	Because people haven't taken the time to really understand the technical application
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:27,487	| IOT215 |	Are the use case
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:28,255	| IOT215 |	Required
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:29,791	| IOT215 |	Okay
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:32,351	| IOT215 |	And that gets to this idea of resilience
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:36,703	| IOT215 |	Which in the side of the world in the industrial World these are systems that are made to be
EDL	00:47:37,471	00:47:38,239	| IOT215 |	Resilient
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:39,775	| IOT215 |	They have backups they have
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:41,823	| IOT215 |	Five nines it's not uncommon
EDL	00:47:42,591	00:47:44,127	| IOT215 |	Even more nines is he better
EDL	00:47:44,639	00:47:46,431	| IOT215 |	When we get to the tech world
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:52,319	| IOT215 |	That's not always the case we are getting much better but you know it's only been a few years since you don't
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:53,087	| IOT215 |	Twitter
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:57,439	| IOT215 |	But go down all the time so I can't do this Facebook was just out a couple weeks ago
EDL	00:47:57,951	00:48:04,351	| IOT215 |	How do we bring the Innovation and the kind of flexibility associated with the tech world and build that way
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:06,911	| IOT215 |	With the resilience and redundancy needed by the
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:08,447	| IOT215 |	The industrial world
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:10,751	| IOT215 |	Match these two things
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:11,263	| IOT215 |	Together
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:13,311	| IOT215 |	Yeah that's a fantastic
EDL	00:48:14,079	00:48:16,127	| IOT215 |	And I think it's one that also
EDL	00:48:16,127	00:48:17,407	| IOT215 |	Causes people to shrivel up
EDL	00:48:17,919	00:48:21,247	| IOT215 |	Because they have those user experiences with a tech
EDL	00:48:21,247	00:48:22,271	| IOT215 |	World on a daily basis
EDL	00:48:22,783	00:48:25,343	| IOT215 |	And so also from security breach
EDL	00:48:25,855	00:48:26,367	| IOT215 |	So you brought
EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:29,183	| IOT215 |	Security which is also could be a technical guy
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:30,975	| IOT215 |	To the point of is
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:31,743	| IOT215 |	Good enough
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:34,303	| IOT215 |	If someone can hack their way into a factory and shut it down for the day
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:36,351	| IOT215 |	Then again
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:38,655	| IOT215 |	The impact of that is more than someone losing their phone for
EDL	00:48:39,167	00:48:40,447	| IOT215 |	Today so I think
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:41,471	| IOT215 |	It goes in both.
EDL	00:48:41,471	00:48:43,007	| IOT215 |	And I think that's
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:45,055	| IOT215 |	Actually unique opportunity for
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:46,847	| IOT215 |	Is Ericsson
EDL	00:48:47,359	00:48:49,407	| IOT215 |	Strives for more than 5 9
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:52,479	| IOT215 |	I understand what it means to stand up a network
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:54,783	| IOT215 |	Working as we move into
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:57,087	| IOT215 |	Dirt space we're doing it with that
EDL	00:48:57,087	00:48:57,599	| IOT215 |	Framework
EDL	00:48:58,367	00:48:59,647	| IOT215 |	So I'd say
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:00,671	| IOT215 |	To date that hasn't
EDL	00:49:00,671	00:49:01,695	| IOT215 |	Surly been the case
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:05,023	| IOT215 |	Some other folks that they definitely that all will just stand up and that work
EDL	00:49:05,023	00:49:06,047	| IOT215 |	But they don't realize it
EDL	00:49:06,559	00:49:07,839	| IOT215 |	Really really difficult
EDL	00:49:07,839	00:49:08,863	| IOT215 |	Computer network
EDL	00:49:08,863	00:49:09,887	| IOT215 |	And redundant
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:10,911	| IOT215 |	And Performing all of the
EDL	00:49:11,423	00:49:13,983	| IOT215 |	And that's what's going to be required in order for us
EDL	00:49:13,983	00:49:14,751	| IOT215 |	Austin Moon
EDL	00:49:14,751	00:49:17,823	| IOT215 |	And really make the reality of iot
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:19,103	| IOT215 |	Happen in profit
EDL	00:49:19,103	00:49:22,687	| IOT215 |	And I think that now we're at a point where the network
EDL	00:49:23,199	00:49:24,735	| IOT215 |	Finally with 5G
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:27,807	| IOT215 |	Work will be able to provide that for these berries
EDL	00:49:27,807	00:49:28,831	| IOT215 |	Specific use case
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:32,671	| IOT215 |	And you'll start to see the products in the services stand up around though
EDL	00:49:33,183	00:49:34,975	| IOT215 |	Not everything's going to be in the cloud
EDL	00:49:34,975	00:49:37,279	| IOT215 |	I think you're going to see a lot more Edge compute
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:39,583	| IOT215 |	If you think about what does a Industrial
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:42,655	| IOT215 |	They're having those for today they have a computer usually
EDL	00:49:42,655	00:49:45,215	| IOT215 |	Sometimes they have internet access but not always
EDL	00:49:45,215	00:49:45,983	| IOT215 |	Cuz that's back NBA
EDL	00:49:45,983	00:49:49,567	| IOT215 |	It's red so I I'm confident you'll end up with
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:50,335	| IOT215 |	Services
EDL	00:49:50,335	00:49:52,895	| IOT215 |	It notable get married and they will both be resilient
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:54,687	| IOT215 |	Excellent
EDL	00:49:54,687	00:49:55,455	| IOT215 |	Okay
EDL	00:49:55,455	00:49:56,223	| IOT215 |	End
EDL	00:49:56,223	00:49:58,783	| IOT215 |	You keep bringing it up so let's talk about 5G
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:50:03,647	| IOT215 |	What industries do you see adopting 5G first will it be like
EDL	00:50:03,647	00:50:06,207	| IOT215 |	Consumers will it be factories with a
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:07,743	| IOT215 |	Cars
EDL	00:50:08,255	00:50:10,303	| IOT215 |	Obviously with our carrier partners
EDL	00:50:10,303	00:50:11,839	| IOT215 |	The faster that there is
EDL	00:50:11,839	00:50:13,119	| IOT215 |	Deploy Network
EDL	00:50:13,119	00:50:19,263	| IOT215 |	It's going to be a lower cost per gigabyte than the current 4G so there's a huge incentive there even for the consumer
EDL	00:50:20,287	00:50:21,567	| IOT215 |	Strongly believe that
EDL	00:50:21,567	00:50:22,591	| IOT215 |	It's going to be
EDL	00:50:22,591	00:50:28,479	| IOT215 |	A transition for the carrier partners and then for their customer So the faster we can drive that
EDL	00:50:28,479	00:50:29,503	| IOT215 |	Clicker that equals 2
EDL	00:50:29,503	00:50:35,903	| IOT215 |	System will continue involved after the carrier marketing consumers I do believe that it's going to be industrial and Autumn
EDL	00:50:35,903	00:50:36,927	| IOT215 |	For sure
EDL	00:50:36,927	00:50:39,487	| IOT215 |	Those are two use cases where
EDL	00:50:39,487	00:50:40,767	| IOT215 |	5G create
EDL	00:50:40,767	00:50:41,535	| IOT215 |	Competitive advantage
EDL	00:50:41,535	00:50:43,583	| IOT215 |	They're not as hot sensitive when you're
EDL	00:50:43,583	00:50:45,631	| IOT215 |	Turn off terabytes of data off
EDL	00:50:45,631	00:50:46,399	| IOT215 |	Vehicle
EDL	00:50:46,399	00:50:49,471	| IOT215 |	It has to be real time and it has to be reliable
EDL	00:50:49,471	00:50:50,239	| IOT215 |	5G is the best
EDL	00:50:51,007	00:50:52,031	| IOT215 |	Same thing for the end.
EDL	00:50:53,823	00:50:55,615	| IOT215 |	Lipstick into the industrial use case
EDL	00:50:55,615	00:50:57,407	| IOT215 |	This is because Factory floors are
EDL	00:50:57,407	00:50:59,711	| IOT215 |	Horrible environments for Nerf
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:02,783	| IOT215 |	I love the factory floor
EDL	00:51:02,783	00:51:05,087	| IOT215 |	There's one of my
EDL	00:51:05,087	00:51:06,367	| IOT215 |	They're horrible 4rf
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:12,511	| IOT215 |	If we're talking about deploying 5G in these situations especially with
EDL	00:51:12,511	00:51:14,559	| IOT215 |	At some of the higher frequency
EDL	00:51:14,559	00:51:15,327	| IOT215 |	Spectrum
EDL	00:51:15,327	00:51:16,095	| IOT215 |	How does that
EDL	00:51:16,095	00:51:17,887	| IOT215 |	Work what will that end up looking
EDL	00:51:18,655	00:51:22,239	| IOT215 |	And in one of the big games that the factory floor will get
EDL	00:51:22,239	00:51:23,007	| IOT215 |	From deploying
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:24,287	| IOT215 |	Basically five
EDL	00:51:25,055	00:51:26,591	| IOT215 |	Yeah again you get the low lately
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:28,383	| IOT215 |	You get the high throughput
EDL	00:51:28,383	00:51:29,663	| IOT215 |	High performance
EDL	00:51:29,663	00:51:33,247	| IOT215 |	It really doesn't able to the point where you can cut the cord
EDL	00:51:33,759	00:51:35,807	| IOT215 |	Angular my view and my vision is
EDL	00:51:35,807	00:51:37,599	| IOT215 |	Especially when you start to look at the
EDL	00:51:37,599	00:51:38,623	| IOT215 |	The transformation at the
EDL	00:51:38,623	00:51:43,231	| IOT215 |	Crying in a manufacturing environment
EDL	00:51:43,743	00:51:48,351	| IOT215 |	I hate they want this specialized 3D printed thing for themselves they want their Uggs
EDL	00:51:48,351	00:51:50,911	| IOT215 |	Was just smashed with that or they want their
EDL	00:51:50,911	00:51:52,447	| IOT215 |	Invisalign or plastic
EDL	00:51:52,447	00:51:54,751	| IOT215 |	If you're starting to get to an economy of one
EDL	00:51:54,751	00:51:56,799	| IOT215 |	Which means manufacturing now has
EDL	00:51:56,799	00:51:57,823	| IOT215 |	To be more specialized
EDL	00:51:57,823	00:51:59,871	| IOT215 |	If you could reconfigure the facts
EDL	00:51:59,871	00:52:00,895	| IOT215 |	Before and
EDL	00:52:00,895	00:52:01,919	| IOT215 |	Pull and Pay
EDL	00:52:01,919	00:52:05,503	| IOT215 |	And place different things based off of what was ordered every hour first
EDL	00:52:06,015	00:52:07,807	| IOT215 |	Every month that gives you a ton of flex
EDL	00:52:08,319	00:52:13,183	| IOT215 |	Now 5G if you're able to do that wirelessly at the same output
EDL	00:52:13,183	00:52:13,951	| IOT215 |	Same
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:15,487	| IOT215 |	Reliability and seams
EDL	00:52:15,487	00:52:18,047	| IOT215 |	Security as if you had everything connected
EDL	00:52:18,047	00:52:21,375	| IOT215 |	Then that's a huge that's a leapfrog that's a big step
EDL	00:52:21,375	00:52:22,911	| IOT215 |	We're at that point now
EDL	00:52:23,423	00:52:26,751	| IOT215 |	Partners like a TV and others were we've demonstrated the fact
EDL	00:52:26,751	00:52:28,287	| IOT215 |	That you can get that thing for
EDL	00:52:28,287	00:52:29,823	| IOT215 |	Performance where you haven't been able to
EDL	00:52:30,335	00:52:30,847	| IOT215 |	With others
EDL	00:52:31,615	00:52:32,895	| IOT215 |	And I know from my past
EDL	00:52:33,407	00:52:37,247	| IOT215 |	Experience that we use technologies that on paper that based on science
EDL	00:52:37,247	00:52:39,295	| IOT215 |	If you were to put this radio inside out
EDL	00:52:39,807	00:52:40,575	| IOT215 |	A windmill
EDL	00:52:40,575	00:52:41,855	| IOT215 |	You wouldn't have interference
EDL	00:52:41,855	00:52:45,439	| IOT215 |	But once you did and I'm the window started turning in the generator started
EDL	00:52:45,439	00:52:48,255	| IOT215 |	I'm annoyed that was actually created inside
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:49,279	| IOT215 |	Giant thing
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:50,303	| IOT215 |	It didn't work the Way You Are
EDL	00:52:50,815	00:52:51,839	| IOT215 |	You didn't get the
EDL	00:52:51,839	00:52:52,351	| IOT215 |	That reliable
EDL	00:52:52,863	00:52:54,911	| IOT215 |	I think now you're finally at
EDL	00:52:55,423	00:52:58,239	| IOT215 |	Point where the radio in the connectivity and a connection
EDL	00:52:58,751	00:53:00,543	| IOT215 |	Is going to be able to provide
EDL	00:53:00,543	00:53:02,335	| IOT215 |	The same type of
EDL	00:53:02,335	00:53:03,359	| IOT215 |	Experience
EDL	00:53:03,359	00:53:08,735	| IOT215 |	But you can sometimes better cuz you don't have to issue a rats or people tripping or something cutting
EDL	00:53:08,735	00:53:10,527	| IOT215 |	Did you actually get a ton more
EDL	00:53:10,527	00:53:11,551	| IOT215 |	Flexibility
EDL	00:53:11,551	00:53:13,343	| IOT215 |	As the current user nodejs
EDL	00:53:13,855	00:53:19,999	| IOT215 |	Yeah and I think the flexibility is a really interesting use cases I haven't thought about rats but sure rats also
EDL	00:53:21,023	00:53:23,327	| IOT215 |	When you have programmable
EDL	00:53:23,327	00:53:26,399	| IOT215 |	When you start seeing more AI on the factory
EDL	00:53:26,399	00:53:26,911	| IOT215 |	Floors
EDL	00:53:27,423	00:53:31,775	| IOT215 |	You can actually start moving your equipment around and reprogramming it
EDL	00:53:31,775	00:53:33,567	| IOT215 |	As it were in a way that
EDL	00:53:33,567	00:53:37,663	| IOT215 |	I don't think you could do with a wired system so I talked to a BB and
EDL	00:53:37,663	00:53:38,687	| IOT215 |	A couple other
EDL	00:53:38,687	00:53:40,223	| IOT215 |	Companies about that sort of thing in
EDL	00:53:40,735	00:53:41,759	| IOT215 |	It's pretty exciting
EDL	00:53:42,271	00:53:46,623	| IOT215 |	Titty transformational especially to if you start to think about yeah that's really pretty
EDL	00:53:46,623	00:53:50,975	| IOT215 |	Space that really gives you the flexibility long-term to to have multiple discs
EDL	00:53:50,975	00:53:51,743	| IOT215 |	Lines
EDL	00:53:51,743	00:53:52,767	| IOT215 |	Allows
EDL	00:53:52,767	00:53:54,815	| IOT215 |	La devise a ingenuity
EDL	00:53:54,815	00:53:56,607	| IOT215 |	Start to find its way into Factory
EDL	00:53:56,607	00:53:57,375	| IOT215 |	For which I think is
EDL	00:53:58,655	00:54:00,703	| IOT215 |	Frontier it's really going to be
EDL	00:54:00,703	00:54:03,263	| IOT215 |	The platform of the future it's just going to be redefined
EDL	00:54:03,263	00:54:07,615	| IOT215 |	Economy in a lot of other things coming
EDL	00:54:07,615	00:54:08,639	| IOT215 |	It's a lot more interesting
EDL	00:54:09,151	00:54:10,943	| IOT215 |	If you're trying to find people
EDL	00:54:10,943	00:54:11,967	| IOT215 |	To work at a factory
EDL	00:54:12,735	00:54:16,319	| IOT215 |	If it is more of a robot and it looks more like a phone
EDL	00:54:16,831	00:54:18,367	| IOT215 |	You're going to be able to hire them
EDL	00:54:18,367	00:54:19,647	| IOT215 |	Stokes and Trainor
EDL	00:54:19,647	00:54:20,927	| IOT215 |	It's a lot more effectively and efficient
EDL	00:54:21,951	00:54:23,999	| IOT215 |	So I have been talking with Ericsson
EDL	00:54:23,999	00:54:27,071	| IOT215 |	For probably the last five or six years by iot
EDL	00:54:27,071	00:54:29,375	| IOT215 |	The company has really been very forward-looking
EDL	00:54:29,887	00:54:32,703	| IOT215 |	In building out services in ecosystems
EDL	00:54:32,703	00:54:33,727	| IOT215 |	Json
EDL	00:54:33,727	00:54:35,007	| IOT215 |	I'm curious
EDL	00:54:35,007	00:54:36,031	| IOT215 |	Are we there yet
EDL	00:54:36,543	00:54:40,383	| IOT215 |	I feel like we started talking about it and things weren't real excited and then
EDL	00:54:40,895	00:54:43,711	| IOT215 |	Things had a plateau where people were doing pilot projects
EDL	00:54:44,479	00:54:44,991	| IOT215 |	Really happened
EDL	00:54:45,503	00:54:46,271	| IOT215 |	So
EDL	00:54:46,271	00:54:47,551	| IOT215 |	Do you see us
EDL	00:54:47,551	00:54:53,183	| IOT215 |	Accelerated with iot are we still kind of at this place where we're like a lot of talk and not a lot of action
EDL	00:54:54,207	00:54:56,767	| IOT215 |	Yeah I mean again I I've been here for
EDL	00:54:56,767	00:54:57,791	| IOT215 |	Coming up on a month
EDL	00:54:57,791	00:54:59,071	| IOT215 |	My focus is action
EDL	00:54:59,071	00:55:02,911	| IOT215 |	For sure so you know what I love to do is to take a company from
EDL	00:55:02,911	00:55:04,959	| IOT215 |	A couple hundred million to a billion
EDL	00:55:04,959	00:55:11,359	| IOT215 |	I have faith that the core capabilities are here the core products are here we're getting a lot of traction with the carrier Park
EDL	00:55:11,359	00:55:12,383	| IOT215 |	Partners and they're getting a lot of
EDL	00:55:12,895	00:55:16,991	| IOT215 |	Pull from industrial and Enterprise Partners on wanting to do things to
EDL	00:55:16,991	00:55:18,271	| IOT215 |	Differently sometimes it start
EDL	00:55:18,271	00:55:18,783	| IOT215 |	With a
EDL	00:55:19,295	00:55:20,063	| IOT215 |	He mentioned
EDL	00:55:20,063	00:55:26,207	| IOT215 |	Proof of concept that we're really he's got 32 Partners in the ecosystem around the industrial space
EDL	00:55:27,231	00:55:28,511	| IOT215 |	Had a ton of sick
EDL	00:55:28,511	00:55:29,535	| IOT215 |	Sauce with regard
EDL	00:55:29,535	00:55:31,839	| IOT215 |	To our connectivity manager
EDL	00:55:31,839	00:55:34,399	| IOT215 |	Product and our device management product
EDL	00:55:34,399	00:55:38,751	| IOT215 |	As well as our connectivity management product so we're scaling as quickly as he passed
EDL	00:55:38,751	00:55:45,151	| IOT215 |	I think now it's a matter of can we scale as quickly as the market would like us to and I think that's where I feel
EDL	00:55:45,151	00:55:46,431	| IOT215 |	Canker sore relief
EDL	00:55:46,431	00:55:50,527	| IOT215 |	What are those use cases where we can create the most value and where
EDL	00:55:50,527	00:55:51,295	| IOT215 |	Are those partners
EDL	00:55:51,807	00:55:57,183	| IOT215 |	And partners I think that's one key thing that the internet did so well is it allowed
EDL	00:55:57,183	00:55:57,951	| IOT215 |	Multiple player
EDL	00:55:58,463	00:55:59,487	| IOT215 |	To win to be successful
EDL	00:55:59,487	00:56:03,839	| IOT215 |	Now we're transitioning what I would say is a very traditional closed
EDL	00:56:03,839	00:56:05,375	| IOT215 |	Systems if you think about
EDL	00:56:05,887	00:56:07,423	| IOT215 |	Anna players and
EDL	00:56:07,423	00:56:08,447	| IOT215 |	Oil and gas
EDL	00:56:08,447	00:56:09,215	| IOT215 |	Or
EDL	00:56:09,215	00:56:12,543	| IOT215 |	Even manufacturing for they sold the hardware they sold to
EDL	00:56:12,543	00:56:14,335	| IOT215 |	The software and then they never let anybody else
EDL	00:56:14,335	00:56:15,103	| IOT215 |	Now
EDL	00:56:15,103	00:56:15,871	| IOT215 |	We actually have
EDL	00:56:15,871	00:56:18,175	| IOT215 |	I really think about that transition
EDL	00:56:18,175	00:56:22,783	| IOT215 |	And we have to find the right Partners that'll help us bring our products and
EDL	00:56:22,783	00:56:24,575	| IOT215 |	Solutions to Market as quickly as we pop
EDL	00:56:25,599	00:56:26,879	| IOT215 |	We're going to have to partner fast
EDL	00:56:27,647	00:56:28,671	| IOT215 |	So I think from that
EDL	00:56:28,671	00:56:29,439	| IOT215 |	Perspective
EDL	00:56:29,439	00:56:31,231	| IOT215 |	It's taking our core capabilities
EDL	00:56:31,231	00:56:33,535	| IOT215 |	Matching those up with the system integrators
EDL	00:56:34,047	00:56:36,095	| IOT215 |	And the players in the space under
EDL	00:56:37,887	00:56:40,447	| IOT215 |	Like I said mentioned ABB they know
EDL	00:56:40,447	00:56:41,471	| IOT215 |	Factory floors
EDL	00:56:41,471	00:56:42,239	| IOT215 |	We have a fax
EDL	00:56:42,239	00:56:44,031	| IOT215 |	Before but we don't live in a fact
EDL	00:56:44,799	00:56:47,103	| IOT215 |	We can connect all of the things that we need
EDL	00:56:47,103	00:56:48,383	| IOT215 |	The partners to help us
EDL	00:56:48,383	00:56:52,479	| IOT215 |	Let's get there and create that more open ecosystem that allows a lot of pee
EDL	00:56:52,991	00:56:53,503	| IOT215 |	How to be success
EDL	00:56:54,527	00:56:55,551	| IOT215 |	Certain product
EDL	00:56:55,551	00:56:56,575	| IOT215 |	After entity so
EDL	00:56:56,575	00:56:58,367	| IOT215 |	I'd say that's going to be a slightly different
EDL	00:56:58,367	00:57:00,159	| IOT215 |	Lens and I think we are there
EDL	00:57:00,671	00:57:03,487	| IOT215 |	Oh good cuz I've been waiting for these use cases
EDL	00:57:03,487	00:57:05,279	| IOT215 |	I have been waiting for years
EDL	00:57:05,791	00:57:07,839	| IOT215 |	Alright keep it thanks so much for coming on the show
EDL	00:57:09,119	00:57:15,263	| IOT215 |	You better thank you for taking the time and I appreciate it that's it for this week thanks so much for list
