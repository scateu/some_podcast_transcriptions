EDL	00:00:33,536	00:00:34,048	| IOT032 |	Kevin ruined
EDL	00:00:34,816	00:00:35,584	| IOT032 |	What kind of charge
EDL	00:00:35,584	00:00:37,376	| IOT032 |	So we're going to talk about SmartThings
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:39,424	| IOT032 |	Because we got more information
EDL	00:00:39,424	00:00:41,216	| IOT032 |	We're going to talk about some news bits
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:42,496	| IOT032 |	Such as a new integration
EDL	00:00:42,496	00:00:44,800	| IOT032 |	Jennifer ring we're going to talk about Google's OS
EDL	00:00:44,800	00:00:45,824	| IOT032 |	Best for the Internet of Things
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:47,104	| IOT032 |	Rillo
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:48,384	| IOT032 |	Everything about hoverboard
EDL	00:00:48,896	00:00:49,408	| IOT032 |	Even though they're not
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:53,248	| IOT032 |	Let's get started with
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:54,016	| IOT032 |	Smart thing
EDL	00:00:54,016	00:00:57,856	| IOT032 |	All right last week we spent a lot of time because I wondered if my smart
EDL	00:00:57,856	00:00:59,648	| IOT032 |	Things home automation hub
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:00,416	| IOT032 |	Most haunted
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:03,232	| IOT032 |	Turns out the Hub was just not really working
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:04,000	| IOT032 |	We
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:05,024	| IOT032 |	Hydrema right
EDL	00:01:05,024	00:01:07,840	| IOT032 |	We were we were right we were wondering what the heck happened
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:10,912	| IOT032 |	We're going to still wonder I finally got my
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:11,936	| IOT032 |	I'm sending it back to
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:12,704	| IOT032 |	Tell SmartThings to
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:13,216	| IOT032 |	Figure out there
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:16,288	| IOT032 |	Or dissected or whatever it is
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:16,800	| IOT032 |	Is autopsy
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:19,104	| IOT032 |	And figure out
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:19,872	| IOT032 |	What happened
EDL	00:01:19,872	00:01:20,640	| IOT032 |	Because
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:22,944	| IOT032 |	We replaced the Hub and now everything works
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:23,968	| IOT032 |	So my experience
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:25,248	| IOT032 |	Should not be your ex
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:31,392	| IOT032 |	See this is good to know because two reasons me personally and I've said this many times that's going to be my backup if we
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:33,696	| IOT032 |	You know Winks away into the background
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:37,280	| IOT032 |	People who are considering SmartThings
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:40,352	| IOT032 |	They probably walked away from last week's podcast making
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:42,144	| IOT032 |	New one of these artists
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:43,680	| IOT032 |	It's not working
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:45,984	| IOT032 |	It's not working for Stacy is not going to work for me but
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:47,264	| IOT032 |	But
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:48,032	| IOT032 |	You should not
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:49,056	| IOT032 |	Worried so
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:50,592	| IOT032 |	Take two on SmartThings
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:54,432	| IOT032 |	Is that you could actually add things very easily
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:55,712	| IOT032 |	So when I
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:56,992	| IOT032 |	Launch my new hub
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:59,040	| IOT032 |	I was able to add all the sensors
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:01,088	| IOT032 |	My camera woes iFix
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,880	| IOT032 |	So instead of adding it
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:03,648	| IOT032 |	As an app
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:04,928	| IOT032 |	On its own
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:07,488	| IOT032 |	A separate camera thing is
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:08,512	| IOT032 |	Instead added it
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,280	| IOT032 |	Spruce SmartThings
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:16,704	| IOT032 |	So instead of adding it as a wireless camera I did have to compromise and added as a wired camera so it comes with
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:20,032	| IOT032 |	Ethernet cable and I did that when I did it that way it worked
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,056	| IOT032 |	And from then on
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,080	| IOT032 |	And I was Off to the Races
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:30,272	| IOT032 |	One of these shoes you had was some of the motion sensors or door open close sensors are not working and one
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:32,064	| IOT032 |	Was stuck in open mode and
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,856	| IOT032 |	Something of the stadium
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:36,928	| IOT032 |	Plug which is a zigbee device it never found the zigbee device
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:39,232	| IOT032 |	Yes that's that always result
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:42,048	| IOT032 |	Yay in what was weird is that
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,584	| IOT032 |	The problems I was having wasn't Lake
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,376	| IOT032 |	One radio wasn't work
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:47,424	| IOT032 |	It was like just a bunch of things
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,728	| IOT032 |	So we don't know
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:52,032	| IOT032 |	We still don't know when SmartThings
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:53,056	| IOT032 |	Autopsies
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:54,080	| IOT032 |	It tells me what happen
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,616	| IOT032 |	And because I've asked if they do that
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,408	| IOT032 |	I will let everyone else
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:57,920	| IOT032 |	What the heck have
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:00,480	| IOT032 |	We should probably point out now are you
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:01,248	| IOT032 |	Did not
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,016	| IOT032 |	By this
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:02,784	| IOT032 |	Correct
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:04,064	| IOT032 |	The one that I
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:05,856	| IOT032 |	Tested was a review unit
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:06,624	| IOT032 |	That they had sent
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:10,976	| IOT032 |	The one that I swapped it out for was one that I actually
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,256	| IOT032 |	Purchased via ammo
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:15,328	| IOT032 |	And you would purchase it before last week's show
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:19,168	| IOT032 |	Which is why we knew you have to and that's why we're saying no LS swap them out and see what happens
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:19,936	| IOT032 |	So that's what you did
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:24,288	| IOT032 |	Gotcha I know I only said that because you know the review units
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:26,848	| IOT032 |	I've gotten review units for a dozen years
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:27,616	| IOT032 |	Thursday
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:32,480	| IOT032 |	Companies and they are often times when review unit doesn't have the latest software or it
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:35,552	| IOT032 |	They produce some quickly off the line to get them out
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:37,344	| IOT032 |	Are the early reviewers and so on
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:41,440	| IOT032 |	This has happened before I guess what I'm saying not trying to give anybody passed but the reality of the
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:42,208	| IOT032 |	Situation is
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:42,720	| IOT032 |	It does have
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:45,280	| IOT032 |	Instead the one you bought does work
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:47,584	| IOT032 |	And I'm guessing how did you go through
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:52,960	| IOT032 |	Typical Samsung support or no
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:59,360	| IOT032 |	The way SmartThings does their support is they have both email support they have forums and then they have like a chatbot
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:03,712	| IOT032 |	At a certain point in time though if it's not working I have seen
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:10,112	| IOT032 |	Them support via like finally they're just like okay this isn't working here let's call let's get to the bottom of it
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:16,512	| IOT032 |	So in a situation like mine I imagine that someone from SmartThings would actually you would end up on
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:19,839	| IOT032 |	On the phone with it because there were enough weird crazy things happening
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,607	| IOT032 |	They would just be like
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,375	| IOT032 |	Okay
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:27,519	| IOT032 |	Yeah I mean support can always be her Miss for any company and I said that if somebody who's managed support desk for the previous life
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:29,823	| IOT032 |	So get your experience could vary but
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:30,591	| IOT032 |	My point being
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:34,431	| IOT032 |	Chances are if somebody else had similar to the same problem
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,479	| IOT032 |	Play Wicked solid support from Samsung
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:39,807	| IOT032 |	Amazon
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,087	| IOT032 |	Samsung Tab e
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:43,903	| IOT032 |	Samsung and I will I will say that
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:44,927	| IOT032 |	Yes I have
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:47,231	| IOT032 |	I've been a SmartThings user for
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:47,999	| IOT032 |	Gears
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:49,535	| IOT032 |	But their forums
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:50,559	| IOT032 |	Are awesome
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:55,167	| IOT032 |	They have a lot of really dedicated users who do a lot of crazy stuff
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,959	| IOT032 |	And so just
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:00,799	| IOT032 |	Kind of trolling around the forums you can actually find a lot of fun things
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,335	| IOT032 |	You can do and ideas
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,103	| IOT032 |	So
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:05,663	| IOT032 |	This is again more for the DIY person
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,199	| IOT032 |	Not the person who's like
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,479	| IOT032 |	I just want to plug it in and have it work
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:14,367	| IOT032 |	Write it sounds like there's a good robust Community there that's willing to share for the DIY people
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:16,671	| IOT032 |	But even out of the box if you just want to use the product
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:19,231	| IOT032 |	Now that it's working the setup process
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:21,791	| IOT032 |	It's good you know you think it's a solid
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,583	| IOT032 |	Entry to
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:29,727	| IOT032 |	Start homes for people don't have anything right now yes so if you were taking this out of the box you've never if you were going
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,263	| IOT032 |	To the smart
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,287	| IOT032 |	Some space in your leg
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,823	| IOT032 |	Holy cow what do I buy
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,591	| IOT032 |	This looks pretty good
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,639	| IOT032 |	I would recommend
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,407	| IOT032 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,431	| IOT032 |	And I would do it
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,223	| IOT032 |	Unhesitatingly for
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:43,807	| IOT032 |	Like probably 90% of the population
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:44,831	| IOT032 |	I would say
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:46,111	| IOT032 |	For people who are not
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:49,439	| IOT032 |	There are people who are not going to be comfortable kind of
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:53,791	| IOT032 |	Playing with software setting rules even things like Winker probably too complicated for them
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,327	| IOT032 |	Those people
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,863	| IOT032 |	Should probably just get a nest and
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,399	| IOT032 |	You know just
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:01,215	| IOT032 |	Toggle things on and off or maybe they should just not really
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:01,727	| IOT032 |	Worry about the smart
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:04,543	| IOT032 |	Gotcha maybe they should call their ISP it have
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:05,567	| IOT032 |	Set up every
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:09,407	| IOT032 |	Just just reach out to Stacy
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:09,919	| IOT032 |	Papa
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,271	| IOT032 |	You mentioned when
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:18,111	| IOT032 |	So let me ask you this is somebody who owns and is very happy with wink
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:20,671	| IOT032 |	And this is a personal preference which
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,975	| IOT032 |	Would you go with if you could only choose one
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,743	| IOT032 |	I would go with
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:24,511	| IOT032 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,815	| IOT032 |	Because because SmartThings
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,351	| IOT032 |	This has a more consistent
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,887	| IOT032 |	User experience than week
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:30,655	| IOT032 |	For me
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:37,055	| IOT032 |	There are things like the lights all come on at the right time for me SmartThings works
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,335	| IOT032 |	More consistently
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,871	| IOT032 |	For me then winked has
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:43,199	| IOT032 |	I do lose those some of my favorite device
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:46,783	| IOT032 |	This is so right now Chamberlain MyQ is not supported on smart
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,087	| IOT032 |	Southern Chamberlain has told me
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,367	| IOT032 |	That they will
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:50,879	| IOT032 |	Eventually stop
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:53,183	| IOT032 |	Okay so no garage door opener
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:54,207	| IOT032 |	So my garage door open
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,279	| IOT032 |	Now you got to have fun
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:00,095	| IOT032 |	Chase now I just have to hit something else in my app
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:00,607	| IOT032 |	So there
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,399	| IOT032 |	And there is
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:07,007	| IOT032 |	SmartThings does have an Arduino Shield so there's a possibility of me doing a work around there
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:08,287	| IOT032 |	But that is not
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,335	| IOT032 |	No it's not your everyday person
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:14,943	| IOT032 |	Only people who do podcasts and speak Elvish
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,247	| IOT032 |	We're back to you
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,551	| IOT032 |	It also doesn't have in this is actually big
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:20,831	| IOT032 |	It also does
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:21,343	| IOT032 |	Support Lux
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:23,391	| IOT032 |	Your favorite
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:24,415	| IOT032 |	It's are my favorite
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,183	| IOT032 |	So
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:31,583	| IOT032 |	I have begged Lutron to make a dongle that supports their protocol that I can plug into the SmartThings
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,119	| IOT032 |	Dongle
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,447	| IOT032 |	Elvis dongles and
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:43,359	| IOT032 |	Iot Bingo that I'm going to make that and we can print it up
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:44,383	| IOT032 |	For Christmas
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,151	| IOT032 |	Best for everyone who listen
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,967	| IOT032 |	That will be my Christmas gift to Olive
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,735	| IOT032 |	Holiday gift
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:50,271	| IOT032 |	So
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,551	| IOT032 |	With the Lutron
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:54,367	| IOT032 |	You don't with the SmartThings you there are ports on the back
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,391	| IOT032 |	Plug China
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,927	| IOT032 |	Things into and make it
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,951	| IOT032 |	You know ad on radio
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:00,255	| IOT032 |	So they haven't done that yet but
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,535	| IOT032 |	But it's their potential
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,559	| IOT032 |	Lutron would be like
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,351	| IOT032 |	Then I would just
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,215	| IOT032 |	How to make me so happy so
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:11,007	| IOT032 |	Those are the two things I miss most
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:13,567	| IOT032 |	That's why right now the wink Hub is still
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:15,103	| IOT032 |	Kind of actually right now it's unplugged
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:18,943	| IOT032 |	I unplugged it as part of the setup process in troubleshooting but
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:22,271	| IOT032 |	If it isn't plugged back in it stopped working
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,295	| IOT032 |	For some reason
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,575	| IOT032 |	Everything just got to stop
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,599	| IOT032 |	United 7
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,367	| IOT032 |	Bothered excited cuz
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,159	| IOT032 |	Catch-22
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:31,487	| IOT032 |	I don't know that we've ever talked about this before but I'm curious again
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:33,023	| IOT032 |	Personally I think for the audio
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:35,839	| IOT032 |	Amazon Echo integration
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:39,679	| IOT032 |	How robust is that and how well is that working
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,191	| IOT032 |	It works
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,471	| IOT032 |	It
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,239	| IOT032 |	Turns on
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,007	| IOT032 |	Buy lights
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:46,079	| IOT032 |	It does not there at there are definitely things that does not
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:46,847	| IOT032 |	Work with
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:49,151	| IOT032 |	So it doesn't work with the locks
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:49,663	| IOT032 |	It doesn't work
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,455	| IOT032 |	Blinds
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:54,527	| IOT032 |	If I wanted to get the special Stacy support
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:57,343	| IOT032 |	I think there is a way for it to work with my blinds
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,367	| IOT032 |	And I can work on that
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,415	| IOT032 |	And tell people about that
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,439	| IOT032 |	But I haven't yet
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:04,511	| IOT032 |	Cuz I spent two hours on special Stacy support
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,535	| IOT032 |	Aetna
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,583	| IOT032 |	I felt that that was plenty sure
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:10,655	| IOT032 |	I wonder if there is a way to do that with if this then that which is your favorite toy
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:13,471	| IOT032 |	SmartThings is supported through if the subnet
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:15,007	| IOT032 |	Amazon Alexa
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:18,335	| IOT032 |	Still has limited Triggers on FSM that so
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,615	| IOT032 |	Come on Amazon
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:20,895	| IOT032 |	We would still have
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:26,783	| IOT032 |	Add blinds to shopping list
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:33,695	| IOT032 |	So that's how SmartThings is doing as I create new recipes and things will definitely come back to this
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:34,463	| IOT032 |	I'm sure
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:37,279	| IOT032 |	And I think for a while I'm going to stick with this hub
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,047	| IOT032 |	Although
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:38,815	| IOT032 |	I'm going to
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:45,215	| IOT032 |	Just going to throw this out there the next see if people have finally worn me down and I think I might try a Nexia hub
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:45,983	| IOT032 |	Because
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,287	| IOT032 |	Because I feel kind of bad about not trying one out
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,567	| IOT032 |	I'm getting a lot of questions about
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:56,479	| IOT032 |	No no I mean the more the merrier I mean not all at one time obviously you don't want to have all these things going on in the in the same house because
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:10:02,623	| IOT032 |	I could actually cause problems that people would not have so I say go for it
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:03,903	| IOT032 |	So
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:05,695	| IOT032 |	That's the SmartThings experience
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:08,255	| IOT032 |	So I recommended if you guys are into it
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:12,863	| IOT032 |	I'd like the apps I think the software is much better I used to recommend people didn't SmartThings
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:15,423	| IOT032 |	Really feeling good about tinkering
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:19,775	| IOT032 |	Now I feel that the software has a lot of use so bring it every bring it
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,567	| IOT032 |	$99 for the version
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:24,639	| IOT032 |	Hub 249 for monitoring
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,431	| IOT032 |	Kit and also by
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,223	| IOT032 |	I can't
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,783	| IOT032 |	Not going home care
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,063	| IOT032 |	RockAuto
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:34,111	| IOT032 |	So if you want to come get this is not your answer
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:35,647	| IOT032 |	And it doesn't work with Nest beak
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,927	| IOT032 |	Because they also are not
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:39,231	| IOT032 |	Super appreciative of the nest
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:40,511	| IOT032 |	Terms
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,815	| IOT032 |	Frederick how the data is used in what they share
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,863	| IOT032 |	All of that again with the
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,911	| IOT032 |	So speaking of
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:49,471	| IOT032 |	Fitness no longer belong
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:50,495	| IOT032 |	Google
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,287	| IOT032 |	Now
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:57,407	| IOT032 |	But we'll talk about Google and Google has released its operating system
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,943	| IOT032 |	Some for the internet of things called
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,711	| IOT032 |	Brillo
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:06,111	| IOT032 |	We talked about it before and we scratch their heads because it was more of a concept and everything else
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:10,463	| IOT032 |	For those who missed it Google announced their iot platform
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:12,255	| IOT032 |	Comprised of brillo and
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,023	| IOT032 |	Weave
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:15,583	| IOT032 |	Yeah they did that at the Google IO event
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:19,423	| IOT032 |	In June or July always forget which month it was but
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,471	| IOT032 |	Oh my God I met this year you're right right
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:22,495	| IOT032 |	Taryn Toomey
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:25,567	| IOT032 |	And we hadn't heard really much of anything since then
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,847	| IOT032 |	Other than that saying
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:30,687	| IOT032 |	Our Nest we will be available to people in 2016
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:32,735	| IOT032 |	And it's different than Google's weave
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,527	| IOT032 |	So that's a whole nother mish-mosh
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:38,623	| IOT032 |	But regardless the good news is right after the last show of course
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:41,695	| IOT032 |	Google release the SDK for Brillo
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:45,535	| IOT032 |	If you go to developers. Google.com Merlot you can get the
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:47,071	| IOT032 |	Limited information they've shared
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:47,839	| IOT032 |	Publicly
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:50,655	| IOT032 |	But you can then also request an invite
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:53,983	| IOT032 |	To the Brillo SDK search array
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:59,359	| IOT032 |	If ice maker or are you just morbidly curious like we are you can request an invite for that
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:04,735	| IOT032 |	Other than that there is a introduction to broil a video that's all a matter of 3 4 minutes long
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:11,135	| IOT032 |	Didn't really tell me anything that Google didn't already say back in May so if you miss the announcement way
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:14,975	| IOT032 |	Way back when you could actually watch this and maybe get a glimpse at what Google is going to do
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:18,815	| IOT032 |	There's a little bit more info
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:21,375	| IOT032 |	Formation so they're going to be updating it every
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,679	| IOT032 |	Etsy well actually I should
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:24,959	| IOT032 |	Hello
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,983	| IOT032 |	Works with
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:26,751	| IOT032 |	Google
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:32,383	| IOT032 |	Sweet yes now I asked Google about if it was going to work with Nest we
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:35,967	| IOT032 |	And here's where things get a little acronym
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:39,039	| IOT032 |	I'm going to tell you exactly what Google told me
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:42,367	| IOT032 |	I'm going to bed it's either a subset or a superset
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,159	| IOT032 |	Your guess is as
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:45,695	| IOT032 |	So here it is
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,463	| IOT032 |	Quote
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:49,535	| IOT032 |	We're working closely with Nest ensure that nest
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:55,935	| IOT032 |	Stand workshop with Nest devices are interoperable with Brillo devices and we will have the same grade out of boxes
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:58,239	| IOT032 |	Experience and set up built into Android phone
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:12:59,519	| IOT032 |	Unquote
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,823	| IOT032 |	So it sounds like it doesn't work with
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,103	| IOT032 |	Ness
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,127	| IOT032 |	We've yet
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:05,919	| IOT032 |	Correct that's how I read that as well
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:06,687	| IOT032 |	So
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:09,247	| IOT032 |	That's that's it that's what we do
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:13,343	| IOT032 |	That's all we know that's all we know
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,927	| IOT032 |	Brillo will be
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,719	| IOT032 |	And this might be not news but I'll
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:21,023	| IOT032 |	Mention only cuz it is on their developer site
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,047	| IOT032 |	Brillo is
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:27,679	| IOT032 |	Chelsea Hardware diagnostic as a platform because it will be square on arm chips Intel x86 chips
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:29,471	| IOT032 |	MX based Hardware
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:31,775	| IOT032 |	Also you're not limited to just one
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:35,871	| IOT032 |	Chip architecture if you're making devices and they're going to release updates every
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:37,151	| IOT032 |	6 week and
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:38,431	| IOT032 |	Bigger releases every
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:40,223	| IOT032 |	Smuts which I actually thought
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:46,367	| IOT032 |	So that that's kind of interesting to me because I also a cover Google Chrome and Android platforms
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,135	| IOT032 |	And
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:50,975	| IOT032 |	Google is committed to monthly security updates for Android
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:56,607	| IOT032 |	And every six weeks it updates Google Play services for Android as well as
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:14:00,191	| IOT032 |	The Chrome OS gets a full stable release update every 6 weeks
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:03,519	| IOT032 |	It's just odd to me or interesting that they're using the same timeframe
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,311	| IOT032 |	So
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,079	| IOT032 |	Maybe this
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:09,919	| IOT032 |	Ties into that but see will use your Chrome knowledge here
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:14,527	| IOT032 |	Is Google's Brillo developer kit is based on Ubuntu 14.
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:16,575	| IOT032 |	4 + Android developer
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,111	| IOT032 |	Including Android Studio
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:18,879	| IOT032 |	No
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,391	| IOT032 |	Including
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:20,927	| IOT032 |	Bebe
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:24,767	| IOT032 |	Android debugging Bridge
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:27,839	| IOT032 |	I may have gotten that wrong but basically
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:31,423	| IOT032 |	8 Ibiza is a command line tool set that you use
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:33,471	| IOT032 |	Imma that I've used in the past to
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:38,591	| IOT032 |	Control and modify Android phones from a PC or a Mac
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,383	| IOT032 |	So it's a way that like
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:43,967	| IOT032 |	Little custom ROMs on my Android phone I wipe out Google's Android I put on
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:47,039	| IOT032 |	Something else Cyanogen or what have you
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:47,807	| IOT032 |	I don't want to
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:50,367	| IOT032 |	You throw a bunch of names out there cuz it doesn't matter what it is
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:54,975	| IOT032 |	Use ADB to unlock the device use ADB to push the new
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,511	| IOT032 |	Image to the phone and Flash
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:58,047	| IOT032 |	The phone and so on so
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:00,351	| IOT032 |	It's a toolset that developers using
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:03,167	| IOT032 |	Easiest used to modify their Android devices
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:07,519	| IOT032 |	Okay so it sounds like that I could use this to develop on my iot devices
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:12,127	| IOT032 |	I would say probably because ADB is actually a
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:14,175	| IOT032 |	Small part of the Android SDK
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:17,503	| IOT032 |	Okay so and we knew that Berlin was a stripped down version
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,271	| IOT032 |	Have Android anyway
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:21,599	| IOT032 |	Yes so it sounds like they're staying true to that
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:24,159	| IOT032 |	So this is going to work on devices
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:26,207	| IOT032 |	This little is 32 megabits
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:26,975	| IOT032 |	Megabit
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,743	| IOT032 |	Bytes megabytes
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:30,303	| IOT032 |	Bytes of RAM
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,327	| IOT032 |	+ 100
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:31,839	| IOT032 |	28th May
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,119	| IOT032 |	Historic
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,399	| IOT032 |	Which actually is kind of big
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:34,911	| IOT032 |	Yes it is
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,703	| IOT032 |	So this is not a sensor thing
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,007	| IOT032 |	Cognizant
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:41,567	| IOT032 |	Liam probably the
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:43,359	| IOT032 |	Google onhub router
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,127	| IOT032 |	Which we know is
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,175	| IOT032 |	Going to have pillows
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:48,223	| IOT032 |	Support built in order
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,271	| IOT032 |	LOL. My bad
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,111	| IOT032 |	Google
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,695	| IOT032 |	Is it nestweaver Google
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,255	| IOT032 |	But we do know
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,023	| IOT032 |	Ashley
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:04,095	| IOT032 |	Okay so that's what we know about Brillo
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,375	| IOT032 |	If you guys are confused
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:07,679	| IOT032 |	Well well
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,959	| IOT032 |	So is the rest of the world
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:09,727	| IOT032 |	That is what we know
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,543	| IOT032 |	Unless confusing
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:16,383	| IOT032 |	The only because it just caught my eye
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:20,735	| IOT032 |	We mention Android a lot here we just mentioned crom and we'll talk about boiling weave
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:26,879	| IOT032 |	On the developer site for Billy says extend the reach of your IOS and Android apps to the physical world with weave
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:33,535	| IOT032 |	So I just want to mention you know they're not in typical Google fashion they're not sticking solely with Android for this it's
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:35,327	| IOT032 |	Bear cross platform
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,351	| IOT032 |	On the mobile site
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,375	| IOT032 |	Right still don't
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,399	| IOT032 |	Have anything we View
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,983	| IOT032 |	We've waited this long for Brillo
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:43,007	| IOT032 |	Which we know
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:45,311	| IOT032 |	How's I know that imagination
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:46,335	| IOT032 |	With their developing
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,359	| IOT032 |	Board that we talked about a couple
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:49,663	| IOT032 |	Citgo they are supporting Brillo
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,199	| IOT032 |	Whatever that is
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,271	| IOT032 |	ASL words
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:55,807	| IOT032 |	Lots of languages
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,343	| IOT032 |	But
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:17:01,183	| IOT032 |	List of all hey look you know Google really has not shared a lot of
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:03,487	| IOT032 |	Details here out to Developers
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,255	| IOT032 |	Person trying under
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:05,023	| IOT032 |	Standing
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:11,167	| IOT032 |	Eventually someone will build a product that uses this but I think what's happening is people are looking at the center like
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,959	| IOT032 |	What are we going to do with this OS
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:18,847	| IOT032 |	Splatoon until we know a little bit more about weave which is actually going to do the talking to two devices
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:20,639	| IOT032 |	We kind of don't know what we want
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,943	| IOT032 |	Well and that's fine
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,479	| IOT032 |	You and I sat through the big
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:28,063	| IOT032 |	Come by akeno last year at CVS with Samsung talking about
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:30,367	| IOT032 |	How the internet of things will
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,647	| IOT032 |	Tie the whole world together
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:35,231	| IOT032 |	My guess is that this January at CES you may see
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,767	| IOT032 |	Google's partners
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,559	| IOT032 |	Maybe Samsung but probably others
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:41,119	| IOT032 |	Have a little something to show for all this
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,399	| IOT032 |	We can't start docker
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,959	| IOT032 |	Nope
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:46,239	| IOT032 |	It's less than 8 weeks away
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,287	| IOT032 |	All right moving right along
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,823	| IOT032 |	Just blowing right through that
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:51,103	| IOT032 |	Going to talk about
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:53,919	| IOT032 |	Little bit of news for those of you guys who like doorbells
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:58,527	| IOT032 |	Jalisco August said that they were going to start selling a doorbell door lock
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:01,343	| IOT032 |	The doorbell part of that won't be out till the middle
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,367	| IOT032 |	December but
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,135	| IOT032 |	Can buy it now
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:05,439	| IOT032 |	And today or rather
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,463	| IOT032 |	Yesterday
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,231	| IOT032 |	Ring
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,791	| IOT032 |	They company that Richard Branson invested in
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:12,863	| IOT032 |	Has announced that it will do an integration with
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:13,375	| IOT032 |	The Kevo
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:14,655	| IOT032 |	Door lock
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,167	| IOT032 |	Which is
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,447	| IOT032 |	Matador LACMA
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,727	| IOT032 |	Kwikset
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:20,031	| IOT032 |	Bluetooth suddenly photos of Bluetooth door lock
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,823	| IOT032 |	Are pretty the deadbolt
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:27,199	| IOT032 |	And so basically what happens is you can have similar function at when someone is your ring doorbell
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:28,479	| IOT032 |	You can give them commands to open
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:30,527	| IOT032 |	If you have a key
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,063	| IOT032 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:34,879	| IOT032 |	Find nice it sounds like a
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:37,183	| IOT032 |	There seems to be this coalescing vision
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:39,743	| IOT032 |	Is it no longer can you just have a connected doorbell
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:41,279	| IOT032 |	We're connected door lock now they mad
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,095	| IOT032 |	Integrations are good
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,887	| IOT032 |	Yeah it's it's another way though
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:46,911	| IOT032 |	I will say
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:49,983	| IOT032 |	Cuz these door locks are like between 200 200
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:50,751	| IOT032 |	50 buttons
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:53,311	| IOT032 |	If these doorbells are about two hundred bucks
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:57,151	| IOT032 |	So suddenly you are now investing about 404
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,175	| IOT032 |	$50 on your
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:01,247	| IOT032 |	So probably more than the cost of your front door
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:03,295	| IOT032 |	What kind of front door do you have
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:05,343	| IOT032 |	A piece of plywood with a Holguin
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:09,951	| IOT032 |	We live in the sticks with a lock anything up it's just left opens pretty much a mesh screen
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,999	| IOT032 |	Just kidding
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:15,071	| IOT032 |	You're like we have one of those but I don't know what it came with the house
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:17,375	| IOT032 |	Gonna be a heck of a lot
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:18,655	| IOT032 |	Got it
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,423	| IOT032 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,191	| IOT032 |	So
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,471	| IOT032 |	That's out there
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:22,751	| IOT032 |	I'm a big fan of
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,031	| IOT032 |	Connected doorbell
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:24,799	| IOT032 |	Genre
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:27,103	| IOT032 |	So that is definitely on my Christmas list
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:33,247	| IOT032 |	Speaking of which Kevin and I are going to get together and come up with a connected device Christmas list so stay tuned for that
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:35,039	| IOT032 |	Because Kevin doesn't know
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:37,343	| IOT032 |	We're going to start that very soon
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:38,879	| IOT032 |	Surprise surprise
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:42,719	| IOT032 |	This is why I should have cute cards or teleprompter I had no idea you were going to make us do that
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:43,487	| IOT032 |	Boom

EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:27,007	| IOT032 |	A self-balancing
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:27,519	| IOT032 |	Scooter
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:32,127	| IOT032 |	You could call it a personal transporter you could call it a hoverboard but clearly
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:33,407	| IOT032 |	We're not hovering with this
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:36,479	| IOT032 |	So what I did was I bought one of these things that
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:37,759	| IOT032 |	Britton Segways
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:38,527	| IOT032 |	Before I love Segways
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:41,599	| IOT032 |	But there now 56 Grand whatever they are
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,623	| IOT032 |	I'm not going to go get a Segway
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:46,463	| IOT032 |	There there little bit cocky little bit clunky so
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,743	| IOT032 |	What I bought is
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:50,047	| IOT032 |	Similar concept but it
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:52,351	| IOT032 |	Looks more like a skateboard
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:52,863	| IOT032 |	Innocence
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,655	| IOT032 |	But you don't ride it
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:56,959	| IOT032 |	Like a skateboard but it goes
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:00,287	| IOT032 |	Just wright
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:04,127	| IOT032 |	So you're sitting you stand on a hoverboard
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:07,199	| IOT032 |	And what it has it has small 6in
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:07,967	| IOT032 |	Wheels
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:08,735	| IOT032 |	And it has
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:11,807	| IOT032 |	Two independent Motors and a battery inside source Electric Power
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:14,879	| IOT032 |	Recharge it up takes about 1 to 2 hours to charge
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:20,256	| IOT032 |	And then you put your feet on this thing in there foot pedals to where you place your feet when you press
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:22,816	| IOT032 |	Your put your foot down on these pressure points
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:25,376	| IOT032 |	It knows your on it and it is ready to ride
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:27,680	| IOT032 |	It also has a gyroscope inside
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:34,080	| IOT032 |	So that way once you get over the first five minutes of initial trusting I guess.
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:36,128	| IOT032 |	I was trusting your balance on this thing
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:37,408	| IOT032 |	Itself balances
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:40,224	| IOT032 |	So it's on two wheels you're standing on it and it's self-balancing
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:41,760	| IOT032 |	The interesting thing is
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:44,576	| IOT032 |	The two wheels are obviously connected by an axle but
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:48,928	| IOT032 |	Your left foot in your right foot each have an independent motor and operate independently
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:55,584	| IOT032 |	If you want to go forward either lean forward or push your the front of your feet down a little bit more than the back your feet and you go follow
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:58,400	| IOT032 |	Same backwards you lean backwards
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:00,448	| IOT032 |	And it recognizes that you want to go backwards
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:03,008	| IOT032 |	The interesting thing with the independent axles is
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:07,616	| IOT032 |	What you put one foot so your left foot forward and your right foot back you literally spin
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,128	| IOT032 |	In place
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:13,760	| IOT032 |	Very easy to ride
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:18,368	| IOT032 |	And 11 electric movie at solar panel so I'm all for Anything Electric
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:19,136	| IOT032 |	How long can you ride on
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:20,672	| IOT032 |	With that one charge
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,464	| IOT032 |	A single charge I have
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:25,792	| IOT032 |	Maxed it out yet but what it says is depending on how you ride it
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:28,352	| IOT032 |	Terrain the speed that you ride and so on
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:30,144	| IOT032 |	Is anywhere from 9 to 12 miles
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:33,472	| IOT032 |	Sounds like that's actually about as much as a Segway Cortana
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:34,752	| IOT032 |	Speed-wise
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:41,152	| IOT032 |	You can stand in place not go anywhere you can crawl along really slow or if you go full speed which I just kidding
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:42,432	| IOT032 |	Comfortable enough to do
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:43,712	| IOT032 |	You going to bounce
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:45,760	| IOT032 |	1011 miles an hour so basically
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:47,040	| IOT032 |	6 minutes
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:47,808	| IOT032 |	Pace
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:48,576	| IOT032 |	Per mile
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,600	| IOT032 |	Holy moly
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:53,440	| IOT032 |	Oh you can haul you can haul and it's silent because it's electric so actually
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:53,952	| IOT032 |	This is really
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:55,488	| IOT032 |	What they did is
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:59,072	| IOT032 |	It's got two little blue LED headlights so that way when you are
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,352	| IOT032 |	Moving
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:05,216	| IOT032 |	And activating one or both of the motors the light for that motor I should light up so people can see
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:06,752	| IOT032 |	And also if you go
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:09,056	| IOT032 |	I don't know what the threshold is Victor going
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:09,824	| IOT032 |	At 8
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:12,896	| IOT032 |	Close top speed it starts beeping so the people around you
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:14,432	| IOT032 |	Can hear you and get out of your way
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:15,968	| IOT032 |	Along pretty quickly
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:16,992	| IOT032 |	So what
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:18,784	| IOT032 |	It is really really fun
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:19,808	| IOT032 |	Is really fun
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:20,320	| IOT032 |	So how much
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:23,392	| IOT032 |	Well that's great I'm glad you asked that
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:23,904	| IOT032 |	Happy car
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,696	| IOT032 |	What I found out
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:28,512	| IOT032 |	In doing a lot and I did a lot of research for this
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:29,280	| IOT032 |	Thereabouts
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:31,328	| IOT032 |	Three maybe four companies that make these
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:35,168	| IOT032 |	And they're all in China they are all the same
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,448	| IOT032 |	Products
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:41,056	| IOT032 |	I bought a no-name brand and I paid 343 I purchased two additional ones for the kids
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:42,592	| IOT032 |	For Christmas don't tell them anybody
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:44,128	| IOT032 |	And they were 299
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:47,456	| IOT032 |	If you buy a brand name one which is takes the exact same thing
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:54,368	| IOT032 |	And slapped a logo on it such as iowahawk Levi board funky duck or any one of a number of other
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:54,880	| IOT032 |	Brand names
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:56,672	| IOT032 |	You will end up paying
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:24:00,512	| IOT032 |	I've seen him for 599 I've seen them for 1,000 I seen them
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:05,376	| IOT032 |	1499 and I've seen them for $1,799
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:07,424	| IOT032 |	Don't do that
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:10,752	| IOT032 |	Don't buy one of those for that much it's not worth it first of all
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,800	| IOT032 |	And second of all you get the exact same thing
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:14,080	| IOT032 |	Probably run 300
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,896	| IOT032 |	In fact if you shop around on Alibaba which is
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:17,920	| IOT032 |	China's
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:22,272	| IOT032 |	Take online Commerce Place you can get it directly from the manufacturer even under
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,320	| IOT032 |	Note 8 to 2:50
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:26,880	| IOT032 |	Yeah and if you buy in bulk
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:29,440	| IOT032 |	OtterBox
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:33,024	| IOT032 |	But I'm not going to get into the personal transporter real hoverboard business myself
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:35,840	| IOT032 |	Corporate gift-giving season is upon us
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:36,864	| IOT032 |	There you go
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:39,424	| IOT032 |	Now I will say this as fun as they are to ride
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:41,216	| IOT032 |	The outer shell is
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:41,984	| IOT032 |	Is completely plastic
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:45,824	| IOT032 |	And that's fine keeps the weight down it's certainly sturdy enough
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:47,360	| IOT032 |	However when you
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:48,896	| IOT032 |	Are learning to write it
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:51,968	| IOT032 |	Kind of jump off at like a jump off a skateboard
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:52,736	| IOT032 |	And what happens is
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:54,272	| IOT032 |	Nothing rolls over on itself
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:55,040	| IOT032 |	And since you're
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:57,600	| IOT032 |	Probably getting a sidewalk or road or driveway
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:58,624	| IOT032 |	It gets counted up
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:02,208	| IOT032 |	Really quickly so you want to be careful when you're learning to ride
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:03,744	| IOT032 |	Metal shatter
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:06,304	| IOT032 |	Crap to be quite honest but that's okay I can live with it
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,096	| IOT032 |	It's something you want to be
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:10,400	| IOT032 |	You don't consider when you when you do if you buy one
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:11,424	| IOT032 |	Learn how to write a note
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:15,264	| IOT032 |	You can ride on the carpet that we learned actually riding it in the house
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:17,824	| IOT032 |	Yeah we are on that we have bamboo floor so we've been around
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:21,152	| IOT032 |	Various rooms are resource that we went on the carpet no problem
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:26,272	| IOT032 |	Not that great on grasping out all the grasses but you could do it and what is it
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,040	| IOT032 |	Pretty
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,320	| IOT032 |	Strong National
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:30,368	| IOT032 |	How much does a
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:33,440	| IOT032 |	That's a great question is it is heavy
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,464	| IOT032 |	So if you
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:40,096	| IOT032 |	I do not like right in the city or on a college campus or at work and then you find a place we can't ride it yet to pick it up
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:41,632	| IOT032 |	And it's about 22 and a half pounds
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:48,288	| IOT032 |	It's not big but it's dance because it's got some Hefty batteries in there you got the two electric motors in
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:51,360	| IOT032 |	That's why these posture to keep the weight down
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:56,480	| IOT032 |	So it's heavy it's not something you're into putting a backpack and tote around when you're not riding at you're going to ride it
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:57,760	| IOT032 |	And then you can eat off it
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:00,320	| IOT032 |	I'm not going to want to carry
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:02,112	| IOT032 |	Got it okay
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,136	| IOT032 |	So I think
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,160	| IOT032 |	That is some awesomeness
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,696	| IOT032 |	Disgust
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:06,976	| IOT032 |	Some great dad
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:07,744	| IOT032 |	It's actually
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:10,048	| IOT032 |	Yes I'm confusing operating systems
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:12,352	| IOT032 |	And if you stay tuned we will have
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,888	| IOT032 |	Actually some more great gadgets
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:14,912	| IOT032 |	Sansom Commerce

EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:27,424	| IOT032 |	How you're doing this because
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:29,984	| IOT032 |	How do you guys make money right now
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:30,752	| IOT032 |	I'm spending

EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:42,016	| IOT032 |	Totally worth $50 for the convenient but
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:43,808	| IOT032 |	For a lot of people they might be like who
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:47,136	| IOT032 |	Armani to keep track of my grocery list
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:48,416	| IOT032 |	So let's talk about
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:53,024	| IOT032 |	Why you went into this and then how to think about kind of building a business model
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:55,072	| IOT032 |	Cuz I think there's a lot of options
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:56,608	| IOT032 |	Explore them
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:30:00,704	| IOT032 |	Couple different questions than their the first one is
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:01,728	| IOT032 |	Why do the spa
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:03,776	| IOT032 |	Why does it why does this device
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:07,616	| IOT032 |	This is a first world problem
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,128	| IOT032 |	So why create
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:10,688	| IOT032 |	It is a first world problem
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,712	| IOT032 |	There's no doubt about
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,480	| IOT032 |	Like we recognize
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:16,064	| IOT032 |	But fundamentally we got tired of running out of stuff
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:19,136	| IOT032 |	Ain't we got busy family
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,416	| IOT032 |	Demanding job
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:21,952	| IOT032 |	3 kids
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:24,256	| IOT032 |	So yeah we tried mobile app
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:26,048	| IOT032 |	They're a good step in the right direction
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:27,584	| IOT032 |	Can you get your list with you when you walk
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:28,864	| IOT032 |	The store you can share with others
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,912	| IOT032 |	But In the Heat of the Moment
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:32,704	| IOT032 |	I do not like in that scenario like a
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:35,264	| IOT032 |	Describes about getting breakfast ready for the family
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:37,056	| IOT032 |	In the Heat of the Moment you fall back
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:39,360	| IOT032 |	Because it's fast
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:40,640	| IOT032 |	Easy Uke
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:41,664	| IOT032 |	Shut down
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:44,736	| IOT032 |	Mobile apps are not necessarily the right tool for the job
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:46,272	| IOT032 |	I'm inside the house
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:47,296	| IOT032 |	So we wanted to create a

EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:08,160	| IOT032 |	But they're also the impact on
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:11,232	| IOT032 |	To think about the future
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:14,304	| IOT032 |	Retail will irritable move inside the hall
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:16,864	| IOT032 |	Angelini net doors are setting
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,936	| IOT032 |	Skittles commercial
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:22,496	| IOT032 |	Experience of
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:24,032	| IOT032 |	Being able to buy things
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:25,568	| IOT032 |	Will be more kinky
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:26,080	| IOT032 |	Great Adventure
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:28,128	| IOT032 |	19 places where cops
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:30,944	| IOT032 |	That's a little that could feel yucky
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:32,736	| IOT032 |	Am I single
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:34,784	| IOT032 |	Because that's really important
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:39,904	| IOT032 |	Yeah cuz advertising I think there's new advertising models that people aren't really talking about
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,184	| IOT032 |	Instead I think
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:43,744	| IOT032 |	Are really interesting or could be interesting
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:50,144	| IOT032 |	Around like apis for I think it was like kind of the old Campbell's cookbooks on steroids
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:53,984	| IOT032 |	And I don't know if you have those cookbooks for the 1970s but
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:56,288	| IOT032 |	OKC
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:59,104	| IOT032 |	So my mom had that
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:03,712	| IOT032 |	Scrum was a working mom and she used them because
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:04,224	| IOT032 |	The working mom
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:09,344	| IOT032 |	And so I grew up on a variety of Frozen vegetable meat in Campbell Soup
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:10,112	| IOT032 |	Casseroles
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:13,184	| IOT032 |	And that was a form of advertising and I think about
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:15,232	| IOT032 |	You know today with an API
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:17,536	| IOT032 |	You really have an understanding you are like
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,048	| IOT032 |	Proctoring
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:19,840	| IOT032 |	Campbell Soup of
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:21,632	| IOT032 |	What people are consuming
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:22,656	| IOT032 |	Based on you know
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:25,728	| IOT032 |	But I'm logging in activity tracker my food tracking
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:28,032	| IOT032 |	And you can start delivering to me some you know
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:30,080	| IOT032 |	Crazy recipes I customize rest
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:32,128	| IOT032 |	And then you could you know
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:33,152	| IOT032 |	Maybe help.
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:37,248	| IOT032 |	Compile my what are those called meal plans for the week that could be helpful
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:40,320	| IOT032 |	That could be depending on how it's done and you know if your
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:42,368	| IOT032 |	Automatically filling my shopping bag
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:43,136	| IOT032 |	You know that
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:49,024	| IOT032 |	I is a working mom might really actually welcomed this if I could set parameters around that ghetto
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:50,816	| IOT032 |	Sodium intake and things like that
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:51,840	| IOT032 |	But I don't think
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:56,704	| IOT032 |	I don't know if Custer like companies are really there yet I don't know
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:58,240	| IOT032 |	Such a good point about
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:36:59,520	| IOT032 |	You know that balance
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:04,384	| IOT032 |	Examples
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:05,408	| IOT032 |	Where
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:06,944	| IOT032 |	Things have been helpful
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,736	| IOT032 |	Based on
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:10,528	| IOT032 |	Other companies knowledge of what
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:11,552	| IOT032 |	You like don't like
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:13,088	| IOT032 |	Watch.
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:14,880	| IOT032 |	Bright Netflix
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:16,672	| IOT032 |	First come to my mind
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,696	| IOT032 |	I like Netflix
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:21,536	| IOT032 |	Most people do
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:24,864	| IOT032 |	Radio is another good example that I think like
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:25,888	| IOT032 |	Pandora and Spotify
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:27,424	| IOT032 |	I'm going to make you mad
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,448	| IOT032 |	Predictions for
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:29,472	| IOT032 |	What you might want to listen to
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:32,800	| IOT032 |	All recipes that far from that type of
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:34,592	| IOT032 |	Negations and
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:40,224	| IOT032 |	I think what would be important that recipes would be being able to
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:42,016	| IOT032 |	Control some of the parade
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:43,296	| IOT032 |	Campers at Lake
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:45,600	| IOT032 |	I think a company wants to
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:49,696	| IOT032 |	Send me an and I think food companies are getting a lot smarter about changing their off
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:54,048	| IOT032 |	I certainly don't want a bunch of recipes that offer me
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:55,584	| IOT032 |	Really poor option
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:56,352	| IOT032 |	Cuz I'm not going to
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:59,936	| IOT032 |	That's right that's right you also don't want
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:01,472	| IOT032 |	Feel like a like a commercial in
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:04,800	| IOT032 |	No one likes
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:05,312	| IOT032 |	To feel like the
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:12,480	| IOT032 |	But people do want
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:16,576	| IOT032 |	And that's certainly the way we approach our product
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:17,856	| IOT032 |	Is
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:20,160	| IOT032 |	Yes focus on delivering value today
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:21,440	| IOT032 |	I'd help
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:23,744	| IOT032 |	If you do that
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:25,024	| IOT032 |	The belated Builder
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:26,304	| IOT032 |	I guarantee it
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:27,840	| IOT032 |	If you do that
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:30,656	| IOT032 |	True you guys are really doing this so
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:31,424	| IOT032 |	I guess
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:37,824	| IOT032 |	From me I do want to make sure how are you building your product to make sure somebody is equally good scanning and voice
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:39,616	| IOT032 |	Enginetech she doesn't have built
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:40,384	| IOT032 |	Mico
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:43,456	| IOT032 |	Which does exactly the same thing
