EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:36,256	| IOT118 |	Let's get into our shows
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:40,864	| IOT118 |	Speaking of show next week we're going to have the Amazon Echo Show
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:43,936	| IOT118 |	But in the meantime we should actually talk because some of the reviews are out
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:44,704	| IOT118 |	And
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:46,496	| IOT118 |	I know I felt like they were like
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:51,104	| IOT118 |	It's got the screen is desiigner
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:55,968	| IOT118 |	It was a mixed bag in the reviews and it's funny because the hardware itself
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:02:00,320	| IOT118 |	People did complain about the design felt it was chunky block Etc
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:05,184	| IOT118 |	And it actually brings me back to the very first Kindle device which was also
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:11,072	| IOT118 |	Very angular and odd you know Jenna was remember that the page Kindle
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:13,632	| IOT118 |	About Amazon website
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:15,936	| IOT118 |	Yellow
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:16,960	| IOT118 |	It's blocking a junkie
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:22,080	| IOT118 |	Amazon
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:27,712	| IOT118 |	They are not here to design things to sell you things in the most efficient and cost-effective
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,480	| IOT118 |	Way possible
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:31,296	| IOT118 |	That they are that they are
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:34,368	| IOT118 |	Again I did not order when you did and you should have one like
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:36,416	| IOT118 |	Probably right after the show it's going to be delivered
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:39,488	| IOT118 |	UPS come to my house at 1:45
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:42,048	| IOT118 |	Oh I'm sorry
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,072	| IOT118 |	What what you're getting
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:43,840	| IOT118 |	I'm not
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:47,936	| IOT118 |	You know I get to see you again from going back-to-back the original Fire TV
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,216	| IOT118 |	But has the
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:50,752	| IOT118 |	Cards for
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:51,776	| IOT118 |	Madam a
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:56,128	| IOT118 |	On the screen that there's a benefit to that especially for the bedside device and so on
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:03:00,736	| IOT118 |	And for people who maybe you're not tech-savvy want to keep in touch with family
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,784	| IOT118 |	Tweety's Echo shows would be
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:04,064	| IOT118 |	Would be handy but
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:06,368	| IOT118 |	I don't know I will say this
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:11,488	| IOT118 |	Amazon continues to evolve the whole Smart Home
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,024	| IOT118 |	Product line
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:15,072	| IOT118 |	Far faster both hardware and software
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:18,656	| IOT118 |	Then anybody else on the market today and I'll give him credit for that
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:20,448	| IOT118 |	I agree with you and
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:22,496	| IOT118 |	Working
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,520	| IOT118 |	Hard to
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:25,312	| IOT118 |	Say hey is this working
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:28,128	| IOT118 |	So there are really actually moving
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:31,200	| IOT118 |	And I love it
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:35,808	| IOT118 |	Some features that might make the show work for some people with Smart Homes
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,368	| IOT118 |	So they brought in several camera
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:39,904	| IOT118 |	Suzhou Logitech
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:41,440	| IOT118 |	Cameras and
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:44,256	| IOT118 |	My August doorbell camera actually can feed into the show
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:44,768	| IOT118 |	When I get it
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,840	| IOT118 |	Those are the kind of things that you know
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,120	| IOT118 |	Might
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:49,632	| IOT118 |	Mater to
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:53,728	| IOT118 |	No doubt no doubt right rather than have you know
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:59,616	| IOT118 |	Paleta smartphone and look at the feed whatever it mean it's just easily accessible you know if you have that show in your room
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:04,224	| IOT118 |	What I imagined Google will do in response is
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,528	| IOT118 |	You know the Google home doesn't need a screen because you can
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:11,392	| IOT118 |	Chromecast use the Chromecast on your TV if you have that always on
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,952	| IOT118 |	Sunday now you can just be like
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:17,791	| IOT118 |	You don't need a device with a dedicated screen to send it to your television
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,119	| IOT118 |	I will show up.
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:27,775	| IOT118 |	So that's kind of where I see probably Google heading in that direction there's pros and cons to this
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:31,359	| IOT118 |	I mean obviously if your TV is on watching something you don't want to be interrupted with
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,919	| IOT118 |	Bright
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:39,039	| IOT118 |	Order pizza
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:44,159	| IOT118 |	But then again I mean it wouldn't be a stretch to see a little picture in picture pop up
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:46,463	| IOT118 |	Did a programmatically appear as soon as
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:51,071	| IOT118 |	If somebody's at the door so it doesn't take away from the viewing experience of
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:55,423	| IOT118 |	Whatever you were doing beforehand so AT&T I never very clearly
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:05:01,823	| IOT118 |	Like 15 years ago show this for Smart Home
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:03,359	| IOT118 |	Digital Life was part of U-verse
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:04,895	| IOT118 |	So I'll go
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,943	| IOT118 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:10,015	| IOT118 |	So if you're right picture and I always forget about picture in picture
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,295	| IOT118 |	So
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,063	| IOT118 |	That could
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:12,575	| IOT118 |	Definitely
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,879	| IOT118 |	We should mention
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,415	| IOT118 |	That we
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:18,207	| IOT118 |	Talk about the Google home stuff
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:22,303	| IOT118 |	Because Android police did a teardown of the latest
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:27,679	| IOT118 |	App update for the Google home and they noticed a couple things they notice bluetooth support which
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:31,263	| IOT118 |	Pair more devices to the stadium or speakers
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:32,543	| IOT118 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,591	| IOT118 |	And then you can also set
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,383	| IOT118 |	Default help
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,407	| IOT118 |	Put devices so you
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,687	| IOT118 |	You can actually say
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,199	| IOT118 |	Hey
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:42,015	| IOT118 |	This guy the Google home in my living room
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:43,295	| IOT118 |	I want you to talk to my living room
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,087	| IOT118 |	Which
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,111	| IOT118 |	As the default
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:48,671	| IOT118 |	Yes as a default which means it's automatically going to
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,695	| IOT118 |	Go there so in that
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,719	| IOT118 |	Future that we just talk
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:54,815	| IOT118 |	You might have to set your defaults but then poop that's where they're just going to send it
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,607	| IOT118 |	Yeah nope
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,631	| IOT118 |	Android Police
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:04,031	| IOT118 |	Does a lot of Android app teardowns and some of those things pan out some of them don't have the code is in there
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:06,847	| IOT118 |	Where to enable those two features that you just mentioned
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,871	| IOT118 |	But it's not
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,383	| IOT118 |	Active
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,663	| IOT118 |	Right
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:12,479	| IOT118 |	And Google did talk about this though at
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:12,991	| IOT118 |	Their last
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:17,087	| IOT118 |	That I oh I oh I was so excited
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:18,623	| IOT118 |	Everyone else was like no product
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:22,463	| IOT118 |	Cohasset vision for context
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,071	| IOT118 |	Andrew
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:28,607	| IOT118 |	Kevin was writing about context
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:35,519	| IOT118 |	Yeah I was Google Now on my wrist I said I want to see it and lo and behold we got it
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:42,175	| IOT118 |	Alright Amazon also announced a fun new feature
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:45,247	| IOT118 |	I personally wanted like women
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,783	| IOT118 |	It launched so I'm excited about
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:47,807	| IOT118 |	It's Erica
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:51,903	| IOT118 |	And isn't this will work on your show this work on your dots this work on your
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,439	| IOT118 |	I don't know if it would work
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:59,583	| IOT118 |	Taps who has a tap you know what it actually I tested I have a tattoo I have one of each type of echo
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:02,911	| IOT118 |	It does not show up as an option on my tab
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,447	| IOT118 |	I might at brother
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:05,983	| IOT118 |	Okay so
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:08,031	| IOT118 |	Kevin has answered both questions
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,567	| IOT118 |	Kevin has the tap and it does not work
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:16,735	| IOT118 |	So there's a couple ways you can use this I actually used it from The Madam a app on my phone
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,295	| IOT118 |	By going to conversations
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:21,343	| IOT118 |	And that's where you can see the
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:24,415	| IOT118 |	Voice calling that you might have done you see a history there in your contacts
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:27,743	| IOT118 |	But the very top of that screen there's a blue bar that says drop in
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:32,607	| IOT118 |	When you tap that it shows you which Echo devices you can drop in on
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:35,423	| IOT118 |	I have three right here if I tap any one of those
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:39,263	| IOT118 |	That device will actually make a sound like an incoming call but little
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:40,031	| IOT118 |	Ring light
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,055	| IOT118 |	Turn green
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,847	| IOT118 |	And it now becomes an intercom
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:46,431	| IOT118 |	So it's an intercom between my phone through the app and that Echo
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,967	| IOT118 |	But I think you can do it
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,247	| IOT118 |	Without the app as well
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:52,575	| IOT118 |	Okay one thing to know before you start
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,367	| IOT118 |	Dropping in on people in trying to make this work
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,927	| IOT118 |	This is based on the name of
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,439	| IOT118 |	Your Echo
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:59,999	| IOT118 |	When you install that you had to give it a name
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,791	| IOT118 |	If you gave it a cute fun name like
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,327	| IOT118 |	She who shall not be named
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,631	| IOT118 |	You're not going to want to keep that you're going to
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:09,215	| IOT118 |	Probably for the intercom feature what I keep it as the name of the room that it's in
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:12,799	| IOT118 |	Who is your go-to one of your echos
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,567	| IOT118 |	And you'll say
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,103	| IOT118 |	Madam
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,895	| IOT118 |	Drop in on
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:17,663	| IOT118 |	Bedroom
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:18,943	| IOT118 |	And then
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:21,759	| IOT118 |	It will the light will turn green up there and
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:23,039	| IOT118 |	Chime will sound and
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,087	| IOT118 |	You are working
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,135	| IOT118 |	If you can drop in and you can talk to whomever
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:30,207	| IOT118 |	You can actually also do it like a formal phone call
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:31,999	| IOT118 |	If you think that someone might be busy
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:33,791	| IOT118 |	And so then you would say
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,583	| IOT118 |	Madam a
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,095	| IOT118 |	Call
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:40,191	| IOT118 |	And then what's going to happen is the person actually has two
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:40,703	| IOT118 |	Answer you
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:43,263	| IOT118 |	Two ways to do a drop-in is like
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:44,799	| IOT118 |	I'm here
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,567	| IOT118 |	And the other one is like
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,103	| IOT118 |	Oh
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:47,615	| IOT118 |	I'm trying to get
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:48,639	| IOT118 |	Attention
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:58,879	| IOT118 |	I like both approaches and part of the reason is when this was announced a lot of folks who wrote it up as
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,159	| IOT118 |	You able to spy on
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,975	| IOT118 |	And listening on people in your house and so on
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:06,303	| IOT118 |	And you made it sound like they wouldn't know that you're doing this but
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:09,375	| IOT118 |	It's so far in my usage it's very clear
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:11,935	| IOT118 |	Between a chime and the ring light
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:15,263	| IOT118 |	But you are either, glistening talking Etc
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,031	| IOT118 |	So I don't
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:19,103	| IOT118 |	I don't have that concern of a from a privacy standpoint
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:23,199	| IOT118 |	And I actually so my husband and I tested this and he was able to walk
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:24,479	| IOT118 |	All the way across the bedroom
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,783	| IOT118 |	And I could still hear it just fine
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,063	| IOT118 |	Can you
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:31,903	| IOT118 |	Well I have my stepdaughter is a low top
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:36,255	| IOT118 |	Then she wasn't facing the echo
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:42,655	| IOT118 |	It might have to understand my family does not like to test things with me this stuff they don't put their all into it so
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:44,447	| IOT118 |	It could have just been that she's a low talker
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:46,751	| IOT118 |	I don't know
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:50,591	| IOT118 |	I suspected it work for you and your husband I'm sure it's going to work fine for everybody else
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,407	| IOT118 |	You know I feel like kids voices
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,735	| IOT118 |	Understanding my daughter sometime
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,111	| IOT118 |	Redis clear
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,415	| IOT118 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:08,511	| IOT118 |	Let's see what else do we have that was so much like a personal assistants exciting
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,327	| IOT118 |	We got apple
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:13,631	| IOT118 |	Confirm
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,423	| IOT118 |	That's it
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:18,239	| IOT118 |	That's the report I mean you never really know
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:22,335	| IOT118 |	What two apple has purchased until usually long after the fact
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:25,151	| IOT118 |	But I didn't use shell companies and so on so
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,199	| IOT118 |	The report is that
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:30,015	| IOT118 |	They purchased sensomotoric
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,039	| IOT118 |	If I'm saying that correctly
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,575	| IOT118 |	Which is a
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:35,647	| IOT118 |	German company that has 1991
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:38,975	| IOT118 |	They have developed a range of eye tracking
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:41,791	| IOT118 |	Hardware and software through 4 lotto verticals
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:44,607	| IOT118 |	And it sort of makes sense if this is
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,399	| IOT118 |	That this might be true
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:49,215	| IOT118 |	Because there's been a lot of discussion about Apple getting in on
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,007	| IOT118 |	AR VR
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:55,359	| IOT118 |	Wearables possibly although so far that's all just
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,639	| IOT118 |	Speculation
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:59,967	| IOT118 |	Because at WWDC they were showing a rnvr through
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:00,991	| IOT118 |	AR kit
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:07,135	| IOT118 |	Bearcat which is been very impressive from what I seen so far
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:10,463	| IOT118 |	Many of the people who work in PR that I talk to
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:14,303	| IOT118 |	They're like this is really powerful and it's really easy and
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,119	| IOT118 |	It's already on everybody
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,471	| IOT118 |	When I was 11 right
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:25,055	| IOT118 |	Isn't this company makes glasses
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:27,871	| IOT118 |	Peoples Natural Gas
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:28,383	| IOT118 |	In real time
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:32,991	| IOT118 |	And it is up to a hundred and twenty hurts which is super fast
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:34,783	| IOT118 |	A lot
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,551	| IOT118 |	That's a lot
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:37,855	| IOT118 |	And
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,647	| IOT118 |	The benefit here is
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:42,207	| IOT118 |	If you know where someone's looking it's a more granular
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:43,487	| IOT118 |	Data field
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,255	| IOT118 |	For you to actually
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:47,327	| IOT118 |	Zhu Zhu it's it's less jerky
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:48,863	| IOT118 |	Fluid
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:52,191	| IOT118 |	Yeah I mean that you're getting analytics that
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:54,495	| IOT118 |	You might not think you could get a sense
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:57,311	| IOT118 |	But they would be very valuable for a developer to have
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:12:02,943	| IOT118 |	These type of analytics are pretty useful and in fact it was earlier this month at YouTube
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:06,783	| IOT118 |	Was actually showing off video analytics through VR
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,807	| IOT118 |	And of course
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:10,879	| IOT118 |	Are being owned by Google alphabet.
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,415	| IOT118 |	Probably more for
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:15,487	| IOT118 |	Add sewing thing for ad targeting
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:18,815	| IOT118 |	To see what people are looking at as opposed to a developer
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:25,727	| IOT118 |	But either way I'm into to be able to get this type of granular data on what people actually looking at is it school
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,751	| IOT118 |	Going to open up new markets
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,031	| IOT118 |	And
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,799	| IOT118 |	Possibly
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,591	| IOT118 |	Confirm that people are ignoring ads
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:32,383	| IOT118 |	That's true
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,175	| IOT118 |	Let's see
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:37,503	| IOT118 |	What else do we have we have a hundred million dollar fund from Trent
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:40,575	| IOT118 |	This is Jennifer.
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:44,415	| IOT118 |	We don't know a lot about this but they said this week
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:48,255	| IOT118 |	And this is the typical corporate investment strategy what it looks like is
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:50,303	| IOT118 |	Dollars to invest
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:53,887	| IOT118 |	And they're trying to get an understanding of how
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:56,191	| IOT118 |	To think about Security in the eye
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:58,751	| IOT118 |	So this looks very strategic for
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:02,079	| IOT118 |	We've had we shared some thoughts on
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,127	| IOT118 |	Security iot in the past
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:08,991	| IOT118 |	Oh gosh I don't think I have a day doesn't go by that I don't think about security and iot
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:16,415	| IOT118 |	So yeah this is interesting I too am looking for a threat model like a way to think about securing the internet of things which is
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,695	| IOT118 |	It's just completely massive
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:19,743	| IOT118 |	And it's really probably
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:22,815	| IOT118 |	It's more a model of thinking about how to secure
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:25,375	| IOT118 |	So many highly distributed
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,143	| IOT118 |	Devices that
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:28,447	| IOT118 |	Are really relatively dumb
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:31,007	| IOT118 |	What are going to have very complicated permissioning
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:31,519	| IOT118 |	Between them
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:35,615	| IOT118 |	That's kind of how I'm thinking about it I however do not have a hundred
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:38,431	| IOT118 |	Million dollars to invest so you should probably talk to
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,455	| IOT118 |	At first but then you can call me
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:41,247	| IOT118 |	I could start a $10
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:42,527	| IOT118 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:44,063	| IOT118 |	I'm sure I could make it even to hunt
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,855	| IOT118 |	I mean let's be generous
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:48,159	| IOT118 |	410x already
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:50,975	| IOT118 |	Speaking of security
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:53,791	| IOT118 |	There is a wannacry variant running around
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:57,631	| IOT118 |	Hitting everything
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:00,703	| IOT118 |	This is a ransomware attack
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:03,263	| IOT118 |	Which is basically where companies are like
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,311	| IOT118 |	They wake up one morning
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:08,895	| IOT118 |	They got a message and it's like hey you can't access your data because
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:13,503	| IOT118 |	We've got it and we've encrypted it and if you want the key to unencrypt it
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:15,295	| IOT118 |	You got to pay us X number of Bitcoin
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,647	| IOT118 |	So people freak out this is Ben
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,183	| IOT118 |	Ongoing for a while
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,743	| IOT118 |	What are predicted late last year
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:26,047	| IOT118 |	Included in my annual predictions
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:28,607	| IOT118 |	Is this is going to be a big deal for iot
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,655	| IOT118 |	Not necessarily for
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,447	| IOT118 |	Attacking
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,727	| IOT118 |	Individual consumers
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,799	| IOT118 |	Protagonist company
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:38,079	| IOT118 |	Hey
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:40,127	| IOT118 |	If you want your thermostat to work
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:47,295	| IOT118 |	Pay this meeting points maybe it would attract consumers I just feels weird.
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,063	| IOT118 |	Especially
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:51,135	| IOT118 |	Cloud-based iot service providers that are at risk
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:54,463	| IOT118 |	And it wouldn't be hey do you want your thermostat to work it would be
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,743	| IOT118 |	Do you want your
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:57,023	| IOT118 |	10 million
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:59,327	| IOT118 |	Customers thermostats to work
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:00,863	| IOT118 |	Right
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:04,191	| IOT118 |	So yeah
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:05,471	| IOT118 |	Way better
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:11,103	| IOT118 |	Please don't use it
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:15,455	| IOT118 |	As soon as I read the news about how this new variant I think it's called Pacha
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:16,735	| IOT118 |	It's hit
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:19,295	| IOT118 |	N64 countries
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,575	| IOT118 |	And some of the various
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:25,439	| IOT118 |	Companies that it is hit I mean the major shipping company
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,207	| IOT118 |	Maersk is it
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,999	| IOT118 |	The proper pronunciation
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:29,535	| IOT118 |	They they were only able to
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,327	| IOT118 |	Send out like one of their shipping boats
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:32,095	| IOT118 |	Only one
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:35,935	| IOT118 |	Then they like one of the largest shipping providers around the world
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,727	| IOT118 |	As a result of being hit by this
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,519	| IOT118 |	You know
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:41,055	| IOT118 |	It got me thinking about
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:44,383	| IOT118 |	Boy the IRT service providers better
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,175	| IOT118 |	Better not get lock out
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:49,759	| IOT118 |	Just think of it again the scalability of how many
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,551	| IOT118 |	People be impacted if
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,831	| IOT118 |	A Samsung
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,855	| IOT118 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:54,367	| IOT118 |	Platform
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:55,903	| IOT118 |	Was locked out of the top
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,975	| IOT118 |	A wink and Nest mean there's just so many
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:01,791	| IOT118 |	Especially if it has a ransomware
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:03,327	| IOT118 |	Kind of
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:05,375	| IOT118 |	Attached to it it's one thing if your device doesn't
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:08,703	| IOT118 |	So if you get a message
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,215	| IOT118 |	My device doesn't
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:10,239	| IOT118 |	You're like
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:11,263	| IOT118 |	Son of a gun
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,799	| IOT118 |	And you get kind of frustrated
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:19,455	| IOT118 |	Hey this platform has been compromised until Samsung pay
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:21,759	| IOT118 |	You know all your data belongs to us
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:23,551	| IOT118 |	And then I would say
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:26,623	| IOT118 |	That's a different level of freaked out cuz you're like
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:28,927	| IOT118 |	Yep I got who has access to Lake
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,951	| IOT118 |	When I'm home
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:31,999	| IOT118 |	When I'm not home my security alarm
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,279	| IOT118 |	That is a berry
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,815	| IOT118 |	But if they're attacking
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:36,607	| IOT118 |	Provider and not the consumer directly
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:39,167	| IOT118 |	That's going to freak people to hack out
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,959	| IOT118 |	Is it true that
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:46,847	| IOT118 |	Is it is it should I I think I mean this type of attacks or less about getting the data although I
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,127	| IOT118 |	Share your concern
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:51,711	| IOT118 |	I'm sitting here going I walk up to my house and I can't unlock my front door now
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:56,575	| IOT118 |	And neither can any of the other three million people or router many that have the same lock as me
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:04,767	| IOT118 |	Yep that's true
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:08,863	| IOT118 |	I don't carry it
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:11,679	| IOT118 |	I have my watch or my phone that has the app
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:12,959	| IOT118 |	It's a Kwikset
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:15,519	| IOT118 |	It is just use a screwdriver
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,359	| IOT118 |	I can't believe you went there
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,639	| IOT118 |	It's true
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,687	| IOT118 |	I have a Kwikset lock
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:28,831	| IOT118 |	Vanitas Z-Wave screwdriver
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,671	| IOT118 |	Thanks I'm changing my lock now
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,719	| IOT118 |	You're like great did you send this to me you did
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:38,559	| IOT118 |	Not mocking it locks anymore
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:42,399	| IOT118 |	This attack is really scary it's spreading very quickly
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:45,471	| IOT118 |	It's part of a new type of attacks just like wannacry was
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:47,519	| IOT118 |	They call them network-based attacks
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:49,311	| IOT118 |	And we could go into that
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:51,359	| IOT118 |	Stop that
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:54,431	| IOT118 |	To tell you that this is actually a big deal because it's hitting
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:55,455	| IOT118 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:57,247	| IOT118 |	Not just computers
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,271	| IOT118 |	So
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:01,599	| IOT118 |	This attack picture or variants of it
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:03,135	| IOT118 |	Which confusingly is called
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:04,415	| IOT118 |	Not not yet you
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,487	| IOT118 |	Is
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:12,351	| IOT118 |	It's running a muck and the way to stop it do we have a way to stop at yet I don't
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:16,447	| IOT118 |	You know what that there was a report
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:20,543	| IOT118 |	I want a security researcher that if you created a read-only file with a certain name
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:23,103	| IOT118 |	That it would stop it
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:23,871	| IOT118 |	And I know that
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:26,175	| IOT118 |	One email provider
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:27,455	| IOT118 |	Tank in Germany
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,735	| IOT118 |	Has disabled
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,527	| IOT118 |	The email address
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:34,367	| IOT118 |	Of we're supposed to send the Bitcoin but that's a problem because
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:39,487	| IOT118 |	Now even if you want to pay it you can't so that it doesn't seem like the smartest solution to me
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:42,559	| IOT118 |	Yeah that I saw that and I was kind of like
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:48,191	| IOT118 |	You have a good excuse but if the hacker still doesn't give
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:49,215	| IOT118 |	What you doing
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:49,983	| IOT118 |	Still kind of screwed
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:51,775	| IOT118 |	So that's a very legal
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:52,287	| IOT118 |	Kind of
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:54,335	| IOT118 |	Weight attack
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,127	| IOT118 |	It's a big
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:57,151	| IOT118 |	And
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:59,199	| IOT118 |	Once again is highlights
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:03,295	| IOT118 |	How unready we are to actually move
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,831	| IOT118 |	Everything online
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:07,391	| IOT118 |	And how the old security models
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:09,951	| IOT118 |	Are now being exploited
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,231	| IOT118 |	Because we haven't adapted
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:12,511	| IOT118 |	To this agreement
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:13,791	| IOT118 |	So things like
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:15,327	| IOT118 |	How do you patch test
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,375	| IOT118 |	How do you deal with
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,399	| IOT118 |	Problems when they occur
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:24,287	| IOT118 |	How do you get people to upgrade to the latest version of os has on their computers because a lot of these
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:26,591	| IOT118 |	Types of attacks are on
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:27,359	| IOT118 |	Older
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:33,503	| IOT118 |	Versions of OSS
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:37,599	| IOT118 |	Industrial or even Medical Society
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,623	| IOT118 |	Yep
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,927	| IOT118 |	People who manufactured this
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,207	| IOT118 |	They don't support
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:43,487	| IOT118 |	Upgrades to a nice early
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:47,583	| IOT118 |	Which means if you're if you bought like a million ATMs you don't want to update
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,607	| IOT118 |	Beto's in potentially
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,119	| IOT118 |	Break all the stuff
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:51,935	| IOT118 |	You really want your vendors
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:52,447	| IOT118 |	Help there
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:59,871	| IOT118 |	I just I just had this conversation with my son who works at Wawa which is a convenience store chain on the East Coast
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:01,663	| IOT118 |	And we were
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:04,479	| IOT118 |	Discussing two nights ago on the deck I said what
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:06,783	| IOT118 |	Systems do your point of sale
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:09,599	| IOT118 |	Systems take baby touchscreens for ordering at the deli and all that
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,391	| IOT118 |	Windows 95
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:16,767	| IOT118 |	I said I said you know I mean
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:22,655	| IOT118 |	If I knew what I was doing I can come in there and you know a taxi sings of the virus he's like well you just have the point of sale
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:26,751	| IOT118 |	System that that may not be connected to our corporate system
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:30,591	| IOT118 |	But what if I held them Ransom across all 665 stores
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:33,919	| IOT118 |	And you couldn't take orders at your Deli how much would that cost your store
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:35,455	| IOT118 |	And then all the sudden he got silent
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,295	| IOT118 |	Yeah not to mention stealing people's credit card
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:43,647	| IOT118 |	Why will these you don't pay at those terminals okay
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:45,951	| IOT118 |	What are point
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:47,999	| IOT118 |	But they think they're safe and they're not
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,023	| IOT118 |	Exactly
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,047	| IOT118 |	And that is kind of
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:53,631	| IOT118 |	That is where we are today in that we
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:55,167	| IOT118 |	This is going to be a giant
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:56,703	| IOT118 |	Honking bass until
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:59,007	| IOT118 |	We get all of these old systems
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:01,055	| IOT118 |	Updated or out
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:07,199	| IOT118 |	I talk to people in the medical industry and they're like God we are like 15 to 20 years out from that because
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:09,247	| IOT118 |	Those purchasing Cycles
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:11,551	| IOT118 |	Even today people are still
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:14,367	| IOT118 |	At the board level or the purchasing level
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:18,720	| IOT118 |	Turn on Tech stuff so things that they perceive as being non-tech
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:20,000	| IOT118 |	Point-of-sale system
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:21,280	| IOT118 |	They're like
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:24,608	| IOT118 |	How do I really want to pay the extra money for security
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,912	| IOT118 |	And the answer is often no
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:33,824	| IOT118 |	I don't think they look at it I don't think that's the question they ask themselves or like do we need to upgrade a point-of-sale system know it's worth
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:37,152	| IOT118 |	Working fine how much would it cost how much would it cost to upgrade
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:38,176	| IOT118 |	Tiffany
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:39,712	| IOT118 |	Really not whatever MyPay
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:46,880	| IOT118 |	Guess what you could pick a cost you more lost Revenue by not doing it with another new from the Securities and they're not
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,392	| IOT118 |	Not looking at it that way
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:49,184	| IOT118 |	Not the equations
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:49,952	| IOT118 |	The people are
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:50,720	| IOT118 |	Making in their hair
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,536	| IOT118 |	That's all be terrified
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:54,304	| IOT118 |	And talk about the
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:55,584	| IOT118 |	Like
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:59,168	| IOT118 |	I have the new Eero routers that we talked about
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:21:59,680	| IOT118 |	Couple weeks ago
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:05,824	| IOT118 |	I have been testing them but I will admit to not testing them too long because I came while I was in Costa Rica
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:08,384	| IOT118 |	One does not test routers
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,408	| IOT118 |	Vacation
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:09,920	| IOT118 |	This one.
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:10,944	| IOT118 |	Other people
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:13,760	| IOT118 |	So these are the
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:15,296	| IOT118 |	And Eero Pro
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:16,064	| IOT118 |	Routers
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:16,832	| IOT118 |	And they
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:19,648	| IOT118 |	Are more powerful the beacon is smaller
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:21,440	| IOT118 |	And plugs in
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,464	| IOT118 |	So it's kind of like a
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:23,232	| IOT118 |	Flume say it
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,768	| IOT118 |	Oh I need a little bit more WiFi coverage
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:26,560	| IOT118 |	Send
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,096	| IOT118 |	There's two things I can't
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:31,168	| IOT118 |	One is I could go all around my house
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:36,544	| IOT118 |	I did go all around by house testing like Netflix streams and that sort of thing which seem to be
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:38,080	| IOT118 |	The biggest test
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:38,848	| IOT118 |	I could come up with
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:40,640	| IOT118 |	I did not run a software like JP
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,176	| IOT118 |	Detest
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,456	| IOT118 |	The actual
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:45,760	| IOT118 |	Signal strength
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:46,528	| IOT118 |	6 megabits per second
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,832	| IOT118 |	In the
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:50,112	| IOT118 |	Clear reason
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:53,440	| IOT118 |	Like I did think about doing it and I was like you know what
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,464	| IOT118 |	Wi-Fi today
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:58,304	| IOT118 |	In many homes when you have sufficient
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,840	| IOT118 |	Connection and I've got a 305
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:01,376	| IOT118 |	Bit per second connection
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:02,912	| IOT118 |	So at that point
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:04,960	| IOT118 |	I don't actually
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:05,472	| IOT118 |	Care about getting
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:09,824	| IOT118 |	Even bad Wi-Fi is good Wifi in your house
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:13,664	| IOT118 |	Right so that the real issue is coverage it's so
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:15,712	| IOT118 |	Where can I go in my house
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:17,248	| IOT118 |	Inexperienced
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:20,576	| IOT118 |	And I think honestly that's how we should start testing
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,112	| IOT118 |	Because
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:27,232	| IOT118 |	Especially when you're a lot of the reasons people upgrade their Wi-Fi networks is because you know you're
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,256	| IOT118 |	Sticking up
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:32,096	| IOT118 |	Connect sprinkler in a garage somewhere in the garage has crappy WiFi
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:36,192	| IOT118 |	And you know that sprinklers only going to need like a 1.5 megabit per second connection
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:39,776	| IOT118 |	Right it doesn't need to Speed it needs the ability to communicate
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:40,800	| IOT118 |	Reliably in
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:41,568	| IOT118 |	Consistently
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:42,336	| IOT118 |	Exactly
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,128	| IOT118 |	That was my thinking
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:44,896	| IOT118 |	In this you guys can
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,176	| IOT118 |	Call and tell me
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:46,688	| IOT118 |	That that stupid
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,480	| IOT118 |	Ectasia Rock
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:50,784	| IOT118 |	So
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:52,064	| IOT118 |	IWatch all around my house
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:55,648	| IOT118 |	Everything worked I had a challenging area
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:57,952	| IOT118 |	It's actually worth
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:02,560	| IOT118 |	Contesting doorbells so I have this challenging area right outside my backdoor
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:05,632	| IOT118 |	So I went out there and I spent some time
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:06,912	| IOT118 |	With some connected doorbells
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:08,704	| IOT118 |	Those
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:10,752	| IOT118 |	Had better
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:13,568	| IOT118 |	Wi-Fi signals as measured from the doorbell app
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,592	| IOT118 |	Based on the DBS
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:16,640	| IOT118 |	So
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:19,200	| IOT118 |	It seems like these actually offer better
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:19,712	| IOT118 |	Pepperidge
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:23,296	| IOT118 |	Then my existing which were the old school year
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:26,368	| IOT118 |	Is this going to work for everyone
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,416	| IOT118 |	That's becoming the question with
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:30,208	| IOT118 |	By any answer is
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:30,976	| IOT118 |	I don't know
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:32,256	| IOT118 |	You really have to install
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:34,048	| IOT118 |	That's it that's kind of crappy answer
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:36,096	| IOT118 |	But it's it's a fair
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:38,912	| IOT118 |	Answer because everybody's
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:43,264	| IOT118 |	Infrastructure is different your house or townhouse your apartment your office building
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:47,616	| IOT118 |	It all depends on the layout depends on the materials
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,896	| IOT118 |	That are used to construct it
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:51,712	| IOT118 |	So you can't say it's going to work for everybody
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:52,224	| IOT118 |	Nobody can
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:53,248	| IOT118 |	But
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:56,576	| IOT118 |	You can eventually I don't know if they do it yet
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:58,368	| IOT118 |	You can add the extra Beacon
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:01,696	| IOT118 |	So if you have really crappy coverage
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:04,512	| IOT118 |	You're going to be able to buy a beacon in just be like
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:06,560	| IOT118 |	And plug it in
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:07,840	| IOT118 |	So
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:10,144	| IOT118 |	The Eero beacons $149
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,192	| IOT118 |	Enable ship in July
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,472	| IOT118 |	It also doubles as a night light
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:17,056	| IOT118 |	Mine is currently up mine is actually in the roof
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,080	| IOT118 |	On the roof
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:20,128	| IOT118 |	On a roof
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:20,896	| IOT118 |	In a cabin
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:21,408	| IOT118 |	It's so
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:23,200	| IOT118 |	The night light does not
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:23,712	| IOT118 |	Really
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:28,832	| IOT118 |	Help their the idea of the night light is actually one so you don't stick it in the cabinet like I did
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:32,928	| IOT118 |	Depreciate
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,720	| IOT118 |	Appreciate is not the word
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:35,232	| IOT118 |	Where do you usually
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:40,608	| IOT118 |	Negative negatively impacts the signal
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:41,120	| IOT118 |	Thank you Kevin
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:42,656	| IOT118 |	But
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:44,448	| IOT118 |	You can put this in your hallway
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:49,568	| IOT118 |	I actually thought about putting in my hallway because I always right about those doors weren't testing those doorbells and I thought
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:51,872	| IOT118 |	Good way to add connectivity there
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:59,040	| IOT118 |	There was also announced that they were going to launch to Services when is a security service in one is a parental control service
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:01,600	| IOT118 |	Those are not available on my test app
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:07,488	| IOT118 |	So do not test those but I'm really eager to test those cuz for $10 a month it's something I might actually buy
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:08,768	| IOT118 |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,560	| IOT118 |	Well that's it on the Eero
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:11,840	| IOT118 |	It's time for
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:12,864	| IOT118 |	Kevin
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:15,424	| IOT118 |	How to say sayonara in for us to

EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:26,176	| IOT118 |	Any iot products were going to talk about
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,968	| IOT118 |	Sustainable business models
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:29,760	| IOT118 |	How to talk to your engineers
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:30,528	| IOT118 |	And more
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:32,832	| IOT118 |	Stay tuned for all of that
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:39,232	| IOT118 |	And we'll see you next week everyone we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:44,864	| IOT118 |	Message from our sponsor sponsor is TE Connectivity and I have Nick Langston
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:48,960	| IOT118 |	Head of Business Development at TE Connectivity to talk about the smart
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:54,592	| IOT118 |	So let's kick this off with a quick reminder what is TE Connectivity do
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:56,640	| IOT118 |	TV connectivity mix
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:57,664	| IOT118 |	Sensors
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:58,432	| IOT118 |	Antennas
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:26:59,968	| IOT118 |	Huge variety
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:00,736	| IOT118 |	Connectors
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:03,040	| IOT118 |	That appear in all manner of device
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:07,136	| IOT118 |	Message from consumer electronics to Home Appliances that Aerospace
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:07,904	| IOT118 |	Medical devices
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,952	| IOT118 |	We're here today to talk about
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:11,744	| IOT118 |	How I can get a smart kitchen
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:13,024	| IOT118 |	What we see happening in the
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:14,304	| IOT118 |	Today is
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:17,888	| IOT118 |	Device manufacturers are adding sensors that take advantage of
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:19,168	| IOT118 |	Increase precision
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:20,192	| IOT118 |	To enable
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,728	| IOT118 |	Usersub make meals
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:22,496	| IOT118 |	With
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,520	| IOT118 |	More consistency
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:25,312	| IOT118 |	With less effort
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:30,944	| IOT118 |	They're also really focused on using this increased Precision in sensing to improve efficiency
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:32,480	| IOT118 |	We're in the business of manufacturing
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:35,808	| IOT118 |	Watches that can get those jobs done for everyone
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:40,416	| IOT118 |	And when you think about it there's a lot of different places in the kitchen that are really rather harsh be
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:44,000	| IOT118 |	Because exposed to extremely low temperatures extremely high temperatures
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,304	| IOT118 |	Exposed to a lot of moisture
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:49,632	| IOT118 |	A lot of motion it takes a particular skill set
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:50,656	| IOT118 |	To design
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,424	| IOT118 |	Sensors
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:54,240	| IOT118 |	Connectors and things that can withstand assorted
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:54,752	| IOT118 |	Environment
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:59,360	| IOT118 |	Precision sounds really awesome but it also makes it sound professional
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:00,896	| IOT118 |	How can the smart kitchen
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:02,176	| IOT118 |	Actually help everyone
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:04,224	| IOT118 |	We think about the
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:05,248	| IOT118 |	Smart kitchen
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:06,272	| IOT118 |	As being
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:08,832	| IOT118 |	The area in the Smart Home
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,600	| IOT118 |	That
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:12,160	| IOT118 |	Really begins to deliver a lot of value
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:13,440	| IOT118 |	To the public
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:13,952	| IOT118 |	Early on
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,768	| IOT118 |	People on connected home things
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:21,888	| IOT118 |	Because the kitchen is the place where we really begin our lives at home
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:27,264	| IOT118 |	It's all about what's cooking what's going on how we talk to each other how we gather as a family that'll happen
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:31,104	| IOT118 |	In the kitchen and if we can leverage sensing
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:31,872	| IOT118 |	And connect
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:32,640	| IOT118 |	Activity
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:34,944	| IOT118 |	With all of the data now available
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:36,736	| IOT118 |	What about us as individuals
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:42,368	| IOT118 |	And What Makes You mistake online then we can leverage that to live healthier and happier life
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:46,208	| IOT118 |	For example if we think about a week when
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:46,976	| IOT118 |	Weave
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:50,816	| IOT118 |	Just nailed it and everything's gone right for us we can look back on that week
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:55,424	| IOT118 |	It's okay I had two healthy meals I didn't know reason had a lot of junk food that I had good activity
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,960	| IOT118 |	Think about a bad week
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:57,728	| IOT118 |	Maybe you say I am
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:29:00,544	| IOT118 |	Too much junk food I was traveling a lot of fast food
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:02,592	| IOT118 |	With the smart kitchen
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:03,872	| IOT118 |	Your appliances
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:05,408	| IOT118 |	May actually be able to
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:09,504	| IOT118 |	Know about your current health they may communicate with your
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:15,392	| IOT118 |	Wearable device to know what kind of activity you had during the day and they can leverage artificial intelligence
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:16,928	| IOT118 |	To understand what
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:17,952	| IOT118 |	Sort of Neil
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:19,232	| IOT118 |	You should be eating
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:22,304	| IOT118 |	Hear a t e connectivity we want to provide the
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:22,816	| IOT118 |	Sensors
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:25,120	| IOT118 |	Activity and even the system
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:27,168	| IOT118 |	That helped make that possible
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,448	| IOT118 |	In appliances
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:31,264	| IOT118 |	The Senate May look like something like a wireless
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,544	| IOT118 |	Power and data trend
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:33,056	| IOT118 |	Ignition system
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:38,432	| IOT118 |	Some new cooking appliance whether it says sous vide circulator or
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:40,224	| IOT118 |	Smart coffee machine

EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:09,408	| IOT118 |	He is the founder of tech product manager
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:11,456	| IOT118 |	And today we're going to talk about
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:17,344	| IOT118 |	How to introduce your own iot products to the market or how you should think about that if your company is trying to do this
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,672	| IOT118 |	Thanks for coming on the show this week
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:23,488	| IOT118 |	Thank you so much for having me and really excited to be
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:26,560	| IOT118 |	I am too I'm excited you're here because
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:31,680	| IOT118 |	My gosh I see a lot of companies saying Hey to the mix
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:33,216	| IOT118 |	We're going to watch a connected product
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:35,520	| IOT118 |	And then they do something and it's terrible
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:39,360	| IOT118 |	So I'm hoping that maybe this conversation will
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,640	| IOT118 |	Stop a little bit of that from happy
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:43,712	| IOT118 |	Boston I come up to you and I'm like that
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:44,992	| IOT118 |	We need some IRT
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:45,760	| IOT118 |	Is that really the right approach
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:49,088	| IOT118 |	Yeah that's a really good point because
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:50,368	| IOT118 |	That's what I see a lot of
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,136	| IOT118 |	Company
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:52,928	| IOT118 |	Today pay here that iot
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:54,464	| IOT118 |	He has all this potential
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:55,232	| IOT118 |	Opportunities
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:58,304	| IOT118 |	And then
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:30:59,072	| IOT118 |	We need an iot
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:01,376	| IOT118 |	Aetna really not understanding
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:08,288	| IOT118 |	Iot is just a tool that can help
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:13,408	| IOT118 |	Solve the customer's problem in a better cheaper faster way
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:16,736	| IOT118 |	So by understanding what problem did really trying to solve
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:21,088	| IOT118 |	Then you can analyze if iot with all these components and all the benefits
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:22,880	| IOT118 |	Actually the right Solutions
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:26,464	| IOT118 |	And once you have that understanding you can go through
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:30,048	| IOT118 |	Process to understand all the different pieces
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,328	| IOT118 |	How they fit together
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:32,608	| IOT118 |	If there's a business case
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:43,616	| IOT118 |	Jump that step I launched into
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:44,384	| IOT118 |	We're building
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:46,688	| IOT118 |	So let's have identified
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:53,088	| IOT118 |	Problem is it safe to say that there's probably a few more steps once I've identified that problem before I should launch into
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:56,672	| IOT118 |	Yes there's actually a lot of different
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:58,464	| IOT118 |	Places that you can go through to
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:00,512	| IOT118 |	Valley Faith with her. Problem is
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:02,048	| IOT118 |	First of all that's a traditional
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,608	| IOT118 |	Weather. Problem is worth
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,376	| IOT118 |	I'll be
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:07,424	| IOT118 |	But then once you figure out that your company
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:09,728	| IOT118 |	That's found a problem when solving
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:12,288	| IOT118 |	And they are well suited to solve it
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:13,056	| IOT118 |	It's not the same thing
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,360	| IOT118 |	And you can go into
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:17,408	| IOT118 |	The process of understanding
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,200	| IOT118 |	What it would take to do it from an iot
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:21,248	| IOT118 |	That's where
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,528	| IOT118 |	I think there's a lot of
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:28,416	| IOT118 |	Confusion between companies because iot sonido and it has so many different components
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:31,488	| IOT118 |	Even if they're able to identify the problem
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:33,536	| IOT118 |	The transition from
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:34,560	| IOT118 |	Strategy to
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:38,656	| IOT118 |	A lot of things get lost bear
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:40,192	| IOT118 |	Alright so
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:41,728	| IOT118 |	How should I
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:42,752	| IOT118 |	Think about this
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:43,264	| IOT118 |	Cuz like
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:44,544	| IOT118 |	For a while
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:50,688	| IOT118 |	A lot of connected products were coming on the market and they basically were like you can control XYZ from your phone
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:51,712	| IOT118 |	And most people are like
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:52,736	| IOT118 |	That sounds great
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:56,320	| IOT118 |	Actually I don't to pay three times as much for something
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:58,624	| IOT118 |	Like to turn on crock pot for my phone
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:01,440	| IOT118 |	How do I get people to think about
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:04,256	| IOT118 |	Connectivity and really applying it to
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:09,632	| IOT118 |	I guess useful make sense for their business
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:12,704	| IOT118 |	The way I think about it is that
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:13,984	| IOT118 |	Dislike song
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:16,288	| IOT118 |	What are the problems that companies
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:18,080	| IOT118 |	Particularly are trying to solve
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:20,128	| IOT118 |	They already have those problem
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:22,176	| IOT118 |	So companies are coming up with
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:23,200	| IOT118 |	New problems
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:24,480	| IOT118 |	Barefoot products
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:25,248	| IOT118 |	So bad
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:26,016	| IOT118 |	Are the ones that
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:27,552	| IOT118 |	Falling to this
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:29,344	| IOT118 |	Not enabled
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:33,952	| IOT118 |	But let's say that you are a manufacturer that sells
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:34,976	| IOT118 |	A particular
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:35,744	| IOT118 |	Type of
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:36,768	| IOT118 |	Epic Motors
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:38,304	| IOT118 |	And then your customers
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:39,584	| IOT118 |	They are
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:40,608	| IOT118 |	1 C to
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:46,752	| IOT118 |	Get more value out of those Motors because they say that they are discussing the money because there's
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:50,336	| IOT118 |	So the customer already has. Problem
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:53,152	| IOT118 |	And you have been having that problem
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:54,944	| IOT118 |	Forever we discussed
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:57,760	| IOT118 |	Society doesn't really opening
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:34:02,880	| IOT118 |	How can you apply this new technology to solve that problem in a better way so that
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:03,392	| IOT118 |	You can provide
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:05,184	| IOT118 |	More value to your crush
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:08,256	| IOT118 |	Ultimately they don't care about iot
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,072	| IOT118 |	People don't buy a
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:15,168	| IOT118 |	Customer doesn't really care about how
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:16,704	| IOT118 |	Take care about
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:18,496	| IOT118 |	How you going to help them
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,776	| IOT118 |	Bottom line
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:22,336	| IOT118 |	About my opinion
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:23,104	| IOT118 |	I don't like
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:25,664	| IOT118 |	Problems with companies
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:27,712	| IOT118 |	And how can you enhance that
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:30,272	| IOT118 |	Caballo tea to bring more value to your customers
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:33,344	| IOT118 |	Okay so
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,880	| IOT118 |	Maybe I should think of this is
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:40,768	| IOT118 |	Classes of problems that the internet of things are adding connectivity consol what would those be
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:46,912	| IOT118 |	Challenges that we have with the term biote is that it's all-encompassing
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:49,728	| IOT118 |	Anything that connects to the internet
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:54,080	| IOT118 |	And 1/2 component on the difference
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:59,456	| IOT118 |	But there's a big difference in the car
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,992	| IOT118 |	Solutions for healthcare
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:04,320	| IOT118 |	Consumer products like wearables
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:05,600	| IOT118 |	Smart buildings
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:08,160	| IOT118 |	Smart TVs to military to energy
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:09,440	| IOT118 |	So I think that
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:09,952	| IOT118 |	The class
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:11,232	| IOT118 |	Problems
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:14,304	| IOT118 |	Are going to be dependent on the industry that you're serving
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:17,888	| IOT118 |	You're going towards the industrial manufacturing setting
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:22,496	| IOT118 |	The challenges that they have always had have to do with up time
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:25,056	| IOT118 |	Reboot of their production line
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:26,080	| IOT118 |	Purchasing cost
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:31,456	| IOT118 |	If you're looking at it
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:34,272	| IOT118 |	Call Darius
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:35,296	| IOT118 |	Convenience
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:37,856	| IOT118 |	Give me five different systems of data
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:41,696	| IOT118 |	So that's the kind of problems you can solve
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:45,280	| IOT118 |	Kindred Healthcare well that's a highly regulated area so
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:47,584	| IOT118 |	Problems that have to do with
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:54,240	| IOT118 |	Ensuring Precision of instrumentation to be single time
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:59,360	| IOT118 |	There's no one killer application for iot
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:03,968	| IOT118 |	One solution
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:05,248	| IOT118 |	Classes of problems
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:06,784	| IOT118 |	Which detergent
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:08,064	| IOT118 |	Solving approach
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:10,624	| IOT118 |	With the corresponding Eye Institute.
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:11,904	| IOT118 |	One of the things that I see
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:15,232	| IOT118 |	It's a different process
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:16,256	| IOT118 |	Understanding
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:17,792	| IOT118 |	Who are the customers
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:20,096	| IOT118 |	Anubis digging into what
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:20,864	| IOT118 |	Text problems
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:22,912	| IOT118 |	So sometimes
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:25,728	| IOT118 |	Even if you were focusing on a specific vertical let's say
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:26,240	| IOT118 |	Black building
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:27,520	| IOT118 |	And
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:29,056	| IOT118 |	You are creating a product
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:30,080	| IOT118 |	Connected
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:33,920	| IOT118 |	A device that controls the air conditioning to say
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:34,432	| IOT118 |	Energy
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:39,808	| IOT118 |	Buildings need to save energy there for dissolution is going to work out
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:42,880	| IOT118 |	But it turns out that when you actually do
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:46,720	| IOT118 |	Some user research
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:48,512	| IOT118 |	Care about serving energy
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:53,120	| IOT118 |	That much they really cared about the other colors not be running in there cooking
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:56,192	| IOT118 |	Or their security in the building so
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:37:02,848	| IOT118 |	All the sudden you have this companies that come in with IBS
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:05,152	| IOT118 |	Back from the customer
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:10,272	| IOT118 |	Could be okay if I cared about that problem
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:13,856	| IOT118 |	Let's get into this idea business models because
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:18,720	| IOT118 |	I think a lot of companies throughout connected products and services without thinking about
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:21,024	| IOT118 |	Supporting them over the life there Prada
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:24,608	| IOT118 |	So their business model doesn't necessarily match with
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:26,400	| IOT118 |	Product that they put out there
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,960	| IOT118 |	I think people are realizing that
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:29,984	| IOT118 |	They made some mistakes
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:34,080	| IOT118 |	Child services on a product
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:36,896	| IOT118 |	But
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:38,944	| IOT118 |	How do you advise companies to
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:43,296	| IOT118 |	Identify their problem and then before they even start building
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:44,320	| IOT118 |	Product to think about
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:45,088	| IOT118 |	How they're going to
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:46,624	| IOT118 |	Pay for it or how they're going to charge cup
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:55,072	| IOT118 |	Converse all these different areas
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:55,840	| IOT118 |	In order of
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:58,400	| IOT118 |	Understanding
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:00,704	| IOT118 |	On the way aye
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:03,520	| IOT118 |	Set this up is in a way that is Progressive
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:06,848	| IOT118 |	So once you understand your users and understand your data
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:08,128	| IOT118 |	And having a date
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:10,944	| IOT118 |	Ticketfly see a lot of companies doing is that
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:12,736	| IOT118 |	They say we're going to going to
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:15,296	| IOT118 |	Add sensors to whatever we are selling
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:17,088	| IOT118 |	And that's it
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:20,160	| IOT118 |	When you probe deeper text what are you going to do with that data
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:21,440	| IOT118 |	I will figure it out later
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:23,744	| IOT118 |	And it turns out that later Never Comes
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:27,584	| IOT118 |	A lot of fees in the clouds
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:28,096	| IOT118 |	Space
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:29,888	| IOT118 |	Storage Etc
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:33,472	| IOT118 |	By going through a process that can
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:34,496	| IOT118 |	Help you understand
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:40,384	| IOT118 |	All the different components of a solution
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:44,992	| IOT118 |	How long do you intend your system to be on the field and therefore
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,528	| IOT118 |	How long do you have to
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:50,112	| IOT118 |	Be able to get revenue from that customer can make it
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:51,648	| IOT118 |	Bible all those things
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:53,184	| IOT118 |	Is what I see is important
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:53,952	| IOT118 |	What to do
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:58,304	| IOT118 |	Even before you start for the types of before you raise Capital before you launch
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:00,608	| IOT118 |	I understand your data strategy
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:01,888	| IOT118 |	What is
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:03,168	| IOT118 |	Is model support that strategy
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:11,360	| IOT118 |	And that all of those things are interrelated because the technology has to be at a price point
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:12,128	| IOT118 |	45
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:14,176	| IOT118 |	And that's what all this change
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:14,688	| IOT118 |	Play together
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:18,016	| IOT118 |	If you add more data then
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:19,040	| IOT118 |	Cost you
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:22,112	| IOT118 |	Marcos Torres so therefore you going to have to charge more
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:24,416	| IOT118 |	And by being able to understand all these different
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:25,696	| IOT118 |	Complexity
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:28,512	| IOT118 |	Then
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:29,792	| IOT118 |	I'm more realistic
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:31,328	| IOT118 |	Memorial Estates
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:32,096	| IOT118 |	Road map
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:33,376	| IOT118 |	That actually
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:35,424	| IOT118 |	Pictures of passports profitability
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:36,448	| IOT118 |	As opposed to just
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:37,216	| IOT118 |	Cool
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:39,008	| IOT118 |	Technological solution
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:44,896	| IOT118 |	I'm sitting here looking at your iot decision framework and for folks who care I will put it in the show notes
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,432	| IOT118 |	But you got
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:47,456	| IOT118 |	You excited
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:49,504	| IOT118 |	So and that's actually less about like
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:52,064	| IOT118 |	Ux it sounds like
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:55,392	| IOT118 |	Well it is still your ex but it's more about identifying the need of your customer
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:40:01,280	| IOT118 |	You got the business model that you're going to work from the technology
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:04,608	| IOT118 |	Then you move to security so a thank you for having
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:05,632	| IOT118 |	Security in there
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:11,776	| IOT118 |	Is a lot of people feel like security something that should be designed in from the beginning
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:18,432	| IOT118 |	This is obviously a I think still before you put anything together but can you talk about like how you think about security and house
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:22,272	| IOT118 |	Please back with everything that you've talked about that comes before
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:24,832	| IOT118 |	Yes that's a very good point send
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:27,392	| IOT118 |	The reason I put security here
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:28,672	| IOT118 |	After technology
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:29,952	| IOT118 |	The way
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:31,232	| IOT118 |	I use this framework is
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:33,024	| IOT118 |	It's a matrix
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:35,072	| IOT118 |	So you look at each of those items
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:37,376	| IOT118 |	At each layer of the Earth
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:40,704	| IOT118 |	Iot technology stack support example when you looking at business
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:42,496	| IOT118 |	A look at the business implications
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:44,288	| IOT118 |	But then also
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:45,568	| IOT118 |	Empathize Hardware perspective
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:50,176	| IOT118 |	Application
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:55,296	| IOT118 |	You're going down then you have
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,064	| IOT118 |	Technology so
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:58,624	| IOT118 |	What cigar did you going to use to solve V
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:00,160	| IOT118 |	And then
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:02,208	| IOT118 |	Security cam player because
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:05,024	| IOT118 |	Unless you understand what the technology
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:07,840	| IOT118 |	What you going to say
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:09,888	| IOT118 |	Security risk management
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:12,704	| IOT118 |	It's a located that you should be able to
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:15,776	| IOT118 |	Beginning to end
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:16,544	| IOT118 |	Before you
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:18,080	| IOT118 |	Start developing anything
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:19,360	| IOT118 |	So in that sense
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:21,920	| IOT118 |	It is baked into your design
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:23,456	| IOT118 |	And then you have to understand
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:25,248	| IOT118 |	What security
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:29,600	| IOT118 |	You need a device Hardware other device off when they are a Communications
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:35,488	| IOT118 |	What's the worst that can happen
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:39,072	| IOT118 |	That's true and understanding your customer base is in
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:40,352	| IOT118 |	Port near to because
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:42,912	| IOT118 |	A medical device is very different
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:45,984	| IOT118 |	From a security standpoint than a consumer thermostat
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:47,008	| IOT118 |	Or a Bluetooth
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:50,080	| IOT118 |	And that's why in the framework but I have a case
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:52,384	| IOT118 |	Starting with ux witches understand your user
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:54,687	| IOT118 |	It's so if you understand
EDL	00:41:54,687	00:41:56,991	| IOT118 |	Persona 4
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:59,551	| IOT118 |	Different user involved throughout the life cycle
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:00,831	| IOT118 |	Then you can say you know what
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:01,855	| IOT118 |	Security
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:04,671	| IOT118 |	Even though we might be in a highly regulated energy
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:05,695	| IOT118 |	Well
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:09,535	| IOT118 |	Security is going to be most important for us at the device Hardware because
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:10,815	| IOT118 |	Physical tampering
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:12,863	| IOT118 |	I supposed to the car application
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:14,655	| IOT118 |	Assessment
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:15,679	| IOT118 |	And you say
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:19,007	| IOT118 |	Might different users care about Security in this difference
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:19,775	| IOT118 |	Layers
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:21,823	| IOT118 |	And I am comfortable with this levels of risk
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:24,895	| IOT118 |	Now here's the fun part of all
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:25,663	| IOT118 |	All this
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:26,431	| IOT118 |	This
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,199	| IOT118 |	Is a real
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:32,063	| IOT118 |	And I think it's it actually is a very nice
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:33,343	| IOT118 |	Way of thinking about
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:39,487	| IOT118 |	It's also this is a very fast-moving area
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:40,767	| IOT118 |	And so
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:43,071	| IOT118 |	How much time should a company
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:44,607	| IOT118 |	Take on this
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:54,079	| IOT118 |	Put everything
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:55,103	| IOT118 |	Together so
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:57,919	| IOT118 |	All teams should be looking at you like salty should be looking at 8
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:02,015	| IOT118 |	Ed
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:04,319	| IOT118 |	But I do work substitute teacher
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:09,439	| IOT118 |	A week or so working with your team you can actually learn the framework
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:17,631	| IOT118 |	You should be able to fill this out really quickly or so if you spending too much time on this
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:25,567	| IOT118 |	So that you understand all the different things and you make the fish
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:27,359	| IOT118 |	And my
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:30,687	| IOT118 |	To go with a minimum viable product
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:31,967	| IOT118 |	You always going to be learning
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:36,831	| IOT118 |	But at least
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:37,855	| IOT118 |	And then turn right on
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:39,903	| IOT118 |	And the other thing is that
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:43,999	| IOT118 |	Isolation because the industry moves so far my recommendation is
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:47,327	| IOT118 |	Look for Market fit before everything else
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:49,631	| IOT118 |	A lot of companies that are coming from
EDL	00:43:50,399	00:43:53,471	| IOT118 |	Having hyperthyroidism having a lot of experience there
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:55,007	| IOT118 |	They thrive
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:55,775	| IOT118 |	Forecast
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:43:59,615	| IOT118 |	They want to have the cheapest product
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:00,895	| IOT118 |	Smallest products in Market
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:02,943	| IOT118 |	And I
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:04,223	| IOT118 |	Paint that is actually
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:05,759	| IOT118 |	Putting the cart before the horse
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:08,575	| IOT118 |	Do something even if it's broken
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:12,927	| IOT118 |	With other types of components from third-party vendors
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:14,463	| IOT118 |	So that you
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:15,487	| IOT118 |	Verify that the
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:17,023	| IOT118 |	Traction in the market
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:20,607	| IOT118 |	Watch contraction in the market then you can actually start by finding your offering
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:22,655	| IOT118 |	To make it faster
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:23,935	| IOT118 |	Cheaper smaller etcetera
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:25,983	| IOT118 |	And
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:27,007	| IOT118 |	Here's a tough question
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:29,055	| IOT118 |	Cuz I think a lot of the benefits that
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:31,359	| IOT118 |	Connectivity will bring to businesses
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:35,967	| IOT118 |	Is an Ashley in a physical product in some cases it might be a service
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:39,551	| IOT118 |	And I'm thinking of things like you know being able to order a Domino's Pizza
EDL	00:44:39,551	00:44:40,831	| IOT118 |	Amazon
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:43,135	| IOT118 |	In this this feels very
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:47,487	| IOT118 |	Physical product oriented but I'm curious if this can be adapted to
EDL	00:44:48,255	00:44:53,375	| IOT118 |	Just probably thinking about how connectivity everywhere is going to disrupt
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:54,911	| IOT118 |	All kinds of businesses in
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:55,935	| IOT118 |	Thinking about using this
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:57,983	| IOT118 |	Even to deliver services
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:58,495	| IOT118 |	Azure software
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:01,823	| IOT118 |	Yes I can see that's a great observation in
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:02,847	| IOT118 |	I think this
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:04,639	| IOT118 |	Generic
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:07,455	| IOT118 |	It has all the different components that you can eat
EDL	00:45:07,967	00:45:12,319	| IOT118 |	And then ask your realtor Progressive than you can focus on a specific area
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:14,623	| IOT118 |	Example of the echo
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:16,927	| IOT118 |	The echo have all these components
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:20,511	| IOT118 |	But as you continue to evolve it into stay now the echo
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:21,791	| IOT118 |	Orders pizza
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:22,815	| IOT118 |	Well that is just
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:24,607	| IOT118 |	Focusing on the device
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:25,375	| IOT118 |	Software area
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:29,215	| IOT118 |	In the voice recognition and artificial intelligence
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:32,287	| IOT118 |	So you can actually have
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:35,103	| IOT118 |	And then it just touches
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:36,895	| IOT118 |	Sum of the parts
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:39,455	| IOT118 |	You don't have to do everything every single time
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:41,247	| IOT118 |	What are
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:43,039	| IOT118 |	Sir product mistakes
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:45,087	| IOT118 |	They have gone before so
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:47,391	| IOT118 |	What are some some ways that people have not
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:49,439	| IOT118 |	Follow this
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:50,207	| IOT118 |	How to fight them
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:45:58,399	| IOT118 |	The first one is not understanding who your users are
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:00,959	| IOT118 |	And what problems are you really looking
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:01,727	| IOT118 |	Salt for them
EDL	00:46:02,751	00:46:04,799	| IOT118 |	So that it's a combination of
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:07,615	| IOT118 |	Not having user
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:09,407	| IOT118 |	And also the technology
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:10,431	| IOT118 |	Leading the way
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:11,455	| IOT118 |	I think a lot of companies
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:13,759	| IOT118 |	Think that iot is going to
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:15,807	| IOT118 |	Open your doors from a technology perspective
EDL	00:46:16,319	00:46:18,879	| IOT118 |	The temperature to Dollar Tree without really understanding that you
EDL	00:46:20,415	00:46:20,927	| IOT118 |	Another
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:26,559	| IOT118 |	So the idea is that you can
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:27,583	| IOT118 |	Add sensors
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:28,095	| IOT118 |	2
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:30,655	| IOT118 |	So that you can collect information
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:32,447	| IOT118 |	2Pac somebody
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:34,495	| IOT118 |	If you don't have a clue what the value is going to be
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:36,543	| IOT118 |	Going to be really hard to
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:37,823	| IOT118 |	Justify
EDL	00:46:38,591	00:46:39,359	| IOT118 |	Cost
EDL	00:46:39,359	00:46:42,175	| IOT118 |	Later or change it to your organization
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:43,199	| IOT118 |	Or anything else
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:45,759	| IOT118 |	Business
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:47,551	| IOT118 |	You have to think that
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:50,111	| IOT118 |	Other couple of my area that I think are
EDL	00:46:50,111	00:46:52,415	| IOT118 |	Often not understood correctly security
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:46:56,767	| IOT118 |	Speculation
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:47:02,655	| IOT118 |	Companies don't really take the time to understand what regulations are going to eat
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:06,239	| IOT118 |	Especially if they're going to go to work
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:08,287	| IOT118 |	Like energy or Healthcare
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:11,103	| IOT118 |	You know what they're getting into otherwise
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:11,615	| IOT118 |	It's never going to
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:14,175	| IOT118 |	Adoption or purchase etcetera
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:16,991	| IOT118 |	Other types of
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:19,039	| IOT118 |	Examples of smart buildings
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:20,063	| IOT118 |	Now
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:21,855	| IOT118 |	You have to deal with building code
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:26,975	| IOT118 |	Exchanges in different districts and municipalities and you have to have all the different
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:29,791	| IOT118 |	I completely outside of the technologically well
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:31,071	| IOT118 |	A lot of companies just
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:32,351	| IOT118 |	Don't think about that
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:33,631	| IOT118 |	So my recommendation is
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:36,447	| IOT118 |	Think about it
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:38,751	| IOT118 |	I get the rice counseling to make sure you understand
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:40,031	| IOT118 |	What the regulations
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:44,127	| IOT118 |	And in the
EDL	00:47:44,127	00:47:44,895	| IOT118 |	Area
EDL	00:47:44,895	00:47:46,175	| IOT118 |	Regulation changes your back
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:53,087	| IOT118 |	How do you ask your users what they want especially when we're kind of in this place where we it's like your users don't even know
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:54,879	| IOT118 |	What they want
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:57,183	| IOT118 |	Give them what they need not necessarily what they want
EDL	00:48:02,559	00:48:05,887	| IOT118 |	And that's why I'm a big proponent uaccess
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:09,983	| IOT118 |	Techniques that you can do to observe your users
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:10,751	| IOT118 |	Their uses
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:12,543	| IOT118 |	Won't be able to tell you
EDL	00:48:12,543	00:48:14,591	| IOT118 |	What solution they want
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:16,127	| IOT118 |	But they can tell you what the problem is
EDL	00:48:16,639	00:48:18,431	| IOT118 |	And it's your responsibility
EDL	00:48:19,967	00:48:21,503	| IOT118 |	To come up with something.
EDL	00:48:22,271	00:48:24,831	| IOT118 |	Salt. Net for them in a way that make
EDL	00:48:24,831	00:48:25,343	| IOT118 |	Makes sense
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:29,183	| IOT118 |	There are a few of my favorite things
EDL	00:48:29,183	00:48:33,535	| IOT118 |	To observe your users in the wild identify who uses our first of all
EDL	00:48:34,047	00:48:38,911	| IOT118 |	And then go out there and spend the day with them and interview them even how they interact with their environment
EDL	00:48:39,423	00:48:40,447	| IOT118 |	Problems first time
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:41,983	| IOT118 |	Then
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:43,007	| IOT118 |	Costume
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:44,287	| IOT118 |	Identify the problem
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:45,823	| IOT118 |	Keep that
EDL	00:48:45,823	00:48:49,151	| IOT118 |	Discovery and research mentality swap
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:55,039	| IOT118 |	And other
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:56,319	| IOT118 |	Types of Technology
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:58,879	| IOT118 |	But they need to make it deeper into
EDL	00:48:58,879	00:49:01,183	| IOT118 |	Iot is what
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:02,463	| IOT118 |	To be a part of everything
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:06,047	| IOT118 |	Needs to be part of the toolbox if any product manager
EDL	00:49:06,559	00:49:07,583	| IOT118 |	So that we can understand
EDL	00:49:09,375	00:49:09,887	| IOT118 |	And then
EDL	00:49:10,399	00:49:13,215	| IOT118 |	Only then proposed what solution to fit them
EDL	00:49:15,007	00:49:15,519	| IOT118 |	All right
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:18,079	| IOT118 |	Thank you
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:20,127	| IOT118 |	Thank you so much for having me
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:21,151	| IOT118 |	Really exciting
EDL	00:49:23,455	00:49:24,735	| IOT118 |	To be able to have this conversation with you
EDL	00:49:26,015	00:49:27,039	| IOT118 |	You just had it with
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:33,439	| IOT118 |	Carlos Nursery thank you so much that's it for this week's show thank you so much for this
