EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:50,592	| IOT185 |	Okay Kevin let's start with the biggest news which
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:51,872	| IOT185 |	Just probably
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:52,640	| IOT185 |	Oh
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,664	| IOT185 |	You think Google
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:57,760	| IOT185 |	I think it is we have to talk about that cuz I'm still reeling from the event
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:00,576	| IOT185 |	As of yesterday I need coffee
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:02,368	| IOT185 |	Yasso
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:03,648	| IOT185 |	3 things are an ounce
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:05,440	| IOT185 |	To really don't
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:06,720	| IOT185 |	Concern our audience
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:12,096	| IOT185 |	But the one thing that does is what we already knew was coming or at least what we expected based on leaks
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:16,704	| IOT185 |	The Google home hub which you can already order for 100
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:17,728	| IOT185 |	$49
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:21,568	| IOT185 |	It is a smart display similar to the Lenovo and
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:22,592	| IOT185 |	JBL
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,104	| IOT185 |	Companion products
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:27,456	| IOT185 |	That aren't they are Google Hardware partner so they're all using Android things
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:29,760	| IOT185 |	This is a little different it's
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:34,368	| IOT185 |	Cheaper than those which is interesting but I think I understand why now that I've
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:36,416	| IOT185 |	Actually seen and use the device
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,440	| IOT185 |	Super starters
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:40,256	| IOT185 |	It's hard to tell in the pictures
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,792	| IOT185 |	But it is a very
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:43,072	| IOT185 |	Small device
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:45,120	| IOT185 |	It's a 7-inch display
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:48,448	| IOT185 |	You can hold the base of it in your hand quite easily
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,472	| IOT185 |	It's just
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,008	| IOT185 |	Really I think you're towards
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:52,800	| IOT185 |	Being a smart
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:56,128	| IOT185 |	Controlling device with a little bit of media
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:03:02,528	| IOT185 |	And I say that because the screen is not as big as the Lenovo for example of the 10-inch Lenovo with a 1080p 10 inch
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,808	| IOT185 |	Screen this is 7 in
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,856	| IOT185 |	And they're giving
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,648	| IOT185 |	Dating Google is giving you
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:09,696	| IOT185 |	Three months of YouTube
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,464	| IOT185 |	Premium
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,744	| IOT185 |	With this device
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:15,328	| IOT185 |	If you purchase it not YouTube TV which is actually what I use
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,864	| IOT185 |	Mysmartice play for
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,888	| IOT185 |	Quite a bit so
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:21,216	| IOT185 |	You can certainly you know use this device
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:25,056	| IOT185 |	For media but it is really all about the new home View
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:28,896	| IOT185 |	And that is going to be coming to the other smart displays I'm explain what that is
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:31,968	| IOT185 |	At any point in time you can just walk up at the display
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,760	| IOT185 |	Of course you can control your home devices
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:37,344	| IOT185 |	Cuz my voice but if you slide down from the top you get a brand new
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:41,696	| IOT185 |	Homeview which shows you what's going on in the room you're currently and such as
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,720	| IOT185 |	What temperature brass
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:44,512	| IOT185 |	Mustang with sensors you have installed
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,536	| IOT185 |	Your lighting
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,328	| IOT185 |	Situation at the moment etcetera
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:48,096	| IOT185 |	And then you
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:50,144	| IOT185 |	Controls to everything else in the house as well
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:50,912	| IOT185 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,984	| IOT185 |	Everything old is New Again
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:58,848	| IOT185 |	So basically they've reinvented the fancy touchscreen the wall base touch screens that
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,360	| IOT185 |	Like high-end
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:02,432	| IOT185 |	Yeah it is since they really have
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:03,200	| IOT185 |	They really have
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:03,712	| IOT185 |	And
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,528	| IOT185 |	It basically aggravates it gets rid of all those
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:10,624	| IOT185 |	External apps you might be using which you can still use for all your devices but
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:15,232	| IOT185 |	It just aggravates everything in one spot which is already done in the home mobile app
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:15,744	| IOT185 |	But now it's
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:19,327	| IOT185 |	A little easier on the eye and it's little more intuitive because
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:23,935	| IOT185 |	You have pretty much everything you want to see where you are at the right time in one spot
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:26,495	| IOT185 |	Okay so it's kind of like home OS
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:29,311	| IOT185 |	Switch is the Apple homekit version of this
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:31,871	| IOT185 |	In a sense I would say yes
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:32,895	| IOT185 |	A little more
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,663	| IOT185 |	Text to Lynette
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,175	| IOT185 |	Because
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:36,735	| IOT185 |	If I'm using the home app
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,783	| IOT185 |	On my iPhone 4 sample
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,575	| IOT185 |	It's not going to say you know
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,599	| IOT185 |	What the lights
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:43,135	| IOT185 |	State is in the room I'm in
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:46,463	| IOT185 |	It'll show with the light state for every light in the house and home
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:47,487	| IOT185 |	Got it
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:49,279	| IOT185 |	So
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,815	| IOT185 |	So that
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:53,887	| IOT185 |	Feature will be coming to the old
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:57,215	| IOT185 |	Smart displays they're not that old but the Lenovo in the JBL
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:58,495	| IOT185 |	Additionally it's a big
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:04,383	| IOT185 |	Interaction of rather interface with Google Assistant of course it will show your routines if you want
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:06,687	| IOT185 |	And it you can even program the routine standings
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,479	| IOT185 |	Include the display in those routines
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:14,879	| IOT185 |	So your good morning routine could of course show you news weather Etc appointments whatever he will automatic
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,159	| IOT185 |	Dim at night
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:19,231	| IOT185 |	Good night and you don't even need to set a routine for that if I
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:25,631	| IOT185 |	Google touted this ambient EQ which is a light sensor and basically they're going to smartly reduce the
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:32,031	| IOT185 |	The brightness Depending on time of day and if you're not in the room it's not going to do that because there's no sensor to show
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:35,103	| IOT185 |	Show motion which the other ones actually do have
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:41,503	| IOT185 |	I walk in my room to Lenovo smart display actually brightens up but will Google says it to trying to reduce the billboard effect and what they
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:45,855	| IOT185 |	I mean is they don't want your eye drawn to a bright rectangle
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:47,647	| IOT185 |	In the room when you walk in
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:49,439	| IOT185 |	They want you to look at this device
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:52,767	| IOT185 |	When you want to look at it when you need to look at it so
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:57,375	| IOT185 |	That makes a lot of sense it's but again it's a fancy ambient light sensor implementation
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,423	| IOT185 |	That
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,959	| IOT185 |	Someone else
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:01,727	| IOT185 |	Let me ask you
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,263	| IOT185 |	Because there's a lot
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:04,799	| IOT185 |	2009
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:08,127	| IOT185 |	Oh does it have any radios like zigbee or Z-Wave I know that
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:09,663	| IOT185 |	We love those in our home hub
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:14,527	| IOT185 |	We love those two and unfortunately no I say unfortunately for us
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:19,391	| IOT185 |	A lot of mainstream people who have not invested in zbr Z-Wave devices
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:25,791	| IOT185 |	Don't care because you're not missing anything so there's no new radios with Bluetooth 5.0 and 802 11
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:29,119	| IOT185 |	AC wifi both 2.4 and 5 gigahertz
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,143	| IOT185 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:30,911	| IOT185 |	That's good on the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:34,751	| IOT185 |	Is it Hey Kevin is it Wi-Fi for Wi-Fi
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:38,847	| IOT185 |	Yeah I didn't go there
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,127	| IOT185 |	Is it really
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:43,455	| IOT185 |	What is 11 AC is going to be named
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,015	| IOT185 |	Now I'm totally lost.
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:48,319	| IOT185 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:50,879	| IOT185 |	Pictures of you guys who miss last week show that they did
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:51,903	| IOT185 |	The Wi-Fi Alliance
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:53,439	| IOT185 |	Instant credit
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,719	| IOT185 |	Read my hand
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,815	| IOT185 |	Okay so then the big question is
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,607	| IOT185 |	You said that you've got
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,143	| IOT185 |	Yours and I have mine
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:02,911	| IOT185 |	So would you buy this
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,983	| IOT185 |	I would not from me
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:09,311	| IOT185 |	And that is because I like the immersive media
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:11,103	| IOT185 |	Experience provided by the larger
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,127	| IOT185 |	Lenovo smart display
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,407	| IOT185 |	So
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:14,175	| IOT185 |	If
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:17,759	| IOT185 |	You're all in on say homekit obviously this is not for you
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:20,319	| IOT185 |	You're all in on Madam and The Echoes
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:23,903	| IOT185 |	This isn't going to do much for either unless you plan to switch
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:29,535	| IOT185 |	Show away from mad at me because by and large most of the same devices are supported on both of those platforms
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:32,607	| IOT185 |	I will confess that I actually have a better experience on madam
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,375	| IOT185 |	Hey
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:37,215	| IOT185 |	Despite the fact that I'm a heavy Google Apps and Android user
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:40,031	| IOT185 |	Because Google Apps actually
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:44,127	| IOT185 |	Works on madhumeha but because of my weird account issues
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:45,407	| IOT185 |	It doesn't work
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:46,175	| IOT185 |	On
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:46,943	| IOT185 |	The Google devices
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:49,759	| IOT185 |	Continuing frustration so I'm like
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,295	| IOT185 |	Google I love you but no
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:54,623	| IOT185 |	Yeah obviously if you have a g Suite account
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,415	| IOT185 |	As opposed to regular Google account
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:08:01,023	| IOT185 |	Yeah you're going to run into that issue time and time again with your phones and Google assistant general Shore
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,303	| IOT185 |	What about the
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,607	| IOT185 |	And so that's
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:11,007	| IOT185 |	That's what I was going to bring up because this is one thing you can't get with your second Echo Show for example so I think
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,799	| IOT185 |	You have the nest doorbell ring
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,079	| IOT185 |	I do
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,615	| IOT185 |	Okay as do I
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:19,455	| IOT185 |	And you know you can certainly go into the app today and look at
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,991	| IOT185 |	See who's at the front door at 7.
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:25,087	| IOT185 |	But when somebody rings the doorbell today you literally have to
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,391	| IOT185 |	Tell a display or device to
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,671	| IOT185 |	To show who's out there
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,951	| IOT185 |	What they did here is
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:33,023	| IOT185 |	Is Google integrated with Nest so that any time
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:35,327	| IOT185 |	Somebody Rings Your Nest doorbell
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:37,631	| IOT185 |	The video stream will immediately
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:39,423	| IOT185 |	Pop up unannounced
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:41,471	| IOT185 |	If you want to do anything or say anything
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,519	| IOT185 |	It just pops up on the Google home hub
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:48,639	| IOT185 |	And then you can have a two-way conversation or if you don't want to talk to the person there's some pre-canned
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,407	| IOT185 |	Responses
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:52,223	| IOT185 |	So you can just say sorry not interested tap that little
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:53,247	| IOT185 |	You don't have to say anything
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,039	| IOT185 |	I can just tap the sorry we're not interested in
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,575	| IOT185 |	That's what it will say to whoever's out there
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,367	| IOT185 |	Does it say in your voice tube
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,159	| IOT185 |	Yes you. Don't record it
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:01,951	| IOT185 |	You don't
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:03,743	| IOT185 |	We are at entry
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:07,583	| IOT185 |	Yeah Google does the voices in
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,631	| IOT185 |	I color I think right so
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:12,959	| IOT185 |	Cyan for me would say sorry not interested
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,263	| IOT185 |	We're not even going
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:16,543	| IOT185 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,079	| IOT185 |	So I feel like
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:18,591	| IOT185 |	I know
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,383	| IOT185 |	If I should buy this or not
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,151	| IOT185 |	That's good
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,943	| IOT185 |	And I will say
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:25,247	| IOT185 |	For people interested in seeing the nest
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:27,039	| IOT185 |	If you have Nest gear Nest cameras
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:30,367	| IOT185 |	Google has been pretty shy about sharing the camera base
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:32,159	| IOT185 |	Rest apis with other partners
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:32,927	| IOT185 |	So
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:33,695	| IOT185 |	You may never
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:38,559	| IOT185 |	I'm not not anything I know for a fact but I will say that people
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,375	| IOT185 |	Are companies out there that would love access to that
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,399	| IOT185 |	But they don't get it
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,447	| IOT185 |	And this may become like a
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,471	| IOT185 |	Competitive advantage
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:45,983	| IOT185 |	Google
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:52,895	| IOT185 |	If I would agree with that and I don't know anything either but I suspect you're right I think this is a platform play for Google and
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:55,711	| IOT185 |	I mean if you spend 3.2 billion on Nest I would imagine
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,735	| IOT185 |	That makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:04,159	| IOT185 |	I'm one other quick thing only because this relates to something else that was announced yesterday
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:09,535	| IOT185 |	For those who use the or will use the Google home hub or any other smart display for photos
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,303	| IOT185 |	Because integrates
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:13,631	| IOT185 |	Is Google photos and you can just view albums all day long on the devices
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:16,703	| IOT185 |	They have added a live albums
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:20,287	| IOT185 |	And using their search smart so you can say I want to see pictures of
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:22,335	| IOT185 |	Nor my dog or Beano
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,127	| IOT185 |	My wife my husband whatever
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,151	| IOT185 |	It will search
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:29,759	| IOT185 |	Do your photos and create a live album and show those on the display of the Google home hub
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,551	| IOT185 |	As you add more photos
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:33,343	| IOT185 |	Of that person or pet
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:36,927	| IOT185 |	Not to the album it will automatically add them to that album
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,975	| IOT185 |	For you for the Google home hub which I thought was
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:41,279	| IOT185 |	It's cool though that's lovely
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,047	| IOT185 |	Yes
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:44,095	| IOT185 |	And as it relates to something else
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:45,119	| IOT185 |	That's sort of related
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,399	| IOT185 |	Not quite our audience
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:48,191	| IOT185 |	The pixel 3XL
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,983	| IOT185 |	Has a new pixel stand
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,775	| IOT185 |	Twitches a wireless stand
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:54,079	| IOT185 |	To charge your pixel 3 or 3XL
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,871	| IOT185 |	When you put the phone on the
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:58,943	| IOT185 |	Charger it can show you photo albums
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:01,247	| IOT185 |	Also on the phone
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:03,039	| IOT185 |	And will show you the nest
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:04,575	| IOT185 |	Camera from the doorbell
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:09,951	| IOT185 |	When that phone is sitting there so kind of beans on mini smart display with very limited functionality
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:11,999	| IOT185 |	That's kind of cool knots it
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:14,559	| IOT185 |	Well actually I don't ring my phone everywhere in the house
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,583	| IOT185 |	So that might be
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,119	| IOT185 |	Fix for me if I were going to buy
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:19,935	| IOT185 |	Can I get a software update for my original
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,983	| IOT185 |	Cancel my pixel 2
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:26,335	| IOT185 |	I don't know about that I think they're telling us as a pixel 3
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,639	| IOT185 |	Function a pox on their people
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:30,943	| IOT185 |	Well
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,711	| IOT185 |	Let's
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,479	| IOT185 |	Move actually
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:34,271	| IOT185 |	Before we move on be on Google
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:36,319	| IOT185 |	There's there's one of the thing GE announced
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:39,647	| IOT185 |	Some smart light bulbs the C by GE
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,415	| IOT185 |	Lights
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:42,463	| IOT185 |	I'm just going to say this straight
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:46,559	| IOT185 |	GE has the world's most confusing connected lightbulb strategy
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,071	| IOT185 |	See I have ever
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,631	| IOT185 |	They have branded this
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:53,471	| IOT185 |	These light I have owned a variation of the GE connected lights
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,775	| IOT185 |	That we're not great at all
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:59,615	| IOT185 |	And then they went out and they rebranded or lunch new light
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:00,895	| IOT185 |	That were
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,175	| IOT185 |	Pakistan
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:04,479	| IOT185 |	Circadian rhythms are Auto tuning
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:09,343	| IOT185 |	According to the day and they had it a night version that you were night bulb and a daytime bulb
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:14,207	| IOT185 |	So the idea was you would put like the night bulb in your bedside table in the daytime bold maybe at you
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,231	| IOT185 |	Your desk and
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:16,511	| IOT185 |	I thought that was
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,559	| IOT185 |	You saying strange as well
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,071	| IOT185 |	Now
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:20,863	| IOT185 |	And that was under the sea brand
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,167	| IOT185 |	Letter c as in Charlie
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:24,447	| IOT185 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,727	| IOT185 |	And so now they have
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,239	| IOT185 |	The
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:27,263	| IOT185 |	Google C
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:30,591	| IOT185 |	So these new
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:31,871	| IOT185 |	Google
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:33,407	| IOT185 |	See lights are Bluetooth Bass
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:34,687	| IOT185 |	Much like there
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,199	| IOT185 |	Prettiest
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:37,503	| IOT185 |	And I
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:39,551	| IOT185 |	They audit at me when you screw them in
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,855	| IOT185 |	The Inn you have a Google
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:43,135	| IOT185 |	Home hub
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,695	| IOT185 |	They're going to automatically be detected
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:48,767	| IOT185 |	I'm not sure what the network authentication process is if
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:52,095	| IOT185 |	It's like a barcode if it's some sort of weird handshake
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:52,863	| IOT185 |	But
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:59,263	| IOT185 |	These are getting these sorts of automatic Discovery are becoming more common Amazon actually showed a lot of that
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,543	| IOT185 |	Shut off last month
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:01,823	| IOT185 |	@its
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,103	| IOT185 |	Fun exciting
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:05,919	| IOT185 |	We lunch 70 things in one day kind of event
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:08,223	| IOT185 |	But I'm still not keen on Bluetooth Baseline
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:10,783	| IOT185 |	I know Bluetooth mesh makes this better
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,807	| IOT185 |	I still
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:14,623	| IOT185 |	Yeah I still remember like being able to be like
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:17,951	| IOT185 |	Walk downstairs and suddenly losing the ability to control my lights and that was
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,231	| IOT185 |	Sake
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:21,023	| IOT185 |	So I'm curious about this one
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:26,911	| IOT185 |	Yeah I'm curious to I mean this is all and this kind of goes with the theme of yesterday's event with the Google home hub
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:31,519	| IOT185 |	Although these work with any Google home product and I'm a mini etcetera it's all about simplicity
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:33,055	| IOT185 |	And that's
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:37,919	| IOT185 |	Southpaw for mainstream people who are just getting started in this morning we're having on started it also
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:43,295	| IOT185 |	That's what they're going for here literally you plug these in and then just go to the Google home app and they say
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,575	| IOT185 |	And start controlling that's it
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,111	| IOT185 |	So I think that
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:48,671	| IOT185 |	That's great I'm curious as you are about
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:51,999	| IOT185 |	You know the implementation of that from a security standpoint I don't
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:58,143	| IOT185 |	Think you're scanning anything we could do it in the plug these in and powder them up but Google has a Google has my wife I could
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:02,751	| IOT185 |	Maybe they're running tests on anyway I did send them an email and
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,543	| IOT185 |	We'll try to figure that out for you guys cuz
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:08,383	| IOT185 |	That's how dedicated we are to the nitty-gritty of these Marton
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:08,895	| IOT185 |	Also
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,431	| IOT185 |	Related
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,199	| IOT185 |	To Google
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:13,503	| IOT185 |	This is a story that I wrote last week
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:15,551	| IOT185 |	I've been working on this for a little while but
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,855	| IOT185 |	How does a little bit
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:20,159	| IOT185 |	I have been hearing from Smart Home
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:20,927	| IOT185 |	Device makers
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,719	| IOT185 |	That Walmart
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:24,255	| IOT185 |	If you wanted to be sold in Walmart
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,791	| IOT185 |	You needed to have
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:26,815	| IOT185 |	Support
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:30,143	| IOT185 |	And if you had only met him a support
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:31,679	| IOT185 |	Can I come back when you can support Google
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:33,727	| IOT185 |	And talk to her
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:35,775	| IOT185 |	Six different people they all confirm this
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:36,799	| IOT185 |	Walmart
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:38,079	| IOT185 |	Still has not gotten back
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:38,847	| IOT185 |	Test me on this
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:39,359	| IOT185 |	Kind of losing her
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,663	| IOT185 |	But in a baby
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:42,943	| IOT185 |	Maybe
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:47,551	| IOT185 |	And the other thing is that was Universal was it if you support Madam a
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:48,319	| IOT185 |	That's fine
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,855	| IOT185 |	But don't emphasize that
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:52,159	| IOT185 |	Need to put that on the side of the box or the back of the box
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:54,207	| IOT185 |	And then I talked to some other people
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:57,791	| IOT185 |	Who said that they were actually encouraged to move their operation
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:00,863	| IOT185 |	Off of AWS Amazon web service
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,911	| IOT185 |	And they were also encouraged
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:05,215	| IOT185 |	To not use a smart
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:05,983	| IOT185 |	Home hub
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,799	| IOT185 |	And in this make sense
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:12,127	| IOT185 |	Is anywhere talk about Simplicity or talk about normal people
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:16,223	| IOT185 |	That's kind of I think the theme of this year would be the normalization of
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:16,991	| IOT185 |	The Smart Home
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:17,759	| IOT185 |	Not
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,271	| IOT185 |	Like 4
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:25,183	| IOT185 |	Like my mom and dad are not like all the smart home is normal but it's prepping it to become normal so making it so normal people
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:25,695	| IOT185 |	Can adopt
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,487	| IOT185 |	That is a big strides
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:30,303	| IOT185 |	And closing the loop on this
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,839	| IOT185 |	About the normal fee
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:36,191	| IOT185 |	Normal people don't know or care about zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:40,031	| IOT185 |	But normal people pretty much know about Bluetooth and WiFi and I think that's
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,567	| IOT185 |	Really worried there's
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:43,871	| IOT185 |	Getting rid of the Hub that's coming from
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:46,431	| IOT185 |	Keeping the products simpler and using those two radios
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:51,551	| IOT185 |	Yeah and that makes sense. I think there will always be room in a market
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,831	| IOT185 |	For the foreseeable
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,623	| IOT185 |	Future Percocet B&C way
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:55,391	| IOT185 |	It's just
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,671	| IOT185 |	That's like your leveling up
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:01,535	| IOT185 |	Alright while we're on this topic of simplicity
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:04,607	| IOT185 |	Amazon release the new software update
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:05,887	| IOT185 |	Four battle
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,167	| IOT185 |	And
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,447	| IOT185 |	I downloaded it
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:10,495	| IOT185 |	I always have the worst experience
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,263	| IOT185 |	With my
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,031	| IOT185 |	Madame Mao
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,055	| IOT185 |	I'll be honest
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:17,151	| IOT185 |	Even actually what I had the Amazon guy over to like
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:19,711	| IOT185 |	Hit my house basically see what he said
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:22,271	| IOT185 |	Is like gosh your app run so slowly
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:23,551	| IOT185 |	I think it's because I have
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:24,063	| IOT185 |	A lot
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,087	| IOT185 |	Devices
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,367	| IOT185 |	But
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:28,415	| IOT185 |	What do you think
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:35,327	| IOT185 |	Yeah I updated it on my phone and it's actually kind of similar to what Google's going for with their home
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:41,727	| IOT185 |	Review on the Google home hub it's more of an aggregator of here's all your devices here's all your groups and rooms you can even
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:44,031	| IOT185 |	To see what skills you have in your smart home
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:47,359	| IOT185 |	I like it so far it's visually very pleasing to me
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,895	| IOT185 |	I often find these apps to Beatrice
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:50,175	| IOT185 |	Kind of fairy
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:50,943	| IOT185 |	Bright
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:55,295	| IOT185 |	And this is a very low-key relaxing pestilli color I don't know if I
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,319	| IOT185 |	If you saw the same but
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:17:00,927	| IOT185 |	It was the first thing that jumped out at me quite honestly and then everything's very well-organized I think
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:01,439	| IOT185 |	Yes it's like
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,743	| IOT185 |	Dark blue and then they it's a
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:06,303	| IOT185 |	Brighter blue but it's not like a super bright blue it's very
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:09,119	| IOT185 |	Just chill seafoam green or nice
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:09,887	| IOT185 |	Purple
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:14,239	| IOT185 |	So are ya at the color palette did actually job is like
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:15,007	| IOT185 |	Oh that's a little
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:20,895	| IOT185 |	Weird alright it actually kind of felt a little old-fashioned it reminded me of color palettes I saw on smart-home things back in like
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:22,175	| IOT185 |	2013
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:22,687	| IOT185 |	I think Peak
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:24,479	| IOT185 |	Which was Best Buys
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:25,503	| IOT185 |	Smart home hub
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:27,039	| IOT185 |	Had a similar color palette
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:31,135	| IOT185 |	I am talking about color palettes let's talk about grouping
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:35,487	| IOT185 |	Cuz I said that's important with this at the groupies
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,255	| IOT185 |	What is happening
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:42,143	| IOT185 |	This is an area where Amazon has always excelled they let you put you can have as many groups as you want
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,935	| IOT185 |	I have about half a dozen
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:44,959	| IOT185 |	Which might be
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:49,823	| IOT185 |	Bring so slow and I put I have a Christmas grouping I have a downstairs grouping I
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:50,591	| IOT185 |	Groupings for me
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:51,359	| IOT185 |	My rooms
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:52,127	| IOT185 |	And
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:57,247	| IOT185 |	Here's a pro tip for you guys because I recently had a hue light bulb just go offline
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,015	| IOT185 |	I don't know why
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:17:59,295	| IOT185 |	You just happened
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:02,879	| IOT185 |	So I had to delete that bulb and then re-add it
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,159	| IOT185 |	And
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:06,207	| IOT185 |	I re-added it in the hue
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:06,719	| IOT185 |	App
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:08,767	| IOT185 |	Got to do that
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,303	| IOT185 |	And then I had to
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:12,607	| IOT185 |	Delete the old bald from the Amazon
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,631	| IOT185 |	Echo app
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,655	| IOT185 |	And then
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:16,191	| IOT185 |	Put the new one into
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,215	| IOT185 |	Groups
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:19,263	| IOT185 |	I realize that I had had it
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,543	| IOT185 |	Living room
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:21,823	| IOT185 |	Group
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,103	| IOT185 |	But then when I
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:26,687	| IOT185 |	Created my downstairs group in which is all of my lights downstairs
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,479	| IOT185 |	Instead of
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:28,991	| IOT185 |	Adding
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,527	| IOT185 |	The room group
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:31,807	| IOT185 |	To that
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:34,111	| IOT185 |	Teen I'd added two things individually
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:36,415	| IOT185 |	This is too convoluted for everyone
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:42,559	| IOT185 |	Are we following this hence the Simplicity Factor everybody's going for these days
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,351	| IOT185 |	So the point is
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:47,423	| IOT185 |	You can add things to a routine you get out of group
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:48,703	| IOT185 |	To your routine
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,239	| IOT185 |	So
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,287	| IOT185 |	From now on I'm treating like
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:54,847	| IOT185 |	Hey that's the living room group and now I'm just putting that hoe
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:55,871	| IOT185 |	Croup into my room
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:57,663	| IOT185 |	So I went back and read it on my
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,711	| IOT185 |	Around that beat
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:00,479	| IOT185 |	Cuz
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:03,295	| IOT185 |	If something happens you can just swap one thing out in
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,087	| IOT185 |	Right
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:11,487	| IOT185 |	And that makes sense from a contextual standpoint because let's say you have a movie night routine in the living room everything in
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:14,303	| IOT185 |	Living room is going to be affecting or most everything
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:20,703	| IOT185 |	The lights perhaps my dim the TV might come on the Fire TV Etc perhaps even have a connected speaker system
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:24,287	| IOT185 |	That fires up and then turns everything to say Netflix so
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:26,591	| IOT185 |	That makes sense you can just do everything at once with a group
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,127	| IOT185 |	You think is worth it
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:31,455	| IOT185 |	Netflix movie night or Amazon Prime movie night
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,247	| IOT185 |	I actually have had this debate in my
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:37,599	| IOT185 |	House beside our movie night
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:42,463	| IOT185 |	Yeah I'm okay with picking and choosing from my TV screen what I
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:44,511	| IOT185 |	What service I want to watch and we have like
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:47,071	| IOT185 |	Three or four of them sick I'm right there with you but
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:48,863	| IOT185 |	Yeah we bounced around its
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:49,887	| IOT185 |	Buy show for us
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:51,679	| IOT185 |	Let It Go stay
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:57,055	| IOT185 |	Related before we get off at topic
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,847	| IOT185 |	Google's
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:20:00,127	| IOT185 |	Omeprazole so updated
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:02,175	| IOT185 |	And if you want a peek
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:08,063	| IOT185 |	At what the hungry looks like on the Hub if the same cohesive interface on the new Google home app
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:13,183	| IOT185 |	And I really like what's been done here in fact I like it better than the Mad MAF refresh
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:16,255	| IOT185 |	Okay yeah you know I like it is brighter it's got
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:18,559	| IOT185 |	Lovely things I love being able to like
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:19,071	| IOT185 |	Turn the light on
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,119	| IOT185 |	Make it brighter make it dimmer
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,911	| IOT185 |	Change the color like all of that is really
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:24,191	| IOT185 |	Very nice
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,471	| IOT185 |	Simple simple
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:26,495	| IOT185 |	Simple again
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:29,055	| IOT185 |	So I do Wonder though is that
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:32,895	| IOT185 |	Again is that a function of the Google Engineers coming up with that or is that
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:36,479	| IOT185 |	Four devices that are little weird or off that might not be in there
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,527	| IOT185 |	Do you get to pick your own or how does that work
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:40,063	| IOT185 |	How did those visual elements
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:40,575	| IOT185 |	Transfer over
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:48,255	| IOT185 |	Who did Ryan yeah with a manufacturer has some say what they're EPI and so on I presume that Google knows that
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:54,399	| IOT185 |	Yeah this is it maybe a tunable bulb and therefore we need this interface my guess is they know the attributes somehow
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,679	| IOT185 |	3D apis
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:21:00,287	| IOT185 |	To dynamically show the correct control but I don't have a ton of those
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,055	| IOT185 |	Unique
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:03,103	| IOT185 |	Idevices so I couldn't say for sure
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:05,407	| IOT185 |	Well I am still traveling but

EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:11,039	| IOT185 |	Here's my weird connected device what do you think it is
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:14,623	| IOT185 |	Cuz I really think Amazon Nails it when they talked about having
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,159	| IOT185 |	Yeah mon
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,720	| IOT185 |	Range and on-off
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:21,792	| IOT185 |	Toggle I think that's a really good way to start thinking about these things
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,840	| IOT185 |	On off Circle
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:26,144	| IOT185 |	Range is volume maybe it's
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:27,424	| IOT185 |	Lighting colors
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:30,496	| IOT185 |	And then mode is anything specific to a device like
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:32,032	| IOT185 |	In lights it might be a scene
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:35,104	| IOT185 |	In a washing machine that might be permanent press clothes

EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:56,256	| IOT185 |	That was the problem

EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:07,520	| IOT185 |	But if you eat your maintenance operations
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:09,312	| IOT185 |	36 hours
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,592	| IOT185 |	And that is way too long
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:11,872	| IOT185 |	There's no mechanism
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:15,968	| IOT185 |	Collectively bargain refrigeration systems
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:19,296	| IOT185 |	You can only imagine what that means for food safety
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:21,600	| IOT185 |	Poop has to be disposed of immediately
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:24,160	| IOT185 |	We talked about those in the traffic
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,536	| IOT185 |	So is the solution iot

EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:45,920	| IOT185 |	What I mean by scale is activating a pilot the full-scale production of thousands of refrigerator

EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:38,912	| IOT185 |	In the meantime
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,680	| IOT185 |	Frank work
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:40,960	| IOT185 |	Go to find out more
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:41,472	| IOT185 |	About cotton
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:47,872	| IOT185 |	You can go to our website at cognizant.com
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:56,064	| IOT185 |	Okay
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:58,112	| IOT185 |	We have almost exhausted
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,904	| IOT185 |	Smart Home Smart displays but
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,440	| IOT185 |	Not
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:01,952	| IOT185 |	Quite
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,512	| IOT185 |	Big news
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:08,096	| IOT185 |	And I'm going to say something that underlies the need for trust
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:09,120	| IOT185 |	Lost in the space
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:10,656	| IOT185 |	Is Facebook launch
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,984	| IOT185 |	Display that has a
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:17,056	| IOT185 |	The camera that tracks you and you can call people on it
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:17,568	| IOT185 |	And
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:19,360	| IOT185 |	I don't know why
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:23,200	| IOT185 |	And it has an assistant integration to
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:24,736	| IOT185 |	Does
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:26,784	| IOT185 |	Triple would you be
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,344	| IOT185 |	Let me think about
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,136	| IOT185 |	Not at all
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:32,672	| IOT185 |	I'm kidding I'm not even thinking
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:33,440	| IOT185 |	Not at all
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:37,280	| IOT185 |	Basically this is the new portal from Facebook which is the
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,840	| IOT185 |	Cassius we talkin about a
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:42,400	| IOT185 |	Some type of smart device from them for quite some time it's
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:48,800	| IOT185 |	Again similar to say smart display or nekoshou but it's a little bit more limited in that
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:50,592	| IOT185 |	It's really meant for
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:51,616	| IOT185 |	Video call
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:53,664	| IOT185 |	So obviously there's a camera on here
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,944	| IOT185 |	And I think that's going to be
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,480	| IOT185 |	The biggest challenge for Facebook
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:57,760	| IOT185 |	Who already has
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:26:01,856	| IOT185 |	I say probably one of the least trusted large companies with personal information
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:05,184	| IOT185 |	This this is what trips me out people still ask
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:05,952	| IOT185 |	They're like
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:06,720	| IOT185 |	Hey
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:10,816	| IOT185 |	You know how when you talk about something and then you get an ad for it on Facebook
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:12,352	| IOT185 |	I didn't think it on your phone
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:12,864	| IOT185 |	In this case
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:14,656	| IOT185 |	Again
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:17,216	| IOT185 |	So if you can imagine you know that
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:19,008	| IOT185 |	Put in your house
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:19,776	| IOT185 |	I mean
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:21,056	| IOT185 |	Right
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:25,408	| IOT185 |	Not with Facebook I mean I wouldn't say no one's not go
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:26,944	| IOT185 |	Do it but I
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,480	| IOT185 |	Fewer people are going to do it
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:31,808	| IOT185 |	With them versus with Amazon or Google in my opinion
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:33,088	| IOT185 |	Shoe department
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,136	| IOT185 |	Why did they release the
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:40,512	| IOT185 |	I am not sure quite honestly because it is really limited it mean yes it is
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:44,864	| IOT185 |	It's got to be always listening because there is a matinee integration and they're going to add a Google integration
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:45,376	| IOT185 |	The future
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:47,680	| IOT185 |	It doesn't even it's not like you can use
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:52,032	| IOT185 |	Facebook Messenger to talk to people Center April literally just a video.
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,568	| IOT185 |	Type device
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:55,360	| IOT185 |	With an always listening assistant
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:56,896	| IOT185 |	And it's not cheap either
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:27:02,016	| IOT185 |	It's 199 for the 10-inch display and 350
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:04,064	| IOT185 |	For a 15.6 in
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:08,416	| IOT185 |	Display that rotates from portrait to landscape I mean it's like a big old slab of a tablet
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:09,952	| IOT185 |	Santander
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,744	| IOT185 |	Yeah telepresence
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:12,768	| IOT185 |	From Facebook
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:13,280	| IOT185 |	You know
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:15,584	| IOT185 |	All your corporate and family secrets
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:16,096	| IOT185 |	Xposed
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,888	| IOT185 |	And
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:20,960	| IOT185 |	And on the product page they have you know
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:21,984	| IOT185 |	Here's the
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:23,776	| IOT185 |	All the features and privacy is on the pig
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:30,688	| IOT185 |	I just don't need it asked us for phone numbers for two-factor authentication and then
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:31,712	| IOT185 |	Used that phone
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:34,272	| IOT185 |	For this is not a cup
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:38,368	| IOT185 |	But I don't honestly know I mean I feel like in the media we
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,136	| IOT185 |	Dog and face
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:39,648	| IOT185 |	A lot
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:40,928	| IOT185 |	We see this
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:44,000	| IOT185 |	I don't actually know how many normal like truly normal
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:50,144	| IOT185 |	We're outside this world they I feel like they have a bag distrust but they may not understand the actual
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:52,960	| IOT185 |	You know is it evil it's certainly Machiavellian
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:54,752	| IOT185 |	Facebook
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:59,872	| IOT185 |	Yeah that's it there's a trust issue because of what they've done with data and then got basically caught doing
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:05,760	| IOT185 |	To their credit I mean they are trying here from a privacy standpoint there saying you can completely disable the camera microphone with a single
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:09,344	| IOT185 |	Or you can block the camera lens with the provider camera cover
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:12,672	| IOT185 |	So there's that then they also say they don't listen to view or keep
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:14,208	| IOT185 |	Your video calls
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:16,512	| IOT185 |	Everything stays between you and the person you've talked
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:21,376	| IOT185 |	The smart camera uses AI that runs locally not on their servers
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:24,960	| IOT185 |	Am I smart camera this is actually pretty cool tack it follows
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:30,592	| IOT185 |	People basically original around the room keeps them in focus and so on so that's nice I like that
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:34,688	| IOT185 |	But they don't use facial recognition or identify who you are so so they say
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:38,528	| IOT185 |	And are they only send the voice commands to their servers after you say the hot word
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:40,320	| IOT185 |	Which is a portal
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:43,136	| IOT185 |	I didn't tell you.
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:47,488	| IOT185 |	But I see why they need to do that they have to do something on mobile right
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:52,864	| IOT185 |	They had to do some soap couple years back they were all in on mobile because people were like a ghost
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:53,376	| IOT185 |	What's the weather
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:29:00,032	| IOT185 |	So if you think about we're moving to a world without screens or that we don't look at the screens or utilize the screens are pockets
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:02,592	| IOT185 |	It does become important to have
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:04,384	| IOT185 |	Communication or
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:06,176	| IOT185 |	A way into
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:11,808	| IOT185 |	The home in four people are going to spend time trying to think again connect which is what their fundamental mission is
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:21,536	| IOT185 |	Sure. And I get it too because they missed the boat in terms of mobile they actually tried to do a quote-unquote Facebook phone with h
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:23,072	| IOT185 |	HTC and that totally bombed
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:26,400	| IOT185 |	And now they're trying to do the Facebook portal in
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,704	| IOT185 |	Before it gets too late
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:31,008	| IOT185 |	So I get it too but I can tell you
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:32,288	| IOT185 |	No way will I buy one
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:32,800	| IOT185 |	Not
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,640	| IOT185 |	So outside
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:37,408	| IOT185 |	Crazy
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,432	| IOT185 |	Facebook screens
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:40,480	| IOT185 |	I am going to tell you about the number
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:41,248	| IOT185 |	The Enquirer
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:43,808	| IOT185 |	Redible number of screens I saw at
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:48,160	| IOT185 |	The smart Kitchen Summit so every year since don't need screens
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:50,208	| IOT185 |	Like your kitchen
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:52,256	| IOT185 |	Could actually end up with more screens than
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:56,096	| IOT185 |	Like an editing any other room in the house
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,376	| IOT185 |	So
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:30:00,192	| IOT185 |	This Is It event this is the fourth year that this event happen
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,728	| IOT185 |	And I love going to it because
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:03,264	| IOT185 |	But you know I love to cook I love song
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:08,640	| IOT185 |	And food there is always food there delicious food I actually ate
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,920	| IOT185 |	3D printed
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:11,200	| IOT185 |	Dragon fruit
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:12,480	| IOT185 |	Juice
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:14,272	| IOT185 |	How do I go
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:17,856	| IOT185 |	Juicy gummy I don't even know it was 3D printed liquids which was
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:18,880	| IOT185 |	Bonkers
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:21,184	| IOT185 |	You are not going to buy this
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:25,792	| IOT185 |	3D printed beef jerky
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:26,816	| IOT185 |	No that's not a liquid
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,096	| IOT185 |	Time
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:29,888	| IOT185 |	Sprite imagine 3D printed
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:30,400	| IOT185 |	Sprite YouTube
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,960	| IOT185 |	Okay we're not talking about that
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:34,496	| IOT185 |	Weird thing about screens everywhere
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:37,056	| IOT185 |	So I saw a smart
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:37,824	| IOT185 |	Cookshop
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:38,592	| IOT185 |	Where
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:39,360	| IOT185 |	It was a cooktop
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:40,640	| IOT185 |	Glass kind of
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:42,176	| IOT185 |	Cooktop induction
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:43,200	| IOT185 |	Kitchen range I'm assuming
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,480	| IOT185 |	And it had a TV in it
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:46,528	| IOT185 |	So like why you were cooking you can look down and
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:49,856	| IOT185 |	Things happen it was actually also a touchscreen which
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:52,160	| IOT185 |	I'm just going to go out on a limb here and say
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:55,488	| IOT185 |	Maybe not a great idea to combine your cooktop and range
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:56,256	| IOT185 |	Everything
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:57,536	| IOT185 |	Together in a touch screen
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:02,144	| IOT185 |	It happened no but I could see watching you know afternoon cooking shows
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:05,472	| IOT185 |	The next following along cooking right there and just doing what they're doing
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:06,496	| IOT185 |	Just avoiding
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:08,800	| IOT185 |	Yes
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:09,568	| IOT185 |	Yes
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:13,664	| IOT185 |	So that is one place where you might one day or you have the option where you could have asked
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:18,272	| IOT185 |	The other is if you look up from your cooktop you'll have a vent
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:19,808	| IOT185 |	Right most homes have event
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:21,344	| IOT185 |	Range hood range hood
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:22,368	| IOT185 |	Also
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:23,904	| IOT185 |	GE was showing off
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:26,208	| IOT185 |	This was a huge scream like
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:27,232	| IOT185 |	Like 20 in
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:28,512	| IOT185 |	It was very large
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:30,048	| IOT185 |	Cover the whole range hood
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:32,608	| IOT185 |	And the range hood had a camera in so you
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:33,376	| IOT185 |	Gazebo
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:38,752	| IOT185 |	Had a camera on the top of the thing so it could like look at you and get
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:42,848	| IOT185 |	Your kitchen view but it also had a camera underneath the range hood also
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:43,616	| IOT185 |	Got whatever you
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:50,016	| IOT185 |	You're cooking and it was it had the full internet they were showing but I thought that was really interesting mostly it was
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,552	| IOT185 |	Is an Android Base thing so there was
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:52,320	| IOT185 |	Google Duo
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:56,160	| IOT185 |	Calling my mom on Duo and being like Mom is this Austin yet
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:57,696	| IOT185 |	What consistency
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:31:58,976	| IOT185 |	That would be really
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:02,560	| IOT185 |	I could see something similar used in restaurants
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:05,120	| IOT185 |	Yeah between the cokes in the head
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:08,192	| IOT185 |	Jefferson and maybe the head waiter Etc
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:13,056	| IOT185 |	Yeah if you could get actually some AI in there and be like hey there's plenty of sear on that steak flip it
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:14,592	| IOT185 |	You know friends that like that could be
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:19,456	| IOT185 |	So that was another screen and then there was the everyone's favorite the refrigerator
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:21,504	| IOT185 |	And then
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:24,320	| IOT185 |	There's all these smart devices I mean
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:28,160	| IOT185 |	The Lenovo tablet and the Echo Show are basically like
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:28,928	| IOT185 |	The kitchen TV
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:30,208	| IOT185 |	My house
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:30,976	| IOT185 |	So
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:33,024	| IOT185 |	Ayo Kevin I felt kind of exhausted by
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,304	| IOT185 |	All the screens
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:36,352	| IOT185 |	Expensive good Lord
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:37,632	| IOT185 |	Sure
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:40,448	| IOT185 |	So that was that was one thing and it would it felt like
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:43,520	| IOT185 |	In this makes sense because then the kitchen voices
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:44,032	| IOT185 |	Awesome
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:45,568	| IOT185 |	Because your hands are there
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:50,176	| IOT185 |	Right you're like oh I can tell things but you're also like if you're going to follow rest beard anything
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:51,456	| IOT185 |	Do I actually want to
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:53,760	| IOT185 |	Yeah I kind of
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:57,088	| IOT185 |	Like the idea of the projector approach
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,880	| IOT185 |	As opposed to this because
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:32:59,904	| IOT185 |	You couldn't
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:06,048	| IOT185 |	Moving navigate with gestures not touch anything you know or you if you did touch like your countertop cuz
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:12,448	| IOT185 |	Maybe the recipe video is being shot on your countertop it's okay that countertops going to get messy anyway I would not want like Grease
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:13,984	| IOT185 |	Busy fingers all over a touchscreen device
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:15,776	| IOT185 |	Yes and
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:19,872	| IOT185 |	I actually asked some people about projection and they were not keen on it
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:21,408	| IOT185 |	I was really bummed about that cuz
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:23,968	| IOT185 |	Bosch actually showed her off at Eva and
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:24,992	| IOT185 |	In the kitchen
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:26,016	| IOT185 |	I actually think
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:27,040	| IOT185 |	Projectors
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:29,600	| IOT185 |	Is a there more economical they don't break as much
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:33,696	| IOT185 |	GE showed off his like little vents to keep the grease off your range hood but
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:34,976	| IOT185 |	Is anyone who's ever
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:37,792	| IOT185 |	Like how to clean the range hood that sucker is like a
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:38,304	| IOT185 |	The Greaseman
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:40,096	| IOT185 |	I want a camera or
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:41,376	| IOT185 |	Beautiful screen there
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:47,520	| IOT185 |	No I would love to see somebody basically create a projector for almost like a can light and overhead light
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:49,312	| IOT185 |	For my kitchen island for example
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:51,872	| IOT185 |	Yeah or just even I mean
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:54,176	| IOT185 |	There are many projectors that you could just
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:56,224	| IOT185 |	Pop on the top of a
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:59,040	| IOT185 |	Girl for a couple or like a Madam a speaker
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:33:59,552	| IOT185 |	Pitztal
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:02,624	| IOT185 |	But yeah we'll see so that was
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:05,440	| IOT185 |	Kind of the big takeaway they also had Wireless
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:05,952	| IOT185 |	Power
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:07,232	| IOT185 |	Howard
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,256	| IOT185 |	Counters item
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:13,632	| IOT185 |	We've got of Wireless power standard
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:14,400	| IOT185 |	Finally it's
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:14,912	| IOT185 |	The cheese stands
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:18,496	| IOT185 |	It's the same standard we use you know to charge our phones
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,264	| IOT185 |	Now
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:24,384	| IOT185 |	They're doing a high-powered version of that standard to power things like blenders or food processors
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:25,664	| IOT185 |	Or I don't know
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:27,456	| IOT185 |	Coffee grinders whatever
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:27,968	| IOT185 |	Kitchen appliance
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:29,504	| IOT185 |	George Foreman grills
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:32,832	| IOT185 |	So what they're showing off is
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:34,112	| IOT185 |	This bills into account
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:38,976	| IOT185 |	And it is kind of neat cuz they'll just they had a special Phillips and higher are making
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:40,768	| IOT185 |	Appliances for this right now
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:42,560	| IOT185 |	They just pulled out like a Phillips
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:44,096	| IOT185 |	Chopper
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:45,632	| IOT185 |	Stuck it on there.
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,448	| IOT185 |	Ezra like whoa
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:51,008	| IOT185 |	Record
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:51,776	| IOT185 |	Nopor
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:52,800	| IOT185 |	Look model cord
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:54,848	| IOT185 |	So that actually was
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:58,944	| IOT185 |	Kennedy I would like that basically your whole food prep
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:03,040	| IOT185 |	Space can also be up top you know you're not limits very specific cook
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:03,808	| IOT185 |	Spots
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:05,344	| IOT185 |	So wake me I haven't even told people
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,392	| IOT185 |	Oh no they have that
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:08,928	| IOT185 |	So they have that
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:09,952	| IOT185 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:11,232	| IOT185 |	So I want that again
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:13,792	| IOT185 |	Wireless charging is induction which
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:14,816	| IOT185 |	Anyone who's like
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:16,864	| IOT185 |	Better high-end kitchen induction
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:17,376	| IOT185 |	Pop song
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:18,656	| IOT185 |	All the rage
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:20,192	| IOT185 |	You do need a special pan
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:21,728	| IOT185 |	So they done two things
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:26,848	| IOT185 |	In the future it would be possible with the right kind of counter-service and pan
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:28,640	| IOT185 |	Actually just put
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:29,664	| IOT185 |	Pain on the couch
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:30,432	| IOT185 |	Countertop
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:31,200	| IOT185 |	It would heat up
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:32,480	| IOT185 |	You could just
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:33,248	| IOT185 |	On your counter
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:35,296	| IOT185 |	What they're showing off now
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,320	| IOT185 |	Is a
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:37,600	| IOT185 |	It's like a coaster looking devices
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:39,136	| IOT185 |	1 inch thick device
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:40,672	| IOT185 |	And it has the
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:43,488	| IOT185 |	The circle on it so you know where to put your pan
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:47,840	| IOT185 |	But yeah so you just popped out anywhere on your counter where it has this
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:48,608	| IOT185 |	Higher
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:49,120	| IOT185 |	Wattage
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:50,656	| IOT185 |	Power Inn
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:51,680	| IOT185 |	You can cook
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:52,704	| IOT185 |	Crazy
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:54,240	| IOT185 |	It's bananas
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:57,312	| IOT185 |	So I was kind of keen on this I thought it was neat
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:58,080	| IOT185 |	I don't
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:35:59,360	| IOT185 |	See it happening
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:05,248	| IOT185 |	For another five or six having the standards not even be finalized till the middle of next year but
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:06,528	| IOT185 |	I'll keep an eye on that
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:11,904	| IOT185 |	Considering how long it's taking the QI standard to evolve and become the de facto
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:14,464	| IOT185 |	Which is you were talking at least 10 years
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:16,768	| IOT185 |	But I would agree with you would probably a half a decade outfit
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,560	| IOT185 |	Real accommodations here
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:22,400	| IOT185 |	Which is a bummer alright a couple other things I saw there that were
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:22,912	| IOT185 |	Worth mention
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:24,192	| IOT185 |	1
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:25,728	| IOT185 |	You're going to see this in the newsletter youku
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:26,496	| IOT185 |	Daiso
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:28,288	| IOT185 |	Sign up for the newsletter if you don't but
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,568	| IOT185 |	Thought of you asked me about this
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:30,336	| IOT185 |	Robot
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:31,616	| IOT185 |	Cooking device called the rotimatic
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:33,664	| IOT185 |	It makes Roshes
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,176	| IOT185 |	Switches a
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,968	| IOT185 |	South Asian flatbread
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:37,760	| IOT185 |	And it also makes tortillas
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:39,296	| IOT185 |	Or pizza dough
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,320	| IOT185 |	So this is a
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:42,112	| IOT185 |	This is a $1,000 real
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:44,672	| IOT185 |	That sits in your kitchen
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,696	| IOT185 |	It's fairly large
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:47,232	| IOT185 |	Yeah it's pretty large
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:49,280	| IOT185 |	But you just put all the ingredients on topping
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:52,096	| IOT185 |	Mix a little ball of dough
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:54,400	| IOT185 |	Bruise around a whole bunch in it
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:56,704	| IOT185 |	Makes it go down into this cavity and
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:57,472	| IOT185 |	Squishies at Platt
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:58,496	| IOT185 |	And then
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:01,824	| IOT185 |	Cough up which is important rotis
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:02,592	| IOT185 |	And then it
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:03,360	| IOT185 |	Fix it
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:04,128	| IOT185 |	And
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:06,432	| IOT185 |	Slide it out like a printer fits like a printer tray
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:08,736	| IOT185 |	Your life
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:10,528	| IOT185 |	Down the chute
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:11,808	| IOT185 |	Set out of paper
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:12,832	| IOT185 |	Richie gym
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:13,856	| IOT185 |	Roti Jam
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:15,136	| IOT185 |	So I would say
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:16,416	| IOT185 |	They sold forty
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:22,560	| IOT185 |	I know and they don't even sell it in India they sell it only in the US UK and
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:23,072	| IOT185 |	Arts of Asia
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:27,424	| IOT185 |	Yeah check that out because the video is
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:29,728	| IOT185 |	Pretty freaking phenomenal and the companies
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:31,776	| IOT185 |	Been doing this a long time it took a lot after
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:33,568	| IOT185 |	And then
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:35,104	| IOT185 |	The June oven Kevin's in my favorite
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:42,528	| IOT185 |	Damn didn't update the ties them into Whole Foods all of a sudden to the Whole Foods right now and you're doing oven which might be
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:43,040	| IOT185 |	President marketing
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:44,064	| IOT185 |	Decide
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:45,856	| IOT185 |	But it will bake
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:51,232	| IOT185 |	The 365 brand pizzas there's some sweet potato Puffs there's all kinds of things
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:52,256	| IOT185 |	That you can just
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:53,536	| IOT185 |	Click the button and it automatically has
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:54,816	| IOT185 |	Settings
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:38:00,192	| IOT185 |	I eat it's a little clunky cuz it's kind of a long list you go through I don't know how automated
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:04,800	| IOT185 |	This could be I mean if I'd be better if you could scan a barcode or if it actually recognized the things but
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:08,384	| IOT185 |	How would it know that it's a 365 brand of frozen pizza one
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:13,248	| IOT185 |	So yeah barcode scanning I guess I don't know
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:14,016	| IOT185 |	Will they don't have
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:14,528	| IOT185 |	Have a way to scan the
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:18,624	| IOT185 |	I don't even
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:24,256	| IOT185 |	On my watch I have it on my phone
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:31,936	| IOT185 |	You're not here but I like to know who's doing what in my house when I'm not there I'll be out running at night and all of a sudden so many fires at the junior like
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:33,216	| IOT185 |	Really see it on my watch
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:36,288	| IOT185 |	Who's making a cake in there
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:36,800	| IOT185 |	Hey
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:41,920	| IOT185 |	Sometimes they make stuff and I come home and everything's cleaned up in the food is like missing gone like
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:42,688	| IOT185 |	I didn't get any
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:45,248	| IOT185 |	Yeah I got got to keep an eye on that
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:46,528	| IOT185 |	COK
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,064	| IOT185 |	Yes June
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:48,832	| IOT185 |	The oven for
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:49,856	| IOT185 |	Controlling parents everywhere
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:56,512	| IOT185 |	All right so those were two things I saw there that were pretty cool I also ate food from the Brava oven it is another
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:58,304	| IOT185 |	Late
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:38:59,840	| IOT185 |	Crazy eye color
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:02,400	| IOT185 |	So no heat
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:03,424	| IOT185 |	Comes off of it
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:04,448	| IOT185 |	You know the light is
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:09,056	| IOT185 |	Do not know I get that yes but like
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:14,432	| IOT185 |	When were using our June oven like you can feel some heat it's pretty well insulated but you can still feel some heat
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:15,200	| IOT185 |	I just wonder if
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:17,504	| IOT185 |	It's any different from an outside
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:18,016	| IOT185 |	Experience
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:20,320	| IOT185 |	Oh I didn't touch the oven
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:21,856	| IOT185 |	So I don't know I'm so
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:23,136	| IOT185 |	That is okay
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:26,208	| IOT185 |	I texted you know that I'm good you nice
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:29,536	| IOT185 |	Okay we're going to move right along for a minute
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:31,328	| IOT185 |	Caressing his oven
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:32,352	| IOT185 |	2
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:34,400	| IOT185 |	A story in the New York Times
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:35,680	| IOT185 |	Which is a column
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:36,704	| IOT185 |	By Farhad manjoo
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:37,984	| IOT185 |	About
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:38,752	| IOT185 |	The iot
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:39,776	| IOT185 |	And
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:41,568	| IOT185 |	I took away two things for this
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:42,848	| IOT185 |	1
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:43,616	| IOT185 |	I felt like
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:45,408	| IOT185 |	He is a good barometer of where
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:45,920	| IOT185 |	The rest of the
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:50,528	| IOT185 |	Yes right and I was kind of surprised that people were like just coming around to the fact that
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:52,064	| IOT185 |	People want to come put
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:52,832	| IOT185 |	Computer center
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:53,600	| IOT185 |	Everything internet
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:55,392	| IOT185 |	Go to the Internet cuz I feel like we've been talking about that
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:40:00,256	| IOT185 |	We have but we're nitzsche friends
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:03,328	| IOT185 |	There is a radical technologists in that regard
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:07,936	| IOT185 |	Wow I've never been in The Fringe radical Technologies category I feel like
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:09,472	| IOT185 |	But
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:09,984	| IOT185 |	Finally
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:11,264	| IOT185 |	I guess
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:13,056	| IOT185 |	He's talking to people about
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:17,152	| IOT185 |	Privacy and security and so he talked to Bruce
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:18,176	| IOT185 |	Schneier who
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:19,200	| IOT185 |	You know every year
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:24,832	| IOT185 |	We don't we get some mainstream publication talking to him and realizing that this is a really bad idea to
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:28,672	| IOT185 |	To put computers and everything and connected to the internet without any sort of
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:31,232	| IOT185 |	So I'm hopeful
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:34,304	| IOT185 |	In light of the Privacy hearings that are going on now
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:36,864	| IOT185 |	And in light of this particular
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:38,400	| IOT185 |	Column that we might
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:39,168	| IOT185 |	Almost
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:42,240	| IOT185 |	Be to the point where we can get some privacy and some
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:45,568	| IOT185 |	Cyber security standards around connected devices
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:46,592	| IOT185 |	That are legit
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:48,896	| IOT185 |	Especially since California
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:50,176	| IOT185 |	Did just pass their law
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,968	| IOT185 |	So I don't know what do you think Kevin
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:59,136	| IOT185 |	Yeah I mean in an ideal world and I know this is going to happen but in an Ideal World all the big companies involved here
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:40:59,904	| IOT185 |	Are we get together
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:01,696	| IOT185 |	And say we need to work on the
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:02,464	| IOT185 |	Together
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:03,488	| IOT185 |	Because it's a problem
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:05,280	| IOT185 |	For all of us the issue there is
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:08,864	| IOT185 |	They want the data of course so they want if they don't
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:10,656	| IOT185 |	Necessarily want all these
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:12,704	| IOT185 |	Regulations and controls in place
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:17,312	| IOT185 |	But again in an Ideal World I would like to see them do this as opposed to what
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:20,128	| IOT185 |	Expect will happen if the government
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:21,664	| IOT185 |	What governments will try and do this
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:23,456	| IOT185 |	And they will do it
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:25,760	| IOT185 |	Probably wrong and they won't take too long to do it
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:29,088	| IOT185 |	So I'm actually worried that the government will work with these guys
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:31,136	| IOT185 |	And they will do two things one
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:33,952	| IOT185 |	They will just Outsource the writing of this legislation.
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:36,256	| IOT185 |	Facebook and Google and Amazon

EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:39,840	| IOT185 |	Not much as
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:46,496	| IOT185 |	And I'm worried that they'll leave out like whole swathes of Industry where data is being collected
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:48,544	| IOT185 |	And used in ways that are
EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:49,824	| IOT185 |	A little disconcerting
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:50,848	| IOT185 |	So do you know

EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:40,415	| IOT185 |	I guess rhinestone
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:41,695	| IOT185 |	Murrieta California
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:44,255	| IOT185 |	In addition to Smart doorbell
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:45,023	| IOT185 |	I'd like to add
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:45,791	| IOT185 |	Alzheimer's
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:49,119	| IOT185 |	Health Access to power outlets isn't going
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:53,727	| IOT185 |	Shout out those cameras
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:54,751	| IOT185 |	Inside the home
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:57,823	| IOT185 |	Any products that could help converts a light socket
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:00,127	| IOT185 |	Thank you for the show
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:04,479	| IOT185 |	Orion this is a really good question and it's also
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:06,271	| IOT185 |	It's mostly good cuz it's really easy to answer
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:09,087	| IOT185 |	On the security front
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:10,623	| IOT185 |	Security camera front
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:12,927	| IOT185 |	There are the Arlo cameras which you can
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:15,231	| IOT185 |	Purchase and there are two versions
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:16,767	| IOT185 |	About more than
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:19,839	| IOT185 |	Persian chicken be looking for the wire free ones
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:21,375	| IOT185 |	And they haven't
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:24,959	| IOT185 |	Cheaper one that is battery powered I'm not going to recommend you go with that
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:27,519	| IOT185 |	I recommend you go with the more expensive one
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:28,543	| IOT185 |	That has a ring
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:29,311	| IOT185 |	Rechargeable battery
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:32,639	| IOT185 |	And the reason why is because the batteries on this thing run out like
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:35,967	| IOT185 |	But there
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:37,247	| IOT185 |	Good cameras there weather
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:38,527	| IOT185 |	Weathersafe
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:39,295	| IOT185 |	There
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:41,343	| IOT185 |	I don't know what else to say about them
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:43,647	| IOT185 |	If you don't want to do that and
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:44,927	| IOT185 |	You want to stay in the same ecosystem
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:48,767	| IOT185 |	My advice to you is going to be ring because they have their stick up cams
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:51,071	| IOT185 |	That they have wireless ones
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:52,863	| IOT185 |	But they also have a doorbell
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:56,191	| IOT185 |	The two doorbells actually the older model and then a newer model
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:58,239	| IOT185 |	That is battery powered so
EDL	00:44:58,239	00:44:59,519	| IOT185 |	You don't have to actually
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:00,031	| IOT185 |	Wire it
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:07,199	| IOT185 |	Raise the video doorbell the old one is $99 and the new video doorbell 2 is 199
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:09,503	| IOT185 |	That has a quick-release battery which is nice
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:10,015	| IOT185 |	Yes
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:13,599	| IOT185 |	I do like those quick-release batteries and you can buy extra batteries in
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:16,159	| IOT185 |	Just leave them charging and just swap them out
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:17,183	| IOT185 |	Which is what I think peep
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:18,719	| IOT185 |	So
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:23,071	| IOT185 |	Those are your two like those are the two most pet adoptions I've tried all of
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:24,095	| IOT185 |	That you're in
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:25,119	| IOT185 |	It's pretty good
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:28,191	| IOT185 |	Weather pretty good it's really good that means the ring is quality doorbell
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:31,007	| IOT185 |	So if you have a front door that
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:32,287	| IOT185 |	Get some sunlight
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:35,871	| IOT185 |	Ring even sells a solar trickle charger for the video doorbell 2
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:37,663	| IOT185 |	Hell yeah and for the cameras
EDL	00:45:38,687	00:45:41,503	| IOT185 |	Oh yes I forgot about that solar panel
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:42,783	| IOT185 |	I had that in my
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:44,319	| IOT185 |	Part of my review kit but I never tried it
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:46,367	| IOT185 |	Cuz yeah it's $50
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:49,695	| IOT185 |	To add that it kind of fits around the entire base of the
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:53,023	| IOT185 |	Video doorbell 2 and then there's a little solar panels on the top of it
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:57,119	| IOT185 |	So there you go so good options for you Ryan or anybody else who's looking
EDL	00:45:57,119	00:45:57,887	| IOT185 |	Looking for
EDL	00:45:57,887	00:45:58,399	| IOT185 |	Wireless
EDL	00:45:59,167	00:46:00,191	| IOT185 |	Cameras outside your house
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:01,215	| IOT185 |	N wireless store
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:05,823	| IOT185 |	And we actually do get that question for a little time because a lot of people don't have
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:10,687	| IOT185 |	Power to run for these or maybe there's no Outlet nearby or you don't want to have
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:11,967	| IOT185 |	Chord
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:13,759	| IOT185 |	Yeah right next to your front door for example
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:16,831	| IOT185 |	Text your doorbell or camera whatever it is so
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:19,647	| IOT185 |	It's a great question and we do get this one a lot I will say
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:21,439	| IOT185 |	This is important for your wireless
EDL	00:46:22,463	00:46:23,743	| IOT185 |	It might be thrilling
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:27,583	| IOT185 |	To be like oh my God I could totally stick this up in a tree or someplace crazy
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:29,375	| IOT185 |	Which is actually what I did with
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:30,399	| IOT185 |	My first Arlo
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:32,703	| IOT185 |	And then when the batteries ran out after like a month
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:33,215	| IOT185 |	And a half I was
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:39,103	| IOT185 |	So consider access to batteries
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:39,871	| IOT185 |	When you're placing
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:41,407	| IOT185 |	That's my
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:42,175	| IOT185 |	Big word of advice
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:43,711	| IOT185 |	Okay
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:44,479	| IOT185 |	Kevin
