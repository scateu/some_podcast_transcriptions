EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:50,080	| IOT187 |	Hey Kevin
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:51,104	| IOT187 |	I'm sick
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:51,616	| IOT187 |	Today so
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:53,920	| IOT187 |	What's going to happen on this show
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:54,688	| IOT187 |	Feels like
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:55,712	| IOT187 |	Anything Could Happen
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:56,736	| IOT187 |	But
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,016	| IOT187 |	Shake It Off
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:59,040	| IOT187 |	With North
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:00,832	| IOT187 |	This was surprising this
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:02,880	| IOT187 |	Happened super fast we talked
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:03,904	| IOT187 |	I believe last week
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:04,672	| IOT187 |	Weak about the maker
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:08,512	| IOT187 |	The myo armband which was a gesture-based armband
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:09,792	| IOT187 |	Deciding to
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:10,304	| IOT187 |	To kill that
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:11,328	| IOT187 |	And
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:14,144	| IOT187 |	Start something new but we had no idea what the new thing is
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:15,936	| IOT187 |	And now we do
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:17,472	| IOT187 |	The company that made the Maya
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:18,752	| IOT187 |	Armband
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:21,568	| IOT187 |	What has changed its name it is now known as
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:22,080	| IOT187 |	North
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,360	| IOT187 |	Which kind of makes sense
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:26,432	| IOT187 |	Canada and it now has launched a new Prada
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:27,712	| IOT187 |	Cold vocals
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:28,992	| IOT187 |	And Kevin
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,016	| IOT187 |	What are Focus
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:36,416	| IOT187 |	Coco's are glasses coming from North and this is good because now they have three more pivot Points if they want to change the
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,208	| IOT187 |	Secondary name is east south or west
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:39,744	| IOT187 |	If this doesn't work out
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:40,512	| IOT187 |	Vocals
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,792	| IOT187 |	Air smart glasses
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:46,656	| IOT187 |	They're not cheap at $999 you will be able to get them in
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,424	| IOT187 |	A North
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:50,496	| IOT187 |	Store they're building one in Brooklyn New York
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:53,056	| IOT187 |	Right now
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:54,848	| IOT187 |	Of course they are
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:59,712	| IOT187 |	So soon you'll be able to go to Brooklyn and get measured up because you do have to get
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:02,272	| IOT187 |	Connect scan your head has to be scanned for proper
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:05,856	| IOT187 |	What's different about these glasses say then
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,392	| IOT187 |	Google Glass for example
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:11,232	| IOT187 |	But I still have don't use them there's no camera here or anything like that
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,512	| IOT187 |	These look like
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:15,584	| IOT187 |	What they look like the glasses that I wear today just kind of
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:19,424	| IOT187 |	Hipster looking glasses and to the right side
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:21,472	| IOT187 |	Of glasses hidden from anybody
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:24,032	| IOT187 |	Who's looking at you is a small projector
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:27,360	| IOT187 |	And what the projector does is it bounces information
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,384	| IOT187 |	Off of
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:31,968	| IOT187 |	A spot on the lens right onto your retina
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:35,296	| IOT187 |	Like fun and that's this is not the first product
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:41,440	| IOT187 |	To do that I forget who maybe it's Intel has a similar technology until does they started a smart classes
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:42,720	| IOT187 |	Unit called vaunt
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:44,000	| IOT187 |	And then promptly shut it down
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:48,096	| IOT187 |	Oh I was going to say perhaps North is using the until technology but
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:50,144	| IOT187 |	Qualcomm Tech
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:56,032	| IOT187 |	Really interesting all right so what can you do with these things for a thousand bucks
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:04:01,920	| IOT187 |	Honestly you can't do much but you can get some information which I think is actually a good thing
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:07,808	| IOT187 |	I'm all about context give me the right information in the right place at the right time and making it so that it's not
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:08,576	| IOT187 |	Disruptive
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:13,184	| IOT187 |	So if I'm having a conversation I don't want to be like look at my phone every five seconds from new information
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:15,232	| IOT187 |	You don't have to do with vocals
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:17,024	| IOT187 |	300 by 300 pixels
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:21,119	| IOT187 |	Viewing area is 15 degree viewing area
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,143	| IOT187 |	And
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:24,191	| IOT187 |	You can view messages you
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:29,567	| IOT187 |	Can send automated responses to messages you can call an Uber you can also get Turnpike
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:35,967	| IOT187 |	Turn directions to your calendar check the weather and I presume more functionality will come to these but the point is
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:36,735	| IOT187 |	These are not
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,527	| IOT187 |	Highly intensive things
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:40,831	| IOT187 |	That is giving you or letting you do
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,367	| IOT187 |	What I thought was really cool
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,159	| IOT187 |	Because I'm crazy
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:50,303	| IOT187 |	Is you can actually see information like a text or get your turn by turn directions but you can also then talk to
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,607	| IOT187 |	And say
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,143	| IOT187 |	Respond to Charlie
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:54,911	| IOT187 |	You know and
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:55,935	| IOT187 |	Charlie I'm running late
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,983	| IOT187 |	So I actually thought that was
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,775	| IOT187 |	Not only are you getting basically at
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:01,311	| IOT187 |	Tiny personalized screen
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,847	| IOT187 |	You can also interact
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:06,175	| IOT187 |	Yes I was actually surprised to see
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:08,991	| IOT187 |	The matinee integration quite honestly and I think
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:14,623	| IOT187 |	It's really smart rather than North creating their whole own special interface or
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:16,927	| IOT187 |	Assistant or anything like that it just makes sense
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:19,487	| IOT187 |	To integrate with something that's good and already exist
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:22,559	| IOT187 |	I thought you were going to say that you were really intrigued by the little
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:25,375	| IOT187 |	Accessory that comes with it did you see the loop
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,655	| IOT187 |	I did not know I did
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,679	| IOT187 |	Machida Loop yes that is
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:33,823	| IOT187 |	Yes Loop is I got plastic ring with a joystick button looks like a regular smart ring they might
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,591	| IOT187 |	Benefind
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,615	| IOT187 |	It may be from
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:37,919	| IOT187 |	Motive or somebody like that yes motive
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:44,319	| IOT187 |	We just added an NFC authentication chip to theirs but that's only the story you can use the little joystick on the rink s wipes
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:49,183	| IOT187 |	Through the interface on your classes so it's not like you have to again with Google Glass sound like you have to
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,975	| IOT187 |	Touch the glasses to do anything
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:57,375	| IOT187 |	You know I had to cancel a swipe the side of my head and I think I put a dent in my hairline there by doing that so much so
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:01,471	| IOT187 |	This is really really cool matinee integration also makes sense for another reason
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:06,335	| IOT187 |	Amazon actually was a lead investor in the series B funding for North
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,359	| IOT187 |	Yes
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:16,575	| IOT187 |	These look pretty interesting to me I don't have $1,000 to get this I don't think I
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:22,975	| IOT187 |	1% and its current state because I wear Smartwatch and not generally does the same stuff plus more but I'll
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:26,559	| IOT187 |	Lakers are going and I would do it if they had so here's
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,863	| IOT187 |	A lot of people are like oh got $1,000
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:29,631	| IOT187 |	That's crazy for glasses
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:32,703	| IOT187 |	I'm going to out myself right now I don't buy a lot of
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:35,007	| IOT187 |	Jewelry but I do spend a crazy amount of
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,055	| IOT187 |	Glasses
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:39,359	| IOT187 |	Because I love like really unique and
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,407	| IOT187 |	Frames and sometimes those are
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:42,175	| IOT187 |	More expensive
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:42,943	| IOT187 |	So
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,735	| IOT187 |	Well I have spent $1,000 on a
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,271	| IOT187 |	Pair of frames
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,807	| IOT187 |	Are my glasses they look awesome
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,087	| IOT187 |	They have actually
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,111	| IOT187 |	Are big sunglasses that have
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:52,159	| IOT187 |	Swarovski crystals in them it's
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,439	| IOT187 |	But
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:56,767	| IOT187 |	These are not those glasses these do not look as cool as I would want them
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:59,071	| IOT187 |	$1,000 so that's just me
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,655	| IOT187 |	And I think that's because they want to appeal to a wide audience
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:07,007	| IOT187 |	You know these are pretty generic looking hipster doofus glasses like eyewear
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,543	| IOT187 |	I like that there hipster doofus glass
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,079	| IOT187 |	I like that
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:10,847	| IOT187 |	All right
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:14,943	| IOT187 |	Is another reason real quick just that I could not get these even if I wanted to
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:16,479	| IOT187 |	Did you obviously work with
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,015	| IOT187 |	Prescription lenses if you want
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:19,039	| IOT187 |	But
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:22,367	| IOT187 |	They don't work with bifocals which I have progressive lenses so that
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:24,159	| IOT187 |	That might work okay with these
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:24,927	| IOT187 |	However
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:28,767	| IOT187 |	They can only handle prescriptions between + 2 and -4 diopters
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:31,583	| IOT187 |	And I'm well beyond that both eyes unfortunately so
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:32,607	| IOT187 |	It's not even an option for me
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,399	| IOT187 |	So it's not for old or blind
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,447	| IOT187 |	Got it did you just call me old
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:38,239	| IOT187 |	Weird lines and line
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:42,847	| IOT187 |	Are you being right
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:45,663	| IOT187 |	I'm like hey I might have bifocal soon to
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,711	| IOT187 |	Or actually I'm getting progressive lenses for
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,479	| IOT187 |	For the first time
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:52,319	| IOT187 |	Good luck getting used to that the first days
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,087	| IOT187 |	Might make you nauseous
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,135	| IOT187 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:55,903	| IOT187 |	So
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,927	| IOT187 |	Related
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:08:00,255	| IOT187 |	But not exactly so we mentioned the Qualcomm chips are in these glass
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:05,375	| IOT187 |	These are not the chips that are in there but Qualcomm has launched a brand-new reference design
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,143	| IOT187 |	And for smart audio
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,447	| IOT187 |	And this is worth noting
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:13,311	| IOT187 |	Cuz I really think we're getting to this point where we're going to have that interface from her
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:14,847	| IOT187 |	Write the movie her where you
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:20,223	| IOT187 |	You're like you got your phone in your pocket and it's super smart but you also have a relatively smart headset
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:22,015	| IOT187 |	TED talks to you when you interact with
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,783	| IOT187 |	Actually
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:25,087	| IOT187 |	I feel like I just saw an ad for this for some
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,111	| IOT187 |	Other madam
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:26,623	| IOT187 |	A powered headset
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,927	| IOT187 |	So what county is created
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:34,559	| IOT187 |	Reference design for its qcc5100
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,607	| IOT187 |	Series Bluetooth audio chip
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,399	| IOT187 |	Yay
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:40,191	| IOT187 |	Is for Android phones obviously
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,727	| IOT187 |	You put the
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:44,543	| IOT187 |	Anime app on the phone and you pair to these earbuds
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,847	| IOT187 |	And you toggle mantle made with a simple push of the bike
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:50,431	| IOT187 |	And they actually have decent quality
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:54,783	| IOT187 |	Features for music listening as well so they're going to active noise-cancellation they use the
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,063	| IOT187 |	Qualcomm app
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:09:02,463	| IOT187 |	X codec for high definition audio and qualcomm's true wireless stereo I'm not saying that thing better than
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:05,279	| IOT187 |	What those are so many rappers use but
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,047	| IOT187 |	Now these are not just
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:08,863	| IOT187 |	An assistant in your ear not just a hero
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,679	| IOT187 |	They don't actually have the hair bow
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,191	| IOT187 |	Functions
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:14,239	| IOT187 |	But maybe we'll get
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:15,775	| IOT187 |	It's so much computing
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:21,407	| IOT187 |	It's funny you mention that her movie cuz I've seen it probably 20 times I love it
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:24,991	| IOT187 |	Do you know that I cannot get my wife and daughter to watch it cuz I think it's
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,271	| IOT187 |	Creepy
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,551	| IOT187 |	They will not watch that movie
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:28,831	| IOT187 |	Huh
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,879	| IOT187 |	If I will not watch The Haunting of Hill House
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:35,999	| IOT187 |	But who neither would I but that's creepy on purpose this is their interpretation of her is creepy
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:38,815	| IOT187 |	They probably see the p
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,887	| IOT187 |	I bought those pants
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,167	| IOT187 |	MLB him for Halloween
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,959	| IOT187 |	No I'm kidding about that but
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:48,031	| IOT187 |	I'm worried because we're going to this he Robles
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,311	| IOT187 |	Future and
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:50,847	| IOT187 |	You have to accept it
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,663	| IOT187 |	It better get on board
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,431	| IOT187 |	Hassan Whiteside
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,967	| IOT187 |	We're going to talk about something
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,247	| IOT187 |	Along those lines out of
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,039	| IOT187 |	Remember creepy
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:00,319	| IOT187 |	But now
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:01,599	| IOT187 |	Glucagon
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:02,879	| IOT187 |	Well maybe not I don't
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:05,183	| IOT187 |	The Google home hub reviews are out
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,207	| IOT187 |	And
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:07,487	| IOT187 |	People think
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,047	| IOT187 |	Yeah and
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,327	| IOT187 |	I read all reviews
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:15,167	| IOT187 |	They're obviously the devices cheaper so that's a plus
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:21,567	| IOT187 |	But you get a better experience on the larger smart display as in general yes they cost more so you're paying for the
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:27,967	| IOT187 |	The sound quality on the Google home hub is not up to par with those as well and you know I
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,735	| IOT187 |	Still
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:35,135	| IOT187 |	I don't know I just can't get over the size of it. You know what listen it's not for me and that's fine there plenty of other people who are fine with
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:37,695	| IOT187 |	With a little home interface and a photo frame
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:43,839	| IOT187 |	That 7 inch screen no problem I just like the additional feature of a bigger screen for my YouTube TV and videos and
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,887	| IOT187 |	They're totally fair
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:47,167	| IOT187 |	But a photo frame
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:49,983	| IOT187 |	Right now is about 79 to a hundred bucks so
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:55,103	| IOT187 |	You could send people like your Kik pictures and get this for like a family member if you thought
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,407	| IOT187 |	It doesn't have a camera so it's
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:57,919	| IOT187 |	It's kind of creepy
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:03,295	| IOT187 |	What it does actually take Duo calls that I just found this out the other day
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:09,439	| IOT187 |	I thought you couldn't use Google Duo on this because it did not have a camera Google says it supports Duo calls
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,463	| IOT187 |	Better voice only
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,231	| IOT187 |	Oh
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,791	| IOT187 |	Yeah so this actually might be great for like
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,303	| IOT187 |	A grandparent
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,119	| IOT187 |	Yeah it is
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:20,191	| IOT187 |	People won't be able to see you on the other end of the call but that's okay
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:20,959	| IOT187 |	That might be a bonus
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:25,567	| IOT187 |	It depends my for my friends yes they're probably very happy about
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:29,663	| IOT187 |	All right and Google home hub features have started rolling out to smart.
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,711	| IOT187 |	Displays I have not tested it on mine
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,503	| IOT187 |	It started yesterday I believe
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:36,319	| IOT187 |	And Kevin has not tested on his
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:43,231	| IOT187 |	Well I tried to force the firmware update by resetting the Hub and it didn't do anything so we're talking about it
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:44,767	| IOT187 |	All of the features that Google
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:48,095	| IOT187 |	Demoed on the Google home hub this month at the made by Google event
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:53,983	| IOT187 |	Are trickling down to the other smart displays which makes sense so the Lenovo that you and I have Stacy this marks
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:56,031	| IOT187 |	Display is getting at the JBL is getting it
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:57,567	| IOT187 |	And this will add the
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:00,127	| IOT187 |	Slide down for Europe
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,431	| IOT187 |	Whole-home interface feature
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:08,063	| IOT187 |	To allow you to control things by touch little bit easier which I love that future but and this is another reason why
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:13,183	| IOT187 |	I probably wouldn't get a whole lot because if you're just getting for that feature you're going to get it on the on the better Hardware anyway
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,975	| IOT187 |	Alright well hopefully
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:19,071	| IOT187 |	We will get that soon I will say that I did enable Matt Amaze new whisper mode
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:19,839	| IOT187 |	And
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:20,863	| IOT187 |	It was super easy
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:22,655	| IOT187 |	I just started whispering to her and she said
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,447	| IOT187 |	I think you're whispering to me
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,727	| IOT187 |	Would you like me to Whisper back
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,519	| IOT187 |	Or something along those lines and I said yes
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,799	| IOT187 |	And then poof
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:30,079	| IOT187 |	It happened
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:32,895	| IOT187 |	This is notable one because he was promoted
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,431	| IOT187 |	Pretty useful Batu
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,735	| IOT187 |	I had this whole voice interaction with
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:37,759	| IOT187 |	Metal Mayhem
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,551	| IOT187 |	That's historically somebody
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,575	| IOT187 |	Probably would have done in the app
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:41,855	| IOT187 |	So
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:46,719	| IOT187 |	It's subtle it's great that you can actually enable this by voice it's that's
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,743	| IOT187 |	Smart use of the
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:49,023	| IOT187 |	Microphones
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:50,047	| IOT187 |	Yay
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:54,399	| IOT187 |	If you're listening and you're on the matinee team someone did actually ask us
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:56,703	| IOT187 |	They're like hey I'm hard of hearing is there a way for
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:58,239	| IOT187 |	Recognize my voice
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:13:00,543	| IOT187 |	Which yes there is and when it hears me it
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:01,311	| IOT187 |	It just speaks up
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:01,823	| IOT187 |	A little louder
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:04,895	| IOT187 |	And I cry just for that person
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,687	| IOT187 |	I was like that is a brilliant idea
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:08,479	| IOT187 |	So Madden 18 Folk
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:09,759	| IOT187 |	Or the Google team phone
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,039	| IOT187 |	I'm actually not fussy
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:12,319	| IOT187 |	Go for that
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,343	| IOT187 |	Can you still use case
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:16,159	| IOT187 |	Unless they're whispering and then don't shout really
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,695	| IOT187 |	All right
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,719	| IOT187 |	Let's talk more about Amazon
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:21,535	| IOT187 |	Amazon is pitching immigrations customs
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:22,815	| IOT187 |	Horseman
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:26,399	| IOT187 |	On using its recognition face recognition cloud service
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:26,911	| IOT187 |	2 track
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:28,191	| IOT187 |	Immigration
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,215	| IOT187 |	This is
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:32,031	| IOT187 |	Unsettling it's related to the use of the
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,567	| IOT187 |	Face recognition service
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,103	| IOT187 |	By police officers and now they're just
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,383	| IOT187 |	Ice
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:37,663	| IOT187 |	Which currently
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:40,479	| IOT187 |	It's a super controversial agency
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:40,991	| IOT187 |	4
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,527	| IOT187 |	A lot of reasons
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:44,319	| IOT187 |	We don't get into politics much but
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,111	| IOT187 |	I can say that
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:48,415	| IOT187 |	Isis one of the agencies behind separating
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,463	| IOT187 |	Families from their children at
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:54,303	| IOT187 |	At the border and a lot of people think that's a problem so Microsoft Salesforce and other
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,095	| IOT187 |	Called in
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:56,863	| IOT187 |	2 question
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:57,631	| IOT187 |	4
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:00,191	| IOT187 |	Allowing their technology to be used by this agency in
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:01,727	| IOT187 |	Many people feel is
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:05,311	| IOT187 |	I just can say it's the pursuit of people you shouldn't separate families
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:11,967	| IOT187 |	And just to be clear this is not a done deal yet
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:16,063	| IOT187 |	Yes this has been a pitch and I guess demos
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:18,623	| IOT187 |	Still under consideration so it may not happen
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:21,183	| IOT187 |	Without again getting too deep into the politics
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:22,719	| IOT187 |	I think what we need are
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,487	| IOT187 |	The right
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:25,279	| IOT187 |	Policies in place first
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:27,839	| IOT187 |	And then look at whatever tools are necessary to help
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:29,375	| IOT187 |	Support those policies
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:31,679	| IOT187 |	So I'm not saying I'm all for this painting means
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:34,751	| IOT187 |	But a piano to me this is putting the cart before the horse
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:39,359	| IOT187 |	Basically this is allowing for things like Mass surveillance and when you run
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,639	| IOT187 |	The images through it
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,407	| IOT187 |	It will recognize
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:44,479	| IOT187 |	We don't have any rules
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:44,991	| IOT187 |	About this
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:47,807	| IOT187 |	The and it's not it's also not foolproof
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,087	| IOT187 |	No no it is
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:54,463	| IOT187 |	And you might be recognized as a escaped convict when obviously you are not
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,999	| IOT187 |	And it's worth saying that
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:57,791	| IOT187 |	We are more concerned about
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:58,559	| IOT187 |	Dark people
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:04,703	| IOT187 |	People who are brown people who are black coming in and those are actually the people who these facial recognition algorithms
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:05,727	| IOT187 |	Tabby biggest problem
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,263	| IOT187 |	So
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:10,335	| IOT187 |	Lot of things to think about here most of them
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:11,615	| IOT187 |	Kind of dystopia
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:14,175	| IOT187 |	Send a lock that note
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:16,479	| IOT187 |	Let's talk about privacy in the Internet of Things
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:18,271	| IOT187 |	Because we
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:21,599	| IOT187 |	We talked about this a lot we think that in the US were about to get some
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:23,135	| IOT187 |	Privacy regulations
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:23,903	| IOT187 |	I think that is
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,671	| IOT187 |	Good
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:30,047	| IOT187 |	As we are leading up to drafting some kind of legislation getting something implemented we're seeing a lot of
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,327	| IOT187 |	Companies come out talking about it
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,887	| IOT187 |	None more so
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:34,911	| IOT187 |	Then Apple
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:36,703	| IOT187 |	Which has constantly said that
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:37,983	| IOT187 |	Did they keep State a private
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:38,751	| IOT187 |	And
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:42,335	| IOT187 |	You might argue that that actually hurts it and its ability to create
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:48,223	| IOT187 |	Great day I based experiences but it's also something that it is definitely
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,247	| IOT187 |	Trying to pay
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:51,039	| IOT187 |	Pitches a differentiator between Amazon
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:53,087	| IOT187 |	So Tim Cook
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:55,135	| IOT187 |	The CEO of Apple
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:16:01,279	| IOT187 |	Give a speech recently in Europe where he basically said that when companies are misusing quote deeply personal data
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:02,815	| IOT187 |	He called it
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:05,631	| IOT187 |	Weaponized against us with military
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,143	| IOT187 |	Efficiency
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,423	| IOT187 |	Comet surveillance
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:09,983	| IOT187 |	And the entire speech was
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,263	| IOT187 |	Those are strong words
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,287	| IOT187 |	From a CEO
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:16,383	| IOT187 |	Yeah he's all in favor and In Praise of
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:19,199	| IOT187 |	What's the new gdpr regulations in
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:22,271	| IOT187 |	You obviously I see a point in
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:25,087	| IOT187 |	We talked about privacy in the past and we're all for it
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,903	| IOT187 |	I also wondering you kind of alluded to it you know
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:29,695	| IOT187 |	Is this perhaps why
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:30,975	| IOT187 |	The
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,767	| IOT187 |	AI in
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:34,559	| IOT187 |	The iOS world is not
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:35,583	| IOT187 |	Up to Snuff
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:38,911	| IOT187 |	With Google and Amazon in terms of personal
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:40,703	| IOT187 |	Information
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:44,031	| IOT187 |	Helpfulness I guess it's probably best word as well as
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:48,639	| IOT187 |	Homekit not having the launch velocity that the other platforms
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:52,735	| IOT187 |	It's almost like apple is back itself into a corner in these areas
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,783	| IOT187 |	Try and improve them
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,831	| IOT187 |	Without sacrificing privacy which is up
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,855	| IOT187 |	Great goal
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:00,671	| IOT187 |	But it comes at the cost of products that are less useful
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:07,327	| IOT187 |	And it's really unclear so there's a lot of reasons that Apple may be perceived as being more behind it
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:08,863	| IOT187 |	1 is
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:14,751	| IOT187 |	For a long time it didn't let researchers talk about what they were doing a lot of the data science Community is very open
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:16,543	| IOT187 |	And they want to publish research
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,311	| IOT187 |	An apple does not work
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:22,175	| IOT187 |	To happen so part of it may just be it's not attracting people who
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,455	| IOT187 |	Want to share what they're doing with the word
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:25,759	| IOT187 |	The other aspect is definitely really
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,831	| IOT187 |	There are those things too
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,599	| IOT187 |	To think about
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:31,135	| IOT187 |	With this and
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:34,207	| IOT187 |	I think we might be veering too far into the
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:36,511	| IOT187 |	Innovation is awesome Innovation at all
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,279	| IOT187 |	Cost is
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:40,095	| IOT187 |	Awesome in this particular realm because
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:41,631	| IOT187 |	Average height
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:43,167	| IOT187 |	There's kind of conflicting things
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,191	| IOT187 |	There's the idea that
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,215	| IOT187 |	Customization
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,239	| IOT187 |	AI can lead to
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,775	| IOT187 |	Awesome customization
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,287	| IOT187 |	And a better user
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:49,567	| IOT187 |	But
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:52,127	| IOT187 |	Up until now the web has been built on
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,407	| IOT187 |	Using an AI
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,175	| IOT187 |	For better Market
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,735	| IOT187 |	And those are two very contrary
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:18:00,063	| IOT187 |	You're either going to sell the user or you're going to sell the user
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:00,831	| IOT187 |	On something
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:02,367	| IOT187 |	Historically weave
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,391	| IOT187 |	So the user
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,159	| IOT187 |	And
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:06,975	| IOT187 |	It's unclear actually even if the user wants these
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:10,303	| IOT187 |	And that's kind of where we are at
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:12,863	| IOT187 |	At this moment and I'll give you an example of something
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,143	| IOT187 |	Kind of
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,167	| IOT187 |	Ties into this
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:15,935	| IOT187 |	Last month
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:17,471	| IOT187 |	James director of global
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:19,775	| IOT187 |	Additional information gave a presentation
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,823	| IOT187 |	To the association of national advertisers
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,895	| IOT187 |	In it he described the company Gathering data from
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:28,735	| IOT187 |	90000 GM owners in LA in Chicago for
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,503	| IOT187 |	Three months last year
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,807	| IOT187 |	These people were not aware
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:32,831	| IOT187 |	Of this happen
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:38,207	| IOT187 |	Basically it was sent into what people were listening to radio station satellite
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:38,975	| IOT187 |	Etcetera
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:39,743	| IOT187 |	And
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:40,767	| IOT187 |	It took that
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:42,303	| IOT187 |	Title to vehicle
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:45,887	| IOT187 |	Data and location data in basically was packaging this
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:46,911	| IOT187 |	For Advertiser
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:55,871	| IOT187 |	There is so much fear right now like whenever I talk to somebody who doesn't have an echo or a Google device in their home there you
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:57,151	| IOT187 |	Usually concerned about it listening in
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,687	| IOT187 |	Can we have this
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,199	| IOT187 |	Actually happen
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:02,015	| IOT187 |	And with the scariest part of
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,551	| IOT187 |	The presentation I think
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,087	| IOT187 |	Place to me
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:07,903	| IOT187 |	Was that the GM executive said that since of a quote
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:08,671	| IOT187 |	We sampled
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:10,719	| IOT187 |	The behavior every minute
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:11,999	| IOT187 |	Just because we could
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,815	| IOT187 |	Yeah that's not good
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:18,143	| IOT187 |	Interested tie these two things together and elaborate something else
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,167	| IOT187 |	Some more on what you said
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:22,239	| IOT187 |	You're right Innovation for the sake of innovation is
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,519	| IOT187 |	It's not the answer and
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:28,639	| IOT187 |	People sometimes fail to understand that when you innovate and building Technologies
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:31,711	| IOT187 |	That allows you to increase your Innovation and
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:35,295	| IOT187 |	Bill Nur Technologies so the rate of change and innovation
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,831	| IOT187 |	Is increasing
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:40,927	| IOT187 |	What's not increasing is the level of privacy
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,463	| IOT187 |	Security that we have
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:46,047	| IOT187 |	Yeah but you need to be in lockstep for this Market
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:49,119	| IOT187 |	Otherwise you're going to have while you're going to have what we have today you're going to have
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:53,983	| IOT187 |	Devices and device makers that are doing things like this because
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:54,495	| IOT187 |	They can
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:57,055	| IOT187 |	Injustice 2
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:58,591	| IOT187 |	Drive this home
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,359	| IOT187 |	Because
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,639	| IOT187 |	By gosh we're going to
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:04,991	| IOT187 |	Call the spit dystopian episode sidewalk Labs which is alphabets
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:07,551	| IOT187 |	Company building a smarter City on Toronto's
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:08,319	| IOT187 |	Waterfront
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:10,367	| IOT187 |	Area one of the advisors
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:11,135	| IOT187 |	An
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:11,903	| IOT187 |	Cavoukian
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:13,439	| IOT187 |	Who is a privacy expert
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,719	| IOT187 |	She actually resigned
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:15,743	| IOT187 |	Last week
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:17,535	| IOT187 |	Is an advisor to sidewalk
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,839	| IOT187 |	Because she didn't like
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:23,679	| IOT187 |	That Sidewalk labs when it released its privacy and digital governance
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:26,239	| IOT187 |	Proposals and we actually feature those in the newsletter last week
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:28,031	| IOT187 |	They decided
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,055	| IOT187 |	That the
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:29,823	| IOT187 |	Could not make
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,359	| IOT187 |	All personal data
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:32,383	| IOT187 |	D identified
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:36,223	| IOT187 |	At the source and what that means is all of your city public data that
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:38,527	| IOT187 |	It's coming from you as you walk around the city
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:40,063	| IOT187 |	Will still be associated
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,087	| IOT187 |	With you
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:45,951	| IOT187 |	Did you talk about how people could use that data and when people use that data they need to make it
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:47,487	| IOT187 |	Clear what they're doing with it and then
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,791	| IOT187 |	Talk about creating a civil Trust
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,071	| IOT187 |	To monitor that data
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:53,375	| IOT187 |	But they did not say
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,143	| IOT187 |	Is that it had to be
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:55,423	| IOT187 |	Take it away from you
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:59,007	| IOT187 |	And part of the problem here is when you create these type of smart
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:20:59,519	| IOT187 |	Platforms
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:02,847	| IOT187 |	You obviously open them up to third parties
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,639	| IOT187 |	And one of the issues
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:05,919	| IOT187 |	Is
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:07,711	| IOT187 |	At least with sidewalk labs
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:09,247	| IOT187 |	The alphabet company saying is
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:11,295	| IOT187 |	You were committed to D identifying data but
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:13,343	| IOT187 |	We can control with their parties do
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:15,135	| IOT187 |	You can see how this
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,416	| IOT187 |	Could play out negatively for
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,976	| IOT187 |	Also take for example the recent
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:20,768	| IOT187 |	Selling of
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:27,168	| IOT187 |	People's wireless data by the carriers to third-party data brokers who then turned around and sold that data to
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:28,448	| IOT187 |	Two law enforcement agent
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:30,240	| IOT187 |	So then
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:32,032	| IOT187 |	They actually had access to Lake
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:32,544	| IOT187 |	Individuals movie
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:34,336	| IOT187 |	Which is kind of creepy
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:36,128	| IOT187 |	Because you know we have lost
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:36,896	| IOT187 |	Protect
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:38,432	| IOT187 |	How police can get that info
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:40,224	| IOT187 |	Information they just kind of sidestepped
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:40,992	| IOT187 |	Frightened rabbit
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:41,504	| IOT187 |	Just by going to
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,832	| IOT187 |	Now the carrier said they stop doing
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,368	| IOT187 |	But
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:46,880	| IOT187 |	You know these are
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:50,976	| IOT187 |	You have to rely on someone to figure this out and then
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:53,792	| IOT187 |	Shame the company and then they're like oh okay I will stop
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,584	| IOT187 |	It's always after the fact
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:58,912	| IOT187 |	So all of those stories taken together
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:01,216	| IOT187 |	I'm going to say they make me feel dirty
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:05,568	| IOT187 |	They make me feel really uncertain about the world that we're trying to build
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:07,616	| IOT187 |	And the conversations were
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,640	| IOT187 |	Having a bout
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:09,408	| IOT187 |	Are connected products
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:10,944	| IOT187 |	How use the data from those
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:13,760	| IOT187 |	And our monetization play
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:15,296	| IOT187 |	So
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:18,880	| IOT187 |	I'm going to be like if I had to claim a big Story 4
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,648	| IOT187 |	The coming here
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:21,696	| IOT187 |	Which we don't really do those kind of things
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:23,232	| IOT187 |	That's going to be
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,768	| IOT187 |	A huge story next year
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:25,280	| IOT187 |	And
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:30,144	| IOT187 |	A couple episodes ago we talked about how we're getting the smart home ready for normal people
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:32,192	| IOT187 |	And I believe that is truly happening
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:34,240	| IOT187 |	We need to have those conversations
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:36,032	| IOT187 |	What's before everyone starts putting
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:37,056	| IOT187 |	Olaf is crazy
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:37,568	| IOT187 |	Stuff
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:40,640	| IOT187 |	So this is me calling out
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:41,408	| IOT187 |	To everyone
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,432	| IOT187 |	To think about this
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:43,456	| IOT187 |	To talk about this
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,224	| IOT187 |	Start
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:44,992	| IOT187 |	Figuring out
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:45,760	| IOT187 |	How we want
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:46,272	| IOT187 |	How to handle this
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:48,320	| IOT187 |	And maybe it is maybe it's like
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,344	| IOT187 |	OK I don't need this in my
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:51,136	| IOT187 |	It's not providing me enough value
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:52,160	| IOT187 |	I don't know
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:54,208	| IOT187 |	That's enough on that
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:55,232	| IOT187 |	About something
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:58,304	| IOT187 |	I don't know is it more creepy is it less creepy
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,072	| IOT187 |	Everything
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:00,864	| IOT187 |	What's creepy this is the walabot
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:02,144	| IOT187 |	This is a
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:04,448	| IOT187 |	Sensor you can put on a wall they
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:05,984	| IOT187 |	I think it's good for your bathroom
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:08,544	| IOT187 |	And what it is is it detects Falls
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,824	| IOT187 |	It's a $249 divided
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:11,872	| IOT187 |	And you
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:13,920	| IOT187 |	It doesn't use a camera it uses
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:16,736	| IOT187 |	Radio waves so it's tracking basically
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:17,504	| IOT187 |	It's not like it's
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:19,040	| IOT187 |	It's kind of like radar or sonar
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:24,160	| IOT187 |	It's basically creating not images but information about
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:25,440	| IOT187 |	Waterfall looks like
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:28,512	| IOT187 |	Through and it will work through a shower curtain of a war
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:29,792	| IOT187 |	Works for all of this sort of
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,072	| IOT187 |	Thin layers of
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:31,840	| IOT187 |	Materials
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,376	| IOT187 |	And basically it'll say hey
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:36,448	| IOT187 |	This data pattern looks like what it looks like when someone falls in the shower
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:38,752	| IOT187 |	When someone Falls stepping out of the tub
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:41,056	| IOT187 |	And it will call an emergency personnel
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:42,336	| IOT187 |	How late is wifi-only nuts
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:44,128	| IOT187 |	It doesn't have a subscription fee
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:46,432	| IOT187 |	Probably because it's wifi-only
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:48,224	| IOT187 |	And if you're concerned about
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:49,504	| IOT187 |	This is a problem
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:50,272	| IOT187 |	It might be something you're
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:51,552	| IOT187 |	Interested in looking at
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:57,952	| IOT187 |	Yeah honey that's another way to help the Aging population or anybody trips in their bathroom whatever
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:01,024	| IOT187 |	It doesn't seem too invasive to me because it's not like you can
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:01,792	| IOT187 |	The camera
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:08,192	| IOT187 |	Because it's using Wi-Fi it's obviously voice over IP which Emergency Services aren't going to your local
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:13,568	| IOT187 |	Patient through that however I would assume that you set your home location in an app and it just
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,336	| IOT187 |	Provides that
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,104	| IOT187 |	Information
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:21,504	| IOT187 |	To the emergency services so that way you don't have to tell them where you are now you're going to carry this thing around and you're always moving so that
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:24,320	| IOT187 |	That's good you know for the Right audience I think it's
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,600	| IOT187 |	Probably a good product
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:26,368	| IOT187 |	Yes
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,392	| IOT187 |	I'm kind of interested in someone
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:30,208	| IOT187 |	I coming to you this week with a broken toe
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:32,768	| IOT187 |	That's okay
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:33,536	| IOT187 |	Baidu fall
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:36,352	| IOT187 |	Anyway so let's move on to our final Story 4
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:37,376	| IOT187 |	Witches
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:39,168	| IOT187 |	A couple weeks back
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,960	| IOT187 |	Probably months ago actually
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:43,264	| IOT187 |	The New York Times did an awesome story
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:46,592	| IOT187 |	Talking about how smart home devices can be used against people
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:47,104	| IOT187 |	Who are victims of
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,384	| IOT187 |	Vuse solo
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:50,688	| IOT187 |	How people could be controlled
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:52,480	| IOT187 |	By the connected devices in the
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:57,600	| IOT187 |	They're home so maybe their husband installs connected locks and locks them outside the house
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:25:00,672	| IOT187 |	Or maybe a wife uses a camera to monitor the husband
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,208	| IOT187 |	Don't know about it
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:03,488	| IOT187 |	All of these things
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,256	| IOT187 |	Super creepy
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:05,536	| IOT187 |	And
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:08,864	| IOT187 |	There wasn't a lot that we could do we talked about
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:09,632	| IOT187 |	A couple things that you
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:10,912	| IOT187 |	You could do but really it's
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:17,568	| IOT187 |	It's a tough problem to solve Kevin talked about how he always checks with his wife and daughter before installing things in the home
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,616	| IOT187 |	I talked about giving my husband Adnan
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:20,640	| IOT187 |	Access so they have
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:23,200	| IOT187 |	Access to this but
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:25,760	| IOT187 |	The Wirecutter did a story talking about
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:26,528	| IOT187 |	Other things
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:29,344	| IOT187 |	They're good suggestions in that they
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:30,880	| IOT187 |	They help they don't help
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,648	| IOT187 |	The issues
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:35,744	| IOT187 |	Like if you're not prepared to leave the situation or you still live with your abuser
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:36,768	| IOT187 |	These are not
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:37,792	| IOT187 |	Really helps
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,328	| IOT187 |	Tremendously
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:40,096	| IOT187 |	But
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:43,680	| IOT187 |	It's a start so they give instructions on how to log into your router
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:45,728	| IOT187 |	And see what other devices are on the network
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:48,800	| IOT187 |	They talked about how to reset devices and
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:49,824	| IOT187 |	Call the manufacturer
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:56,992	| IOT187 |	The two-factor authentication suggestion is awesome I'm very big into two Factor authentication for all of my online
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:26:02,368	| IOT187 |	Accounts as well as my devices nobody can login pretty simple to my Chromebook if they don't have the special
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,904	| IOT187 |	USB key for example
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:05,952	| IOT187 |	So I'd like to see more
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:10,048	| IOT187 |	Smart home companies during the setup process offer two-factor Authentication
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:15,168	| IOT187 |	Because that could completely lock somebody out from changing settings on you
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:16,192	| IOT187 |	Without your knowledge
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,216	| IOT187 |	Corset could be
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:20,032	| IOT187 |	Agreed
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:22,848	| IOT187 |	And another idea was to disable remote access
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:26,432	| IOT187 |	You can avoid applications that track and store location history
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:28,480	| IOT187 |	Turn off geofencing on
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:28,992	| IOT187 |	Devices
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:31,808	| IOT187 |	You know so again this kind of put you in
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:34,880	| IOT187 |	Back but we are talking about surveillance
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:36,928	| IOT187 |	In a lot of these devices and
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,976	| IOT187 |	You know it can be used against you
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:43,072	| IOT187 |	I'll put a link to that for everyone who is interested in checking the
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:44,352	| IOT187 |	And
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:51,520	| IOT187 |	I'm surprised wait a second I'm surprised that you skipped over one of the most interesting exciting chips.
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:52,032	| IOT187 |	Rays of the week
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:54,080	| IOT187 |	Oh my God I didn't talk about it
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:56,896	| IOT187 |	Now you know that's my point you guys I'm terrible
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:57,920	| IOT187 |	This is what happens
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:04,320	| IOT187 |	Okay she was so excited before the show about this okay there's a new
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:06,624	| IOT187 |	Chip company out there called at mosack
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,904	| IOT187 |	It launched this week
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:08,672	| IOT187 |	And
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:09,184	| IOT187 |	Here's what
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:11,232	| IOT187 |	Any new Chips
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:11,744	| IOT187 |	Japanese automatic
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:15,840	| IOT187 |	Cuz I'm a big nerd
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:18,400	| IOT187 |	But this is a chip designed to solve
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,680	| IOT187 |	The battery problems with
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:22,752	| IOT187 |	Connected sensors in low-power devices
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:23,520	| IOT187 |	Out there in the iot
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:29,920	| IOT187 |	Because my dad if we're going to put a trillion sensors anywhere or even fifty billion sensors we can't be changing the battery
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:35,552	| IOT187 |	So at mosaic what they've done is they've created a tiny bluetooth module
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:36,320	| IOT187 |	And
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:38,368	| IOT187 |	This Bluetooth chip is notable be
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,904	| IOT187 |	Because it's designed to
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:42,720	| IOT187 |	Do some really Advanced things on the sleep and wake mode
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:44,000	| IOT187 |	So that's good right
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,792	| IOT187 |	The way it listens for
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:46,816	| IOT187 |	Data packets is slightly
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:49,120	| IOT187 |	And more power-efficient
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:50,912	| IOT187 |	50 most exciting aspect
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:51,680	| IOT187 |	About it
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,192	| IOT187 |	Is
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,984	| IOT187 |	It Harvest
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:54,752	| IOT187 |	RF energy
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,032	| IOT187 |	Show
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:58,848	| IOT187 |	Basically this doesn't need to be powered by a battery
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:01,408	| IOT187 |	Sorry it can be powered by harvesting
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:02,432	| IOT187 |	Wireless
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:03,200	| IOT187 |	Else and
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:06,528	| IOT187 |	You have to be kind of close to things for this to work
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,552	| IOT187 |	But this is not inductive
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:10,880	| IOT187 |	It gathers energy from the RS
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:12,672	| IOT187 |	Signals so basically
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:15,488	| IOT187 |	Any radio waves out there in this is actually
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:16,000	| IOT187 |	Radio
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,280	| IOT187 |	Powers
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:20,608	| IOT187 |	Other things so Wireless power like we talked about with a Qi standard
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,888	| IOT187 |	That is actually
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:22,912	| IOT187 |	RF power is
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:26,752	| IOT187 |	As well but it's sitting directly on top of something and so
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:28,288	| IOT187 |	It can power things that
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:29,568	| IOT187 |	Require more power
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:31,104	| IOT187 |	Like a cell phone
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:36,224	| IOT187 |	Cuz if you send too much energy through these RF waves to power stuff
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:36,992	| IOT187 |	You end up basic
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:38,016	| IOT187 |	Microwaving someone
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:41,600	| IOT187 |	So you cannot send massive quantities of power wirelessly
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,904	| IOT187 |	But you can't send tiny amount
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:47,232	| IOT187 |	And that's basically what the sensor. Is it's basically trickle charging
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:47,744	| IOT187 |	All the time
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:50,048	| IOT187 |	So I love this
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:51,072	| IOT187 |	I love the design
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:54,400	| IOT187 |	I'm very excited to see this come out into the world
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,424	| IOT187 |	It will not be out into the
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:58,240	| IOT187 |	Volume until 2019
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:03,616	| IOT187 |	And then we probably won't see devices at the earliest until the holidays of 2019
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,896	| IOT187 |	Probably more likely we'll see it
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:05,920	| IOT187 |	In 2020
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:07,200	| IOT187 |	But
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:09,504	| IOT187 |	Yeah this is interesting
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:11,040	| IOT187 |	For so many reasons and
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:17,952	| IOT187 |	The application of this obviously you think sensors right away because they generally have low power requirements to begin with
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:18,720	| IOT187 |	But
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:25,120	| IOT187 |	They're saying there are multiple applications here that we could be using his for such as wearables asset tracker
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:26,400	| IOT187 |	Beacons remotes
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,168	| IOT187 |	Keyboards
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:27,936	| IOT187 |	Mice
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:31,008	| IOT187 |	So there's there's a lot of potential here in terms of
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:32,288	| IOT187 |	What we could see this in
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:34,592	| IOT187 |	Yes now what you will need
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:35,616	| IOT187 |	For this kind of network
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,128	| IOT187 |	Work you're going to need
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:40,480	| IOT187 |	If a mesh situation because you cannot be too far away and still gain
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:41,760	| IOT187 |	The power
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:42,528	| IOT187 |	So
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:43,808	| IOT187 |	You're going to have it like
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:46,880	| IOT187 |	Your phone cannot trickle charge this by talking to it
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:47,904	| IOT187 |	Phone is downstairs
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,184	| IOT187 |	Check the sensors
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:49,696	| IOT187 |	Upstairs
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:52,256	| IOT187 |	Yeah I wonder though
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:54,560	| IOT187 |	What the range is like I'm walking around
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:55,840	| IOT187 |	With a wearable and I'm not
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:30:00,960	| IOT187 |	My phone with me would it be able to harvest energy couldn't possibly get some from the cellular network
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:05,824	| IOT187 |	What's that are around I don't know all the frequencies that they're using to get that yellow electromagnetic
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:06,848	| IOT187 |	Energy
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:08,640	| IOT187 |	Will Kevin I can answer some of the
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:10,688	| IOT187 |	So it is
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,456	| IOT187 |	About 10 feet
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:14,272	| IOT187 |	That's kind of the optimal range that you should be
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:15,296	| IOT187 |	So
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:17,088	| IOT187 |	I mean that's not terrible
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:21,696	| IOT187 |	It's also know so my phone would always be within 10 feet of something I'm wearing
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:27,328	| IOT187 |	I'm carrying my phone as well but obviously I'm almost always more than 10 feet away from a cell tower
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:29,632	| IOT187 |	NFL stand under that just to recharge
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:32,448	| IOT187 |	Things are still very interesting what they could do it.
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:34,240	| IOT187 |	Yes thanks for reminding
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,800	| IOT187 |	I was so eager
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:37,824	| IOT187 |	To get to our

EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:27,744	| IOT187 |	And he
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:29,280	| IOT187 |	The question actually
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:30,816	| IOT187 |	About his Schlage sense lock
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:33,632	| IOT187 |	Hi Kevin and Stacy my name is Isaac
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:35,936	| IOT187 |	I'm from Colorado Michael is actually about the
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:36,704	| IOT187 |	Schlage sense
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:38,752	| IOT187 |	Lock you probably seen in the web.
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:40,544	| IOT187 |	Ever since I was 12 was released
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:42,848	| IOT187 |	We can no longer control the
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:43,616	| IOT187 |	Sexton
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:44,896	| IOT187 |	Locks remotely
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:47,712	| IOT187 |	Sections were actually my favorite locks have been using them
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:48,480	| IOT187 |	Years
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:50,016	| IOT187 |	And I have to my house
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:52,320	| IOT187 |	The other day I almost said to gets locked out of my house
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:55,392	| IOT187 |	Connect keyless remote case I was traveling back home
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:56,160	| IOT187 |	Cisco
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:32:00,000	| IOT187 |	So I was hoping to ask if you guys know more from the rectum
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:01,792	| IOT187 |	Is there an app to type
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:02,560	| IOT187 |	60 shoe
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:04,096	| IOT187 |	And it's not
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:05,120	| IOT187 |	What are the laws
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:05,888	| IOT187 |	Star hump
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:06,656	| IOT187 |	Compatible
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:07,680	| IOT187 |	Would you recommend
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:08,192	| IOT187 |	To replace the
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:11,264	| IOT187 |	That's probably not going to be selected
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:12,288	| IOT187 |	It to be on the air because
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:15,872	| IOT187 |	Complaining about Schlage sense a little bit but
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:17,920	| IOT187 |	I was hoping you might be able to
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,688	| IOT187 |	Thank you
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,480	| IOT187 |	Oh Isaac
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:21,504	| IOT187 |	We do not
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:22,784	| IOT187 |	Let our sponsors
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:23,808	| IOT187 |	Interfere with our editorial
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:25,344	| IOT187 |	We would never do that
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:27,648	| IOT187 |	Because all of our sponsors actually
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:29,440	| IOT187 |	Really want the iot to work out
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:30,720	| IOT187 |	And so they really want to solve
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:31,488	| IOT187 |	These issues
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:32,768	| IOT187 |	In this case
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:33,536	| IOT187 |	You Are Not Alone
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:34,816	| IOT187 |	Schlage
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:35,840	| IOT187 |	Has acknowledged
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:36,352	| IOT187 |	This is an issue
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:42,496	| IOT187 |	Dealing with it's also an issue that August locks and even some light bulbs that are Bluetooth
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,008	| IOT187 |	Baste her face
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:46,080	| IOT187 |	Schlage has given us an official statement
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:48,384	| IOT187 |	They acknowledge that this is an issue
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:50,688	| IOT187 |	People are experiencing remote
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:51,712	| IOT187 |	Connectivity trouble with
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:56,576	| IOT187 |	And they are currently working with apple to identify and resolve the issue
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:57,344	| IOT187 |	In a timely fashion
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:00,928	| IOT187 |	They do want to stress that customers can use their
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:02,208	| IOT187 |	Access codes to unlock the
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:05,792	| IOT187 |	And you can manage the lock using the Schlage Sense app
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:09,120	| IOT187 |	Or the Apple home app if it is in Bluetooth
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:10,912	| IOT187 |	You just can't do it
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:11,424	| IOT187 |	Remotely
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:15,520	| IOT187 |	Now this is probably still super inconvenient
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:16,288	| IOT187 |	People hate this
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:17,568	| IOT187 |	They hate having this problem
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:18,336	| IOT187 |	LED light bulbs
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:20,640	| IOT187 |	Problem with other
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:23,200	| IOT187 |	The issue is the update
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:23,712	| IOT187 |	IOS 12
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:25,248	| IOT187 |	It appears that
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:26,784	| IOT187 |	Something about that update
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:28,320	| IOT187 |	Broke something
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,600	| IOT187 |	In the homekit Bluetooth
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:30,624	| IOT187 |	Implementation
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:32,160	| IOT187 |	The
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:34,720	| IOT187 |	Challenge that a lot of these companies are dealing
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:36,000	| IOT187 |	Here is
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:38,048	| IOT187 |	They don't always have
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:39,328	| IOT187 |	Full access
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:40,096	| IOT187 |	2
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:41,632	| IOT187 |	Beta versions
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,144	| IOT187 |	That might be
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:45,216	| IOT187 |	Locks and so they are working with Apple
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:49,056	| IOT187 |	Kind of
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:51,360	| IOT187 |	The challenge here
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:52,640	| IOT187 |	For apple is there
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:55,712	| IOT187 |	Completely changing the OS versions of major
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:57,760	| IOT187 |	Release of iOS iOS 12
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:59,552	| IOT187 |	And sure you know
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:00,320	| IOT187 |	DeKalb
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:02,880	| IOT187 |	Unit testing regression testing Etc
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:06,464	| IOT187 |	He got beta testers I beta test iOS 12 I did for a while
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:10,816	| IOT187 |	Before it came out live but they're just so many moving parts and you
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:12,096	| IOT187 |	Fix earned Edition
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:16,960	| IOT187 |	May go back and break something in this case perhaps it's something in the Bluetooth stack or who does what
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:19,776	| IOT187 |	You never going to catch at all unfortunately
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:26,176	| IOT187 |	Guess I don't understand you give Apple a pass but I mean I used to manage a QA software testing team just that one Corporation
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:30,784	| IOT187 |	It's a challenge I know anytime that you have coaching to such as especially when they're massive
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:32,576	| IOT187 |	So I hope that it gets fixed
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:37,440	| IOT187 |	It'll for all of that manufacturers that are affected because it's obviously not Ashley
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:38,208	| IOT187 |	And
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:43,072	| IOT187 |	Favorite kind of sucking Windows you know early adopters and IRT people until it happens so
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:44,096	| IOT187 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:49,472	| IOT187 |	You know Apple certainly knows about the issue so my guess is we'll see it fix much under the rather than later and we're just
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:50,752	| IOT187 |	Going to be inconvenience
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:51,776	| IOT187 |	That's what happens
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:53,056	| IOT187 |	And the plus side is
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:54,592	| IOT187 |	This sort of thing
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:58,176	| IOT187 |	Will probably prompt everyone to look at how they're evaluating
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:34:59,456	| IOT187 |	Software update
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,224	| IOT187 |	SRO SF
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:03,296	| IOT187 |	So this voice mail came in actually
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:04,832	| IOT187 |	I was 2 weeks ago
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:06,112	| IOT187 |	But
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:07,136	| IOT187 |	It's still not solved
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:09,952	| IOT187 |	The most recent update as of Wednesday morning
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:14,560	| IOT187 |	When we recorded this from Schlage is quote Apple continues to work on finding the root
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:17,120	| IOT187 |	They're working daily with r and
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:17,888	| IOT187 |	And other companies
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:21,472	| IOT187 |	You can tell that that's an official statement
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:21,984	| IOT187 |	Because I use the word app
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:26,336	| IOT187 |	And that's the first thing in finding
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:29,152	| IOT187 |	The solution is to replicate the problem
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:30,688	| IOT187 |	So Apple needs to do that first
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:37,344	| IOT187 |	Then that should help them determine what the issue is then Fix-It test the fixes make sure the fixes don't break anything else
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:41,440	| IOT187 |	Anywhere in iOS 12 and then push it out to everybody at that point
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:42,208	| IOT187 |	So that
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:44,256	| IOT187 |	All these locks now work the way they used to
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:48,864	| IOT187 |	It's going to take time it's just going to take time and the good thing is as you said I mean
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:51,936	| IOT187 |	They should now have a test case going forward
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:53,728	| IOT187 |	To retest
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:54,496	| IOT187 |	All baby lock
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:57,824	| IOT187 |	Functionality going forward with each new iOS update so
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:35:59,872	| IOT187 |	Hopefully this does not happen again
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:02,432	| IOT187 |	Something else might happen
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,200	| IOT187 |	Because hey
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:04,480	| IOT187 |	It's a whole new world out there you guys

EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:23,936	| IOT187 |	He's going to be talking about how a device
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:25,216	| IOT187 |	Made by a bankrupt company
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:27,520	| IOT187 |	Is still working for us today
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:28,288	| IOT187 |	And
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,056	| IOT187 |	You'll hear from our sponsor
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:31,872	| IOT187 |	How does it stay tuned
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:38,016	| IOT187 |	Everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:41,344	| IOT187 |	Cognizant and I have Frank entities
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,880	| IOT187 |	Conscious its Global leader
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:43,648	| IOT187 |	Of the iot
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:47,488	| IOT187 |	Frank we have covered a lot of ground in our previous
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:52,096	| IOT187 |	We talked about how it's not easy for companies to build iot Solutions
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:53,632	| IOT187 |	But how you guys helped
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:56,960	| IOT187 |	A bunch of your customers in retail in manufacturing
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:37:03,104	| IOT187 |	Now tell us today how cognizant is taking it a step further by using a human Centric approach to
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:05,152	| IOT187 |	Solutions
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:07,712	| IOT187 |	Moschino iot applications are changing
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:13,856	| IOT187 |	Atticus of this customers demand more than the Enterprise Windows lock the speed
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:18,208	| IOT187 |	Scale of the coming transformation is massive and cognizant is helping building
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:21,280	| IOT187 |	But it's also a challenge that comes with graphic Technology Innovation
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:24,864	| IOT187 |	Some companies try to solve the problem but using a technology
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:27,680	| IOT187 |	Design new technologies without
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:29,984	| IOT187 |	Clear understanding what problem different song
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:31,776	| IOT187 |	What we as humans
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:33,824	| IOT187 |	S customers Factory workers
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:34,848	| IOT187 |	Service technician
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:38,944	| IOT187 |	110v that is widely believed in a human supposed to propose to solve this problem
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:40,480	| IOT187 |	Followed by the technology
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:42,272	| IOT187 |	That is a big challenge
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:44,064	| IOT187 |	What do you recommend to your class
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:48,160	| IOT187 |	What we recommend to our customers is that before
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:48,672	| IOT187 |	Legal
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:52,768	| IOT187 |	Solve the problem with the technology first approach to look at what people really
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:54,048	| IOT187 |	It's example
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:54,560	| IOT187 |	Apartments
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:57,120	| IOT187 |	Date we can get all kind of data
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:58,144	| IOT187 |	Some cars we can have
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:37:59,936	| IOT187 |	Show me the different features
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:01,216	| IOT187 |	At the disposal of the grave
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:02,496	| IOT187 |	Depression videos
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:05,312	| IOT187 |	Just need so many features
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:06,848	| IOT187 |	Arconic features
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:09,920	| IOT187 |	Well crafted features
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:14,272	| IOT187 |	Swappa thinks that we work with our customers interest example if still
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:16,576	| IOT187 |	Understand what people really need
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:17,600	| IOT187 |	Like I'm having to use
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:23,744	| IOT187 |	Dimensions can make that experience or driver most
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:26,304	| IOT187 |	And how does composite do that
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:27,840	| IOT187 |	The way we look at
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:29,376	| IOT187 |	Least problem says to
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:31,424	| IOT187 |	Play on key principles of ethnographic

EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:35,776	| IOT187 |	Example in this case
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:38,080	| IOT187 |	The way a driver
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:41,152	| IOT187 |	Answer the question on a survey about what they want in a thug
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:43,456	| IOT187 |	It's very different from what they actually want
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:46,784	| IOT187 |	Doctors established by observing and that is why
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:48,320	| IOT187 |	The principles of
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,344	| IOT187 |	Ethnographic research help

EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:05,632	| IOT187 |	For the iot of all time
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:06,656	| IOT187 |	The quirky
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:10,240	| IOT187 |	But before we get to that
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:12,800	| IOT187 |	Let me give you a chance to tell everybody what Electra
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:15,360	| IOT187 |	So Electric
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:23,552	| IOT187 |	Provide security on dimensionality devices in the field by customers to build
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:26,880	| IOT187 |	Aqi easily integrated long lasting

EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:30,976	| IOT187 |	4080 to deliver the daytime control wherever you stay
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:32,768	| IOT187 |	Which brings us back
EDL	00:40:32,768	00:40:34,048	| IOT187 |	To my favorite product
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:34,816	| IOT187 |	The quirky egg mine
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:39,424	| IOT187 |	We spend a lot of time on the show talking about business models and about security
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:43,008	| IOT187 |	We floated ideas like hey we should have in
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:43,776	| IOT187 |	Expiration date
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:44,800	| IOT187 |	For connected ID
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:45,312	| IOT187 |	Adams because
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:46,592	| IOT187 |	By golly
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:48,128	| IOT187 |	After certain period of time
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:54,272	| IOT187 |	You may not want to support it if you're a manufacturer but does a consumer you need to know that your device is not going to be supported and get ready
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:56,832	| IOT187 |	The updates so you can possibly
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:40:57,856	| IOT187 |	Take it offline
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:40:59,648	| IOT187 |	End
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:01,184	| IOT187 |	You've been thinking about this
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:01,952	| IOT187 |	Probably from the beginning
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:04,000	| IOT187 |	Talk to me about
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:05,280	| IOT187 |	When you are developing Electric
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:07,328	| IOT187 |	Kind of how you were thinking about security
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:09,120	| IOT187 |	Devices
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:10,400	| IOT187 |	Xiaomi
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:11,424	| IOT187 |	Going way back
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:12,448	| IOT187 |	Coming back to the
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:13,728	| IOT187 |	480 * 2
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:14,496	| IOT187 |	Specking
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:16,800	| IOT187 |	Play 90s MP3 player
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:28,832	| IOT187 |	But I'll tell you we got a quiet by Rio and they love consumer MP3 player making cosima devices
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:33,952	| IOT187 |	What's something I did feel like sawdust ideas and I sent to you MP3 players with almost the ultimate this place welcome
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:39,328	| IOT187 |	Every year that was much better delete some bands haircut better
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:41,120	| IOT187 |	Intellicast
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:42,912	| IOT187 |	Fusion so
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:44,448	| IOT187 |	Either you develop
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:46,240	| IOT187 |	Continue to work on a product
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:47,264	| IOT187 |	Really
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:48,288	| IOT187 |	You never did Summer
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:50,592	| IOT187 |	Takes off her that will the bugs were out generally
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:54,687	| IOT187 |	Product development team would move this is kind of
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:56,735	| IOT187 |	Chi products
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:59,295	| IOT187 |	Adult by Thrice some of the development team so similar
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:41:59,807	| IOT187 |	Construction
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:06,207	| IOT187 |	The company is either bring its new product still finish it with software on it and I'll get it working though ship it
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:09,279	| IOT187 |	And the chances of Danny's xidan capable
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:13,631	| IOT187 |	Could you sing a software update for this make in five years time a very low
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:17,215	| IOT187 |	Just simply it's not that serious Nowell it's everything to budget
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:18,239	| IOT187 |	Scheduling
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:21,311	| IOT187 |	That's the engine is made absolutely desperate won't attach
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:27,711	| IOT187 |	Tatiana stock if she were Hubley typing ability but unless they actually had given QA results
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:29,503	| IOT187 |	Retirement money
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:30,015	| IOT187 |	Do this
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:32,831	| IOT187 |	And that's really a structural
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:34,623	| IOT187 |	Consumer product companies
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:37,951	| IOT187 |	Maintenance
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:45,631	| IOT187 |	Cancel 20 years in advance whatever at least and so that was very much my mind with
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:46,399	| IOT187 |	HIIT
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:52,287	| IOT187 |	How do you make some other work how can you make
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:55,615	| IOT187 |	Devices remain secure even if the manufacturer is not involved
EDL	00:42:58,431	00:43:00,735	| IOT187 |	And the way we do separation operating system
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:03,807	| IOT187 |	Add the application unit tiny device White
EDL	00:43:03,807	00:43:04,319	| IOT187 |	Yakima
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:06,111	| IOT187 |	Okay and that brings us
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:08,159	| IOT187 |	Reminder
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:09,439	| IOT187 |	So talk to me
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:11,487	| IOT187 |	About that in the
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:12,767	| IOT187 |	Main steps that you take
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:14,815	| IOT187 |	Keep this operational
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:16,095	| IOT187 |	Even though
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:17,375	| IOT187 |	The company behind the Crooked eight
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:18,911	| IOT187 |	Is now defunct
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:21,471	| IOT187 |	Interesting things
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:22,495	| IOT187 |	Cookie OC Henson
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:24,031	| IOT187 |	Kwikee products
EDL	00:43:24,031	00:43:25,823	| IOT187 |	Innovation
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:29,151	| IOT187 |	Some people decided that I next trade
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:35,295	| IOT187 |	It'll tell you how many eggs you do if you don't have in your fridge from anywhere in the world by the powers on your teeth
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:36,063	| IOT187 |	The promotional
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:37,343	| IOT187 |	Suprax possibly
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:40,671	| IOT187 |	And by golly
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:44,767	| IOT187 |	I do have any eggs and I actually thought it
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:45,791	| IOT187 |	I didn't think it was like
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:46,815	| IOT187 |	Eminently useful
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:47,583	| IOT187 |	But when they
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:50,399	| IOT187 |	The salad is an idea they said it cost like $15 or
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:52,447	| IOT187 |	And at that price I was like that isn't
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:53,983	| IOT187 |	Excellent gift
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:54,751	| IOT187 |	Like
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:56,031	| IOT187 |	Quirky kitchen gadgets
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:58,079	| IOT187 |	For Christmas or holiday
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:44:01,407	| IOT187 |	Right so I was like yeah but then when it came out it was $50
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:05,503	| IOT187 |	Which probably gets
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:08,575	| IOT187 |	KissAnime expensive iot when
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:09,855	| IOT187 |	Like whatever
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:11,391	| IOT187 |	Moving
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:14,975	| IOT187 |	Now that is defended by
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:15,487	| IOT187 |	Quirky
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:17,535	| IOT187 |	If I still had it
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,047	| IOT187 |	It today
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:19,071	| IOT187 |	Message to my son
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:20,607	| IOT187 |	You would actually stay
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:26,239	| IOT187 |	Yeah it should do I believe since you bought a new one you confirmation and now they turn off the pilot
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:30,847	| IOT187 |	Pretty much still around
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:35,455	| IOT187 |	Play Store devices online at least still working yes
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:36,735	| IOT187 |	The one thing series
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:37,759	| IOT187 |	Essentially
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:39,295	| IOT187 |	When they decided
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:40,319	| IOT187 |	Patience of Wilton
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:41,087	| IOT187 |	Successfully
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:43,647	| IOT187 |	Cookie cookie
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:46,207	| IOT187 |	And since that point to him is pretty they don't test
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:51,583	| IOT187 |	Chicken place on the Southwest Center in 2013 to 5 years ago
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:52,863	| IOT187 |	To advise
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:54,143	| IOT187 |	However the device has had
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:55,679	| IOT187 |	Pretty night time
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:57,471	| IOT187 |	7 the right OS updates
EDL	00:44:57,471	00:45:01,055	| IOT187 |	It's been patched.
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:02,335	| IOT187 |	2 in
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:03,615	| IOT187 |	Secrecy
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:04,639	| IOT187 |	It now has
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:06,431	| IOT187 |	Very sweet to trust improvements
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:08,735	| IOT187 |	Pieces good stuff
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:10,015	| IOT187 |	And no one
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:10,527	| IOT187 |	Quickie head
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:18,463	| IOT187 |	Essentially
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:21,279	| IOT187 |	The gold standard one of the oldest
EDL	00:45:21,279	00:45:23,583	| IOT187 |	Security in its radio
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:25,375	| IOT187 |	Should be using
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:26,911	| IOT187 |	Unity Chan sotl Essex
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:29,727	| IOT187 |	Security
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:31,007	| IOT187 |	So now
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:32,031	| IOT187 |	We're familiar with that
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:32,543	| IOT187 |	So
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:33,823	| IOT187 |	You guys
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:34,847	| IOT187 |	Basically Courtney Stefani
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:36,383	| IOT187 |	And there's
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:37,407	| IOT187 |	These existing products
EDL	00:45:38,687	00:45:40,223	| IOT187 |	TLS updates and all kinds of other up
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:41,759	| IOT187 |	And so
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:45,087	| IOT187 |	Listen to it works cuz I rock
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:48,159	| IOT187 |	Oswalt radio operating system underneath
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:51,999	| IOT187 |	Most people
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:53,279	| IOT187 |	Don't have an iOS update on that
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:55,327	| IOT187 |	Phone or laptop whatever
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:55,839	| IOT187 |	Windows
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:07,103	| IOT187 |	Retest all your applications as well as testing done by the operating system Benda
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:14,271	| IOT187 |	. concept has never really been cold all the way down to IRT you know my jio TV
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:21,951	| IOT187 |	But that's what our system has done we have the separation between application and then operating system
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:23,231	| IOT187 |	Essentially that allows
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:25,023	| IOT187 |	Testing
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:26,559	| IOT187 |	To be able to update Yelp rating
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:28,095	| IOT187 |	Christian without the involvement
EDL	00:46:28,095	00:46:30,399	| IOT187 |	Vice Ganda
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:30,911	| IOT187 |	And so
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:32,191	| IOT187 |	This is one way of
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:33,727	| IOT187 |	Thinking about securing iot
EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:37,311	| IOT187 |	Devices and then keeping them operational for a long long long long long
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:39,359	| IOT187 |	Time from an economic
EDL	00:46:39,359	00:46:39,871	| IOT187 |	Perspective
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:42,431	| IOT187 |	You guys have to update the OSB
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:43,199	| IOT187 |	Because
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:44,479	| IOT187 |	You're providing a service to
EDL	00:46:46,271	00:46:47,295	| IOT187 |	Customer so everyone gets
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:49,855	| IOT187 |	Joanna meaning
EDL	00:46:49,855	00:46:51,135	| IOT187 |	Kind of works Lacoste aswell
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:57,023	| IOT187 |	The huge cost of building and testing and maintaining your braking system
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:46:59,327	| IOT187 |	And every customer runs the same OS
EDL	00:46:59,327	00:47:05,471	| IOT187 |	So did you try to work that goes into that to make sure that it's stable and bug-free and we do a whole lot of other stuff
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:06,239	| IOT187 |	What about you
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:07,263	| IOT187 |	Remote Diagnostics
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:15,455	| IOT187 |	Something is going weird or whatever
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:20,319	| IOT187 |	We can dig into problems are deeply and find a recording pics
EDL	00:47:20,319	00:47:21,599	| IOT187 |	Yeah we kind of ducks
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:27,231	| IOT187 |	I'm sure they can stay online and stay secure
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:31,071	| IOT187 |	So let's try this to some big advances that have happened

EDL	00:47:43,359	00:47:45,151	| IOT187 |	And it's actually also tied back in
EDL	00:47:45,663	00:47:46,431	| IOT187 |	Cloud
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:46,943	| IOT187 |	You guys have a cloud
EDL	00:47:48,223	00:47:48,991	| IOT187 |	But I'm trying to chill
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:50,527	| IOT187 |	This is a little bit of a
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:56,671	| IOT187 |	It's actually pretty interesting to see we've been doing this sweeping shipping store devices
EDL	00:47:56,671	00:47:58,207	| IOT187 |	2012 on
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:48:02,559	| IOT187 |	Existing commodity Hardware in the best features of the existing checks

EDL	00:48:23,295	00:48:24,319	| IOT187 |	Application
EDL	00:48:24,319	00:48:26,111	| IOT187 |	Recycled things so it's good
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:27,391	| IOT187 |	Good things to have
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:31,231	| IOT187 |	However if you look at the comparison between the two this composite
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:32,255	| IOT187 |	Application
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:35,327	| IOT187 |	It's not sold in trouble tonight

EDL	00:49:56,479	00:49:57,247	| IOT187 |	Okay
EDL	00:49:57,247	00:49:58,783	| IOT187 |	So that's a lot about
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:01,343	| IOT187 |	And now let's move over to
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:03,647	| IOT187 |	How we get these things to talk to
EDL	00:50:03,647	00:50:04,159	| IOT187 |	The internet
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:06,975	| IOT187 |	Because in the last few years
EDL	00:50:07,487	00:50:08,767	| IOT187 |	I know that you guys lunch with
EDL	00:50:08,767	00:50:09,791	| IOT187 |	The Wi-Fi board
EDL	00:50:10,559	00:50:11,327	| IOT187 |	Some other
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:12,095	| IOT187 |	Lots of other board
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:14,143	| IOT187 |	Filtered out
EDL	00:50:14,143	00:50:15,167	| IOT187 |	Overtime
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:17,471	| IOT187 |	It was mostly Wi-Fi maybe Bluetooth
EDL	00:50:17,471	00:50:20,031	| IOT187 |	And now we're starting to see a lot of cellular
EDL	00:50:20,031	00:50:20,543	| IOT187 |	Modules
EDL	00:50:21,055	00:50:22,079	| IOT187 |	And I think that's
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:23,615	| IOT187 |	It's indicative of something
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:30,015	| IOT187 |	Talk to you since you guys recently launched
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:33,343	| IOT187 |	Bored talk to me about
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:33,855	| IOT187 |	Why
EDL	00:50:34,367	00:50:35,135	| IOT187 |	Is now the time

EDL	00:54:12,735	00:54:14,527	| IOT187 |	Advice for customers
EDL	00:54:16,319	00:54:20,671	| IOT187 |	Very simple things you know we have customers who have
EDL	00:54:20,671	00:54:22,719	| IOT187 |	So they can monitor the TV networks remotely
EDL	00:54:23,487	00:54:25,023	| IOT187 |	What about me
EDL	00:54:25,023	00:54:27,583	| IOT187 |	Cast this is been something that I've been following
EDL	00:54:27,583	00:54:30,143	| IOT187 |	For a couple years now but even in b i o t
EDL	00:54:30,655	00:54:34,495	| IOT187 |	Still pretty expensive they're not at $5 which is where I think
EDL	00:54:34,495	00:54:35,775	| IOT187 |	They really want them to be
EDL	00:54:35,775	00:54:37,055	| IOT187 |	I would like them to be even cheaper
EDL	00:54:37,567	00:54:38,847	| IOT187 |	$5
EDL	00:54:39,359	00:54:43,199	| IOT187 |	Which is easier one of the problems there is he still coming on ready to sell it can I miss
EDL	00:54:43,711	00:54:45,247	| IOT187 |	Point
EDL	00:54:45,247	00:54:49,087	| IOT187 |	Just nb-iot silicon radius of people making the sandwiches
EDL	00:54:50,879	00:54:51,391	| IOT187 |	So is God
EDL	00:54:53,183	00:54:55,231	| IOT187 |	Bad stuff is coming
EDL	00:54:55,231	00:54:56,767	| IOT187 |	It will take a little while but I think
EDL	00:54:56,767	00:54:57,535	| IOT187 |	Bear in mind
EDL	00:54:57,535	00:54:59,839	| IOT187 |	Network early right now
