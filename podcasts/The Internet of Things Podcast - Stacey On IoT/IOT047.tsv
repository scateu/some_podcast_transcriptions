EDL	00:00:08,704	00:00:12,544	| IOT047 |	Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast I am your host
EDL	00:00:12,544	00:00:15,104	| IOT047 |	Stacey Higginbotham and this is your co-host
EDL	00:00:15,104	00:00:16,128	| IOT047 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:16,128	00:00:20,992	| IOT047 |	If we have got an amazing show for you today because Mobile World Congress is happening
EDL	00:00:20,992	00:00:22,016	| IOT047 |	And because
EDL	00:00:22,016	00:00:23,296	| IOT047 |	I'm really seriously hot
EDL	00:00:23,296	00:00:24,832	| IOT047 |	Internet routers have been launched
EDL	00:00:24,832	00:00:25,344	| IOT047 |	This week
EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:27,392	| IOT047 |	So we're going to have
EDL	00:00:27,392	00:00:28,672	| IOT047 |	Eero routers
EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:30,720	| IOT047 |	We're going to have an update from Philips we're going to have
EDL	00:00:31,488	00:00:34,304	| IOT047 |	Numbers from Verizon we've got some Tyrone action
EDL	00:00:35,584	00:00:37,376	| IOT047 |	New chips for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:38,144	| IOT047 |	Make a new money
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:39,680	| IOT047 |	And a whole new network
EDL	00:00:40,192	00:00:40,704	| IOT047 |	12
EDL	00:00:42,496	00:00:43,264	| IOT047 |	Okay so
EDL	00:00:44,288	00:00:45,056	| IOT047 |	Let's start with
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:46,080	| IOT047 |	Eero
EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:49,920	| IOT047 |	Who actually their CEO Nick Weaver's Our Guest
EDL	00:00:50,432	00:00:53,504	| IOT047 |	And I actually also tried out the routers so
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:55,040	| IOT047 |	Free to talk about those first
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:56,064	| IOT047 |	This is cool now
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:58,624	| IOT047 |	I did not pre-order these I remember it
EDL	00:00:58,624	00:01:02,464	| IOT047 |	I want to say was a well over a year ago that Euro announce these
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:07,328	| IOT047 |	Small router / repeaters / metal mesh network devices
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:11,680	| IOT047 |	And they're much cheaper than they are today because they're available
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:17,056	| IOT047 |	Around now right for 199
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:19,360	| IOT047 |	Kickstarter
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:21,408	| IOT047 |	The crowdfunding will collect
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:23,968	| IOT047 |	125
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:29,600	| IOT047 |	And what's interesting about these I mention Mesh networking
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:32,928	| IOT047 |	Everything many people probably by multiple euros
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:36,000	| IOT047 |	And this present time in a free pack right now
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:40,096	| IOT047 |	499 and I think the kick-start price was 290 nights I wish I had
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:43,680	| IOT047 |	Me too because I'm going to tell you
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:45,728	| IOT047 |	I really like these routers
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:49,056	| IOT047 |	They're amazing but I definitely need three and in the evening
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:50,592	| IOT047 |	For in my house
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:52,384	| IOT047 |	Which means I am looking at
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:55,456	| IOT047 |	502 $700 worth of routers
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:57,504	| IOT047 |	Is a lot of routers
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:02:02,112	| IOT047 |	It is a lot of routers is also a lot of money and which you know some people say why not just
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:04,672	| IOT047 |	Go in and retrofit hardwire whatever
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:07,488	| IOT047 |	Your house is pre-wired I know but other people
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:08,768	| IOT047 |	Might consider that
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:12,096	| IOT047 |	But you don't you have more flexibility I think with the wireless network
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:13,376	| IOT047 |	Something to tell you
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:16,192	| IOT047 |	Tell me a couple things
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:19,520	| IOT047 |	I
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:20,288	| IOT047 |	Have
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,056	| IOT047 |	I really
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:21,824	| IOT047 |	Kinda complicated
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:23,872	| IOT047 |	House cuz it's really tallest really skinny
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:24,640	| IOT047 |	And it's really like
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,408	| IOT047 |	Long front to back
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,688	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:28,992	| IOT047 |	I've never likely to my house instead
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:29,760	| IOT047 |	Wifi
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:30,272	| IOT047 |	Router is
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,832	| IOT047 |	Right because you have like
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:35,904	| IOT047 |	Three stories plus like a rooftop
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,976	| IOT047 |	Yes and because I have always connected gadgets
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:43,072	| IOT047 |	Connected stuff in my garage I have connected devices on my roof
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,864	| IOT047 |	My house actually does
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:46,656	| IOT047 |	Need coverage for I feel it needs
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,936	| IOT047 |	Average cousin
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:51,008	| IOT047 |	There's no point in having a connected garage door opener that doesn't actually open anything
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:54,848	| IOT047 |	Good Wi-Fi and that's the point of Euro
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:03:00,992	| IOT047 |	If you think of nothing else the whole sole purpose of this company right now is to deliver
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,528	| IOT047 |	Really
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,552	| IOT047 |	Great Wi-Fi cover
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:04,576	| IOT047 |	Really easily
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:07,392	| IOT047 |	And that in itself is
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:08,160	| IOT047 |	Worth a lot for love
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:10,464	| IOT047 |	People so when I setup my network
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,488	| IOT047 |	I had
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,000	| IOT047 |	3x
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:14,816	| IOT047 |	Lights and are about a hundred and twenty-five
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:17,632	| IOT047 |	It's about a hundred fifty when I bought them 3 years ago
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:19,936	| IOT047 |	So they're they're actually
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:20,448	| IOT047 |	Copper bowl
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:23,008	| IOT047 |	Price and you can buy
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,080	| IOT047 |	It in the challenge with an access point is
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,360	| IOT047 |	They're kind of a mesh Network
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,640	| IOT047 |	But they're kind of a pain to set up
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,504	| IOT047 |	Captain assign IP addresses
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:37,088	| IOT047 |	Yeah and sometimes they create separate Networks
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:42,720	| IOT047 |	Experience depending what you buying we got some range extenders have created separate Networks
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:46,560	| IOT047 |	Yes that's what I was going to say
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,072	| IOT047 |	It's probably
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,608	| IOT047 |	Pretzel
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:50,144	| IOT047 |	The nice thing that the arrow is
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:56,032	| IOT047 |	The box is like looking at you and your phone is like your phone's like
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:04:02,432	| IOT047 |	He's like little pretty diagrams on it like I'm doing something magical and it's making these blinking little
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:03,200	| IOT047 |	Things
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:07,040	| IOT047 |	Magical and then like 30 seconds later it's like
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:08,832	| IOT047 |	So set up is easy
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,160	| IOT047 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,440	| IOT047 |	I have not set up a notch
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:19,839	| IOT047 |	Oh okay I have is pretty simple it's it's basically like setting up most any other connected device that's
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,863	| IOT047 |	Seamless to set up
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:24,703	| IOT047 |	These things are talking to each other so it's best the setup process is
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,007	| IOT047 |	Each one of these little boxes
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,799	| IOT047 |	If you have multiple of something that is
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:32,895	| IOT047 |	Are setting up a mesh Network and the ones singular
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,919	| IOT047 |	SSID or net
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,199	| IOT047 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:37,247	| IOT047 |	So you got one SSID
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,295	| IOT047 |	Yay and you can
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:43,903	| IOT047 |	These can actually be wired so in my case because I've got ethernet Jacks throughout my house
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:46,207	| IOT047 |	Minor all wired
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,231	| IOT047 |	But you can actually
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:49,023	| IOT047 |	Have them be Wireless
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,071	| IOT047 |	An attack
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,887	| IOT047 |	3pac you only get one ethernet
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,703	| IOT047 |	So that's to go from your modem
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:57,727	| IOT047 |	Eero
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:04,127	| IOT047 |	Right so the one hangs off your modem like a traditional router and then additional ones can either hang off those
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,407	| IOT047 |	I guess
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:07,199	| IOT047 |	Daisy chaining them
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,735	| IOT047 |	What are you doing that for
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:09,759	| IOT047 |	Wirelessly
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:10,271	| IOT047 |	Through Wi-Fi
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,063	| IOT047 |	Yes got it
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,087	| IOT047 |	Although they don't
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:13,855	| IOT047 |	Feel like there Daisy
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:14,879	| IOT047 |	They feel like
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:15,903	| IOT047 |	They're not actually
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:16,927	| IOT047 |	Gearbest
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,487	| IOT047 |	Okay
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:21,279	| IOT047 |	Wow complicated
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,071	| IOT047 |	So how does it work
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,863	| IOT047 |	It works really well
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,887	| IOT047 |	So like
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,423	| IOT047 |	The coolest thing was
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:28,959	| IOT047 |	In my house
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:32,799	| IOT047 |	Time Warner Cable who is my internet provider hit actually upgraded
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:35,359	| IOT047 |	They're upgrading whole country to 300 megabit
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:38,175	| IOT047 |	Their whole service footprint to 300 megabits per second
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,711	| IOT047 |	Service
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:42,271	| IOT047 |	And I was like I haven't gotten to yet
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,295	| IOT047 |	What they had
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,087	| IOT047 |	And I just didn't realize it because
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:45,855	| IOT047 |	Actually my access
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,647	| IOT047 |	Which I bought three years ago
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,511	| IOT047 |	They're probably
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:54,303	| IOT047 |	802 11
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:55,583	| IOT047 |	And the best
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:58,399	| IOT047 |	Yeah neither Gyros RAC
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,703	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,983	| IOT047 |	30C Trump's in
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:03,007	| IOT047 |	It does
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:04,287	| IOT047 |	It does
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:08,383	| IOT047 |	Ndng a day
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,919	| IOT047 |	All of the others
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:13,759	| IOT047 |	Switch is the Halos back for the Internet of Things
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:15,551	| IOT047 |	We'll talk about that some other time if it ever happens
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:17,087	| IOT047 |	It happen
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:19,135	| IOT047 |	I digress
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,207	| IOT047 |	Faster WiFi
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:24,767	| IOT047 |	The app is nice there's not a lot to it
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:26,047	| IOT047 |	Best feature
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:27,071	| IOT047 |	In the again
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:28,351	| IOT047 |	Coverage the next
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:30,655	| IOT047 |	Text feature that it's offering right now is
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,703	| IOT047 |	Guess networkx
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,215	| IOT047 |	SSO
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:36,287	| IOT047 |	I now have the ability to do instead of getting my guess
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,079	| IOT047 |	Act the actual SS
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:42,175	| IOT047 |	SSID and password
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:45,247	| IOT047 |	Social Network I can give them
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,039	| IOT047 |	The guest password
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:52,159	| IOT047 |	That the generates for me which is some weed whack password
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,951	| IOT047 |	And
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:56,255	| IOT047 |	I can text it to them or I can give it to him
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,535	| IOT047 |	And I can do it all for the app for lease
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:02,399	| IOT047 |	That is very cool and I should mention Eliza swimming today on Hub
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:07,007	| IOT047 |	The Google is adding this to the onhub very recently I haven't set it up yet but
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:10,079	| IOT047 |	Similar thing it you can use the app to set it up and then
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,359	| IOT047 |	Textured EMF share the
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,151	| IOT047 |	Information for Fergus
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:16,479	| IOT047 |	So don't have to get these little scrap of paper that's
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:20,319	| IOT047 |	Like the Wi-Fi password is this that you'll lose our look at
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:21,599	| IOT047 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:24,415	| IOT047 |	So it's super fun
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,695	| IOT047 |	I like them
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,743	| IOT047 |	They are expensive
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,815	| IOT047 |	Good Broadband cannot be be
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,887	| IOT047 |	So yeah I mean if you're going to pay for
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:37,471	| IOT047 |	You're taking your case 300 megabytes per second pay for 150
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:42,079	| IOT047 |	You want to have internal equipment that can actually handle that otherwise you're paying for something you can't really use
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,127	| IOT047 |	Can you can handle it everywhere
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,687	| IOT047 |	Everywhere in life
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:48,991	| IOT047 |	210 minutes of setup
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:51,807	| IOT047 |	Like literally it took me more time to run up and down the stairs
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:52,831	| IOT047 |	These things that place
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,135	| IOT047 |	Set them up
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:57,695	| IOT047 |	I am very tempted
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,207	| IOT047 |	Backpage
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:01,023	| IOT047 |	Make the investment because I love my onhub
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:04,863	| IOT047 |	But sometimes in certain areas the house it's just not cutting it
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:08,703	| IOT047 |	And I thought about other Alternatives so this might be one
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:14,079	| IOT047 |	I will say this I read a couple of other reviews on this because they all went live today that they were recording
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:14,847	| IOT047 |	And couple
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,663	| IOT047 |	What is a couple people commented about how
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:20,735	| IOT047 |	Eero requires in the app that have your
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,783	| IOT047 |	I think your email address but your
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,807	| IOT047 |	Phone number as well
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,855	| IOT047 |	Okay so I can explain this
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:29,951	| IOT047 |	And I was wondering if this comes up in your interview and if it does then we can just hold out till later
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,231	| IOT047 |	I don't remember
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,767	| IOT047 |	Alright well
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,047	| IOT047 |	Prescott weather
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:34,815	| IOT047 |	CC
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,351	| IOT047 |	If you're hearing this twice
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:36,863	| IOT047 |	It's because
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:43,263	| IOT047 |	Friend is actually security feature so it ties and all the stuff security stuff
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,591	| IOT047 |	Sony Cleaver the CEO
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:52,735	| IOT047 |	Said that so many customers were setting terrible passwords like password 1-2-3 was a favorite of everyone's
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:54,783	| IOT047 |	Videos like
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:09:00,671	| IOT047 |	And given all the scrutiny to router security lately he was like this is terrible so he said he's
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:03,487	| IOT047 |	He's not doing password so the reason why he has
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:09,887	| IOT047 |	Or the company has you give your email or your phone number is so it will email you or give you
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:12,191	| IOT047 |	You or text you a verification code
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,983	| IOT047 |	And so it's kind of a password
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:14,751	| IOT047 |	You
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,799	| IOT047 |	You answer that in and then you get the verification
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:21,919	| IOT047 |	Sentence for the setup of the actual router
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:26,015	| IOT047 |	Next to log into the system every time you need to log into
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:28,063	| IOT047 |	System
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,367	| IOT047 |	OKC
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:31,647	| IOT047 |	Every single
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:35,487	| IOT047 |	So what an end that makes sense so now I don't know if
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:41,375	| IOT047 |	Other people understood that from the other reviews I'm glad that you asked him that we found that out
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,167	| IOT047 |	I'm wondering then
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:43,935	| IOT047 |	Can you still
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:49,567	| IOT047 |	Normally set up a password for devices to connect your network or you still at your current
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,591	| IOT047 |	Wireless network
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:51,871	| IOT047 |	Will have it
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:52,639	| IOT047 |	Same password
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,175	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:57,247	| IOT047 |	My network like Stacy's home network
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:10:00,575	| IOT047 |	If my home network password was password one
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:04,159	| IOT047 |	23 it would still be I can still set my
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:07,487	| IOT047 |	My SSID for Stacy's home network
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:08,767	| IOT047 |	Ssids pass
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:11,583	| IOT047 |	He tried everything
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:15,679	| IOT047 |	So this was just to get into the app
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,215	| IOT047 |	Got it
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:19,007	| IOT047 |	Got it since I first line of defense
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,543	| IOT047 |	Which is you know
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:27,199	| IOT047 |	Cuz if you baby change the password on my
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,991	| IOT047 |	Like actual wireless network
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,271	| IOT047 |	I would come I would
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:33,343	| IOT047 |	Dumpty's routers in the ocean and then I would like
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,367	| IOT047 |	Set them on fire
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:40,255	| IOT047 |	I I know that's kind of like impossible to do but that's what I would do because I have so many devices
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:42,815	| IOT047 |	Changing the password
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,143	| IOT047 |	I get it
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:48,703	| IOT047 |	So yeah if you know my wireless password it's highly unlikely
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,055	| IOT047 |	Kevin's like
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:56,895	| IOT047 |	Haven't tried in awhile me see if I can
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,663	| IOT047 |	Turn lights on
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:04,063	| IOT047 |	All right speaking of Lights let's go
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:07,903	| IOT047 |	Good Segway but I'm not looking forward to sharing this news
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:10,207	| IOT047 |	We talked last week about Phillips
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:13,535	| IOT047 |	And they're Hue app and they updated it on the Android
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:16,095	| IOT047 |	Punched everyone Chagrin and they
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:19,167	| IOT047 |	February 12th after today
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:23,007	| IOT047 |	Permissions for Android 6.0 incorrectly
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,079	| IOT047 |	It sounds
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:32,479	| IOT047 |	Like and we mention this last week that it sounded like they implemented this incorrectly and it does not appear fix
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,759	| IOT047 |	Text as of yet as well
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:38,623	| IOT047 |	And if you missed our show last week basically if you've got the Philips Hue app right now
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:41,695	| IOT047 |	You'll start to see the app ask for
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,743	| IOT047 |	Individual permission
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:47,071	| IOT047 |	Android 6.0 marshmallow features
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,863	| IOT047 |	IPod Philips Hue 4
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:51,167	| IOT047 |	Doing what they should be doing to prepare their app for
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,703	| IOT047 |	Compatibility on marshmallow
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:56,287	| IOT047 |	The problem is two problems really one
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:12:03,199	| IOT047 |	Philips Hue haven't really made it clear why they need these permissions although I understand why and once you understand why you're probably
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,223	| IOT047 |	Oh okay I get it now
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,015	| IOT047 |	Regardless of that
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:12,671	| IOT047 |	The way the app permissions are implemented today in the current version of the app If you deny permission for one of the three things
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:15,743	| IOT047 |	History things are camera storage and location
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,791	| IOT047 |	The Apple workout
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:18,815	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:23,679	| IOT047 |	That's not how it's supposed to work basically if you don't want the app to have access to your camera
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:25,983	| IOT047 |	Which is actually needed to create light scenes
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:28,287	| IOT047 |	It should still work that function
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:30,335	| IOT047 |	Wouldn't work though the app itself should work
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:35,711	| IOT047 |	So really they got if they got to fix this we just before the show checked in the Play Store
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:41,855	| IOT047 |	And that's at the last couple days they're still getting hammered people cannot use the Philips Hue app why can't user lights
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:45,439	| IOT047 |	It's very frustrating and I hope it gets resolved soon
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,463	| IOT047 |	So yeah Phillips
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:50,047	| IOT047 |	We reached out to Phyllis before last week's show they didn't get back to me though until
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:52,095	| IOT047 |	A couple days ago so yeah
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,887	| IOT047 |	They just wanted to let us know
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:58,751	| IOT047 |	That and let everybody listen to the show and who might be affected in feeling kind of like or Phillips
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:05,663	| IOT047 |	Only makes use of these permissions when the functionality related to them is being used
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:08,479	| IOT047 |	I don't access to usage data for these permissions
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:10,015	| IOT047 |	Any other purpose than
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:13,599	| IOT047 |	What we talked about to creating light scenes
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:16,671	| IOT047 |	Storage is using is also used to create light
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,207	| IOT047 |	After photos
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,743	| IOT047 |	And location is
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:20,511	| IOT047 |	Is Portugal fencing
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:21,023	| IOT047 |	So that's it
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:23,839	| IOT047 |	But they are also currently working on a fix for this
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:26,143	| IOT047 |	So it's implemented correctly
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:29,471	| IOT047 |	So they're going to come back to us when they've done that fix
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:32,543	| IOT047 |	We really hope it's soon because they are taking a beating in the App Store
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:35,359	| IOT047 |	And hopefully that happens
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,639	| IOT047 |	That is that
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:38,687	| IOT047 |	Phillips is on it you guys
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,711	| IOT047 |	Bingo that you're upset
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:43,295	| IOT047 |	But they're not using your data in any weird nefarious way so please
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:49,439	| IOT047 |	Feel free to continue using Phillips and Grant them those permissions or feel free not to do it
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,719	| IOT047 |	And maybe don't
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:52,255	| IOT047 |	Top 10 light some candles
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,119	| IOT047 |	Enjoy okay
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:00,959	| IOT047 |	So let's see we've got news Verizon
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,495	| IOT047 |	Verizon is doing
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:05,055	| IOT047 |	Really well it's catching up to its it's
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:07,615	| IOT047 |	Ginormous rival AT&T in the iot space
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:08,895	| IOT047 |	Bear
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:13,759	| IOT047 |	Revenue from their iot and telematics business has total 690 million
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:16,063	| IOT047 |	As of year-end in 2050
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:17,855	| IOT047 |	Teen Witch is up 18%
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,135	| IOT047 |	Which is
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,415	| IOT047 |	Not too shabby
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,975	| IOT047 |	Yeah I think that 18% is
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:28,095	| IOT047 |	Yearly growth and I dug around us and another figure to put this in perspective
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:30,655	| IOT047 |	Back on October 28th when they
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,423	| IOT047 |	Announce their
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:33,215	| IOT047 |	Thingspace platform
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:37,567	| IOT047 |	They had said then that their IRT and telematics revenues were at
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:39,871	| IOT047 |	495 million year-to-date
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:43,711	| IOT047 |	So from October 28th will basically two months the last two months
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:48,831	| IOT047 |	They've jumped the revenue for 495 million to what we just say 600 end
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:51,135	| IOT047 |	90 million + 90 million
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:52,159	| IOT047 |	And that's that
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:52,927	| IOT047 |	Pretty good
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:57,535	| IOT047 |	But as you mentioned they're just still catching up so they're big rival AT&T
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:15:02,399	| IOT047 |	Think you mentioned before the show they were there IRT business was a billion-dollar business
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:03,423	| IOT047 |	As of last year
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:03,935	| IOT047 |	It was on Pace
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:04,959	| IOT047 |	Billion dollar bill
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:06,751	| IOT047 |	15
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:13,151	| IOT047 |	And a lot of AT&T business comes from the connected car cuz they've got to pick up for the fat Tesla they've got out
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,687	| IOT047 |	They got a lot
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,199	| IOT047 |	Golang
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,783	| IOT047 |	Not axle nut Studebaker
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:25,439	| IOT047 |	Verizon thingspace is there developer platform
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,719	| IOT047 |	Just in case you guys are
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,999	| IOT047 |	Like what what
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:29,791	| IOT047 |	It is a cloud platform
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:30,303	| IOT047 |	For Developers
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:35,935	| IOT047 |	You know Verizon has been very upfront about how it's looking at this it is
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:38,495	| IOT047 |	Definitely saying we have got to sell more than connectivity
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:45,407	| IOT047 |	That is that is not going to be a big Revenue grab which I am thankful for because then the data plans would be you know just
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,175	| IOT047 |	Crazy insane
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:47,711	| IOT047 |	Expensive
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:51,295	| IOT047 |	And they're trying to sell strategy around this so there
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,063	| IOT047 |	Holding
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:54,111	| IOT047 |	Cloud together with Consulting
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:58,207	| IOT047 |	And trying to create these Partnerships with companies that are already in the space
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:59,231	| IOT047 |	To build kind of
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:02,815	| IOT047 |	It's basically a Consulting and systems integrator kinda
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:08,959	| IOT047 |	They worked quite a bit with Nokian Erickson on the on the network itself and what they're saying
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:16,127	| IOT047 |	I'll see you today actually from Emma World Congress they said they now have 4,000 more than 4,000 Developers
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:17,407	| IOT047 |	On thingspace which is
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:21,503	| IOT047 |	I'm impressed by the number it may concern they just launched it back at the very end of October
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:25,855	| IOT047 |	Yeah that's that's pretty good I don't know
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,623	| IOT047 |	I mean it
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,391	| IOT047 |	How do we count
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,999	| IOT047 |	Yeah that's it a tough
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:38,399	| IOT047 |	It's hard to quantify minutes it's just a single data point I mean I'm curious to see who actually does
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:40,959	| IOT047 |	Some of these developers and partners are what products
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:42,751	| IOT047 |	Delivered or plan to deliver
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,823	| IOT047 |	So also
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:46,847	| IOT047 |	NWC
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:51,711	| IOT047 |	Trendsetter Cloud apis on things face will be available soon in beta
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:54,271	| IOT047 |	Statway dad's can create mobile apps
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:56,831	| IOT047 |	Retrieve photos video music and other clouds
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,855	| IOT047 |	Content so
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:00,671	| IOT047 |	It's all very interesting kind of reminds me of
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,951	| IOT047 |	What Amazon is doing with
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:04,255	| IOT047 |	My birthday for devices but that's just me
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:08,095	| IOT047 |	It would be here
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:12,703	| IOT047 |	I'm also at Mobile World Congress because how can we not talk about the show with it going on
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:13,983	| IOT047 |	This week
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:16,799	| IOT047 |	AT&T announced a plan to
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:18,079	| IOT047 |	Well is it a plant
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,663	| IOT047 |	Degree to test
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,967	| IOT047 |	Agreed to test for G
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:27,295	| IOT047 |	Drones in conjunction with until
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:31,135	| IOT047 |	So what we've got basically is drones that are capable of
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:34,207	| IOT047 |	Assuring really shrink data really fast
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:40,863	| IOT047 |	Not only that I mean I look at this as somebody who owns a drone and yes I did register I do have my FAA number
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,167	| IOT047 |	What's interesting is
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:47,007	| IOT047 |	I can pretty much only use my drone in line of sight because it's using Wi-Fi
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:52,895	| IOT047 |	So I've got a pretty limited range when you really think about it compared to 4G all the sudden you open up to a
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,943	| IOT047 |	I offered you networking
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,991	| IOT047 |	Songs on following the rules
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:58,271	| IOT047 |	Fly my drone
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:00,063	| IOT047 |	10 miles away
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:03,647	| IOT047 |	Oh my gosh your drone could become a package delivered
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:05,183	| IOT047 |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,975	| IOT047 |	Exactly you know what Amazon it
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:10,559	| IOT047 |	Do those round thing for deliveries but why not like pickup
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:14,143	| IOT047 |	Let me just have my drone drop down loaded up and
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:17,215	| IOT047 |	You could become like an eardrum could become like the equivalent of a
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:17,727	| IOT047 |	Uber driver
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,567	| IOT047 |	Logistics
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:22,335	| IOT047 |	Boggles my mind
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:23,615	| IOT047 |	Cool
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,383	| IOT047 |	But yes
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:29,247	| IOT047 |	Yes this could be awesome it also kind of creates new ways to police the space if you think about
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,295	| IOT047 |	What kind of things you can do with like
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,831	| IOT047 |	Cellular data and
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,599	| IOT047 |	The controls you have there
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:37,439	| IOT047 |	Not only did they talk to each other to avoid collisions
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:40,511	| IOT047 |	The Operators could then have a lot more
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,535	| IOT047 |	Control over
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:43,071	| IOT047 |	How these things are running
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:44,607	| IOT047 |	Because I can
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:47,679	| IOT047 |	Control how they're talking to each other
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:52,287	| IOT047 |	Yeah it does it to me because I wasn't thinking about it no with multiple drones you know
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,615	| IOT047 |	Turn on Wi-Fi networks here you know
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:57,663	| IOT047 |	Where were separate where were
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:19:01,247	| IOT047 |	Not able to share data between drones or talk to each other or someone like that
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:03,551	| IOT047 |	I bet you put us all on the same network
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:05,855	| IOT047 |	Responsibilities
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,695	| IOT047 |	So exciting news there
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:10,463	| IOT047 |	We'll keep an eye on that
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:13,535	| IOT047 |	Also at Mobile World Congress Nokia announced
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:14,559	| IOT047 |	Money
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:20,447	| IOT047 |	They have create Nokia growth Partners has created a 350 million dollar internet-of-things fund
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,983	| IOT047 |	And this is actually for
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:24,031	| IOT047 |	It looks like it's more for
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:27,103	| IOT047 |	Technologies to enable the internet of things which
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,127	| IOT047 |	Yay
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:29,407	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:32,479	| IOT047 |	Not just like hey I've got a connected fork for you but
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:33,503	| IOT047 |	Things like
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:39,647	| IOT047 |	I've got some I got a cool technology for real-time data access or maybe I've got like a new way to control drones over LTE
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:43,487	| IOT047 |	These are the kind of ideas you can give to them and
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:45,535	| IOT047 |	This is a global fund so
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,815	| IOT047 |	It's not just you eccentric
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,095	| IOT047 |	Yaever
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,887	| IOT047 |	I have not limited to espoo Finland
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,935	| IOT047 |	Also not limited espoo Finland
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:55,007	| IOT047 |	I like to say
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:19:59,615	| IOT047 |	The arm
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:02,687	| IOT047 |	You want to talk about the army yes yes yes
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:06,271	| IOT047 |	What is happening arm has a new chip that is
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:09,599	| IOT047 |	Probably going to find its way into maybe like a Raspberry Pi device
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,879	| IOT047 |	But also
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:15,487	| IOT047 |	Looks really good for wearables it's the cortex a 30
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:16,255	| IOT047 |	2
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:18,303	| IOT047 |	The big deal here is
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:23,935	| IOT047 |	Arm did something smart we talked about this before the show and I think we're both in agreement that you can disagree if you'd like
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:29,055	| IOT047 |	They decided to make the CPU just 32-bit compatible not 64-bit
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:36,479	| IOT047 |	What kind of work were bandanas around thinking that kind of makes sense because you know with a with a wearable device a real small device
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:40,575	| IOT047 |	Are you going to need to address more than 4GB of memory probably not
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:44,159	| IOT047 |	So that introduces some overhead gives them a little bit more
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:46,463	| IOT047 |	Power efficiency this thing
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:52,863	| IOT047 |	Jeezy say it's less than 4 milliwatts of power at 100 megahertz clock speed
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,655	| IOT047 |	You can have a
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:58,495	| IOT047 |	Quad-core version that's where it's less than 75 milliwatts
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:01,311	| IOT047 |	Procore at 1 gigahertz scale it up
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:05,151	| IOT047 |	How do you say to recently fast speeds for something like a where Laura or a pie
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:08,223	| IOT047 |	But they're also saying no internet of things things my
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:10,015	| IOT047 |	Like this nicely so
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:10,783	| IOT047 |	It's interesting
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:13,343	| IOT047 |	There's a couple things interesting here and
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:15,135	| IOT047 |	You named almost
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:17,696	| IOT047 |	And I just want to break it down for people who are like
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:19,232	| IOT047 |	What the heck
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:21,024	| IOT047 |	Just happened Kevin was like
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:23,072	| IOT047 |	Talking like a normal human being and then he just like
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,400	| IOT047 |	Yeah
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:27,168	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:27,936	| IOT047 |	Artmix
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:30,240	| IOT047 |	Ship designs roots and I'm going to give it a shot
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:32,288	| IOT047 |	I may not do any better than Kevin
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:35,104	| IOT047 |	Arm is not actually it doesn't make physical chips
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,384	| IOT047 |	It makes it designs
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:38,176	| IOT047 |	Seven other companies like apple or
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:41,248	| IOT047 |	Samsung Cloud
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:42,528	| IOT047 |	Take the designs that are make
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:44,832	| IOT047 |	And actually makes physical chips
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:47,904	| IOT047 |	Specially designed ships and other people make the chips for the butt
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:50,208	| IOT047 |	So fun being complicated
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:52,256	| IOT047 |	What happened in Computing is
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:55,328	| IOT047 |	There's like this whole like end of Moore's law say
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,888	| IOT047 |	Great and I'm going to I'm going to go there be
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:01,472	| IOT047 |	Because I think this is really a big Transit is really exciting and we're talking
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:03,008	| IOT047 |	Even if this weren't iot show
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:06,080	| IOT047 |	Moore's law states the number of transistors on a chip
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:07,360	| IOT047 |	Doubles every two years
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:09,408	| IOT047 |	And because of that
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,176	| IOT047 |	Are chips are gotten
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:12,480	| IOT047 |	Just much faster
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:13,760	| IOT047 |	Art store just got
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:16,832	| IOT047 |	You've got more storage for less money it's amazing right
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:19,136	| IOT047 |	But what's happened is we just can't do that anymore
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:21,696	| IOT047 |	At this point we
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:22,976	| IOT047 |	No we were going to get the
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:28,096	| IOT047 |	There for years but we're at this point where we've been experimenting with all these crazy new architectures
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:31,168	| IOT047 |	Because we don't actually cedar chips to get faster anymore because
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:33,728	| IOT047 |	It's way cooler if they're more power-efficient
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:38,592	| IOT047 |	If they're smaller because we're using our chips not just in these massive servers and
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:40,896	| IOT047 |	Computers but were using them in like
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:43,712	| IOT047 |	Wrist watches in washing machines and all these other crazy place
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:46,528	| IOT047 |	So with this computer
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:47,808	| IOT047 |	Arm is actually saying
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:52,672	| IOT047 |	Total race to get faster and faster and party that's like
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:55,232	| IOT047 |	The fact that they've gone these 64-bit chips
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:58,816	| IOT047 |	Because you know our smartphones and needed to get faster and
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:01,632	| IOT047 |	You know they want to get in the server so those have to be pastor
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,656	| IOT047 |	Who said hey wait
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,168	| IOT047 |	Wait
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,216	| IOT047 |	We don't always have to go that way
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:09,056	| IOT047 |	We could actually take a step back and do a 32-bit computer
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:10,336	| IOT047 |	Did still
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:12,640	| IOT047 |	Got this more modern instruction set
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:15,712	| IOT047 |	And has his more modern architecture
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,992	| IOT047 |	Do it because
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:18,528	| IOT047 |	All kinds of crazy
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:21,088	| IOT047 |	So I think that's kind of like
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:23,904	| IOT047 |	Big picture of really cool things
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:24,928	| IOT047 |	What's happening
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:26,720	| IOT047 |	And I don't know if that helps
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,768	| IOT047 |	And what time
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,280	| IOT047 |	Spell memories
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,328	| IOT047 |	Make any sense
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:32,608	| IOT047 |	But yeah
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:33,632	| IOT047 |	Is awesome
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:34,912	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:36,960	| IOT047 |	That's that's that
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:39,520	| IOT047 |	Blissey final thing should we talk about
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:41,056	| IOT047 |	New wireless networks
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,616	| IOT047 |	What about now
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,920	| IOT047 |	So company called ingenue
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:48,224	| IOT047 |	Launch a wireless network
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:48,992	| IOT047 |	4
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:50,016	| IOT047 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:51,552	| IOT047 |	It's kind of like sigfox
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:52,576	| IOT047 |	Or
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:55,136	| IOT047 |	Laura is a standard a section out of
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,160	| IOT047 |	Separate network but it
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,440	| IOT047 |	It's a separate radio standard for
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:23:59,488	| IOT047 |	Networks
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,536	| IOT047 |	Carrie like small amounts of data
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,840	| IOT047 |	And are usually pretty cheap to run
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,376	| IOT047 |	And there
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:07,168	| IOT047 |	I never really interesting kind of option
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:08,704	| IOT047 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:14,592	| IOT047 |	So ingenue is saying they said it Mobile World Congress that they were going to lunch this network
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:15,360	| IOT047 |	In
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,896	| IOT047 |	Pitea bunch of different places yes
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:20,224	| IOT047 |	Yeah I think they said they have 30
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:20,736	| IOT047 |	8
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:23,296	| IOT047 |	Private networks now in
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:25,600	| IOT047 |	25 countries that will be providing
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:27,904	| IOT047 |	Connectivity in 25 countries for machine traffic
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:31,232	| IOT047 |	Yes and these countries included the US
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:34,560	| IOT047 |	But they also include Canada Nigeria
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:35,072	| IOT047 |	Chili
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:37,120	| IOT047 |	Japan and New Zealand
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:37,632	| IOT047 |	South
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:38,656	| IOT047 |	Thailand
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,192	| IOT047 |	United Arab Emirates
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:43,264	| IOT047 |	I'm at home. I was going to say I'm about to sing It's a Small World
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,056	| IOT047 |	Yeah
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:46,592	| IOT047 |	Don't do that no no no
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:48,896	| IOT047 |	So the cool think so
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:55,040	| IOT047 |	What they use is a use a radio technology they don't use Laura they don't use sick foxes technology they use something called
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,344	| IOT047 |	Have to find it because
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,368	| IOT047 |	It's crazy acronym
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:01,440	| IOT047 |	RPM a random phase multiple access
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:03,488	| IOT047 |	Great you want to tell us what that is
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:09,376	| IOT047 |	I'm not sure what it is it sounds like a teleporter to me
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:11,936	| IOT047 |	Okay basically it's a low power
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:14,752	| IOT047 |	Network that they built and it only
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:21,408	| IOT047 |	Has the only carries that are small bits of data it's not very fast it's not like I'm far 4 G networks is
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,968	| IOT047 |	Purpose Driven Network
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:30,624	| IOT047 |	I think I'd seen that the top speed of the network is like 624 kilobits per second
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:33,184	| IOT047 |	When is basically machine-to-machine specific Network
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:36,768	| IOT047 |	Yes it is 624 kilobits per second
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:40,608	| IOT047 |	That's download speeds than upload speeds r156
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:41,376	| IOT047 |	Kilobits per second
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:42,400	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:45,472	| IOT047 |	But slower than 2G
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:47,008	| IOT047 |	Yeah I was going to say it's like you're
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:51,104	| IOT047 |	But interesting thing to me is
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:52,896	| IOT047 |	The range of this network
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:54,688	| IOT047 |	Because they're carrying
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:56,224	| IOT047 |	Small bits of data
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:26:01,088	| IOT047 |	Slower speeds and they've got their RPM a protocol which again I don't have the details of
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,624	| IOT047 |	They can have
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:04,928	| IOT047 |	Cellular towers for this network that are
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:07,744	| IOT047 |	1 towering cover 300 square miles which is
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:11,840	| IOT047 |	Not many Towers compared to our heavy data-centric networks of today
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:14,912	| IOT047 |	It's true but it does still require Towers
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:15,680	| IOT047 |	Which means
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:18,496	| IOT047 |	And all of these networks actually do require
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:21,056	| IOT047 |	If a significant investment which makes them kind of
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:25,664	| IOT047 |	You know whatever I am looking at these types of networks or any type of wireless network
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:26,944	| IOT047 |	Because everybody has a dream
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:28,736	| IOT047 |	I'm starting to wireless network
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:32,832	| IOT047 |	A lot of people I need half the screen
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:38,208	| IOT047 |	You always have to look at things like the economics of it which are how far apart of your Towers cuz that's a big city
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:39,488	| IOT047 |	Investment
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,512	| IOT047 |	Read how
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:42,048	| IOT047 |	How are you going to get
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:45,632	| IOT047 |	Any sort of specialized radio protocol like RPM
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:49,984	| IOT047 |	Requires some sort of specialized
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:52,800	| IOT047 |	Chip to read that radio protocol in the device
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,568	| IOT047 |	Espresso
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:56,384	| IOT047 |	You're going to have a special purpose to buy so how are they going to get that
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,176	| IOT047 |	Chores who are their partner
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:06,112	| IOT047 |	Interesting in this case is the people behind this company ingenue and it used to be known as Reiko Wireless
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:10,208	| IOT047 |	Under that name of the work with T-Mobile and was part of its in Denver
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:16,608	| IOT047 |	On the board of ingenue is Ivan Seidenberg who was the former CEO
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:17,888	| IOT047 |	Verizon
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:22,496	| IOT047 |	And dr. Andrew viterbi who is the former CTO Qualcomm
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:24,032	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:27,104	| IOT047 |	Those are actually two very smart guys when it comes to radio
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,384	| IOT047 |	Technology
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:31,712	| IOT047 |	And cellular at the economics of building a cellular wireless network
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,224	| IOT047 |	Sound like
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:34,272	| IOT047 |	Could be cool
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:37,088	| IOT047 |	Lot of challenges yet I think but
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,112	| IOT047 |	Yakiniku
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:43,488	| IOT047 |	Yeah I'm still I'm always skeptical about these just because I'm like you know what's you have data
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,792	| IOT047 |	You never say this is enough data
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:47,328	| IOT047 |	He always want more more
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:52,192	| IOT047 |	But you don't baby so into do without their its competitors or things like Laura
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:52,960	| IOT047 |	Like
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:53,728	| IOT047 |	Sigfox
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:57,568	| IOT047 |	And you know that the cellular carriers are also testing
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:59,104	| IOT047 |	You know like lte-m
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:00,640	| IOT047 |	So the LTE machine Networks
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:04,480	| IOT047 |	We'll just have to see so keep an eye on the space because it's
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:05,504	| IOT047 |	In a lot of
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:08,832	| IOT047 |	Storm and fury here but I just don't know if there's much
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:12,672	| IOT047 |	I'm curious as to what spectrum there going to be using and someone as well
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,768	| IOT047 |	Well that's that's a big issue
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:17,280	| IOT047 |	That is it
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,632	| IOT047 |	Alright well
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:24,192	| IOT047 |	You guys have been so patient
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,728	| IOT047 |	Now we can
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:28,032	| IOT047 |	Stay tuned for a chat with Nick Weaver
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:30,848	| IOT047 |	Who is the CEO of hero who's going to talk about
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:37,760	| IOT047 |	Well he may talk about some of the things we've already talked about but he's also a lot more stay
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:43,904	| IOT047 |	Listening
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:48,768	| IOT047 |	Hey everyone it's Stacey Higginbotham and you are listening to The Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:51,072	| IOT047 |	And today my guest is Nick
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:54,912	| IOT047 |	Weaver and he is the co-founder and CEO of Eero
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,448	| IOT047 |	Hey Nick how are you doing
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:58,496	| IOT047 |	Great City how are you doing
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:01,824	| IOT047 |	So let's get started with
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:03,360	| IOT047 |	What is Eero
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:06,432	| IOT047 |	Yeah so euro is a
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:08,992	| IOT047 |	A really simple whole home wi-fi system
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:11,808	| IOT047 |	Key difference between
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:13,344	| IOT047 |	What folks normally have
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:15,904	| IOT047 |	To power their home Wi-Fi is
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:17,184	| IOT047 |	It's typically
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:19,232	| IOT047 |	One router
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:21,024	| IOT047 |	And so what we
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:23,328	| IOT047 |	Offer instead is this whole home system
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,864	| IOT047 |	Where you at multiple units
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:26,656	| IOT047 |	All connect to each other
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:27,424	| IOT047 |	City of one
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:31,776	| IOT047 |	Single Wi-Fi network name that blankets every corner of your home with
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:33,312	| IOT047 |	With really fast reliable
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:34,848	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,896	| IOT047 |	Just for people listening
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:37,920	| IOT047 |	I have had
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:39,712	| IOT047 |	Whole-home reliable
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,480	| IOT047 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:42,016	| IOT047 |	But I had mine because I had
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:45,088	| IOT047 |	I have three access points to my house plus my router
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:46,112	| IOT047 |	And
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:51,488	| IOT047 |	Then Nick came over and he and his team installed Eros
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,024	| IOT047 |	Which
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:53,536	| IOT047 |	Installed apps
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:56,096	| IOT047 |	Because they are really easy
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:58,400	| IOT047 |	Kevin and I have already talked about it
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:59,936	| IOT047 |	Most people though you're right
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:00,960	| IOT047 |	They buy a router
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:03,008	| IOT047 |	They're like oh this is great except
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:03,520	| IOT047 |	It doesn't your
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:05,824	| IOT047 |	Exactly
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:10,432	| IOT047 |	It is one problem and I like to think of it as
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:12,736	| IOT047 |	You're part of this whole new generation
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,272	| IOT047 |	Companies that are alike
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:16,320	| IOT047 |	My God my Wi-Fi router
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:16,832	| IOT047 |	Is
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:20,928	| IOT047 |	Probably one of the most important pieces of equipment in my home
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:24,256	| IOT047 |	Terrible it hasn't changed in like a decade
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:25,792	| IOT047 |	We're more
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:27,840	| IOT047 |	And
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:33,472	| IOT047 |	It's got those janky software it's probably a security risk is this article for the Wall Street Journal has discovered
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:35,264	| IOT047 |	And you guys set out
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:36,288	| IOT047 |	2 years ago
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:42,432	| IOT047 |	Yeah we got started in the beginning of 2014 so you guys set out two years ago to change all that
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,224	| IOT047 |	And so
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:46,272	| IOT047 |	Let's talk about what you did because
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:49,344	| IOT047 |	Design is probably the first thing people notice
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,368	| IOT047 |	This is a
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:52,160	| IOT047 |	Pretty little white box
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:54,720	| IOT047 |	So when I get to spend a lot of time talking about that
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:55,488	| IOT047 |	But then
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:31:00,096	| IOT047 |	The other thing they're going to notice is the fact that each one of these little white boxes cost $199
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,632	| IOT047 |	Kind of a lot for a router
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,424	| IOT047 |	So what are you
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:03,936	| IOT047 |	You getting
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:07,520	| IOT047 |	Yes so with with Ichiro you're getting
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:09,824	| IOT047 |	Some of the highest performance
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:12,128	| IOT047 |	Home WiFi coverage available
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:13,408	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:15,712	| IOT047 |	A single unit retails for 199
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:19,552	| IOT047 |	And if you buy system which starts with three units
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:21,344	| IOT047 |	Prices for 99
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:26,976	| IOT047 |	What you're getting with Eero is you know if you go look at the
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:28,512	| IOT047 |	Home networking category
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:30,560	| IOT047 |	You'll see there's Home wireless routers
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:31,584	| IOT047 |	Sherpas home
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:33,376	| IOT047 |	Wireless access points
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:35,936	| IOT047 |	And there's also things called
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:36,960	| IOT047 |	Range extenders
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:38,496	| IOT047 |	For wireless extender
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:40,800	| IOT047 |	What what year was it
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:43,104	| IOT047 |	It's all three of those things all in one box
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:45,664	| IOT047 |	And our software we felt
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:48,224	| IOT047 |	Well automatically detect
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:49,760	| IOT047 |	How your system setup
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:52,064	| IOT047 |	And optimize your network
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:54,112	| IOT047 |	Docker no configuration no settings
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:56,928	| IOT047 |	All you have to do is just say I want to
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:57,696	| IOT047 |	Network
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:32:01,536	| IOT047 |	With this network name and with this password and then you're up and running
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:02,304	| IOT047 |	So you got
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:04,096	| IOT047 |	These guys switch
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:06,656	| IOT047 |	Really was as simple as I took it
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:09,984	| IOT047 |	Brand of software
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:13,056	| IOT047 |	On the app I downloaded the app and
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:17,408	| IOT047 |	Do you want to add an arrow and I was like yes I do
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,432	| IOT047 |	It was like
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:20,736	| IOT047 |	It's on the Eero
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:22,016	| IOT047 |	There was like
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:25,344	| IOT047 |	I found the Eero connected the arrow in the air was like
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:29,184	| IOT047 |	The lights the lights the lights
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:30,720	| IOT047 |	It was
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:32,256	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:33,280	| IOT047 |	In my network
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:37,376	| IOT047 |	It was stopping it from being awesome was actually my old school switches
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:38,400	| IOT047 |	Which
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:40,960	| IOT047 |	Nick has kindly sent me an email news like
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:43,776	| IOT047 |	Hey Stacy your switches are for a hundred my networking
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:48,128	| IOT047 |	Which I thought was cool but I couldn't see that on my own
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:51,200	| IOT047 |	What we do
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:51,968	| IOT047 |	Every Network
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:54,016	| IOT047 |	Is constantly running Diagnostics
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:55,296	| IOT047 |	And
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:59,904	| IOT047 |	Alpha Diagnostics improve more and more that information will find its way
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:01,440	| IOT047 |	In2 into the app
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:04,768	| IOT047 |	So let's talk about the app
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:05,536	| IOT047 |	Because
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:07,584	| IOT047 |	Really that's kind of I think that's probably
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:10,912	| IOT047 |	Totally agree
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:13,472	| IOT047 |	Oh wait before this that we have to tell everybody
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:14,496	| IOT047 |	Why
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:16,288	| IOT047 |	Why with the internet
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:18,592	| IOT047 |	Things podcast
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:20,640	| IOT047 |	Do we care about
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:21,152	| IOT047 |	Better wife
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:29,600	| IOT047 |	Yeah it's so it's so what's what's been fascinating over the last couple years is just the number of devices that are connected
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:33,440	| IOT047 |	So not news to you or anyone else who's listening
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:40,864	| IOT047 |	You know we now have connected thermostat speakers camera sensors blinds lights
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:43,936	| IOT047 |	Events the list goes on and on and on
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:46,496	| IOT047 |	And as all these devices come online
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:48,544	| IOT047 |	They need to connect an
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:50,336	| IOT047 |	Every corner of your home
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:52,896	| IOT047 |	So when you don't have great connectivity
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:54,432	| IOT047 |	It's really
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:56,480	| IOT047 |	Card for these connected devices to come to life
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:58,016	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:02,112	| IOT047 |	There's there's a combination of the number of devices and types of devices that are connecting
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:04,416	| IOT047 |	And
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:07,744	| IOT047 |	Cutting the cord has actually taken hold
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:08,768	| IOT047 |	Where
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:12,096	| IOT047 |	People are now streaming video everywhere their home they aren't relying on
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:14,912	| IOT047 |	Just their cable or satellite provider
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:17,728	| IOT047 |	So you have these two forces murdering one is
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:19,008	| IOT047 |	Lots of devices
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:21,056	| IOT047 |	Disconnected everywhere and the other is
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:23,616	| IOT047 |	You need really high speed reliable
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:25,152	| IOT047 |	Connectivity
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:27,712	| IOT047 |	To stream video in every room in your home
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:28,224	| IOT047 |	Got it
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:31,808	| IOT047 |	Totally attached to the first which is
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:32,576	| IOT047 |	I have
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:36,672	| IOT047 |	Sonos speakers on my roof and then all the way down in my garage I have
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:38,464	| IOT047 |	Actually I have a Tesla.
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:41,024	| IOT047 |	Needs over-the-air updates via Wireless
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:43,840	| IOT047 |	And I also have a MyQ garage door opener that it's like
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:46,144	| IOT047 |	I'm connected to WiFi as well
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:47,168	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:48,960	| IOT047 |	Yeah
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:50,752	| IOT047 |	So Wi-Fi totally important to me
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:54,336	| IOT047 |	Let's sew on the connectivity front my TVs are Hardware
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:56,128	| IOT047 |	Which I totally recommend to anyone who can do it
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,432	| IOT047 |	But if you can't I did run some
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:00,224	| IOT047 |	I was watching something on a tablet
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:01,760	| IOT047 |	Over this since I was like hey
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:03,552	| IOT047 |	It's not stuttering
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:04,064	| IOT047 |	Nice
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:07,136	| IOT047 |	What is Sutter's I'm sure that's not necessarily my
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:09,440	| IOT047 |	My face at work it could just be my highest p
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:12,256	| IOT047 |	Which actually brings me to a question because I thought
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:13,280	| IOT047 |	Given
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:16,096	| IOT047 |	The Diagnostics you guys have in
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:16,864	| IOT047 |	If you have
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:21,728	| IOT047 |	A huge customer base you're going to start seeing a lot of really interesting data about
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:26,080	| IOT047 |	Kind of broadband speeds and connectivity just around
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:27,872	| IOT047 |	Hopefully the country depending on how
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:29,920	| IOT047 |	How large customer base you get
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:32,736	| IOT047 |	Is that something you're kind of thinking about using
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:35,296	| IOT047 |	Or if you're totally correct that's
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:38,112	| IOT047 |	That's information that we do have and we monitor really closely
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:40,928	| IOT047 |	The reason we monitor that closely is
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:43,744	| IOT047 |	Can directly impact somebody's experience with their Network
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:48,608	| IOT047 |	So what we found in our peda. Where we have
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:51,680	| IOT047 |	Under the customers and thousand of Eros online
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:54,240	| IOT047 |	As you can see the Ebbs and flows
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:56,288	| IOT047 |	Your connectivity across the country
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:02,432	| IOT047 |	Well you can see everything from weather creating outages
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,200	| IOT047 |	2
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:04,992	| IOT047 |	Certain parts of the country have faster
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:08,064	| IOT047 |	A burger medium Connections in other parts of the country
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:11,136	| IOT047 |	And it's so as more and more your networks come online
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:14,976	| IOT047 |	That becomes a really interesting dataset to understand
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:17,536	| IOT047 |	Exactly how well does the internet work
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:21,376	| IOT047 |	From a speed and reliability perspective everywhere in the US
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:24,192	| IOT047 |	So where would you like to live based on the data you seen
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:26,496	| IOT047 |	Where does someone who really loves Broadband Bridge today
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,032	| IOT047 |	Where should I move
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:31,360	| IOT047 |	Yeah it's so it it's interesting there's
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:37,248	| IOT047 |	Median speeds are definitely faster in call the top 30 metropolitan areas
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:39,808	| IOT047 |	But then you also have these outliers we're
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:40,576	| IOT047 |	You have
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:44,416	| IOT047 |	Regional providers that that might have their own fiber
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:46,976	| IOT047 |	Where you get really really fast connections
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:50,304	| IOT047 |	And in some smaller geographies across the country
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:56,192	| IOT047 |	Exciting all right let's take it back to the house and let's take it back to kind of
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:37:01,824	| IOT047 |	What you guys are planning to do with this because one of the features you'll have is kind of a guest Network
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:04,896	| IOT047 |	You make it very easy for me to create a guest Network for p
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:05,664	| IOT047 |	People
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:06,432	| IOT047 |	Which is
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:06,944	| IOT047 |	Super nice
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:10,528	| IOT047 |	But in a previous conversation that we had
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:11,552	| IOT047 |	We kind of talked about
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:14,624	| IOT047 |	How to think about identity
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:16,160	| IOT047 |	Four things on the network
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:18,976	| IOT047 |	And I'd be kind of curious about
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:20,512	| IOT047 |	Going forward
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:21,536	| IOT047 |	What is kind of
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:26,144	| IOT047 |	Your goal for all of the smarts that you're building into this
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:27,680	| IOT047 |	Router because
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:28,704	| IOT047 |	You could do a lot with
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:29,216	| IOT047 |	This platform
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:31,008	| IOT047 |	The biggest wanted is
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:32,800	| IOT047 |	These devices are
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:35,616	| IOT047 |	For lack of a better phrase Arthur typically just black boxes

EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:38,944	| IOT047 |	There's a lot of information
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:39,712	| IOT047 |	There's
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:44,320	| IOT047 |	A lot of different devices connecting and a lot of the work that we have
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:47,136	| IOT047 |	Accomplished and also ahead of us is
EDL	00:37:47,136	00:37:50,976	| IOT047 |	How do we take all that information and make it really easy for people to understand
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:54,048	| IOT047 |	Done as always devices. Connecting throughout our homes
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:58,144	| IOT047 |	Looking at your home network is it is a great indicator of
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:37:59,424	| IOT047 |	What's happening in your home
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:00,704	| IOT047 |	What's going on
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:01,984	| IOT047 |	What devices are connecting
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:04,544	| IOT047 |	And then what things are happening
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:09,408	| IOT047 |	And a lot of the work that we're doing is helping people understand all those nuances
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:10,944	| IOT047 |	Edit it starts with
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:15,296	| IOT047 |	First let's get you really reliable connectivity so all your device devices are connected
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:15,808	| IOT047 |	The one network
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:17,600	| IOT047 |	And then from there let's
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:19,392	| IOT047 |	Hope you understand exactly what's happening
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:19,904	| IOT047 |	From
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:23,488	| IOT047 |	Number of devices connected to the types of devices connected
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:24,768	| IOT047 |	Why
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,560	| IOT047 |	This box
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:29,120	| IOT047 |	Now why did it take a startup to do this
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:30,400	| IOT047 |	When we have had
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:35,776	| IOT047 |	We have these major companies Cisco you stolen linksys now Belkin has it I mean
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:37,568	| IOT047 |	Netgear
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:40,128	| IOT047 |	Dealing all of these are major companies that have
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:44,224	| IOT047 |	Lots of big budgets why aren't they
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:44,992	| IOT047 |	Why does it take
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:46,528	| IOT047 |	A startup like
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:47,040	| IOT047 |	Make yourself to do
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:51,392	| IOT047 |	When you have a an existing
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:53,952	| IOT047 |	Is density of an existing product portfolio
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:56,512	| IOT047 |	It's really hard to start from Square One
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:58,560	| IOT047 |	And rethink the entire product experience
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:01,120	| IOT047 |	So when you when you think of
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:05,216	| IOT047 |	Typical home networking products today they're all
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:06,496	| IOT047 |	White products
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:09,056	| IOT047 |	Meaning. They're all designed to act
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:11,104	| IOT047 |	On the round independently
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:13,152	| IOT047 |	So like we talked about earlier
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:17,760	| IOT047 |	Most homes run on one router and it's so that's what these devices are
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:18,528	| IOT047 |	Design for
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:21,600	| IOT047 |	Single device in your home providing connectivity failure
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:22,112	| IOT047 |	Devices
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:23,136	| IOT047 |	Now
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:25,952	| IOT047 |	Hazard connectivity needs have
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:32,352	| IOT047 |	Changed as more devices have come online as streaming has become more and more important and as the canoe
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:33,888	| IOT047 |	Directions speeds into our home
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:35,168	| IOT047 |	Have improved dramatically
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:37,728	| IOT047 |	Allow you to have multiple devices
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:39,520	| IOT047 |	Allprovide Wi-Fi
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:40,032	| IOT047 |	Track your home
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:44,896	| IOT047 |	Now that the Big Challenge when you go from one device to multiple is
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:47,456	| IOT047 |	All this configuration all of these settings
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:48,480	| IOT047 |	And
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:53,600	| IOT047 |	What we've done to simplify all that is basically started with a new
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:56,416	| IOT047 |	Architecture new way of building this product
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:40:01,280	| IOT047 |	So what we have is we have the same software layer across every single year device
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:02,560	| IOT047 |	And
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:03,840	| IOT047 |	They're all tied to the cloud
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:06,912	| IOT047 |	So what the cloud allows us to do is
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:08,192	| IOT047 |	You can think of it as your
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:11,264	| IOT047 |	Friendly network engineer in the sky
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:16,384	| IOT047 |	That's what's responsible for tuning in configuring and setting up your network
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:19,456	| IOT047 |	So as a customer all you have to do is
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:21,760	| IOT047 |	Think about your network name and password
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:24,320	| IOT047 |	Then all the settings the background are all configured
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:25,856	| IOT047 |	Empire clock controller
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:28,416	| IOT047 |	So with everything in the cloud
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:31,744	| IOT047 |	That's a lot of information about
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:36,864	| IOT047 |	You got all the devices in my house you got a lot of information that you can infer from that about my comings and goings
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:38,400	| IOT047 |	How secure is that
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:43,008	| IOT047 |	Yes so if you're we take security very very seriously
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:44,032	| IOT047 |	In terms of
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:48,384	| IOT047 |	What information is available at the cloud only captures the information that's
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:52,224	| IOT047 |	Bishounen the app in terms of number devices and speed
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:55,296	| IOT047 |	We also have diagnostic information to help us tune
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:57,856	| IOT047 |	That works and that's all around connections
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:59,392	| IOT047 |	Speeds and links between Heroes
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:02,464	| IOT047 |	At no point do we ever know
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:03,744	| IOT047 |	Where you're going on Pine
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:10,656	| IOT047 |	That's not information that we care about it says it's both now capability of the system North it's
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:12,192	| IOT047 |	Something that that's implemented today
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:13,728	| IOT047 |	Okay so you know that I have
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:16,288	| IOT047 |	27
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:24,224	| IOT047 |	Nest thermostat and 6
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:25,248	| IOT047 |	In my house
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:25,760	| IOT047 |	Example
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:28,064	| IOT047 |	But that's the extent of your knowledge
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:31,392	| IOT047 |	Or is the extent of your knowledge just that I have 27 devices
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:34,464	| IOT047 |	We have the the names of all the devices so
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:36,256	| IOT047 |	Every time it gets displayed in the app
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:38,816	| IOT047 |	That's that information is coming directly from iCloud
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:40,352	| IOT047 |	And the reason
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:41,632	| IOT047 |	That's important is
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:46,752	| IOT047 |	You can be off your network so across town across the country across the world
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:49,568	| IOT047 |	I mean you could still be able to check in and see
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:50,592	| IOT047 |	What's happening on your network
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:53,151	| IOT047 |	On the security front aside from not
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:54,431	| IOT047 |	Capturing
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:55,967	| IOT047 |	Information about where I visit
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:59,039	| IOT047 |	There's also the issue of keeping your both firmware
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:00,575	| IOT047 |	And everything else updated
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:01,855	| IOT047 |	How are you guys
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:03,391	| IOT047 |	Looking at that
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:09,279	| IOT047 |	Because I know that a lot of the existing routers you're talking about 10 year old firmware you're talking about Hardware that isn't updated
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:10,303	| IOT047 |	All kinds of
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:12,351	| IOT047 |	So it's really interesting
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:13,631	| IOT047 |	And it doesn't
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:16,703	| IOT047 |	Really come as a surprise is the vast majority of
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:22,591	| IOT047 |	At home networks have never had the software on the network updated and that's becoming an increasingly
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:23,359	| IOT047 |	Larger problem
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:25,663	| IOT047 |	All these devices are
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:27,967	| IOT047 |	Your home network really become the
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:31,295	| IOT047 |	Security layer for all the experiences in your home
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:33,087	| IOT047 |	And if you're not updating your software you
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:34,367	| IOT047 |	You're really leaving yourself vulnerable
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:37,439	| IOT047 |	So and that's one of the biggest benefits of
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:41,535	| IOT047 |	How they are devices tied to the cloud where we update your network automatically
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:42,815	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:44,351	| IOT047 |	That you always have the
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:45,631	| IOT047 |	Latest firmware
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:47,679	| IOT047 |	With the latest security patches
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:48,447	| IOT047 |	And you also get
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:50,751	| IOT047 |	With only products you
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:54,079	| IOT047 |	Typically have to go to some support site
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:43:00,479	| IOT047 |	Download a firmware image find the right page in the admin utility to upload it and then once you upload it
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:03,039	| IOT047 |	Wipes all your settings and you have to reconfigure everything
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:04,575	| IOT047 |	There are other
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:05,087	| IOT047 |	Routers out
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:06,111	| IOT047 |	Kind of launching
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:09,695	| IOT047 |	Couch
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:11,999	| IOT047 |	Using a router I think that's a boxes
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:13,023	| IOT047 |	It's in front of your router
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:14,815	| IOT047 |	But then there's routers like luma
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:17,631	| IOT047 |	They're actually security specific
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:21,471	| IOT047 |	Routers that offer some of them run software that's
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:23,263	| IOT047 |	Continually updated to fight against
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:24,287	| IOT047 |	Malware
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:25,311	| IOT047 |	Some of them have
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:28,639	| IOT047 |	Looking for
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:30,175	| IOT047 |	Bad Network Behavior
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:33,247	| IOT047 |	Is that something you guys are kind of looking at or doing
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:35,295	| IOT047 |	Yeah I think the first order is
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:39,135	| IOT047 |	You have to just make sure the software running a network is really secure and up
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:40,671	| IOT047 |	That gives you a
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:41,951	| IOT047 |	Huge Head Start
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:43,487	| IOT047 |	Compared to the other products
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:44,767	| IOT047 |	So
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:47,839	| IOT047 |	The first thing you have to do is make sure those systems are in place and everything's up to date
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:50,399	| IOT047 |	Play the terms of adding more preemptive
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:54,239	| IOT047 |	I features the monitor anomalies on your network
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:56,543	| IOT047 |	Yeah that's that's definitely something that's very interesting
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:58,079	| IOT047 |	You got to learn to walk
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:43:59,871	| IOT047 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:00,895	| IOT047 |	Got it
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:03,711	| IOT047 |	Now let's talk about features because
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:09,855	| IOT047 |	I feel like this has the potential to be kind of like the Amazon Echo in the sense that it could get new stuff over time which is cool
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:13,695	| IOT047 |	Because right now it feels pretty
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:17,535	| IOT047 |	Barebones III love the speed test I love knowing what devices are in my
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:19,583	| IOT047 |	But I do want to have
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:22,143	| IOT047 |	Kind of more granular control over them
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:26,495	| IOT047 |	Partly because I tested other routers that already allow me this so I'd love to be able to say
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:31,359	| IOT047 |	I want to add like whitelisted sites to my daughters camp
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:32,895	| IOT047 |	As opposed to
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:37,247	| IOT047 |	I want to say hey turn my daughter's computer off at 8:30 when it's her bedtime
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:38,783	| IOT047 |	Interest rate up gun
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:43,135	| IOT047 |	So are those features that we can look forward to Overtime or
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:43,903	| IOT047 |	Is that just not
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:45,183	| IOT047 |	The plans
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:47,487	| IOT047 |	The number one thing we're focused on
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:48,767	| IOT047 |	Is providing you with
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:50,303	| IOT047 |	Really reliable
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:53,375	| IOT047 |	And estas connectivity everywhere in your home
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:56,191	| IOT047 |	That's a core feature that's been overlooked
