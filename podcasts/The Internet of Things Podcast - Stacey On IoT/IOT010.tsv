EDL	00:00:08,448	00:00:12,800	| IOT010 |	Hey everybody this is the fortune Internet of Things podcast with your hoes
EDL	00:00:12,800	00:00:14,592	| IOT010 |	Stacey Higginbotham Andrew
EDL	00:00:14,592	00:00:15,360	| IOT010 |	Co-host
EDL	00:00:15,872	00:00:16,896	| IOT010 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:16,896	00:00:17,920	| IOT010 |	And you
EDL	00:00:17,920	00:00:22,784	| IOT010 |	Astute listeners might have noticed that we added a brand name to the beginning of our podcast
EDL	00:00:23,552	00:00:24,576	| IOT010 |	That is because
EDL	00:00:25,088	00:00:27,136	| IOT010 |	Nothing about the show will change but
EDL	00:00:27,136	00:00:28,416	| IOT010 |	Fortune is now going
EDL	00:00:28,416	00:00:29,184	| IOT010 |	To be affiliated with
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:31,488	| IOT010 |	So if you guys aren't aware of the IMF
EDL	00:00:32,000	00:00:33,792	| IOT010 |	Senior editor Fortune Magazine
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:34,816	| IOT010 |	And Kevin you are a
EDL	00:00:35,328	00:00:37,120	| IOT010 |	A contributing writer at ZDNet.
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:41,984	| IOT010 |	Later in the show Kevin and I talked about the ecobee3 thermostat
EDL	00:00:41,984	00:00:44,544	| IOT010 |	After we recorded the show we found out
EDL	00:00:44,544	00:00:46,592	| IOT010 |	Did some of the information that we had was
EDL	00:00:46,592	00:00:47,360	| IOT010 |	Was incorrect
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:49,664	| IOT010 |	The ecobee3 thermostat
EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:50,688	| IOT010 |	What is homekit
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:51,456	| IOT010 |	Compatible
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:52,992	| IOT010 |	Must be purchased
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:55,040	| IOT010 |	Now the existing ecobee
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:56,320	| IOT010 |	Trees are not
EDL	00:00:56,320	00:00:57,088	| IOT010 |	Homekit
EDL	00:00:57,088	00:00:57,856	| IOT010 |	Compatible
EDL	00:00:57,856	00:00:58,624	| IOT010 |	And now
EDL	00:00:58,624	00:00:59,648	| IOT010 |	Onto the show
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:01,696	| IOT010 |	All right so getting
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:04,256	| IOT010 |	It started with this week's news we should start with
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:04,768	| IOT010 |	I don't know
EDL	00:01:05,280	00:01:06,560	| IOT010 |	Google IO
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:10,144	| IOT010 |	Yeah let's do that since I Google I always last week
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:10,656	| IOT010 |	And
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:13,728	| IOT010 |	Not too many surprises there
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:17,056	| IOT010 |	In terms of everything it was announced and even some things that weren't announced
EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:17,568	| IOT010 |	But I expect
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:19,360	| IOT010 |	Brillo
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:22,944	| IOT010 |	Became reality we heard about Brillo before Google IO
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:25,760	| IOT010 |	And the Rumor at the time was it would be
EDL	00:01:25,760	00:01:26,784	| IOT010 |	Google's
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:28,064	| IOT010 |	I'll call it second
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:30,880	| IOT010 |	Attempt at The Internet of Things cuz I do remember their Android at home
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:34,208	| IOT010 |	Effort back in 2011 that really went nowhere
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:37,024	| IOT010 |	I think it's time as we might have talked about on the Pryor Show
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:39,328	| IOT010 |	But yesterday announced Brillo which is
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:44,960	| IOT010 |	I guess you could say it's a small slice of Android for later devices that you may have around your home
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:46,496	| IOT010 |	Are there also an ounce
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:48,032	| IOT010 |	Weave which
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:50,848	| IOT010 |	Are your thoughts on Stacy because
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,128	| IOT010 |	It was kind of like this
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,408	| IOT010 |	Nebulous
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:55,968	| IOT010 |	Platform was going to tie everything together
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:57,760	| IOT010 |	They also said
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:02:00,832	| IOT010 |	That they would be Wi-Fi Bluetooth sport as well as
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:03,392	| IOT010 |	Thread which I think again we talked about it last show so
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,184	| IOT010 |	New products
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:08,512	| IOT010 |	Announce this kind of reminds me of what Apple did last year
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:10,816	| IOT010 |	At WWDC in 2014
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:12,096	| IOT010 |	Hey working at home kit
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,376	| IOT010 |	And you're not smart home
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:15,424	| IOT010 |	300s and yada yada
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:19,008	| IOT010 |	It only just now a year later the Racine products for that so there's no
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,312	| IOT010 |	Willow products at this is Google
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:24,384	| IOT010 |	Doing what they do they put the platform of the tools out there
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,664	| IOT010 |	And hope that developers and
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,688	| IOT010 |	Hardware partners
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:27,200	| IOT010 |	Support them
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:28,480	| IOT010 |	So exact
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:30,784	| IOT010 |	I think there's a lot going on
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,552	| IOT010 |	Behind the scenes
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:32,320	| IOT010 |	Google
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:35,136	| IOT010 |	I've got to be honest I talked to a lot of people
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:38,976	| IOT010 |	Those before Google IO and then after Google IO to figure out a little bit
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:43,840	| IOT010 |	More about brillo and I have heard so many conflicting reports
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:44,608	| IOT010 |	Conflicting they're just
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:50,752	| IOT010 |	Brillo could be so many things to so many people and it sounds like Google's not even sure
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:51,520	| IOT010 |	What they're after
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:53,312	| IOT010 |	You're like I can't even get specs
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:54,080	| IOT010 |	On
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:58,176	| IOT010 |	The processing power of the memory footprint needed to run Brillo which is
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,992	| IOT010 |	It's going to be an OS for the internet of
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,784	| IOT010 |	It is designed to be lightweight enough
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:06,368	| IOT010 |	According to the two minutes that Google devoted to it
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:06,880	| IOT010 |	Hey Google
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:10,720	| IOT010 |	To be lightweight enough to run on you don't blocks
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:12,000	| IOT010 |	And small device
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:16,864	| IOT010 |	Says but also be powerful enough that it could power you know industrial internet operations like
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,144	| IOT010 |	No farming
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:18,656	| IOT010 |	And
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:19,680	| IOT010 |	Machines
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:20,960	| IOT010 |	So
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,496	| IOT010 |	I kind of look at that
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:28,896	| IOT010 |	Wow you just basically defined the entire ecosystem inside we're going to build something that's going to run on that
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,432	| IOT010 |	And it's a stripped-down version of Android
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:31,712	| IOT010 |	And so I think
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:34,784	| IOT010 |	I don't know if there's a one-size-fits-all there
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,064	| IOT010 |	Google has the
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:36,832	| IOT010 |	Props
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,112	| IOT010 |	And Acumen to do it
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,160	| IOT010 |	When I look at Merlot
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:44,000	| IOT010 |	It could compete with some of the other operating systems out there such as
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:46,816	| IOT010 |	Arm is doing an embedded OS
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,096	| IOT010 |	That's a little bit lighter weight
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,376	| IOT010 |	There's a lot of
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:50,400	| IOT010 |	Custom
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:51,936	| IOT010 |	OS is out there
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:55,776	| IOT010 |	For iot that come on a lot of the chips
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:59,616	| IOT010 |	And then there's a lot of custom platforms out there from
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:00,896	| IOT010 |	Kind of a lot of these
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:02,944	| IOT010 |	Cloud providers that work with both
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:03,968	| IOT010 |	Hardware and
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:04,992	| IOT010 |	The cloud side sole
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,784	| IOT010 |	Electric imp
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:10,112	| IOT010 |	They do a Wi-Fi module plus a cloud side thing
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,392	| IOT010 |	There's particle
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:14,208	| IOT010 |	They've got modules plus a cloud support side thing
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:15,488	| IOT010 |	So
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,768	| IOT010 |	It looks like
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,791	| IOT010 |	Google could be going
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,071	| IOT010 |	After all of that
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,607	| IOT010 |	Ennui
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,655	| IOT010 |	I don't even know what to tell you
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:25,471	| IOT010 |	They showed two slides
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,751	| IOT010 |	Did I think they should actually
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,031	| IOT010 |	Sephora total slides
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:30,079	| IOT010 |	Related to iot one of which was like
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,615	| IOT010 |	Google The Internet of Things
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,639	| IOT010 |	It does lie detector
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,943	| IOT010 |	Satisfy that actually showed
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:37,247	| IOT010 |	Brillo it action and there was actually
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,783	| IOT010 |	People were very excited about
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:39,551	| IOT010 |	A TV
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:40,831	| IOT010 |	Be listed among the devices
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:44,159	| IOT010 |	Controlled and yes I do think there is going to be
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:47,999	| IOT010 |	A home entertainment component here because it just makes sense
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:50,815	| IOT010 |	And then there was the weave slide which showed
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:51,839	| IOT010 |	Basically
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:53,631	| IOT010 |	Brillo at a circle with Brillo
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,655	| IOT010 |	Weave in the cloud
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,447	| IOT010 |	Are the arrows all went around
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,751	| IOT010 |	And there's a little bit of code
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,591	| IOT010 |	You know some people were trying to parse
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,103	| IOT010 |	The code and
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,919	| IOT010 |	I am not sure if that's great or not I look at we
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:07,711	| IOT010 |	They said it was
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:08,735	| IOT010 |	Communications
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:09,503	| IOT010 |	Schema
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:11,295	| IOT010 |	They were very careful not to call it a proton
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,343	| IOT010 |	I still think it's going to
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,647	| IOT010 |	Pete with all join
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,415	| IOT010 |	Anaya tivity
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,695	| IOT010 |	So
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:18,975	| IOT010 |	The idea is to
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:22,047	| IOT010 |	Talking about what device is schema that says what a device
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:24,351	| IOT010 |	Is it communicates what a device does
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:27,167	| IOT010 |	And that is exactly what both
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:29,727	| IOT010 |	The Intel kind of iotivity
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:36,127	| IOT010 |	Standard is trying to do and that's Intel and a bunch of other companies Bandit around them and then Qualcomm
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:38,687	| IOT010 |	Other companies are doing all seen
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:39,967	| IOT010 |	And all join
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:41,503	| IOT010 |	With you all seen Alliance
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:43,807	| IOT010 |	And that's exactly what that's trying to do
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:46,367	| IOT010 |	And we've looks like it might sit on top
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,391	| IOT010 |	Top of that or
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,951	| IOT010 |	Do the same thing but it might be kind of
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,463	| IOT010 |	A couple layers
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:55,583	| IOT010 |	But I was going to say you know a little bit more about the
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:57,119	| IOT010 |	So I'd be curious like
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:59,167	| IOT010 |	Schema versus a protocol if you know what that means
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:02,495	| IOT010 |	Will a schema defines data
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:07,103	| IOT010 |	So I asked her to get that I mean you have your new might have XML schemas and in
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,639	| IOT010 |	Apps and web pages and such
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,175	| IOT010 |	The thing is
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:10,687	| IOT010 |	I think
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:13,247	| IOT010 |	Principle I agree with everything you just said
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,015	| IOT010 |	It's
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:18,623	| IOT010 |	Ultimately this is so far very confusing because you said Google is very specific
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:21,183	| IOT010 |	To say that we wasn't protocol
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,207	| IOT010 |	And here's the funny thing
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:25,535	| IOT010 |	If you go to developers. Google.com oberlo
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,839	| IOT010 |	Which is where you should find everything about furlough
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,119	| IOT010 |	You have one webpage
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:31,167	| IOT010 |	And a contact form on it
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:33,215	| IOT010 |	And right smack in the middle of the web page it says
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,519	| IOT010 |	Weave the iot protocol for everything
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:38,847	| IOT010 |	So they're sending a lot of mixed messages here I think
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,895	| IOT010 |	It just matter what you
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:44,223	| IOT010 |	You originally said that they're just going after the entire
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,991	| IOT010 |	Space here
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,271	| IOT010 |	And
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,831	| IOT010 |	Yeah I don't think that's a smart approach
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:52,671	| IOT010 |	I can imagine I'm not going to say that Apple's going to be successful here
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,207	| IOT010 |	I think Apple will be at least
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,999	| IOT010 |	Initially more successful because
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:58,047	| IOT010 |	They focused on very specific bit
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:58,559	| IOT010 |	Accent Home Care
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,607	| IOT010 |	We'll talk about that in a minute
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:04,191	| IOT010 |	I will say so the one thing that we didn't talk about and we should
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,983	| IOT010 |	They said that
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:10,847	| IOT010 |	Android devices will automatically recognize devices running
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,615	| IOT010 |	Brillo
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:16,735	| IOT010 |	So consumers Ed even people running like Android tablets and stuff and Industrial Ave
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,247	| IOT010 |	Vacations
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:18,527	| IOT010 |	That's a big deal
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:22,111	| IOT010 |	Because that gives it that kind of home kit
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,135	| IOT010 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,159	| IOT010 |	In the sense that
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,183	| IOT010 |	Boom you have automatic
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,463	| IOT010 |	Hey
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,231	| IOT010 |	Look it's a
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:28,511	| IOT010 |	You're at your phone will be like
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,535	| IOT010 |	Yo it's a
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,327	| IOT010 |	It's a TV running
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,887	| IOT010 |	Brillo or it's a door lock running Brillo
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,167	| IOT010 |	I know what it is I can talk to it
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:37,471	| IOT010 |	Presumably using weave
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:38,239	| IOT010 |	So that's
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:40,543	| IOT010 |	That's worth noting because I that could be
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:43,359	| IOT010 |	Huge because the Android ecosystem is huge
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:44,127	| IOT010 |	Massive
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:49,247	| IOT010 |	One other one other related pointer that Google says that support for weed is built into Android
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:52,575	| IOT010 |	And easily available for iOS so typical for Google they will
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:59,231	| IOT010 |	Make their services available for iOS even it was a smaller group of people with a very engaged group of users
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:04,351	| IOT010 |	I'm happy to see that because I'm all about the whole cross platform support I switch phones over time
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:07,679	| IOT010 |	My phone is collecting dust right now and I have an Android phone this week so
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,471	| IOT010 |	Again typical Google I'm glad
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:11,263	| IOT010 |	All right
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,567	| IOT010 |	So so yes that that's
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:15,615	| IOT010 |	What we know so far about Brillo in
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,127	| IOT010 |	Weave
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:21,247	| IOT010 |	Alright next up also at Google IO I was really excited about this
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,271	| IOT010 |	Because I'm So Into
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,551	| IOT010 |	Fashion and also
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,575	| IOT010 |	Because I hate screens
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,135	| IOT010 |	Kevin knows who I know
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,951	| IOT010 |	Is Project Jacquard
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:30,719	| IOT010 |	Which
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,999	| IOT010 |	Is one of Google's advanced
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,279	| IOT010 |	Technology project
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:34,815	| IOT010 |	What it is
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:37,375	| IOT010 |	Is Project Jacquard is a way to weave
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,655	| IOT010 |	Conductive thread
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,679	| IOT010 |	Into any type of
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,471	| IOT010 |	Google
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:44,543	| IOT010 |	As a partnership with Levi's if they announced at Google IO
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,591	| IOT010 |	That they're going to work together in
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,615	| IOT010 |	Kinect developing
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,407	| IOT010 |	I'm guessing conductor
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,175	| IOT010 |	The cloth
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:52,223	| IOT010 |	Conductive cloth is not new
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:56,319	| IOT010 |	We've actually talked to some companies like own signal makes
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,855	| IOT010 |	Shirts that use conduct
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:58,623	| IOT010 |	The cloth
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,391	| IOT010 |	Wechat at
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,159	| IOT010 |	A company that makes
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,719	| IOT010 |	Socks I actually have a pair of them right now
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,255	| IOT010 |	Constance Aria
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:07,839	| IOT010 |	And the socks are some sort of Fitness socks and they have conductive threads
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:11,423	| IOT010 |	What this does is this basically like
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,959	| IOT010 |	Yuan the fitness side
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:15,519	| IOT010 |	But you take all kinds of like heart rate respiration
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:21,919	| IOT010 |	Pressure sensors all this kind of stuff is built into the fabric and then it communicates to an electronic device
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:25,759	| IOT010 |	And it goes to your smartphone and all these Fabrics are actually washable
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,039	| IOT010 |	Once you take the little
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,319	| IOT010 |	Electronic
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:28,831	| IOT010 |	Pod out of
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,135	| IOT010 |	And project soli
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:34,719	| IOT010 |	Is really interesting even beyond the clothing project soli is
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,023	| IOT010 |	Google using radar
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:39,327	| IOT010 |	A device emits radar and then
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,631	| IOT010 |	It can detect
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,143	| IOT010 |	Beer
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:47,007	| IOT010 |	Tidy little motions in your fingers in disruptions in the radar signal
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:50,847	| IOT010 |	And it reads those is basically another gesture interface
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,663	| IOT010 |	So if you put that on the fabric you can like
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:58,015	| IOT010 |	Pinch the fabric or like big tiny little gestures on the fabric
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,807	| IOT010 |	And you're basically
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,087	| IOT010 |	Creating a touch interface on
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:02,623	| IOT010 |	4
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,159	| IOT010 |	Wherever
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:10,047	| IOT010 |	Yeah this is this is all interesting as you said we've we've had the conductor fibers before I test of the arm signal shirt
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:12,607	| IOT010 |	Got my respiration heart rate and all that fun stuff
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,631	| IOT010 |	Washable vest
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,679	| IOT010 |	With these fibers in them
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,215	| IOT010 |	Your test of the socks and whatnot
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:23,103	| IOT010 |	It's the twist here obviously Google is going after interphase as opposed to gathering information
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,919	| IOT010 |	I'm not sold at that
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,711	| IOT010 |	Going to take off
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,991	| IOT010 |	And the thing is
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,271	| IOT010 |	For most of the advanced
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,319	| IOT010 |	Technology projects in Google group
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,343	| IOT010 |	They want to go from
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:37,695	| IOT010 |	Idea to product within two years or their thought is we spike it
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:40,767	| IOT010 |	And in two years I don't know the Ring of interfaces
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,303	| IOT010 |	Hilton to close
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:44,095	| IOT010 |	Listen and have people accept the fact that
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,887	| IOT010 |	Yeah you can use her shirt
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:47,935	| IOT010 |	To swipe through screens on your phone and such
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,727	| IOT010 |	I think it's very ambitious
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,007	| IOT010 |	And it's interesting
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:54,079	| IOT010 |	What are the things they talked about using it on furniture
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:58,431	| IOT010 |	And what if you take it outside clothing and you think about it as
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,735	| IOT010 |	Anything where there's fabric
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:01,503	| IOT010 |	EXO
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:04,831	| IOT010 |	Sure like so your chair that you're sitting any kind of like a captain's chair and
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:06,879	| IOT010 |	And the change things
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:10,207	| IOT010 |	That displays on your screen that you're staring at on the run your desk and so on
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:15,071	| IOT010 |	Yeah I mean it. Just moves the interface from close to something else
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,119	| IOT010 |	Other than the screen
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,399	| IOT010 |	I don't know I mean
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:21,471	| IOT010 |	Furniture we we we still even talking about embedding
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:28,383	| IOT010 |	Wireless charging into furniture for three or four years and that's nobody's really interested in that either side
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:32,991	| IOT010 |	Doing is one thing but having people mainstream people really go after it is another
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:33,503	| IOT010 |	Well yes
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,319	| IOT010 |	I haven't found anybody
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,599	| IOT010 |	I've not seen it
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,111	| IOT010 |	Inaction yet
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:41,951	| IOT010 |	I don't even have and I try and get all the way to stuff
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:43,999	| IOT010 |	End tables pretty clunky
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,535	| IOT010 |	That's that's
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,303	| IOT010 |	Keep around
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,071	| IOT010 |	I don't know you
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,095	| IOT010 |	All right
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,119	| IOT010 |	Let's see
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,655	| IOT010 |	What else do we have
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,423	| IOT010 |	Oh
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,959	| IOT010 |	Other exciting news is
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:54,751	| IOT010 |	Tuesday in
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:58,079	| IOT010 |	London a researcher security researcher from OpenDNS
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,383	| IOT010 |	I should get a really interesting presentation
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:01,663	| IOT010 |	Related to
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,223	| IOT010 |	Corporate networks and The Internet of Things
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:08,319	| IOT010 |	This I hate this acronym but people
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:13,183	| IOT010 |	Love to talk about BYOD which is This Acronym of bring your own device into the network it have
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:17,535	| IOT010 |	Years ago when everybody
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,583	| IOT010 |	I was doing it at least a decade ago
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:24,447	| IOT010 |	You're such a rebel you're an early adopter Double Trouble every day
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:30,847	| IOT010 |	So what's interesting about BYOD is now with all these crazy connected gadgets
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:36,223	| IOT010 |	OpenDNS as research has shown that there is actually a BYO iot
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,247	| IOT010 |	Movement happen
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,015	| IOT010 |	Hang and
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,551	| IOT010 |	What they did is
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:41,343	| IOT010 |	They looked at DNS
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:41,855	| IOT010 |	Records
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,927	| IOT010 |	Did they can see from their clients
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:45,439	| IOT010 |	Stay host
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:47,231	| IOT010 |	DNS servers
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:48,255	| IOT010 |	So they looked at
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:50,047	| IOT010 |	Basically call-outs from
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:50,815	| IOT010 |	Devices on
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,839	| IOT010 |	Clients Networks
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:55,423	| IOT010 |	Stussy like what devices were on the networks and where they were calling out to
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:58,495	| IOT010 |	And they discovered that a lot of Highly secure
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,031	| IOT010 |	Industries
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:01,567	| IOT010 |	Have a lot of really in
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:04,127	| IOT010 |	Secure connected devices from the home like
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:06,687	| IOT010 |	Ness and drop cams and
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:08,735	| IOT010 |	Smart TVs and things that
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,039	| IOT010 |	They may not be insecure
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:14,367	| IOT010 |	We're leaving the home but for a corporate it Network they're not
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,135	| IOT010 |	Up to
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:15,903	| IOT010 |	Corporate it
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:18,463	| IOT010 |	Par I guess would be the way to think about it yes Kevin
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:21,535	| IOT010 |	Oh absolutely not these things
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:25,631	| IOT010 |	And you know I come from the rebellious side where I was bringing stuff in all the time
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:29,471	| IOT010 |	But the fact that matters East things to bring risk into the Enterprise
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,775	| IOT010 |	In terms of you know losing
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:32,543	| IOT010 |	Potential
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:33,055	| IOT010 |	Data
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:37,151	| IOT010 |	Becoming infected spreading malware or viruses throughout the network
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:39,199	| IOT010 |	Git level
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,223	| IOT010 |	So this is this is
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:43,551	| IOT010 |	If this is a problem I mean especially in regulated in
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:46,623	| IOT010 |	Right where that method the data is
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:49,439	| IOT010 |	Has to be protected and someone is over that's that's it
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:49,951	| IOT010 |	That's a big issue
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:54,047	| IOT010 |	It is but this report to be clear was not trying to uncover a hat
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:57,887	| IOT010 |	This is talking about a pattern of behavior that enterprises don't even
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:58,911	| IOT010 |	Real Isaac
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,471	| IOT010 |	What struck me about it
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,519	| IOT010 |	Was the recommendations which were
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,311	| IOT010 |	The consumer devices
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:06,847	| IOT010 |	Need better.
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:07,871	| IOT010 |	Segmentation for corporate net
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,919	| IOT010 |	Cuz right now they're built
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,199	| IOT010 |	For consumers in
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:14,015	| IOT010 |	Did it needs to be aware of where there traffic is going
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:20,927	| IOT010 |	And he gave the example of the Samsung Smart TVs which a couple months ago I believe it was as they got in Allah
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,719	| IOT010 |	A lot of trouble over in the news because
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:24,767	| IOT010 |	The terms of service
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,791	| IOT010 |	Noted that
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:28,607	| IOT010 |	These are boys control TV so the TVs were listening
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:29,631	| IOT010 |	For their wake
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:32,191	| IOT010 |	Basically all the time all the time
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,215	| IOT010 |	And
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:35,263	| IOT010 |	This researcher pointed out that
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:38,335	| IOT010 |	A lot of these TVs are in boardrooms where
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:39,615	| IOT010 |	Companies might hold
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:40,895	| IOT010 |	Very important
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:42,431	| IOT010 |	Insecure beatings and
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:44,223	| IOT010 |	Did you really want something
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:44,735	| IOT010 |	Could be
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:50,111	| IOT010 |	Listening all the time have that capability and was attached to the internet in a way that
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:53,695	| IOT010 |	Wasn't necessarily secure and was also apparently calling South Korea
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,463	| IOT010 |	Ito
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,487	| IOT010 |	Is it malicious
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:56,511	| IOT010 |	Probably not
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,535	| IOT010 |	Could it be exploited
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:14:59,327	| IOT010 |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:01,887	| IOT010 |	So that was kind of a really IOP
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:04,447	| IOT010 |	Report it don't freak out but I would say
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:08,031	| IOT010 |	Suggest if you're if you're in corporate it you may want to check out there
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:11,359	| IOT010 |	Report otherwise if you're building a connected home device
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:14,175	| IOT010 |	When they sneak into the Enterprise
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:17,247	| IOT010 |	Maybe you should think about that market in Star Building better security
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:20,319	| IOT010 |	What just building better security but documenting it better
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:20,831	| IOT010 |	Because
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:22,367	| IOT010 |	That will only help everyone
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,415	| IOT010 |	Finally
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:26,463	| IOT010 |	We'll go to our final bit of news
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,487	| IOT010 |	Which is
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:29,535	| IOT010 |	Homekit devices
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:30,559	| IOT010 |	Are coming
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:31,839	| IOT010 |	Very soon
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:34,655	| IOT010 |	Really soon
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:37,727	| IOT010 |	That to our
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:40,031	| IOT010 |	Get ready for my music Kevin r
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,055	| IOT010 |	Minit review
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,383	| IOT010 |	So let's let's
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,407	| IOT010 |	Talk about some of the devices
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,199	| IOT010 |	What we think about
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,991	| IOT010 |	Yasso
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:50,271	| IOT010 |	A lot of these devices
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:55,135	| IOT010 |	We heard about them before it's just now becoming an availability thing we have the
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:58,207	| IOT010 |	Apple WWDC or worldwide developer
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:59,999	| IOT010 |	The conference next week so
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:02,047	| IOT010 |	I'm sure all these were some of these
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:04,095	| IOT010 |	Harbor Partners will be on stage
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:04,863	| IOT010 |	Show off
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,143	| IOT010 |	Homekit devices
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,167	| IOT010 |	I think
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:11,775	| IOT010 |	I'm not mistaken the first one is currently available solutreans
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:15,615	| IOT010 |	Caseta Wireless line is that correct I said it correctly
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:20,223	| IOT010 |	I think it's caseta I take a setup but I'm pretty sure it's cuz he died I talk to Lutron and I
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:25,855	| IOT010 |	Okay well that's what I got to write that most the caseta wireless line of switches and dimmers
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,647	| IOT010 |	Among the first products
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:33,023	| IOT010 |	The starter kit which I think has two dimmers two remotes and two pedestals
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:37,631	| IOT010 |	Humsafar to 2995 Apple Stores will sell it
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:41,983	| IOT010 |	So as other locations I know Lutron put out a big press release about it today
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:42,751	| IOT010 |	Making a big
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:43,519	| IOT010 |	Splash
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:45,311	| IOT010 |	So there's that one right there
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:50,943	| IOT010 |	Smart home which is what I've shop many many times over the last 10 years they've got their insteon hubs
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:53,759	| IOT010 |	Well now the new $150 insteon hub
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:54,527	| IOT010 |	Pro is
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:56,063	| IOT010 |	Compatible with homekit
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,343	| IOT010 |	It looks like
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:17:03,231	| IOT010 |	That's not going to start shipping until July but you know I know you can order it today cuz I looked at ordering when I actually added to my car at the
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:03,743	| IOT010 |	Check out
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:07,583	| IOT010 |	I have a older insteon Hub here States and I suspect
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,119	| IOT010 |	I'm guessing it's not
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,399	| IOT010 |	Firmware upgradeable
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,167	| IOT010 |	2
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,703	| IOT010 |	My understanding
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:14,751	| IOT010 |	Cuz I talk to insteon CEO
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,775	| IOT010 |	At CES
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:22,175	| IOT010 |	And I asked him this question thinking about you and your insteon care and he said that you're going to have to buy a new one because
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,711	| IOT010 |	The
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:27,039	| IOT010 |	WiFi and mfi certification stuff inside
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,831	| IOT010 |	Certain ships only certain chips
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,367	| IOT010 |	Are going to be
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,135	| IOT010 |	Needed and
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,415	| IOT010 |	Probably don't have
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:33,951	| IOT010 |	No probably not
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,767	| IOT010 |	Pains of being
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,279	| IOT010 |	Early adopters
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:40,095	| IOT010 |	Let me tell you because you use that Smart Hub
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,167	| IOT010 |	So so much yes
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,191	| IOT010 |	I used to
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,215	| IOT010 |	I used to
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,751	| IOT010 |	Anyway
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,543	| IOT010 |	To you and I I think
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:51,871	| IOT010 |	Well you switch your thermostat quite a bit I'm I'm kind of sold on the nest
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:53,663	| IOT010 |	I know you swapped yours out
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,431	| IOT010 |	2 * 2
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:57,759	| IOT010 |	I don't know if you tried the ecobee3 but now that is homekit
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,527	| IOT010 |	Compatible
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:00,319	| IOT010 |	Sell directly to the Apple Store
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:02,111	| IOT010 |	In Apple Store it is
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:05,951	| IOT010 |	It does say as of today at 2 to 3 weeks delivery window it's $250
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:10,303	| IOT010 |	Disable controller from your iPhone iPad so on and so forth the auto way to text
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,583	| IOT010 |	Cancel very similar to nest
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,631	| IOT010 |	Can't think of any major
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:17,727	| IOT010 |	Differences between the two and I don't know if you know of any but
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:20,543	| IOT010 |	To see what a set-up guide
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,823	| IOT010 |	This is by
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:22,847	| IOT010 |	Farm I
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:23,615	| IOT010 |	Favorite
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,639	| IOT010 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,151	| IOT010 |	Ww3
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:28,223	| IOT010 |	Made by probably my favorite favorite thermostat
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,783	| IOT010 |	So
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,063	| IOT010 |	Awesome
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:35,135	| IOT010 |	Because ecobee learn from the nest
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:37,695	| IOT010 |	And took all of their like
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:39,999	| IOT010 |	Nerdy openness sensibilities
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:42,559	| IOT010 |	And crammed a beautiful design wrap around it
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,863	| IOT010 |	And then they went one up above nest
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:46,143	| IOT010 |	An added sensors
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:49,471	| IOT010 |	So with the ecobee3 you get a sensor
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:52,031	| IOT010 |	And you can buy additional sensors
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:54,847	| IOT010 |	That you put in rooms outside the thermostat
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:59,199	| IOT010 |	And they actually communicate back to the thermostat and then there's the magical Outlet
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:01,759	| IOT010 |	The tell your thermostat
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:02,527	| IOT010 |	Oh hey
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,063	| IOT010 |	This room is like
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:08,159	| IOT010 |	85 where is back in that cool hallway that you're in it's like
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:10,207	| IOT010 |	78 Sol
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:13,023	| IOT010 |	Maybe we need to crank up the are a little bit more because
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:14,303	| IOT010 |	This is the priority
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:16,863	| IOT010 |	You can buy additional sensors
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:20,703	| IOT010 |	So you can add it to as many rooms as you have in your house or as many rooms as you
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,215	| IOT010 |	You want to monitor
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:22,495	| IOT010 |	And
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:23,775	| IOT010 |	I love it
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:24,287	| IOT010 |	I really do
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:31,967	| IOT010 |	Weird constantly working at home but the thermostat is downstairs and we are both upstairs so
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:35,039	| IOT010 |	Sometimes we are hot when it's cold downstairs
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:37,087	| IOT010 |	The sensors should help with device
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:40,159	| IOT010 |	Olor devices because of the line of device
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:42,463	| IOT010 |	Message from Elgato it's bees product line
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:44,511	| IOT010 |	These are relatively inexpensive
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,791	| IOT010 |	Just kind of nice but they're mostly
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:48,863	| IOT010 |	Sensors in an information-gathering device
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:49,631	| IOT010 |	So you can
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:54,751	| IOT010 |	You can get the indoor air quality temperature and humidity inside you can you put it outside sensor and
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:57,823	| IOT010 |	Sketcher temperatures are pressure and so on outside
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:59,103	| IOT010 |	Their door
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:01,151	| IOT010 |	Sensors for open and close actions
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,455	| IOT010 |	Which is interesting but also
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:06,527	| IOT010 |	Keep track of what time those open and close and also the duration
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:10,623	| IOT010 |	And so you know maybe you can find out if somebody left the back door wide open and they're letting all the
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:12,671	| IOT010 |	Flies in the summer or something like that
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:14,719	| IOT010 |	And also you can add
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:17,791	| IOT010 |	Smart's to appliances through the eve energy
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:20,607	| IOT010 |	It basically sits between
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,655	| IOT010 |	Well it's really for four lights I would say
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:24,959	| IOT010 |	Put a lightbulb in this and then you put this
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:27,007	| IOT010 |	This into an outlet and you can measure the
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:29,311	| IOT010 |	Power consumption and also turn
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,847	| IOT010 |	They switch on or off
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:35,199	| IOT010 |	So these all Ranger price for about 40 to $80 so little
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,479	| IOT010 |	Less expensive
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:39,295	| IOT010 |	And that fits with how much most sensors right now
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,343	| IOT010 |	So
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,879	| IOT010 |	I'm looking at those in
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:43,903	| IOT010 |	That to me
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,439	| IOT010 |	Strikes me is very much
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:48,767	| IOT010 |	In competition with all of the kind of smart home
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:53,631	| IOT010 |	I was out there cuz a lot of those have a lot of sensor options for SmartThings has a bunch of sensors
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:21:00,031	| IOT010 |	Weibo actually has just announced align its es&l Salina sensors that still aren't on the market yet but
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:02,335	| IOT010 |	Presumably are coming out in time for the holidays
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,103	| IOT010 |	So
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:06,175	| IOT010 |	It is kind of odd to me actually because
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:09,247	| IOT010 |	And this is great because we have as our guest
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:12,831	| IOT010 |	On this week's show Chet Pipkin who is the CEO of Belk
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:15,135	| IOT010 |	Owns WeMo
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,416	| IOT010 |	We're going to be talking about
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,208	| IOT010 |	Why the rush.
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:21,792	| IOT010 |	Add sensors would write down most consumers seem to be buying
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:25,120	| IOT010 |	One-off devices to perform a single function
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:27,424	| IOT010 |	Are people really ready to grab
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:29,984	| IOT010 |	And by all these sensors so
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:31,008	| IOT010 |	We can look forward to that
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:35,616	| IOT010 |	Yashow from a review perspective
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:36,128	| IOT010 |	Cossetta's
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:39,456	| IOT010 |	Now I'm exhausted I've lost
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:40,992	| IOT010 |	Casita
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:41,760	| IOT010 |	Casita
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:43,552	| IOT010 |	I cannot recommend them
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:44,832	| IOT010 |	Like I loved
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:48,416	| IOT010 |	They are functional even when they're not connected
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:49,696	| IOT010 |	They are just really a great
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:52,512	| IOT010 |	Product you do have to install
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:53,536	| IOT010 |	The switches
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:58,144	| IOT010 |	You have to rip out your existing switch box which isn't hard but can intimidate some people
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:00,704	| IOT010 |	So you may want to get an electrician to do it if you're worried about
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:03,264	| IOT010 |	Turning off your breaker in messing with the wires
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:06,336	| IOT010 |	But they are amazing and
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,872	| IOT010 |	The remote controls
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:08,640	| IOT010 |	They work with all
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:10,944	| IOT010 |	Kinds of things I'm really curious to see if homekit
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:16,320	| IOT010 |	Will support using those remotes later on with other lights like used because
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,088	| IOT010 |	That's something that
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:19,904	| IOT010 |	I could do with the Staples connect Hub and I actually
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:22,208	| IOT010 |	A lot of value from doing that cuz I
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:22,976	| IOT010 |	Connect a bunch of
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,512	| IOT010 |	Desperate
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,536	| IOT010 |	Devices
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:27,072	| IOT010 |	Penguin remote control
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,608	| IOT010 |	So look for that that would be cool
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,144	| IOT010 |	And then
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:33,472	| IOT010 |	Can't recommend that Highway
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:35,520	| IOT010 |	And thieves product line
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:36,800	| IOT010 |	I mean it looks like
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:40,128	| IOT010 |	I will tell you though
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:46,016	| IOT010 |	Looking at all those white boxes I'm not sure if I really want those in my house especially with a lot of other War
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:48,832	| IOT010 |	Multifunction device is coming that will do
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:50,624	| IOT010 |	Indoor air quality temperature and humidity
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:52,928	| IOT010 |	Like those sensors from
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:56,768	| IOT010 |	Humidity and
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:57,280	| IOT010 |	Temperature
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:58,816	| IOT010 |	So you may not
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,584	| IOT010 |	Need bees
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:02,656	| IOT010 |	Just think about it
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:06,496	| IOT010 |	It been with a lot of these products safe for the insteon Hub you don't need a hub
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:11,616	| IOT010 |	And so that leads to one last question that I have for you and I think it's very time we considering next week
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:14,688	| IOT010 |	After WWDC will be recording another show
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:15,968	| IOT010 |	Do you think
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:18,528	| IOT010 |	There's a new Apple TV that acts as a homekit hub
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:23,648	| IOT010 |	I hope so there has to be if you've got these open close sensors and things like this
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:25,440	| IOT010 |	There's no reason to have
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:27,488	| IOT010 |	Sensors if you're not going to have
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:28,512	| IOT010 |	Them
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:30,048	| IOT010 |	Trigger action
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:32,096	| IOT010 |	Especially with other devices
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:32,608	| IOT010 |	Guess
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:36,192	| IOT010 |	Just notifying you that a door open and closed
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,728	| IOT010 |	Is not exciting to the average
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,032	| IOT010 |	So
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:43,360	| IOT010 |	You want to know that that door open and close did you want that to trigger
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:44,384	| IOT010 |	Your lights.
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:45,664	| IOT010 |	Or
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:46,944	| IOT010 |	Say something
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:48,736	| IOT010 |	I don't know what I said to do that
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:52,320	| IOT010 |	And to do it consistently even when your phone is away from home
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,088	| IOT010 |	You need a hug
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:53,600	| IOT010 |	Inside your house
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:57,440	| IOT010 |	So I think I think you're right and I do think we will see that next week
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,464	| IOT010 |	That's
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,280	| IOT010 |	I assume it's going to be an Apple TV but
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:04,096	| IOT010 |	Maybe they'll be a coloring box and it will Doom
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:06,400	| IOT010 |	We will see
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,192	| IOT010 |	Awesome alright
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:09,472	| IOT010 |	That's it for this week
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:09,984	| IOT010 |	And
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:12,800	| IOT010 |	Stay tuned for our guests who again is checked
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:15,104	| IOT010 |	Pipkin the CEO of weibo
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:16,896	| IOT010 |	And we will see you next week
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:22,784	| IOT010 |	After we do more from Apple and we will have an exciting device review with the ring doorbell
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,832	| IOT010 |	And it will be a lot of fun
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:25,600	| IOT010 |	Thanks for listening
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:35,328	| IOT010 |	Hey everybody welcome back to the fortune Internet of Things podcast

EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:49,920	| IOT010 |	I am really excited I was
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:51,968	| IOT010 |	Just before the show started I was talking
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:52,992	| IOT010 |	Chat Noir saying
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:55,808	| IOT010 |	You guys have a great business because I think I have bought
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:57,600	| IOT010 |	More products from Belkin that I have either
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:58,880	| IOT010 |	Lost
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:00,672	| IOT010 |	Store has stored in a box
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,696	| IOT010 |	And then we bought
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:03,232	| IOT010 |	Because I needed it and I couldn't find it
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:05,024	| IOT010 |	So ye on you
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:09,888	| IOT010 |	Spell thank you very very much for all of that we've been around for about
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:12,192	| IOT010 |	30 years or so so we would hope
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,984	| IOT010 |	Set you have at least a few things
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:14,752	| IOT010 |	Stacy
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:17,312	| IOT010 |	I do might the reason you're on the show is because I have
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:18,592	| IOT010 |	WeMo products
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:20,640	| IOT010 |	WeMo is your lineup
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,408	| IOT010 |	Connected
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:22,432	| IOT010 |	Home Products
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,200	| IOT010 |	Sand
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:27,552	| IOT010 |	They include connected Wi-Fi light switches connected Outlets
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:29,088	| IOT010 |	Confusingly you guys call a switch
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:31,136	| IOT010 |	Connected cameras
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:33,184	| IOT010 |	And an upcoming line of
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:33,952	| IOT010 |	Sensors
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:36,256	| IOT010 |	And a bunch of other things light bulbs
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,024	| IOT010 |	Actually also
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,840	| IOT010 |	Yeah we've actually been building up
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:41,120	| IOT010 |	Platform for about
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:43,936	| IOT010 |	6 years I'm not always
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:47,008	| IOT010 |	That excited about this term of like smart home or
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:51,616	| IOT010 |	Connected home but I don't think we have found a better way to be able to
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:53,664	| IOT010 |	The kind of talked about that but it is
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:58,016	| IOT010 |	Short of being able to enable experiences that people want
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:00,320	| IOT010 |	To have hey I want my lights coming up
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,856	| IOT010 |	On when the Sun goes down
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:05,184	| IOT010 |	I don't want my irrigation system to
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:07,744	| IOT010 |	Water when it's raining outside
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:09,536	| IOT010 |	Big Apple to unlock
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:13,376	| IOT010 |	These kinds of experiences for folks is really fun place to be
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:18,496	| IOT010 |	I think it's a good one you've been very open so far you guys have done a lot of work with
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,288	| IOT010 |	If this then that
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,056	| IOT010 |	Which is a connected
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:25,152	| IOT010 |	Platform that lets you link devices to web services
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:30,016	| IOT010 |	You actually are one of the two companies that work right now with the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,296	| IOT010 |	And
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:36,672	| IOT010 |	For a long time I have had devices on the SmartThings platform that work with WeMo
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:37,440	| IOT010 |	Pad
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,208	| IOT010 |	What
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:38,976	| IOT010 |	Appear to be hacked
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:42,816	| IOT010 |	WeMo things with applications on my phone such as
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:44,608	| IOT010 |	Reach or you know me
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:49,728	| IOT010 |	So I'm very curious because this week we are in the middle of a bunch of news in this space we
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:50,496	| IOT010 |	With Apple and Google
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:53,312	| IOT010 |	Both announcing pretty big
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:54,336	| IOT010 |	Efforts
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:57,152	| IOT010 |	Where is WeMo going to play
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,688	| IOT010 |	This is all sort of
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:04,832	| IOT010 |	Unfolding the way that we would have helped it too and that's great to see other folks coming on
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:07,904	| IOT010 |	Okay now you are not a apple
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:08,928	| IOT010 |	Apple homekit partner
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:10,208	| IOT010 |	Write like a formal app
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:14,560	| IOT010 |	Yeah we're not announced formally today
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:17,888	| IOT010 |	So we're in did really close dialog
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:20,192	| IOT010 |	To figure out on a collective basis
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,216	| IOT010 |	What's the best
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:23,264	| IOT010 |	Way to really enhance
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:24,800	| IOT010 |	And further
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:25,312	| IOT010 |	Stand
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:30,432	| IOT010 |	Liam homekit if experiences and the WeMo experiences
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:31,712	| IOT010 |	In the bath
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,992	| IOT010 |	Possible way
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:37,088	| IOT010 |	A couple weeks ago I got on the podcast and was a little frustrated with me Moby
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,112	| IOT010 |	Because I couldn't
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:38,624	| IOT010 |	Use
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:39,904	| IOT010 |	My
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:44,256	| IOT010 |	Switch exactly like I wanted to I kept having issues with it
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:46,816	| IOT010 |	Kind of understanding what state it was in
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:49,632	| IOT010 |	And I suspect it was because I was using it with
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:50,144	| IOT010 |	Too many
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,168	| IOT010 |	Apps
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:52,704	| IOT010 |	So I was
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:57,056	| IOT010 |	I would turn it on with my Amazon Echo and maybe I would turn it off via SmartThings
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:57,568	| IOT010 |	And
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,616	| IOT010 |	Sometimes it just would
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,152	| IOT010 |	Worker wouldn't know where it was
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,968	| IOT010 |	So I would love to get your take on
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:07,552	| IOT010 |	Is this a problem that I'm experiencing because I am just
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:09,088	| IOT010 |	Crazy and using way too many app
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:09,600	| IOT010 |	Applications
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:12,160	| IOT010 |	I know that some developers have expressed
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:12,928	| IOT010 |	Appreciation with
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:14,976	| IOT010 |	Keno cloud and I just love to hear
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:16,000	| IOT010 |	As a user
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,792	| IOT010 |	What should I be doing here
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:20,096	| IOT010 |	And is there anything that we most trying
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:22,912	| IOT010 |	I don't know address
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:23,424	| IOT010 |	These issues
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:24,704	| IOT010 |	Yasso
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:27,264	| IOT010 |	Our promise and our
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:29,312	| IOT010 |	Commitment around the WeMo brand
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:34,944	| IOT010 |	Would be for us to do everything we can do to make
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:38,016	| IOT010 |	Those experiences you you are having
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:41,088	| IOT010 |	Reliable land
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:42,880	| IOT010 |	Consistent as we
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:43,648	| IOT010 |	Cam
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,928	| IOT010 |	And it is
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:47,232	| IOT010 |	Inevitable that this is going to get
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:50,816	| IOT010 |	Increasingly complicated for all of us
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:53,632	| IOT010 |	So working off of the WeMo app
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:55,168	| IOT010 |	Is complicated
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:57,984	| IOT010 |	For us but it should be really simple for the
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:58,752	| IOT010 |	User
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,800	| IOT010 |	Being able to
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:05,920	| IOT010 |	Access of Leverage off of all of the insights that exist on the internet
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:10,016	| IOT010 |	Is it dark outside is it light out dumb side
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:13,088	| IOT010 |	When is it that I want my lights coming on and off
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:14,624	| IOT010 |	I don't want to think about it
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,392	| IOT010 |	Can I just
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:16,160	| IOT010 |	Hook in
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:20,256	| IOT010 |	To I'm all of that data using if this then that
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:23,072	| IOT010 |	Now I want to be able to use my voice
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:25,376	| IOT010 |	Using my Amazon Echo
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:26,656	| IOT010 |	Our goal
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:30,496	| IOT010 |	Is 2 a make that a very straightforward and very reliable
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:31,520	| IOT010 |	Experience for you
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:35,872	| IOT010 |	There are some folks out there who are packing into WeMo
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,896	| IOT010 |	It's a little
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:39,456	| IOT010 |	Chopper to make those a really robust
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:40,480	| IOT010 |	Experience
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:41,760	| IOT010 |	And I think
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:42,528	| IOT010 |	Over
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:43,040	| IOT010 |	Time
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:44,576	| IOT010 |	You'll see
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:48,416	| IOT010 |	More and more of us working together in a formal
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:50,976	| IOT010 |	Authorized way to help
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:55,584	| IOT010 |	To ensure that your experiences are really I want you can count on
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:59,168	| IOT010 |	And that you are really good at a lot of benefit joy out of
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,216	| IOT010 |	I'll blame my
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:01,728	| IOT010 |	The acne
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:03,776	| IOT010 |	And we're hacking into the
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,568	| IOT010 |	Are hacking into the WeMo cloud
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,104	| IOT010 |	All right
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:08,640	| IOT010 |	With the idea that
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,408	| IOT010 |	You guys
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:10,432	| IOT010 |	Launched at CES
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:11,968	| IOT010 |	A bunch of
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:13,504	| IOT010 |	Shutters
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:19,904	| IOT010 |	Which I thought was actually kind of an interesting move because it seems kind of like a step back in the sense that most people right now
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:21,440	| IOT010 |	I'll seem to be gravitating towards
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:22,976	| IOT010 |	What off devices
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:26,560	| IOT010 |	Why did you guys launch all these sensors
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:27,328	| IOT010 |	When
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,352	| IOT010 |	A lot of people
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:30,144	| IOT010 |	Seem to be launching
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:37,056	| IOT010 |	Kenneth Comcast and ATT and all of these could have bigger vendors are coming into the market and they're saying Hey will do all these
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:39,104	| IOT010 |	Centers and all that for you and then you die
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:41,408	| IOT010 |	Just bring in your bring your own one-off devices
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:42,944	| IOT010 |	Which
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:45,504	| IOT010 |	Height of seems like it might be easy for consumers I don't know
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:49,600	| IOT010 |	So I'd love to hear your take on kind of where you think the Market's going and
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:50,624	| IOT010 |	Why you guys are
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:53,184	| IOT010 |	Betting on the sensors being
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:53,952	| IOT010 |	A big deal
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,976	| IOT010 |	We think that
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:56,256	| IOT010 |	The markets in what
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:57,792	| IOT010 |	Boomers
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:31:02,144	| IOT010 |	To Adorn unfolding in a way that we thought they were likely to
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:02,912	| IOT010 |	First
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:03,936	| IOT010 |	We thought that it was
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:07,264	| IOT010 |	A really critical thing for us to do to build out this
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,288	| IOT010 |	Platform
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:09,312	| IOT010 |	That would
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:10,592	| IOT010 |	Easily
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:13,664	| IOT010 |	Port and allow lots of different
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:14,688	| IOT010 |	Experiences
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:19,552	| IOT010 |	Do all work as one experience for folk over the coming years
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:23,136	| IOT010 |	So while you're right there's a lot of
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,160	| IOT010 |	Success
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:27,488	| IOT010 |	From one brand or another with the singular type
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:28,000	| IOT010 |	Experience
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:30,048	| IOT010 |	Overtime
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:33,632	| IOT010 |	We think that it is inevitable that people will want
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:39,264	| IOT010 |	Everything in their home to work well with one another we are think that there's
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:40,032	| IOT010 |	Benefit
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:44,128	| IOT010 |	I'm not being able just to kind of sense one spot in your home
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:48,480	| IOT010 |	But rather to a be able to take a look at your whole home
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:52,064	| IOT010 |	So you will see our thinking around
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:53,600	| IOT010 |	Sensors and
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:55,136	| IOT010 |	And switches being
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:56,672	| IOT010 |	It's easier to add one
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:32:02,304	| IOT010 |	And it's easy to on the add more so I can have as little
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:05,376	| IOT010 |	Of my home or as much
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:05,888	| IOT010 |	My home
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,680	| IOT010 |	Sort of covered
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:08,960	| IOT010 |	Censored
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:10,496	| IOT010 |	Monitored
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:11,776	| IOT010 |	And then
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:16,128	| IOT010 |	Managed IT exactly the way that I would want that to Abby
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:19,968	| IOT010 |	And it's great for Belkin to because I found with my smart home gadgets
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:21,504	| IOT010 |	No one can buy
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,832	| IOT010 |	Yeah that's a really really big piece
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:26,368	| IOT010 |	Ivar's thinking to is
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:29,440	| IOT010 |	Some of those other brands who I'm named
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:31,488	| IOT010 |	And the way that the mothers are thinking
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:34,048	| IOT010 |	About this people would have to make a big
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:36,096	| IOT010 |	Commitment upfront
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,632	| IOT010 |	Said they might have to
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:39,424	| IOT010 |	Commit to a monthly fee
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:41,472	| IOT010 |	That's an asking people
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:43,264	| IOT010 |	For a lot
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:44,544	| IOT010 |	If what they want
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:48,896	| IOT010 |	Two-a-day was just one thing or they want to see how that one thing
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:49,664	| IOT010 |	Works
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:50,432	| IOT010 |	Prior to adding
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:51,712	| IOT010 |	A second
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:54,016	| IOT010 |	So let's
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:55,552	| IOT010 |	Let's talk about the rest of Belk
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:57,856	| IOT010 |	Can because you guys also on the Linksys brand of router
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:01,184	| IOT010 |	And I have always been kind of really interested in
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:03,232	| IOT010 |	The role that the router can
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:06,816	| IOT010 |	Play in the smart home because I think like the specialized hubs are
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,864	| IOT010 |	Dirt their tradition kind of
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:10,144	| IOT010 |	Thing and
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:11,680	| IOT010 |	All that kind of
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:13,472	| IOT010 |	Mini radios that live in the router
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:19,616	| IOT010 |	Any intelligence that you need in the home will probably also live in the router baby lives in a set-top box I don't know
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:21,664	| IOT010 |	Epicurious like
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:23,200	| IOT010 |	What your thoughts are there in
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:26,784	| IOT010 |	How you'll have to work with vendors and what kind of intelligence
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:28,576	| IOT010 |	Ends up getting
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:29,344	| IOT010 |	Pushed into the router
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:31,904	| IOT010 |	Still weren't fortunate space
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:34,208	| IOT010 |	As a total organization here because
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:37,536	| IOT010 |	In addition to a WeMo we
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:39,328	| IOT010 |	I also have Linksys
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:44,448	| IOT010 |	We've been in this wireless router space for longer
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:47,264	| IOT010 |	Then that we have been doing WeMo item so
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:52,384	| IOT010 |	It is always been our thought that Wi-Fi will be a early
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:56,480	| IOT010 |	Predominant way of us looking things up in our home
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:58,528	| IOT010 |	The Wi-Fi's got
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:01,088	| IOT010 |	A couple of limitations also
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:04,672	| IOT010 |	One of those is the amount of power that it takes
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:07,488	| IOT010 |	2 I run that Wi-Fi signal
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:08,000	| IOT010 |	So
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:13,120	| IOT010 |	You mentioned zigbee zigbee another kind of radio that
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:14,656	| IOT010 |	People would not be
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:16,192	| IOT010 |	Nearly as
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:18,240	| IOT010 |	Comfortable with as Wi-Fi
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:22,080	| IOT010 |	And we don't want people to I'm even have to think about that
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:25,920	| IOT010 |	So the way that we approach the non
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:27,456	| IOT010 |	Wi-Fi way of
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:28,224	| IOT010 |	Getting
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:31,040	| IOT010 |	Smart devices hooked up in
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:32,320	| IOT010 |	My home
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:33,088	| IOT010 |	Is
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:36,160	| IOT010 |	Do offer the WeMo link for the WeMo link
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:40,768	| IOT010 |	Is a Wifi to zigbee bridge but it's a really curated experience
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:42,560	| IOT010 |	With specific saying
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:49,472	| IOT010 |	Our first thing is are smart bulbs both ones made by WeMo and
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:49,984	| IOT010 |	So
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:52,032	| IOT010 |	Wi-Fi is going to play
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:55,616	| IOT010 |	Really big role is as it does already as
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:56,640	| IOT010 |	The big waves
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,432	| IOT010 |	Getting things connected in my home
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:01,504	| IOT010 |	All of that takes place through
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:03,296	| IOT010 |	My wireless router
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:05,600	| IOT010 |	And we've got a lot of great experience with
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:06,368	| IOT010 |	Linksys
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:08,416	| IOT010 |	All of this will work
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:09,696	| IOT010 |	Two I'm gathering
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:11,744	| IOT010 |	More and more seamless way over time
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:15,584	| IOT010 |	All right as a consumer I look at a lot of things
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:17,888	| IOT010 |	This stuff and I'm really excited about it
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:18,912	| IOT010 |	But I also
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:20,960	| IOT010 |	And looking at it and thinking
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:22,496	| IOT010 |	Holly golly gosh
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:24,032	| IOT010 |	This is very expensive
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:25,312	| IOT010 |	So
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:26,848	| IOT010 |	When I look at the
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:27,872	| IOT010 |	WeMo Outlet
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,664	| IOT010 |	I purchased mine
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:30,432	| IOT010 |	3 years ago
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:31,968	| IOT010 |	And it was $50
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:34,528	| IOT010 |	And it is still $50
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:35,296	| IOT010 |	Switch
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,832	| IOT010 |	I felt by now that the pricing
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:39,392	| IOT010 |	Would it come down quite honestly on this
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,696	| IOT010 |	And then I
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:44,768	| IOT010 |	Also look at things like the connected coffee pot
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:46,560	| IOT010 |	Is $149
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:49,888	| IOT010 |	That is a lot to pay for a coffee pot
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:51,168	| IOT010 |	And I understand that the
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:52,960	| IOT010 |	Coffee pot is not just like
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:54,752	| IOT010 |	Hey we put a Wi-Fi radio in
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:55,264	| IOT010 |	But
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:58,080	| IOT010 |	When can we kind of expect to see
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:35:58,848	| IOT010 |	Prices come down
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:04,224	| IOT010 |	Really excited to be able to bring these new kinds of
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:05,248	| IOT010 |	Experiences in
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:07,040	| IOT010 |	Benefits to a
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:09,088	| IOT010 |	People's homes into
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:09,856	| IOT010 |	People's lives
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:16,768	| IOT010 |	Like I'm you wear I'm highly motivated to be able to find ways to a be able to do that
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:20,352	| IOT010 |	Static even better cost benefit
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:21,376	| IOT010 |	Overtime
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:24,960	| IOT010 |	And a little bit of it depends upon our
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:25,728	| IOT010 |	Perspectives
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:29,824	| IOT010 |	For example prior to the WeMo sensor
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:30,592	| IOT010 |	And switch
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:35,200	| IOT010 |	The only way that people would be able to benefit
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:37,248	| IOT010 |	From some of those capabilities
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:40,832	| IOT010 |	Would have been to get actually
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:43,136	| IOT010 |	A multi thousand-dollar system
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:44,672	| IOT010 |	Brought them in
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,696	| IOT010 |	To their home
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:47,744	| IOT010 |	Maybe with recurring
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:50,816	| IOT010 |	Charges every every month so
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:52,352	| IOT010 |	The huge cost
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,120	| IOT010 |	Benefit
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:54,656	| IOT010 |	That we might brought
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:55,936	| IOT010 |	On day one
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:59,520	| IOT010 |	Was a celebrated I think that correctly in that moment
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,568	| IOT010 |	But now
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:05,408	| IOT010 |	Couple of years has gone by so I think we have a new
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:06,944	| IOT010 |	Perspective on
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:08,736	| IOT010 |	What things should have cost
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:10,272	| IOT010 |	While you I'm haven't
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:11,040	| IOT010 |	Seeing the price
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:13,856	| IOT010 |	Of that switch go down
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:14,624	| IOT010 |	Yats
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:18,976	| IOT010 |	I think it's something that we will see for sure in the coming years
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:20,768	| IOT010 |	And I think that on
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:26,144	| IOT010 |	Did the appliance side with things like coffee pots and heaters and
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:27,936	| IOT010 |	Other things that
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:29,728	| IOT010 |	We have in our homes
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:31,520	| IOT010 |	In most cases it's
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:32,800	| IOT010 |	The high-end
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:35,360	| IOT010 |	Of them everything that is first being brought
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:36,384	| IOT010 |	End of a smart home
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:38,944	| IOT010 |	And I think that I was at my
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:39,968	| IOT010 |	Braids down
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:42,016	| IOT010 |	Into
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:43,040	| IOT010 |	Lower price
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:44,064	| IOT010 |	Point items
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:48,160	| IOT010 |	Will see them cost of connected items come
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:48,672	| IOT010 |	Down
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,720	| IOT010 |	Well I look forward to that
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:52,256	| IOT010 |	And then finally
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:54,560	| IOT010 |	This is a fun one for you
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:56,096	| IOT010 |	What devices
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:56,864	| IOT010 |	Do you want to see
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:38:01,472	| IOT010 |	For me it's the kinds of experiences that I want to have
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:02,496	| IOT010 |	At home
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:06,592	| IOT010 |	I look forward to a system that works well with one another
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:09,664	| IOT010 |	And what it is that damn I expect out of that system
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:10,944	| IOT010 |	Gosip
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:13,248	| IOT010 |	Virtually every single day
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:15,552	| IOT010 |	So used to drive me nuts
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:17,088	| IOT010 |	But I couldn't get into my
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:19,904	| IOT010 |	Garage from outside of my house
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:22,208	| IOT010 |	Then I was delighted that I could
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:24,256	| IOT010 |	Could do that off of my WeMo app
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:25,024	| IOT010 |	Then
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:29,632	| IOT010 |	I was irritated again that I was driving away from home but I couldn't
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:32,704	| IOT010 |	Get WeMo to do that for me automatic
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:36,544	| IOT010 |	So my expectation for what it is
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:40,128	| IOT010 |	But I wanted my own experiences and my own home
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:41,664	| IOT010 |	Go up
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:45,248	| IOT010 |	Every time that I get something done I wanted to
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:49,088	| IOT010 |	Do more that'll be a both a little bit of a curse
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:50,880	| IOT010 |	Integrate
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:52,416	| IOT010 |	Ability for
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:58,560	| IOT010 |	Future great experiences that WeMo and the mothers can unlock for
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:02,912	| IOT010 |	As the systems work in a more holistic way
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:05,216	| IOT010 |	As soon as my smartphone connects
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:06,240	| IOT010 |	To my
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:09,056	| IOT010 |	Smart Wifi Linksys router
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:11,360	| IOT010 |	My system knows that I'm home
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:13,408	| IOT010 |	Things should be able to
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:15,712	| IOT010 |	Happened for me automatically
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:18,016	| IOT010 |	With about me I'm thinking about it
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:21,088	| IOT010 |	So these holistic experiences
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:25,952	| IOT010 |	Everything working to gather in a seamless fashion
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:27,488	| IOT010 |	Is definitely what I'm looking
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:28,256	| IOT010 |	Forward to
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:29,024	| IOT010 |	Me too
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:29,536	| IOT010 |	I'm
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:33,888	| IOT010 |	Going one harder though I'm looking forward it to it happening
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:36,704	| IOT010 |	Even though not all of my devices are in the same platform
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:38,240	| IOT010 |	I think I'm crazy
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:44,128	| IOT010 |	Let's hope that you're not as crazy as of your thinking
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:47,200	| IOT010 |	I'm I'm with you I will drink to that only I'm not drink
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:48,736	| IOT010 |	All right
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:52,064	| IOT010 |	Thank you so much for coming on the show I really appreciate it
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:57,440	| IOT010 |	It's really really good to hear thank you for having me and I look forward to seeing you soon
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:40:00,256	| IOT010 |	That's all for this week show stay tuned for next week
