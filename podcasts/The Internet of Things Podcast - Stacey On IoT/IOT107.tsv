EDL	00:00:13,312	00:00:15,360	| IOT107 |	And today we have a special co-host
EDL	00:00:15,360	00:00:16,384	| IOT107 |	Richard Gunther
EDL	00:00:16,384	00:00:19,456	| IOT107 |	That's right we got Richard Gunther here from the digital media Zone
EDL	00:00:19,968	00:00:22,528	| IOT107 |	He does an awesome podcast especially if you like lighting
EDL	00:00:23,040	00:00:24,064	| IOT107 |	Call Dad home
EDL	00:00:27,136	00:00:28,416	| IOT107 |	Richard is my go-to guy
EDL	00:00:28,416	00:00:29,952	| IOT107 |	I am a bit lighting obsessed
EDL	00:00:29,952	00:00:30,720	| IOT107 |	He is
EDL	00:00:30,720	00:00:34,816	| IOT107 |	That's okay I am too so for all of you guys were like Stacy stop talking about lighting
EDL	00:00:34,816	00:00:35,840	| IOT107 |	This may not be your show
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:41,472	| IOT107 |	We do have an awesome show for you we're going to talk about the Bricker but
EDL	00:00:41,472	00:00:43,776	| IOT107 |	Ikeyless lights again
EDL	00:00:43,776	00:00:46,336	| IOT107 |	Because we found some information about their security
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:48,128	| IOT107 |	A bit of Microsoft Sopris project
EDL	00:00:48,640	00:00:49,664	| IOT107 |	A new hub
EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:50,432	| IOT107 |	From Sbarro
EDL	00:00:50,944	00:00:52,224	| IOT107 |	New mesh Network
EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:52,992	| IOT107 |	From tp-link
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:56,064	| IOT107 |	Some other odds and ends of news and
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:57,088	| IOT107 |	Matinee
EDL	00:00:57,088	00:00:58,880	| IOT107 |	And how to use it to change
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:00:59,392	| IOT107 |	Your lighting
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:02,464	| IOT107 |	I also have an install to talk about
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:04,000	| IOT107 |	We did the Google
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:07,584	| IOT107 |	The Google home vs Echo swap in my house and I'll tell you how that went
EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:11,424	| IOT107 |	Richard has a smart blinds installation
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:14,496	| IOT107 |	You guys are going to want to hear cuz I know you love this stuff
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:16,800	| IOT107 |	Our Guest this week
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:19,360	| IOT107 |	Kevin Ashton
EDL	00:01:19,872	00:01:24,224	| IOT107 |	Who coined the phrase internet of things and he tells us all about that
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:25,248	| IOT107 |	And what he thinks about it today
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:26,528	| IOT107 |	Celtics
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:29,856	| IOT107 |	Let's go to a quick message from our sponsor
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:36,256	| IOT107 |	Got a great idea for an iot business Samsung artik interoperable in
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:42,656	| IOT107 |	Secure iot platform it lets you focus on building your business rather than worrying about technology
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:49,056	| IOT107 |	Integrated Hardware cloud and services interoperability with other device service cloud and systems
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:55,456	| IOT107 |	Charity Samsung artik coyote gets down to business for more information visit Arctic
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:59,040	| IOT107 |	Dot IO and that's a r t i k.
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:03,136	| IOT107 |	Alright let's kick off this show
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:04,416	| IOT107 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:06,208	| IOT107 |	Bricked devices
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,512	| IOT107 |	Because we actually had
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:11,840	| IOT107 |	A couple weeks ago we talked about
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:12,864	| IOT107 |	Somebody had developed
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:15,680	| IOT107 |	A virus basically that went around shutting off
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:18,496	| IOT107 |	Active devices this was theoretical at the time
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,568	| IOT107 |	Thanks to people
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:24,640	| IOT107 |	It's called
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:26,688	| IOT107 |	What is this is
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:30,016	| IOT107 |	It goes through and it finds things that have the Mirai botnet in them
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,808	| IOT107 |	Or are accessible
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,600	| IOT107 |	By the Mirai botnet
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:35,136	| IOT107 |	Because it's got a hard-coded password and
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:37,696	| IOT107 |	Deportes breaks the device
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:42,304	| IOT107 |	Which is crummy if you own this device and suddenly it's
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:44,864	| IOT107 |	Not working but it's also kind of like
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:48,192	| IOT107 |	Vigilante justice on the internet of things trying to keep the bride button
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:48,960	| IOT107 |	Shutdown
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:49,984	| IOT107 |	I don't know
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,264	| IOT107 |	How do you spell
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:58,688	| IOT107 |	Yeah this is really really weird and the thing that's interesting here is am I correct in understanding that this was.
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,736	| IOT107 |	Discovered basically by setting up
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,272	| IOT107 |	A Honeypot
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:04,064	| IOT107 |	To try and find stuff like this
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:04,576	| IOT107 |	What is
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:11,232	| IOT107 |	I think it's nice in the sense that
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:15,072	| IOT107 |	It's going to really Force manufacturers
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:15,840	| IOT107 |	2
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:17,376	| IOT107 |	Is there consumers
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:23,520	| IOT107 |	What the heck is happening here and they're going to call their company in the company's going to be like oh crap we should have spent money on security
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:27,104	| IOT107 |	But I got to admit if my router
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:35,808	| IOT107 |	Well right and so that's what I'm really wondering about is as consumer and you know that's what I focus mostly on
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:36,832	| IOT107 |	My show
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,624	| IOT107 |	If I'm a consumer and I have
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:40,416	| IOT107 |	How does this impact me
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:43,744	| IOT107 |	Is it just that my router shut down
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:44,256	| IOT107 |	What is
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:48,864	| IOT107 |	My indicator that I have this problem and I need to do something about it
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:50,912	| IOT107 |	It breaks your device so
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,192	| IOT107 |	You will know because your device will
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:55,264	| IOT107 |	It flushes all iptables
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,800	| IOT107 |	And all the network
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:59,360	| IOT107 |	And then it adds its own rule to drop all out
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,688	| IOT107 |	It tries to wipe all the codons
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,528	| IOT107 |	So that's a pretty like there's not really
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,040	| IOT107 |	Way to come back
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:12,160	| IOT107 |	Do we know what devices are impacted by this
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:16,000	| IOT107 |	It is devices that are attractive to the Mirai botnet so they're running Linux
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:20,095	| IOT107 |	Those that are running the BusyBox toolkit
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:20,863	| IOT107 |	And it
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:24,959	| IOT107 |	Apparently according to the register has a particular affinity for Ubiquiti Networks
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:29,311	| IOT107 |	Yeah I saw that cuz I run Ubiquiti
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:32,127	| IOT107 |	Here's the solution guy so to block the attack
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,151	| IOT107 |	You have to disable telnet
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,455	| IOT107 |	Which many people tell you to do
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,223	| IOT107 |	You already
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:38,783	| IOT107 |	Change the devices factory set
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,343	| IOT107 |	Also something that you should be doing already
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,135	| IOT107 |	And
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:47,999	| IOT107 |	The company that discovered this radwear also recommends using intrusion prevention systems to lock down device
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,535	| IOT107 |	Coincidentally
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:50,559	| IOT107 |	Pappadeaux's
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:53,631	| IOT107 |	I will say though if you are running
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:56,959	| IOT107 |	Infected device or device it's likely to be affected
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:02,591	| IOT107 |	You should be doing taking those steps anyway because it's highly likely that it will get infected by the ride.
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:04,383	| IOT107 |	Anyhow so
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:05,407	| IOT107 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,199	| IOT107 |	Messi
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,735	| IOT107 |	Messi Messi
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:11,551	| IOT107 |	But we have good security News 2
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:14,111	| IOT107 |	We do two weeks ago
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,391	| IOT107 |	For the two weeks or last week
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:20,511	| IOT107 |	I think was the last week you guys were talking about the Ikea Troy tree lighting
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,327	| IOT107 |	Exactly is is that how you say it
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,863	| IOT107 |	Cuz I've been
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,655	| IOT107 |	You have just
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,423	| IOT107 |	Proven your worth
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:29,215	| IOT107 |	Right there
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:32,287	| IOT107 |	So we wondered
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:35,359	| IOT107 |	Gosh is Ikea doing this right or they just opening up a giant
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:35,871	| IOT107 |	Security hole ever
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:38,687	| IOT107 |	An answer is
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,223	| IOT107 |	I can't do this right
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:45,855	| IOT107 |	Yeah so it looks like from some independent research
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:47,391	| IOT107 |	Into the platform
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:49,439	| IOT107 |	Some really in-depth
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:49,951	| IOT107 |	Analysis
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,279	| IOT107 |	Diarias in
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:54,815	| IOT107 |	The Hub itself
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:57,119	| IOT107 |	And in the communications
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:03,519	| IOT107 |	And the bottom line here was that says it seems like one
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,799	| IOT107 |	One of the most
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:07,103	| IOT107 |	Secure iot style devices
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:09,151	| IOT107 |	I've looked at
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,175	| IOT107 |	A quote
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:10,687	| IOT107 |	Doubt
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,991	| IOT107 |	He does mention one
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,015	| IOT107 |	Potential problem
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,551	| IOT107 |	And that's that
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:19,903	| IOT107 |	At the time of initiation the hub goes out and
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:22,207	| IOT107 |	Things at Ikea server and says hey
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:25,023	| IOT107 |	Let me know if there are any updates I should get
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:27,839	| IOT107 |	And it gets the response back in
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:31,423	| IOT107 |	Clear http which is probably not a good thing
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,959	| IOT107 |	And that's something that they could
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:35,519	| IOT107 |	Clearly fix at some point in time
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:39,871	| IOT107 |	But he also indicated that really the only way of hacking this thing
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,919	| IOT107 |	Is if you had physical access to it
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:45,247	| IOT107 |	Right in the reason is because there's no remote
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,015	| IOT107 |	DIYs
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,295	| IOT107 |	Which also means
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:49,599	| IOT107 |	It looks like this might not work with other device
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,391	| IOT107 |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:53,695	| IOT107 |	That's the downside so it's
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,719	| IOT107 |	Highly secure
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,743	| IOT107 |	In part because
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:56,511	| IOT107 |	It doesn't talk to any
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,815	| IOT107 |	Which is a good way to say
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:05,215	| IOT107 |	It is a medium hope I hope they're able to get beyond that at some point
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:07,775	| IOT107 |	Because I'm very excited about this platform
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:10,079	| IOT107 |	We talked about this a little bit on
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:13,151	| IOT107 |	Our next episode of home on and I've been
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:16,223	| IOT107 |	Eagerly awaiting what Ikea is going to be doing because
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:23,135	| IOT107 |	Stacy I think Ikea has the recipe to sell this stuff right in retail they know how to do it
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:25,695	| IOT107 |	Experiential storytelling in retail
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:28,511	| IOT107 |	I totally agree with you it actually
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:32,095	| IOT107 |	I've been in touch with Ikea and they should be on the show Suits
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,375	| IOT107 |	We can find out
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:33,887	| IOT107 |	A lot more
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,191	| IOT107 |	Yay
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,215	| IOT107 |	Security
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:41,311	| IOT107 |	This is going to get a little deep you guys but you should know about it because
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:41,823	| IOT107 |	Security is
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,127	| IOT107 |	Animal
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,199	| IOT107 |	Microsoft introduced last week
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:53,087	| IOT107 |	A project called project Sopris in what does is basically a way to bring security
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:57,183	| IOT107 |	Two microcontrollers which are the tiny little computers that run a lot of
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,463	| IOT107 |	You're connected to
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:59,487	| IOT107 |	Spices so
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:02,303	| IOT107 |	Tiny kind of dumb processors are
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,071	| IOT107 |	What these are
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:03,583	| IOT107 |	And
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:06,143	| IOT107 |	There's a million different flavors
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:07,679	| IOT107 |	It's not like the Intel
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,471	| IOT107 |	Kind of world where there's one flavor
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,031	| IOT107 |	There's pee more now
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:15,103	| IOT107 |	But what they done is it put out this research paper
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:18,687	| IOT107 |	And they basically came up with seven concepts for security
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,223	| IOT107 |	And put it on
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:23,039	| IOT107 |	Afford a development boards that they're giving to hackers
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,855	| IOT107 |	Later this month in May
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,391	| IOT107 |	So they're getting hackers in May
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,439	| IOT107 |	Try to get them to test it and play with it
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,743	| IOT107 |	So here are the seven things
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,791	| IOT107 |	That you need to have
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:34,815	| IOT107 |	In Microsoft
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,095	| IOT107 |	Worldview-2
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:37,119	| IOT107 |	Make a secure system
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:39,935	| IOT107 |	You have to have a hardware-based Reta Trust
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,471	| IOT107 |	Small trusted computing
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:44,287	| IOT107 |	We're stuck in a loop
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,847	| IOT107 |	Do you have to have defense in depth
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:50,943	| IOT107 |	Basically that means is the device still protected if the security of one layer
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,711	| IOT107 |	Device
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,223	| IOT107 |	Is breached
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:53,247	| IOT107 |	Clark
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,039	| IOT107 |	Compartmentalization
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:09:01,439	| IOT107 |	And so that means does a failure and one component at the device require a reboot of the entire device to return to operation
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:02,719	| IOT107 |	They don't want that
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:05,023	| IOT107 |	Certificate-based Authentication
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:05,535	| IOT107 |	That's what
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:10,399	| IOT107 |	Renewable security which means the devices software can be updated automatically
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,447	| IOT107 |	And then failure report
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:14,751	| IOT107 |	Does the device report failures to its
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,823	| IOT107 |	I'm actually surprised when
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:19,871	| IOT107 |	I sometimes test devices and there's no failure
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,919	| IOT107 |	Reporting and I'm like really
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,967	| IOT107 |	Music
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:25,503	| IOT107 |	So these are the seven properties
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:31,647	| IOT107 |	I look at this and I actually talked to his some security researchers and some people in the industry
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:34,719	| IOT107 |	And they look at this actually this is a really good frame
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:37,023	| IOT107 |	My concern is
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:40,863	| IOT107 |	That Microsoft is pulling all of this in
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,143	| IOT107 |	And there
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,959	| IOT107 |	Already chip vendors who are trying to
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:48,543	| IOT107 |	Create this type of platform or some elements of this platform
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,335	| IOT107 |	On
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,359	| IOT107 |	Their chips so
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,663	| IOT107 |	Nxp has sicurella
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,455	| IOT107 |	Which is a designer
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:56,991	| IOT107 |	Facturar
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,551	| IOT107 |	What is that mean for those guys is basically what
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,599	| IOT107 |	Microsoft's kind of
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,391	| IOT107 |	Perspective seems to be
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,487	| IOT107 |	Or basic
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:17,215	| IOT107 |	Well I mean this is what Microsoft does best right they come out with some really great
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,007	| IOT107 |	Approaches and
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,543	| IOT107 |	Frameworks
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,079	| IOT107 |	And they're usually late to the game
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:27,967	| IOT107 |	Awesome experience
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,015	| IOT107 |	Right exactly
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,551	| IOT107 |	So
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:33,343	| IOT107 |	Who knows who knows if
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:36,927	| IOT107 |	This is going to get adopted I mean I'm wondering if Microsoft is doing this
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,951	| IOT107 |	In some way
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:41,279	| IOT107 |	As a way of saying look this is what we're going to expect
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:43,839	| IOT107 |	Run
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,119	| IOT107 |	Windows for iot
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,167	| IOT107 |	On NE
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:47,935	| IOT107 |	Device
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,471	| IOT107 |	We expect this
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:50,751	| IOT107 |	Level of security
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:53,823	| IOT107 |	And maybe that's where they're going to cut
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:55,103	| IOT107 |	Draw the line
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:57,663	| IOT107 |	I don't know how they would do that exactly
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:02,271	| IOT107 |	Is it could do that programmatically or if it would have to be something that they in a case-by-case basis
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:05,599	| IOT107 |	It's interesting
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:11,999	| IOT107 |	Frank Lee work companies need to be thinking about this yes I'm super glad it looks like the elements
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,511	| IOT107 |	Exactly right
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:19,423	| IOT107 |	And it feels like because of its a lot of the industrial internet so the Enterprise players and Industrial internet come
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,959	| IOT107 |	Please turn to Microsoft azure
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:22,751	| IOT107 |	Another cloud
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:23,519	| IOT107 |	Compute
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:25,311	| IOT107 |	And storage for their iot stuff
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:27,103	| IOT107 |	And they do it because they Trust
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:28,639	| IOT107 |	Microsoft to actually
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:30,175	| IOT107 |	Provide slang
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,479	| IOT107 |	Their it departments are like yeah
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,271	| IOT107 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,039	| IOT107 |	So
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,319	| IOT107 |	That level having
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,879	| IOT107 |	Having influence at Fortune 500
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,159	| IOT107 |	Tundra companies
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:42,207	| IOT107 |	Feels like this could be a good way
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:46,303	| IOT107 |	Get adopted maybe not in the smart home but definitely across connected devices
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,327	| IOT107 |	Enterprise
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,607	| IOT107 |	So
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,631	| IOT107 |	We'll see
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,167	| IOT107 |	All right
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:55,519	| IOT107 |	I know
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:57,311	| IOT107 |	A new hub.
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:58,591	| IOT107 |	You know what this is
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:02,175	| IOT107 |	This doesn't seem too though so fibaro has been talkin
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,199	| IOT107 |	For quite a long time now
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,223	| IOT107 |	About
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,783	| IOT107 |	Version of there
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,551	| IOT107 |	Home Center
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,855	| IOT107 |	Sbarro is a company that
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,903	| IOT107 |	Primarily does business in
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:12,927	| IOT107 |	European countries
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:15,743	| IOT107 |	And they are now bringing
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:17,279	| IOT107 |	A light version of
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:19,327	| IOT107 |	They're Z-Wave based hub
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:21,119	| IOT107 |	The US
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:25,727	| IOT107 |	And this is good news this is a really good product
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,495	| IOT107 |	From what I've
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:27,263	| IOT107 |	Racine
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,287	| IOT107 |	It has
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:29,055	| IOT107 |	Significant
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:32,127	| IOT107 |	Capabilities very granular
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:35,199	| IOT107 |	Programming capabilities energy monitoring
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:36,479	| IOT107 |	All the good stuff
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:39,551	| IOT107 |	That you want in a high-end helping this is a high-end
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:42,879	| IOT107 |	This is a $279 product this is not
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:47,487	| IOT107 |	Something that you're going to buy at your Lowe's for $60
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:53,119	| IOT107 |	There you go
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:54,143	| IOT107 |	There you go
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,679	| IOT107 |	And the other thing that
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,703	| IOT107 |	I love about
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,471	| IOT107 |	Sbarro
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:13:01,055	| IOT107 |	And I think you know we've talked about this I think tomorrow has
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:02,079	| IOT107 |	Some of the best
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:07,455	| IOT107 |	Physical industrial design for products out there if you're looking for products that are going to look cool and home
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:10,783	| IOT107 |	Dyson small and 9
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,295	| IOT107 |	Trusova
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:14,111	| IOT107 |	Particularly for security type products
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,927	| IOT107 |	They have a really good selection
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:18,719	| IOT107 |	Products available
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:23,839	| IOT107 |	And I'm excited to see this finally happening they say they're shipping
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:27,679	| IOT107 |	It's also going to be compatible
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:29,215	| IOT107 |	With systems like
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:31,775	| IOT107 |	Sonos and Logitech
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:36,895	| IOT107 |	Russound and Phillips restaurant surprised about you don't see a lot of folks integrating with that that's
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,431	| IOT107 |	A bit higher in but
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,711	| IOT107 |	Remember this
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:41,247	| IOT107 |	Origins of
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,271	| IOT107 |	Sbarro's Friday
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:44,575	| IOT107 |	In many cases are in
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:46,111	| IOT107 |	Irn installations
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:50,207	| IOT107 |	And they're planning Amazon Echo integration to so good stuff
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:52,767	| IOT107 |	Yeah oh and you can control 230 devices
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:54,047	| IOT107 |	Which is
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:59,167	| IOT107 |	That is a lot actually and I don't think even I have
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,215	| IOT107 |	230 devices
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:06,847	| IOT107 |	Now my echo 230 devices but that's cuz it counts everything multiple times for some reason
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:08,639	| IOT107 |	You may have multiple
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:11,199	| IOT107 |	Every time I read
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:11,711	| IOT107 |	Discover things
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,111	| IOT107 |	Discovery
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:19,647	| IOT107 |	So
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,439	| IOT107 |	That is
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:24,255	| IOT107 |	Quickfundusa
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,303	| IOT107 |	There's a new mesh router
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,071	| IOT107 |	From tp-link
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,631	| IOT107 |	It is The Deco M5
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,399	| IOT107 |	Mesh router
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:33,727	| IOT107 |	What are we calling these are these the new mesh router of the week
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,311	| IOT107 |	I don't know
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:40,639	| IOT107 |	We don't have a name but we do talk about him a lot so
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:43,455	| IOT107 |	The router will settle for $299
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:47,295	| IOT107 |	And I supposed to cover between 2400 and 4500 square feet
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:49,343	| IOT107 |	Individual units are going to be
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:50,879	| IOT107 |	129
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,159	| IOT107 |	So that's cheaper than Eero
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,951	| IOT107 |	It is
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:55,999	| IOT107 |	Right in line with Google Wi-Fi and
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:15:03,167	| IOT107 |	And actually I have not tried this to have you tried the velop system from Linksys cuz that is there mesh wife
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:05,727	| IOT107 |	They have I have not
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,007	| IOT107 |	But now they have
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,567	| IOT107 |	Yeah no I have not
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:16,223	| IOT107 |	And yeah I'm glad to see companies get into this Mike Wolfe and I were talking about a year-and-a-half ago about how it's
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:20,831	| IOT107 |	Wi-Fi routers were just kind of becoming commoditized
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,367	| IOT107 |	Really glad to see companies
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,159	| IOT107 |	Coming out with
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:25,183	| IOT107 |	Innovative
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:28,255	| IOT107 |	New Solutions in adopting this newer
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:30,815	| IOT107 |	Mesh technology since I adopted mesh
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,839	| IOT107 |	In my home
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:34,399	| IOT107 |	Granted I mentioned I'm using Ubiquiti
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:37,983	| IOT107 |	So it's a bit of a more industrial solution
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:41,055	| IOT107 |	I don't have the problems that I used to have
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,591	| IOT107 |	These things
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:44,639	| IOT107 |	Do work these things do solve
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:47,199	| IOT107 |	The coverage issues that most folks
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,735	| IOT107 |	Particularly with iot devices
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:51,295	| IOT107 |	Around the fringes of their home
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,319	| IOT107 |	Typically complain about
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:58,975	| IOT107 |	Industrial designer this tp-link is a little weird I don't know if you can see the picture Richard bit
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,255	| IOT107 |	It's beastly
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:02,303	| IOT107 |	Round circle pucks but then they've got like this
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,607	| IOT107 |	Triangle sticking out
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:05,375	| IOT107 |	Kind of
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,399	| IOT107 |	Of the side looks like
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:08,447	| IOT107 |	And you're like half
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:08,959	| IOT107 |	Pulling out
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:09,983	| IOT107 |	Piece of the pie
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:14,335	| IOT107 |	Is she had her you know I was joking on Twitter earlier this week that
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:20,991	| IOT107 |	I think it's a bit ridiculous that all of these products are designed as if you're going to put them out on your coffee table or something
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:27,135	| IOT107 |	In all likelihood this is going to be shoved in a corner but every company is trying to come up with
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:28,671	| IOT107 |	Something that looks
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:33,023	| IOT107 |	Unique and special and makes it something that you might want to put out for
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,559	| IOT107 |	Visibility
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:35,071	| IOT107 |	Of course
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:38,655	| IOT107 |	Any cords you have for power or
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:41,215	| IOT107 |	And ethernet backhaul on any of these things you're not really
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,495	| IOT107 |	Why do that
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:45,055	| IOT107 |	Here's my brilliant startup idea anyone can have this
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:47,615	| IOT107 |	Okay so Kleenex boxes
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:50,175	| IOT107 |	Have covers and if you're not a girl you may not know this
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:54,783	| IOT107 |	But they have these fancy covers that you can buy the stick over your Kleenex box
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:55,551	| IOT107 |	So
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,063	| IOT107 |	You don't have the app
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:58,111	| IOT107 |	What we need
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:58,879	| IOT107 |	Is that it
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:00,159	| IOT107 |	RF permeable
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:02,719	| IOT107 |	Netease 3D printed custom
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:03,999	| IOT107 |	Router cover
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,791	| IOT107 |	And that it could be pretty
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:11,679	| IOT107 |	All right I just don't want it to be knitted and have it look like a chicken or something like that I have
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,287	| IOT107 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,055	| IOT107 |	Ring added
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,871	| IOT107 |	An unlimited device plan because it
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,895	| IOT107 |	It has so many devices
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,199	| IOT107 |	Ring has been
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:26,271	| IOT107 |	Coming out with more and more products with cameras on them
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:29,599	| IOT107 |	Are intended to secure the perimeter of your home
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:31,391	| IOT107 |	And more cameras
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:33,695	| IOT107 |	Then the more you end up paying in
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,719	| IOT107 |	Video plans
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:36,511	| IOT107 |	To store and access
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:38,815	| IOT107 |	All of the videos that they're recording
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:39,839	| IOT107 |	So
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:45,215	| IOT107 |	At $3 a pop that can get pretty expensive if you have a bunch of these things around the house where
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:48,287	| IOT107 |	Expecting that there going to be coming out with the floodlight soon
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:51,359	| IOT107 |	That's also going to have a camera on it
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:54,943	| IOT107 |	So they've introduced a plan in advance
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,223	| IOT107 |	Of that product release
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:18:00,575	| IOT107 |	That is a universal or unlimited cameras plan
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:02,623	| IOT107 |	Edis called ring protect
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,391	| IOT107 |	Four ring
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,927	| IOT107 |	For $10 a month
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,719	| IOT107 |	You can get
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:08,767	| IOT107 |	Any number of cameras
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:09,791	| IOT107 |	All in the same plan
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:13,119	| IOT107 |	And you can also pay $100 a year
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:14,655	| IOT107 |	If you want to pay that way
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:17,471	| IOT107 |	And if you have any more than three devices
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:18,751	| IOT107 |	Your
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:22,079	| IOT107 |	Definitely going to be saving some money I think this is a great thing
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:25,407	| IOT107 |	I'm expecting to get the ring
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:27,199	| IOT107 |	Flood light when it comes out
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:30,015	| IOT107 |	And so that's going to put me over the edge
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,551	| IOT107 |	I'm definitely going to be getting
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:33,343	| IOT107 |	Wow so
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:37,439	| IOT107 |	That is good news for ring because it means that hopefully people like you
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:38,463	| IOT107 |	Are buying
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,487	| IOT107 |	More than three devices
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,023	| IOT107 |	+ 3
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,815	| IOT107 |	So good for them
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,935	| IOT107 |	I don't know
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:48,959	| IOT107 |	I don't like the looks of it
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,239	| IOT107 |	It's a little bit
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:53,311	| IOT107 |	Chunky to put on the side of the house
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:54,079	| IOT107 |	Okay.
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:55,615	| IOT107 |	But so with a battery
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,151	| IOT107 |	How often do you recharge
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:59,199	| IOT107 |	So I
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,991	| IOT107 |	End up recharging about
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:03,295	| IOT107 |	Every two months I would say
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:07,903	| IOT107 |	Batteries get a workout
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:10,719	| IOT107 |	Because the one camera that I have is on
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:12,767	| IOT107 |	The side of the house where I let the dogs out
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:13,791	| IOT107 |	And
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:14,559	| IOT107 |	I'm doing that
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:15,583	| IOT107 |	Pretty regularly
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:19,423	| IOT107 |	So I'm pretty happy with that I don't really have a problem with
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:21,727	| IOT107 |	Pulling it down
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:25,823	| IOT107 |	The camera is made with a nice clip that it's easy to pull down
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:28,383	| IOT107 |	Just stick it on USB and charge it up for the day
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:30,175	| IOT107 |	Oh okay
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:31,967	| IOT107 |	So yeah I was I was wondering
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:34,783	| IOT107 |	I did the Arlo cameras in when I tested those
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:37,599	| IOT107 |	I put one like way up in a tree and I needed a
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:40,927	| IOT107 |	A ladder to get to it and then the battery died
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,207	| IOT107 |	This was dumb very dumb
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:47,839	| IOT107 |	Well see what you need there is a kid who likes
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,351	| IOT107 |	To climb trees
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:55,263	| IOT107 |	This is news that is tailor-made for you mister lighting
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:57,567	| IOT107 |	So we have some news about
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:59,103	| IOT107 |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:00,639	| IOT107 |	It has a new capability
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:03,711	| IOT107 |	And we have some new light bulbs that will work
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,735	| IOT107 |	With the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:07,295	| IOT107 |	So the new capabilities you can tell the echo
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:08,575	| IOT107 |	To turn
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:11,391	| IOT107 |	Tp-link +
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,671	| IOT107 |	Lifx light bulbs
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:14,975	| IOT107 |	To turn to a specific color
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:15,999	| IOT107 |	So yeah
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:18,303	| IOT107 |	Madame a turn bedroom lights
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,351	| IOT107 |	And that will happen
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,143	| IOT107 |	And that's really cool
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,167	| IOT107 |	Is Google home
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:25,215	| IOT107 |	That already so this kind of brings it to
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:26,495	| IOT107 |	Feature parity
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:28,543	| IOT107 |	And then
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:30,079	| IOT107 |	Tp-link Kasa
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:31,359	| IOT107 |	Are these new bulbs
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,943	| IOT107 |	I believe that the
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,967	| IOT107 |	Color changing
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:39,807	| IOT107 |	Bald is new but I'm not sure about the other ones I know that
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:41,087	| IOT107 |	They were showing
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:43,135	| IOT107 |	At CES this year
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:46,463	| IOT107 |	So I'm not sure if this is the introduction of those for real
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,999	| IOT107 |	Or if they already had them
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:51,327	| IOT107 |	Okay tp-link basically also said hey
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:53,887	| IOT107 |	You can change your colors
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:55,423	| IOT107 |	And are tunable white lights
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:56,447	| IOT107 |	With the echo
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:59,263	| IOT107 |	Which might be the same it is a skill
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,055	| IOT107 |	So
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:03,871	| IOT107 |	It's all part of that smart home skills so it's
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:05,919	| IOT107 |	Well it's a skill
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:08,735	| IOT107 |	It's built into the smart home section
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:09,247	| IOT107 |	Of
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:11,807	| IOT107 |	The app where you would configure this stuff
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:14,623	| IOT107 |	This is really good I'm glad to see that
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:20,000	| IOT107 |	Added color control this has been missing particularly if you have white tunable
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,280	| IOT107 |	You didn't have the ability
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:23,072	| IOT107 |	To address those and if you have
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:24,096	| IOT107 |	Then
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:27,424	| IOT107 |	You really care about the color of
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:28,448	| IOT107 |	Pure white light
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:32,288	| IOT107 |	So having this ability is going to be important
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:35,104	| IOT107 |	To you and then for the color tunables
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,640	| IOT107 |	You always had to revert to
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,432	| IOT107 |	Whatever app you
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,480	| IOT107 |	Control these things
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:42,528	| IOT107 |	If you wanted to change the color like if you had
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:44,576	| IOT107 |	Hue bulbs around so
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:46,112	| IOT107 |	This is a really good
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,904	| IOT107 |	New capability
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:54,304	| IOT107 |	I'm curious how this is getting rolled out though because I tried it and I think you said you tried it to and it isn't working
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:54,816	| IOT107 |	Fortis yet
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,608	| IOT107 |	It isn't
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:22:00,704	| IOT107 |	That doesn't mean I'm I'm sitting here looking in my Google Play Store to see
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:03,776	| IOT107 |	Have I updated the app recently so
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:04,288	| IOT107 |	I don't know
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:11,200	| IOT107 |	But I don't have it yet I will test it out for next week I'm excited about it because you know even things like make the lights warmer
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:12,736	| IOT107 |	Make the lights cooler
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:13,248	| IOT107 |	Will be
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:14,784	| IOT107 |	I think nice
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:16,320	| IOT107 |	Cuz I am absolutely
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,160	| IOT107 |	So
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:24,000	| IOT107 |	It's install time you guys were going to talk about our life in the Smart Home
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,024	| IOT107 |	Mine
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:28,352	| IOT107 |	Is last week I promised you that I would switch my Google home
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:29,888	| IOT107 |	And my echo
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:31,936	| IOT107 |	Downstairs in the living room of my house
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:32,960	| IOT107 |	Our kitchen is where
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:33,728	| IOT107 |	Elizabeth
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:34,240	| IOT107 |	It's open
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:35,520	| IOT107 |	And
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:37,312	| IOT107 |	I didn't actually do a full swap
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:40,128	| IOT107 |	Because the Google home is still a little iffy
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:43,712	| IOT107 |	So they're both kind of sitting there hanging out but we did use the Google home
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:45,248	| IOT107 |	And
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:47,552	| IOT107 |	Here's a couple things I can repay
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:50,880	| IOT107 |	When it comes to doing the smart home stuff
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,160	| IOT107 |	Google home is not quite
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:55,232	| IOT107 |	I had hooked it up to my Logitech Harmony
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:23:00,352	| IOT107 |	That plus the wink integration gave me everything I needed to control all the devices that the echo
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,632	| IOT107 |	Can we talk to the echo
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,144	| IOT107 |	So it downstairs
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:05,216	| IOT107 |	Buy the Google home was fine with the harmony
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:07,776	| IOT107 |	To do a couple things
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:08,800	| IOT107 |	What's 1
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:12,384	| IOT107 |	It wouldn't reliably play music
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:13,408	| IOT107 |	I'm not sure
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:15,968	| IOT107 |	What was going on but we would ask it to play
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:17,248	| IOT107 |	Play Beyonce
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,296	| IOT107 |	And it was
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:21,088	| IOT107 |	Play Beyonce on Spotify
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:22,368	| IOT107 |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:23,648	| IOT107 |	There's been a problem
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:27,744	| IOT107 |	And I even asked at one point I was like what's the problem or what's wrong
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:28,512	| IOT107 |	It was like
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:29,792	| IOT107 |	Sometimes I'm a bit buggy
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,424	| IOT107 |	Like immediately after ask
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:38,496	| IOT107 |	Google home I would ask the Echo and the echo
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:41,056	| IOT107 |	And this is very intermittent
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:41,568	| IOT107 |	It just
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:44,128	| IOT107 |	You never knew when it was going to work or not work
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:44,896	| IOT107 |	Which is
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:48,992	| IOT107 |	Video killer for my daughter who loves listening to music
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:53,856	| IOT107 |	So that was one the other thing is probably just me but it's super weird
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:56,416	| IOT107 |	I have this crazy integration
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:57,696	| IOT107 |	With my
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:59,488	| IOT107 |	Lutron lights
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,536	| IOT107 |	They go to the Lutron hub
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:04,096	| IOT107 |	To SmartThings
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:05,888	| IOT107 |	And then through that too
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:06,656	| IOT107 |	Google home
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,728	| IOT107 |	I have two lights my dining room and my kitchen
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:13,312	| IOT107 |	Google home will turn on and off my dining room
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:17,152	| IOT107 |	But when I ask it to turn on or off my kitchen lights
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:17,920	| IOT107 |	It says it's doing it
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:19,200	| IOT107 |	And then nothing
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:21,760	| IOT107 |	Which I think is super weird
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,808	| IOT107 |	Yeah
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:24,576	| IOT107 |	No
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,368	| IOT107 |	You have these lights hooked up to
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:27,648	| IOT107 |	Other
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:30,208	| IOT107 |	System tray these are your Lutron light so
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:31,488	| IOT107 |	Are integrated with
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,024	| IOT107 |	D
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:34,816	| IOT107 |	Echo.and
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:35,584	| IOT107 |	With
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:37,120	| IOT107 |	What these Logitech as well
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:39,168	| IOT107 |	No they're not integrated with the Logitech
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:43,008	| IOT107 |	To homekit
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:44,032	| IOT107 |	Set up
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:45,312	| IOT107 |	Okay
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,080	| IOT107 |	The echo
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:46,592	| IOT107 |	Into smart thing
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:50,688	| IOT107 |	And are you able to control those lights okay from
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,712	| IOT107 |	Those systems
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:52,224	| IOT107 |	Yes
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:57,856	| IOT107 |	I did my favorite thing to do when my Integrations don't work
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:59,136	| IOT107 |	Which is pull everything out
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:01,184	| IOT107 |	So I pulled the
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:05,280	| IOT107 |	The Lutron to SmartThings integration I broke that and then I
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:05,792	| IOT107 |	Pull the
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:08,352	| IOT107 |	Google home and
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,632	| IOT107 |	The SmartThings integration
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:10,144	| IOT107 |	I broke that
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,216	| IOT107 |	Thinking maybe that would solve
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:15,008	| IOT107 |	But it hasn't solved it
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:15,520	| IOT107 |	So
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,568	| IOT107 |	If anyone has any ideas
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:19,360	| IOT107 |	Gilfre Richard
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:22,176	| IOT107 |	Yeah I mean something
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:23,712	| IOT107 |	That I would try is
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:28,832	| IOT107 |	To set them up temporarily so that they're all in the same room
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:30,368	| IOT107 |	And then see if
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:36,256	| IOT107 |	Your Google home is able to control them if you tell it to turn all the lights on in that room
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,584	| IOT107 |	Okay I'm going to do it
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,608	| IOT107 |	And that actually brings me
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:42,144	| IOT107 |	To another thing
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:43,168	| IOT107 |	The frustrated me about
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:43,936	| IOT107 |	Google home
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:45,728	| IOT107 |	When you put it in like lights and stuff
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:48,032	| IOT107 |	It asks you what room you want them
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:51,104	| IOT107 |	And so I put it in the appropriate room
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:51,872	| IOT107 |	Psychiatry
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:54,432	| IOT107 |	My various my for living room lights are all in the living
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:55,712	| IOT107 |	But
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,992	| IOT107 |	I want to be able to say
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:59,808	| IOT107 |	Haji turn off downstairs
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:00,832	| IOT107 |	It right now
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:01,600	| IOT107 |	I can't actually
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,392	| IOT107 |	I can't group the grouping
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:05,184	| IOT107 |	Into another group
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:05,952	| IOT107 |	So
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:07,488	| IOT107 |	In the Echo you can actually
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:09,536	| IOT107 |	Sayo I want to create a living room
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:10,816	| IOT107 |	Setting
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:12,608	| IOT107 |	And then I want to also keep
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:15,424	| IOT107 |	These lights in also it downstairs setting
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:17,984	| IOT107 |	And you can do that but in Google home you can't have
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:19,008	| IOT107 |	One device at 2
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:19,520	| IOT107 |	Rims
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:21,312	| IOT107 |	Yeah that's
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:25,408	| IOT107 |	Seems like it's something that they're going to have to fix it was funny
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:28,224	| IOT107 |	The echo gives you the ability to
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:30,528	| IOT107 |	Group things anyway you want to
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:34,368	| IOT107 |	But doesn't have the ability to know
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:36,160	| IOT107 |	What room anything is in
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:38,464	| IOT107 |	And then Google home
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:43,072	| IOT107 |	Knows what room things are in but doesn't give you any other group incapability
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:45,376	| IOT107 |	Is there must be a happy medium somewhere
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:47,424	| IOT107 |	There will be I have total faith
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:48,704	| IOT107 |	So
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:50,496	| IOT107 |	My verdict so far is
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:53,568	| IOT107 |	Is the Google home can't live on its own right now downstairs
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:55,360	| IOT107 |	And it's awesome
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:57,664	| IOT107 |	For talking to for asking
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:58,432	| IOT107 |	Questions of
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:27:00,736	| IOT107 |	But it's still not quite there in the
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:06,112	| IOT107 |	This is terrible so Kevin was out sick today
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:08,416	| IOT107 |	I'm trying to convince Kevin that he needs a Google home
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:11,744	| IOT107 |	And he's not sold yet so I don't think this is going to make him
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:12,512	| IOT107 |	Rush out and buy one
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:16,096	| IOT107 |	Maybe not
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:17,888	| IOT107 |	So you have an integration
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:19,680	| IOT107 |	And it's actually a really good one
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:21,728	| IOT107 |	It's over not integration and installation
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:28,384	| IOT107 |	I'm really excited about this so I have been looking for a way to automate blinds
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:31,200	| IOT107 |	Blinds throughout the house
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:31,712	| IOT107 |	And
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:33,504	| IOT107 |	I have a Southern Exposure
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:34,784	| IOT107 |	4
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:36,320	| IOT107 |	Part of the home and
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:38,624	| IOT107 |	So I get quite a bit of
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:39,136	| IOT107 |	Sunlight
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:41,440	| IOT107 |	And I want to be able to block that out at
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,720	| IOT107 |	Times of the day
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:44,000	| IOT107 |	So
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:46,816	| IOT107 |	Most of the products that are out there are there
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:47,584	| IOT107 |	Very pricey
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:48,608	| IOT107 |	Or
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:49,632	| IOT107 |	Still
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,448	| IOT107 |	Crowdfunding
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:58,336	| IOT107 |	And when I was at CES I ran across this company called mysmartblinds
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:01,152	| IOT107 |	And mysmartblinds creates
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:02,944	| IOT107 |	A $99
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:07,808	| IOT107 |	That you can install in nearly any
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:09,344	| IOT107 |	2 in or
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:11,136	| IOT107 |	Wider blinds
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:11,904	| IOT107 |	Installation
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:13,952	| IOT107 |	In the top rail
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:20,352	| IOT107 |	And it comes with a bunch of adapters to fit it to different manufacturers in mine wasn't one of the listed manufacturers but it were
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:20,864	| IOT107 |	Worked anyway
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:24,960	| IOT107 |	Too much
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:25,472	| IOT107 |	Weider
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:28,544	| IOT107 |	Is that right blind slats or is that the headspace
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:31,872	| IOT107 |	Yeah that's the blind slat so if you buy a
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,408	| IOT107 |	2 inch blind that's a pretty
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:35,968	| IOT107 |	Typical wooden blind nowadays
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:38,528	| IOT107 |	It's not going to work with mini blinds
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:42,368	| IOT107 |	So if you have something that's like really really thin
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:48,768	| IOT107 |	But with the wider wood blinds or wider vinyl blinds metal blinds it'll work with those
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:50,048	| IOT107 |	And
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:52,352	| IOT107 |	You just installed at the top
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:53,120	| IOT107 |	Rail
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,656	| IOT107 |	Comes charged but
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:57,984	| IOT107 |	You could charge it again through USB if you wanted to
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:02,080	| IOT107 |	Charger supposed to last for a proxy
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:02,592	| IOT107 |	Smitley
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:06,176	| IOT107 |	Six months to a year I think they said so will
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:07,200	| IOT107 |	See how that goes
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:09,504	| IOT107 |	And all it does is eclipse blind
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:11,552	| IOT107 |	It's not trying to raise or lower
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:14,368	| IOT107 |	It's just flipping the blinds either open or closed
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:15,136	| IOT107 |	In
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:15,904	| IOT107 |	Quarter
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:16,416	| IOT107 |	Anchorman
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:21,536	| IOT107 |	Not all the way from clothes to open but close to Parkway open and then open
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:22,304	| IOT107 |	And then
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:24,352	| IOT107 |	Parkway open and then closed again the other way
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:31,520	| IOT107 |	And I am really impressed it took less than maybe 20-25 minutes to install the Kit
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,824	| IOT107 |	Chainsaw the blind
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:35,360	| IOT107 |	Hooked it up to the app
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,640	| IOT107 |	It works through Bluetooth
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:39,200	| IOT107 |	It works on
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,480	| IOT107 |	IOS
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:41,760	| IOT107 |	An Android
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:44,320	| IOT107 |	And having hooked to Bluetooth
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:45,088	| IOT107 |	On
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,112	| IOT107 |	One device
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:50,208	| IOT107 |	All my other devices were able to know and control it
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:51,232	| IOT107 |	So there is some
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:53,536	| IOT107 |	Cloud stuff going on there to make all that work
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:57,120	| IOT107 |	The only thing that I have a problem with
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:57,632	| IOT107 |	Right now
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:59,936	| IOT107 |	Is the because it's Bluetooth
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:01,216	| IOT107 |	The range is kind of limited
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:04,288	| IOT107 |	That's my beef against Bluetooth lights
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:08,640	| IOT107 |	I like I want to go downstairs and turn off the light
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,968	| IOT107 |	Junction is a smaller house
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:14,016	| IOT107 |	Yeah that
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:16,832	| IOT107 |	Yeah yeah well
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:17,600	| IOT107 |	Someday
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:18,624	| IOT107 |	Someday
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:20,672	| IOT107 |	Maybe we'll actually get Bluetooth
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:21,952	| IOT107 |	Toothbrush for reals
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:22,976	| IOT107 |	In the meantime
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,512	| IOT107 |	What you can do
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,792	| IOT107 |	Is you can set schedules
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:29,120	| IOT107 |	And it is also aware of where the sun would be
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:32,448	| IOT107 |	Where you're located at different times of the day
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,472	| IOT107 |	So you can
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:35,776	| IOT107 |	Basically say at a certain time of day but
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:39,360	| IOT107 |	Dependent based on what time of year it is and where I am
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:42,432	| IOT107 |	Then close the blinds and those schedules
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:44,224	| IOT107 |	Live locally on the device
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:49,600	| IOT107 |	So it will still work on its own without any sort of controller nearby which is a great thing
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:52,416	| IOT107 |	They also sell a
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:53,696	| IOT107 |	Just a little
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:55,744	| IOT107 |	Remote that is Bluetooth and
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:59,072	| IOT107 |	You can install that just like you would install a light switch
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:30:59,840	| IOT107 |	They have
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:01,632	| IOT107 |	Solar charger
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:04,448	| IOT107 |	That you can install on the outside if you want to use that
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:06,496	| IOT107 |	I am really impressed
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:07,264	| IOT107 |	With
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:09,568	| IOT107 |	This kit how easy it is to use
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:10,592	| IOT107 |	And
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:14,944	| IOT107 |	I don't understand why I can't buy this in every single Lowe's
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:16,736	| IOT107 |	And Home Depot around
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:18,528	| IOT107 |	But you can get it on Amazon
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:22,112	| IOT107 |	Awesome and it's $99 in actually how wide
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,416	| IOT107 |	How does it deal with the with the
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:24,928	| IOT107 |	The Blind Side
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:27,232	| IOT107 |	It's just a thing you stick on the slats right
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:29,280	| IOT107 |	It's not like I'm 12
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:35,424	| IOT107 |	I mean if you stick it in the top rail you're basically putting this mechanism in the top rail
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:36,704	| IOT107 |	2
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:41,056	| IOT107 |	Turn the little mechanism inside that top rail
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:42,080	| IOT107 |	The adjuster
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:43,360	| IOT107 |	The
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,128	| IOT107 |	Slat angle
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:46,432	| IOT107 |	So you don't see this at all
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:47,968	| IOT107 |	End
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:49,248	| IOT107 |	The wave that
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:50,016	| IOT107 |	It works
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:50,528	| IOT107 |	Is
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:52,064	| IOT107 |	Then by
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:54,112	| IOT107 |	Turning the crank inside
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:55,392	| IOT107 |	Then
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:32:02,304	| IOT107 |	Your blinds turn and it doesn't matter if you have 2 inch blinds or if you have 4 inch blinds if there is such a thing
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:04,096	| IOT107 |	Lake Ozark banks
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:08,704	| IOT107 |	Awesome
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:09,472	| IOT107 |	Well this is a good

EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:38,560	| IOT107 |	Creating the
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:41,888	| IOT107 |	Which is a big statement it's like inventing the internet
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:43,424	| IOT107 |	What did you really do
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:45,216	| IOT107 |	Well
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:47,776	| IOT107 |	1998
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:50,592	| IOT107 |	I was an assistant brand manager
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:52,128	| IOT107 |	Procter & Gamble with and
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:54,176	| IOT107 |	I just launched
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:55,712	| IOT107 |	The new range
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:58,016	| IOT107 |	Charles Kylie Cosmetics on makeup
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:02,624	| IOT107 |	This was this was kind of my suspect product launch in my career and ice packs
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:05,184	| IOT107 |	I defecate frustrated when I went
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:08,768	| IOT107 |	My local grocery store to get my weekly groceries
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:09,536	| IOT107 |	And
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:10,560	| IOT107 |	Noticed
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,864	| IOT107 |	My most popular products with no.

EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:15,680	| IOT107 |	You hear a lot of fantasy
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:17,472	| IOT107 |	He talked about marketing
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:20,800	| IOT107 |	The most basic thing is if people can't buy your product
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:21,824	| IOT107 |	It's about trying to sell
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:23,616	| IOT107 |	I started a
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:31,040	| IOT107 |	It was
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:32,832	| IOT107 |	You're horribly out of stock
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:37,440	| IOT107 |	Protect me the most was
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:38,976	| IOT107 |	People this was in
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:40,768	| IOT107 |	Did you say 1996 or 99
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:42,304	| IOT107 |	898
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:47,936	| IOT107 |	So this was in 1998 and so people understand this is before smartphones
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:49,216	| IOT107 |	Etnyre
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:49,984	| IOT107 |	Pause Spotify
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:51,264	| IOT107 |	Yes
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:57,408	| IOT107 |	It's funny for those of us who are old enough to remember what life was like in 1998 it's kind of funny it's almost like
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:34:59,712	| IOT107 |	Black and white world
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:08,160	| IOT107 |	End of 1994 beginning of 1995 and
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:10,464	| IOT107 |	Most people have not heard of it until then
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:12,512	| IOT107 |	Yes I was still using a dial-up modem
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:14,816	| IOT107 |	And I have got my first
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:15,328	| IOT107 |	Email address
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:20,960	| IOT107 |	The way you access the internet
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:26,848	| IOT107 |	Computer
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:27,616	| IOT107 |	Dakota motor
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:31,968	| IOT107 |	But you're plugging joke
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:38,112	| IOT107 |	Computer plug that box into your phone line which are the required a splitter on the phone line
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:40,416	| IOT107 |	On your phone line
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:43,488	| IOT107 |	Your phone line was that busy to everybody else
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:47,584	| IOT107 |	If you had cool waiting you had a problem because the cool waiting
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:49,376	| IOT107 |	Guitar with mess up your internet connection
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:53,216	| IOT107 |	You would get online and what could you do online
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:54,752	| IOT107 |	A lot of what you could do was
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:58,336	| IOT107 |	Bulletin board

EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:06,784	| IOT107 |	Really want the internet
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:08,576	| IOT107 |	Like in the
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:10,368	| IOT107 |	Mid-to-late 1990s
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:12,160	| IOT107 |	Say yes with that context
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:13,952	| IOT107 |	That is actually relevant
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:17,536	| IOT107 |	Because the other Solutions this out-of-stock problem turned out
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,560	| IOT107 |	2B information
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:21,376	| IOT107 |	The really big thing but I should have discovered
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:22,912	| IOT107 |	That was not the only person
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:24,960	| IOT107 |	Was that
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:27,264	| IOT107 |	Are computers needed to start Gathering date
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:32,384	| IOT107 |	Is that all the information
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:36,480	| IOT107 |	It was human and two data are ugly
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:39,296	| IOT107 |	Until really I mean I guess
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:42,368	| IOT107 |	Nike rally 1990
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:44,160	| IOT107 |	You started to see the beginning of
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:46,976	| IOT107 |	Automatic data capture
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:49,024	| IOT107 |	The UPC barcode
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:51,328	| IOT107 |	Is the most visible example
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:54,144	| IOT107 |	Of a technology that was trying to
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:55,936	| IOT107 |	Start
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:56,704	| IOT107 |	Tonight
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:58,240	| IOT107 |	How date was entered into
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,008	| IOT107 |	Chicken Tortas
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:01,568	| IOT107 |	It's interesting to Crothers because
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:06,432	| IOT107 |	For a lot of people who use computers in the 20th century so that we people who
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:08,992	| IOT107 |	Probably in the forties or older
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:12,832	| IOT107 |	Now the idea of human in today Taurus is so
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:14,624	| IOT107 |	So much the natural paradigm
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:15,904	| IOT107 |	Computing
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:16,928	| IOT107 |	But it doesn't seem
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:18,208	| IOT107 |	Orange
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:20,000	| IOT107 |	Not sure if you were born in 20
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:21,280	| IOT107 |	First century
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:24,096	| IOT107 |	You're very very used to your computer gathering at 7 a.m.
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:24,864	| IOT107 |	Pencilmation
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:26,656	| IOT107 |	But the one I realized was looking
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:27,936	| IOT107 |	Out-of-stock problem
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:29,984	| IOT107 |	Was caused by the fact that
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:31,008	| IOT107 |	Stores
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:33,056	| IOT107 |	Had moved to more
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:35,104	| IOT107 |	Computerized Information Systems
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:39,712	| IOT107 |	Fidelity information they had was being hinted at the checkout counter and in a few
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:43,296	| IOT107 |	Stop code scanner in the warehouse a few other places and not men
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:48,928	| IOT107 |	Very detailed real-time like is a particular color of a particular lipstick
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:51,488	| IOT107 |	On the Shelf in a particular store
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:52,512	| IOT107 |	Was
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:58,656	| IOT107 |	Riddled with inaccuracies and errors to the point where it was kind of useless
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:01,472	| IOT107 |	The stores had sort of a big picture of you
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:04,288	| IOT107 |	But at that the grill detailed level
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:06,080	| IOT107 |	But she went into Data was
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:09,408	| IOT107 |	Was too limited to really be precise about what was happening
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:12,480	| IOT107 |	In a retail supply chain and then it turned out
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:17,344	| IOT107 |	Zygote into this mall through instead of 1998-1999
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:18,624	| IOT107 |	Any office supply chain
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:21,696	| IOT107 |	The way you live in this world a physical thing
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:27,584	| IOT107 |	Everybody was very enamored with what was called the information revolution in the 1990s
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:31,168	| IOT107 |	The information we really needed was about these these physical
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:37,056	| IOT107 |	Cata how can you order tonight
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:40,896	| IOT107 |	The capture of dates were about stoplight
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:44,224	| IOT107 |	Little lipsticks on shelves so I need any other thing in the world
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:46,016	| IOT107 |	At that time there was
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:49,856	| IOT107 |	Emerging technology called RFID radio-frequency
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:51,136	| IOT107 |	Z Nation
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:52,416	| IOT107 |	It started to look too
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:52,928	| IOT107 |	Tumi light
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:56,256	| IOT107 |	This Mason RFID technology
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:39:00,352	| IOT107 |	Could potentially be embedded and sings like lipstick Packaging
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:02,144	| IOT107 |	As a way to know what the
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:03,168	| IOT107 |	Shell
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:05,984	| IOT107 |	But the other piece of artwork
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:07,776	| IOT107 |	Which was
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:09,312	| IOT107 |	Kind of a berry
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:11,360	| IOT107 |	Niche technology in
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:14,176	| IOT107 |	In the 1990s and the reason was
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:16,736	| IOT107 |	It was much more useful
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:19,552	| IOT107 |	If you could connect it to the network
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:24,928	| IOT107 |	Because now I'm the the lipstick is on the shell to keep it. Example
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:27,744	| IOT107 |	Meticulous
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:31,328	| IOT107 |	If that date was being shed on Broadway
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:32,864	| IOT107 |	And so
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:33,888	| IOT107 |	The emergency
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:37,984	| IOT107 |	Public internet at about the same time as the beginning
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:40,288	| IOT107 |	Specialization of RFID
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:41,312	| IOT107 |	Was I buried
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:45,408	| IOT107 |	Technology-wise because what we've LED Subs
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:50,016	| IOT107 |	What was
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:55,392	| IOT107 |	But not in great detail inside 1999
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:57,696	| IOT107 |	Was it connecting sensors
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:39:59,488	| IOT107 |	Like RFID tags
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:01,280	| IOT107 |	To the internet
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:03,328	| IOT107 |	Gooseberry powder
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:04,608	| IOT107 |	Because suddenly
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:10,240	| IOT107 |	Gather information automatically in one place and know it in real time and some other place so you can
EDL	00:40:10,240	00:40:13,568	| IOT107 |	You can gather information all over the place and not real time in one place
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:16,896	| IOT107 |	This idea of connecting
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:18,432	| IOT107 |	Consensus to the internet
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:19,712	| IOT107 |	Soda
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:21,248	| IOT107 |	Machines to gather their own
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:21,760	| IOT107 |	Information
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:23,040	| IOT107 |	Was
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:25,856	| IOT107 |	A really revolutionary paradigm
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:26,624	| IOT107 |	Time shifting computer
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:32,512	| IOT107 |	The only person he was thinking that way
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:35,584	| IOT107 |	But I do remember it was very hard
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:36,352	| IOT107 |	Define other
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:37,120	| IOT107 |	The people
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,144	| IOT107 |	It was thinking that way
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:41,728	| IOT107 |	I say we get to 1999 and I have
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:45,312	| IOT107 |	Crystallize this concept in my mind
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:50,176	| IOT107 |	That Proctor needs to lead a kind of a worldwide effort
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:54,272	| IOT107 |	Initially chips but then all the senses
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:55,552	| IOT107 |	Insane
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:57,088	| IOT107 |	Unconnect
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:58,112	| IOT107 |	To the internet
EDL	00:40:58,624	00:40:59,904	| IOT107 |	So we can have this
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:04,000	| IOT107 |	Incredible new visibility into what's going on in the world
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:09,632	| IOT107 |	Senior manager
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:12,192	| IOT107 |	Instead of 5 minutes or less
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:12,704	| IOT107 |	Icicle
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:14,496	| IOT107 |	Because
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:16,288	| IOT107 |	You know you had people who were very busy
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:18,848	| IOT107 |	Who didn't know if this is going to be interesting to them
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:21,408	| IOT107 |	Most importantly
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:22,432	| IOT107 |	Wooden on techno
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:25,248	| IOT107 |	Release for guys who
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:26,784	| IOT107 |	How to started
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:30,368	| IOT107 |	Working at a time when Company still had things like typing pools
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:32,160	| IOT107 |	So I guess my thought is
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:34,464	| IOT107 |	Because this is
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:39,584	| IOT107 |	Focused on things that the P&G guys while the technology is difficult
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:42,144	| IOT107 |	It's probably much more accessible to be like
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:46,496	| IOT107 |	Hey you could track all your things as opposed to you could put
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:49,568	| IOT107 |	Stuff on this magical place called the World Wide Web
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:50,848	| IOT107 |	It feels easier
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:52,895	| IOT107 |	That's that's why I said
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:54,687	| IOT107 |	This is happening
EDL	00:41:54,687	00:41:56,991	| IOT107 |	I mean in 1998
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:42:00,575	| IOT107 |	John Chambers who was the CEO of Cisco
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:06,975	| IOT107 |	Chambers guide run around all the CEOs in 100 CEOs with
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:08,767	| IOT107 |	PowerPoint presentation
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:11,583	| IOT107 |	Explaining to them what the internet
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:13,887	| IOT107 |	What was and how important it was that
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:16,191	| IOT107 |	It was kind of internet or. I was kind of
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:16,959	| IOT107 |	Raised right
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:21,567	| IOT107 |	50 60 something year old white guys
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:23,359	| IOT107 |	Who
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:29,503	| IOT107 |	I've been told in a very compelling way
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:31,807	| IOT107 |	If I needed to get on board with the internet
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:33,855	| IOT107 |	So the way to get
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:37,183	| IOT107 |	Attention
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:41,023	| IOT107 |	Was to find a way to join the wood Internet to the wood thing
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:41,791	| IOT107 |	Bicycle
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:46,911	| IOT107 |	To describe this idea of network connect connected
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:49,471	| IOT107 |	And so the PowerPoint presentation
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:55,103	| IOT107 |	At least through the company with this PowerPoint presentation
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:58,175	| IOT107 |	I had to coat something like small packages
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:43:01,503	| IOT107 |	Just kind of a horrible dead-on-arrival kind of name really
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:04,319	| IOT107 |	To really grab the attention of these people who
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:07,391	| IOT107 |	Newton's net worth important wunschel what it was
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:08,159	| IOT107 |	Answered
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:08,671	| IOT107 |	Tubidy
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:13,279	| IOT107 |	Make my idea pitch my idea was an internet strategy
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:16,351	| IOT107 |	RN about I think it was probably about April 9th
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:19,423	| IOT107 |	99 change the presentation
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:24,031	| IOT107 |	And I knew I wanted to use the word internet and I do I want to see use the word things
EDL	00:43:24,031	00:43:28,895	| IOT107 |	So I wanted to get them both in the same type of the PowerPoint presentation and there was no
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:33,247	| IOT107 |	Easy way to do that so I came up with this this phrase into that all stings
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:37,855	| IOT107 |	As far as I'm aware nobody'd ever
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:40,671	| IOT107 |	At least not loudly and publicly
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:42,975	| IOT107 |	Out of Internet all's anything
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:44,767	| IOT107 |	If all right there was just the internet
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:48,607	| IOT107 |	Preposition that went with internet
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:52,191	| IOT107 |	I'm here looking back I probably should have called it like the internet for things
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:52,703	| IOT107 |	Saw something
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:57,823	| IOT107 |	But whatever reason internet all stadiums had some kind of ring to it
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:59,359	| IOT107 |	So that was a typo.
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:04,991	| IOT107 |	Impatient and earned me to MIT to make it real at some point
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:05,759	| IOT107 |	During the
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:07,295	| IOT107 |	Sodalite to mm
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:09,087	| IOT107 |	It became a common
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:11,647	| IOT107 |	Common phrase people used
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:12,927	| IOT107 |	So let me ask you
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:14,975	| IOT107 |	Now that we are in 2017
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:21,119	| IOT107 |	And I feel like the Resurgence in The Internet of Things has been around for
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:22,655	| IOT107 |	11 2010
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:25,983	| IOT107 |	Where we started seeing a cheap sensors
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:26,751	| IOT107 |	Data everywhere
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:30,335	| IOT107 |	WeChat cloud computing which made a big deal
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:33,663	| IOT107 |	And so where it where do you think we are today
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:35,967	| IOT107 |	You thought we would be or did you think we'd get here
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:36,735	| IOT107 |	Here faster
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:41,855	| IOT107 |	If you'd have asked me in like 1999 or 2002 predict 2017 I would have been
EDL	00:44:42,367	00:44:43,647	| IOT107 |	Wrong about most things
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:47,487	| IOT107 |	I think I was
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:49,023	| IOT107 |	Network sensing
EDL	00:44:49,023	00:44:52,095	| IOT107 |	An automatic data capture was going to be a huge thing
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:53,631	| IOT107 |	Look at me trying
EDL	00:44:53,631	00:45:00,031	| IOT107 |	Inspirational I'll give you some examples in a minute
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:01,311	| IOT107 |	RFID tags with B
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:02,335	| IOT107 |	Would be everywhere at right now
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:04,639	| IOT107 |	And it's interesting why that no
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:05,407	| IOT107 |	By the way
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:06,943	| IOT107 |	And some of its structural
EDL	00:45:06,943	00:45:07,711	| IOT107 |	It's like
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:14,111	| IOT107 |	Gives you his day to you you haven't got because you haven't got that you don't necessarily know you know
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:14,623	| IOT107 |	Need it
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:16,415	| IOT107 |	So I could be buried
EDL	00:45:16,415	00:45:18,975	| IOT107 |	Nicole is still kind of
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:23,327	| IOT107 |	Working our way through the 20th century generation of senior managers
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:24,351	| IOT107 |	These are people who
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:27,679	| IOT107 |	Grasping the idea of
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:28,447	| IOT107 |	Networks and
EDL	00:45:29,471	00:45:30,239	| IOT107 |	Intuitively
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:33,055	| IOT107 |	There's some kind of
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:33,823	| IOT107 |	Fort imagination
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:36,383	| IOT107 |	Has better see the value of something like
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:40,479	| IOT107 |	They got to know where your stuff is all the time through a technology like RFID
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:42,527	| IOT107 |	Add another thing this happened
EDL	00:45:42,527	00:45:44,575	| IOT107 |	Pacification I mean one of the assumptions I made
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:46,879	| IOT107 |	Through my whole time at MIT
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:53,023	| IOT107 |	Was it you needed something like RFID because something like Vision Machine Vision
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:54,303	| IOT107 |	Was never going to be good enough
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:45:56,351	| IOT107 |	I'm actually happy
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:45:57,631	| IOT107 |	Softer
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:46:00,703	| IOT107 |	1952 about 2000
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:02,495	| IOT107 |	Machine Vision was horrible
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:04,799	| IOT107 |	I was a really struggling field
EDL	00:46:04,799	00:46:05,567	| IOT107 |	And then
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:07,103	| IOT107 |	Episode of 2000
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:09,151	| IOT107 |	2010 it suddenly
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:10,687	| IOT107 |	Became very sophisticated
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:15,295	| IOT107 |	And the reason why is interesting from the internal things perspective by the way
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:17,599	| IOT107 |	But she got good suddenly
EDL	00:46:17,599	00:46:19,391	| IOT107 |	Because of network sensing
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:22,207	| IOT107 |	So digital cameras all senses
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:25,535	| IOT107 |	And then uploading pictures to the internet is kind of
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:27,839	| IOT107 |	Caprice of network products.
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:29,119	| IOT107 |	I want happen
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:29,631	| IOT107 |	Was
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:31,423	| IOT107 |	The dataset
EDL	00:46:31,935	00:46:34,751	| IOT107 |	That computer scientist had available to them
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:37,055	| IOT107 |	Algorithms
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:40,383	| IOT107 |	Dinner went from a few pictures to a few
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:41,919	| IOT107 |	100 million pictures
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:42,943	| IOT107 |	In a few years
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:46,527	| IOT107 |	See I credited two gpus in
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:49,343	| IOT107 |	Having more compute but you're right the training data
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:55,487	| IOT107 |	A big deal
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:57,279	| IOT107 |	Write machine learning
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:58,303	| IOT107 |	Is
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:46:58,815	| IOT107 |	Patton Wrecker
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:00,351	| IOT107 |	Basically
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:03,679	| IOT107 |	You have a hypothesis about Wattpad
EDL	00:47:03,679	00:47:07,263	| IOT107 |	She might want to recognize to Beartooth for example identify a face
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:10,335	| IOT107 |	Hypothesis
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:11,103	| IOT107 |	Some mathematics
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:13,919	| IOT107 |	But you need to run
EDL	00:47:14,431	00:47:20,575	| IOT107 |	Thousands or Millions
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:25,951	| IOT107 |	But also your algorithm
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:26,719	| IOT107 |	How can I prove itself
EDL	00:47:27,231	00:47:29,791	| IOT107 |	Ride it can start to look for
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:31,071	| IOT107 |	What oldies station
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:34,143	| IOT107 |	The same face what do they have in common
EDL	00:47:34,655	00:47:37,215	| IOT107 |	I'm one of the ones that I sold what I say
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:39,263	| IOT107 |	Butt off my face what do they have
EDL	00:47:39,775	00:47:40,543	| IOT107 |	What don't they have
EDL	00:47:41,567	00:47:47,967	| IOT107 |	So
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:48,735	| IOT107 |	Burger
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:50,271	| IOT107 |	Unimportant
EDL	00:47:51,295	00:47:51,807	| IOT107 |	Is generally
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:55,135	| IOT107 |	Didn't happen until about
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:57,183	| IOT107 |	2000-2001 is Seroquel
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:48:03,071	| IOT107 |	A lot of things we do today without thinking about it like GPS and
EDL	00:48:03,583	00:48:05,375	| IOT107 |	Smartphones in your pocket
EDL	00:48:05,375	00:48:06,399	| IOT107 |	High definition
EDL	00:48:06,399	00:48:09,983	| IOT107 |	Digital cameras in your pocket and you know broadband
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:12,031	| IOT107 |	Downloading hi-def movies and things
EDL	00:48:12,543	00:48:13,311	| IOT107 |	All those things
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:14,847	| IOT107 |	Pretty much
EDL	00:48:15,359	00:48:17,151	| IOT107 |	Declared to be impossible
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:19,455	| IOT107 |	The early 2000
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:20,991	| IOT107 |	That was some
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:21,759	| IOT107 |	Supposed to be
EDL	00:48:22,783	00:48:26,623	| IOT107 |	These physical limits or technological limits of man
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:28,927	| IOT107 |	It would never be possible to
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:30,975	| IOT107 |	To scream high definition
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:31,999	| IOT107 |	Movie into Ohio
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:36,863	| IOT107 |	Peter have a GPS sensor that work indoors in your pocket
EDL	00:48:36,863	00:48:40,447	| IOT107 |	It was supposed to be all these reasons why those things wouldn't work
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:41,727	| IOT107 |	Elderberry important
EDL	00:48:41,727	00:48:46,591	| IOT107 |	Technology invented in the two in the early 2000s the transformed
EDL	00:48:46,591	00:48:47,871	| IOT107 |	You could do with radio
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:48,895	| IOT107 |	Radio sensing
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:54,015	| IOT107 |	Which lead us to where we are today
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:56,575	| IOT107 |	Any type of things which is like you
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:48:57,343	| IOT107 |	Does GPS
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:48:58,623	| IOT107 |	So
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:49:00,671	| IOT107 |	There's a whole bunch of star
EDL	00:49:00,671	00:49:03,487	| IOT107 |	And the GPS space in the digital photography space
EDL	00:49:03,999	00:49:06,047	| IOT107 |	Health sensing from your phone
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:07,839	| IOT107 |	A lot of things that were
EDL	00:49:07,839	00:49:08,607	| IOT107 |	Maybe
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:12,191	| IOT107 |	Should have creamed off by a few wild-eyed dreamers like
EDL	00:49:12,191	00:49:13,215	| IOT107 |	Met-Ed
EDL	00:49:13,215	00:49:15,263	| IOT107 |	Late 90s early 2000
EDL	00:49:15,263	00:49:20,127	| IOT107 |	But we were told we were crazy and frankly we weren't being crazy enough
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:20,895	| IOT107 |	That is awesome.
EDL	00:49:22,175	00:49:24,223	| IOT107 |	There's stuff that you like
EDL	00:49:24,223	00:49:25,247	| IOT107 |	And then it doesn't
EDL	00:49:26,271	00:49:27,295	| IOT107 |	It happens way later than
EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:29,343	| IOT107 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:30,623	| IOT107 |	It's awesome
EDL	00:49:30,623	00:49:31,391	| IOT107 |	That's why I love it
EDL	00:49:31,903	00:49:35,743	| IOT107 |	So let me ask you because I know you said you were working on a new book
EDL	00:49:36,255	00:49:39,839	| IOT107 |	And you also told me that you are inherently an optimist
EDL	00:49:39,839	00:49:43,679	| IOT107 |	Look at the internet
EDL	00:49:43,679	00:49:45,983	| IOT107 |	As a tool that can be used for great evil
EDL	00:49:45,983	00:49:46,751	| IOT107 |	Is he all kinds of
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:49,055	| IOT107 |	Set a bad but I can also see like
EDL	00:49:49,055	00:49:55,199	| IOT107 |	I talked to a company that it's a power company that once they connected their infrastructure they were able to turn off
EDL	00:49:55,199	00:50:00,319	| IOT107 |	The lights at beaches when sea turtles were nesting in so sea turtles are actually now
EDL	00:50:00,319	00:50:06,719	| IOT107 |	They just have to dispatch Crews to actually physically turn off these lights
EDL	00:50:06,719	00:50:10,303	| IOT107 |	Four seater sea turtles can come up to nest on the dark Beach and it's very sad
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:14,399	| IOT107 |	I look at that and I'm like holy cow
EDL	00:50:14,911	00:50:15,679	| IOT107 |	Cool things
EDL	00:50:15,679	00:50:17,983	| IOT107 |	So you can do with this so what does the future hold
EDL	00:50:17,983	00:50:19,263	| IOT107 |	Oh
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:21,823	| IOT107 |	Spiffy wonderful
EDL	00:50:21,823	00:50:25,151	| IOT107 |	42 optimistic because history teaches us to be open
EDL	00:50:25,151	00:50:25,919	| IOT107 |	Domestic
EDL	00:50:25,919	00:50:29,759	| IOT107 |	My lost book how to fly a horse was very much about
EDL	00:50:29,759	00:50:31,551	| IOT107 |	The human creative spirit
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:35,391	| IOT107 |	But I think one of the things we we can mess because it's
EDL	00:50:35,391	00:50:36,927	| IOT107 |	Everywhere is
EDL	00:50:37,439	00:50:41,023	| IOT107 |	Another thing that's unique about human being as a species
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:43,583	| IOT107 |	Is we all have an innate drive to create
EDL	00:50:44,095	00:50:45,631	| IOT107 |	Not everybody is going to
EDL	00:50:47,167	00:50:47,935	| IOT107 |	5th Symphony
EDL	00:50:49,471	00:50:51,775	| IOT107 |	We all have an innate drive to create two
EDL	00:50:51,775	00:50:54,335	| IOT107 |	Improve things to make things better so
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:56,639	| IOT107 |	What we do is a species
EDL	00:50:56,639	00:50:57,407	| IOT107 |	Is
EDL	00:50:57,919	00:50:59,455	| IOT107 |	Approve also
EDL	00:50:59,455	00:51:02,527	| IOT107 |	Improving on technology and we've done that forever
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:05,599	| IOT107 |	Anat has led us to a place where
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:06,367	| IOT107 |	In
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:07,647	| IOT107 |	1800
EDL	00:51:08,159	00:51:10,463	| IOT107 |	People were worried about growing population
EDL	00:51:10,463	00:51:11,231	| IOT107 |	Because
EDL	00:51:11,231	00:51:14,815	| IOT107 |	The world's population of China just about reached 1 billion
EDL	00:51:16,607	00:51:17,887	| IOT107 |	But today at 7
EDL	00:51:18,655	00:51:19,935	| IOT107 |	An 1800
EDL	00:51:20,447	00:51:21,983	| IOT107 |	Average life expectancy
EDL	00:51:21,983	00:51:24,287	| IOT107 |	See probably was about 38
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:26,079	| IOT107 |	And today it's about
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:27,359	| IOT107 |	75
EDL	00:51:28,383	00:51:29,151	| IOT107 |	So
EDL	00:51:29,151	00:51:30,687	| IOT107 |	We know only
EDL	00:51:30,687	00:51:32,223	| IOT107 |	We have been able to sustain a large
EDL	00:51:33,503	00:51:36,831	| IOT107 |	Most of those people live longer Fuller happy alives
EDL	00:51:37,343	00:51:39,135	| IOT107 |	What's changed
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:41,951	| IOT107 |	Strangest we continually improve. Technology
EDL	00:51:42,463	00:51:43,743	| IOT107 |	So when you look at what's happening
EDL	00:51:43,743	00:51:44,511	| IOT107 |	Now
EDL	00:51:45,023	00:51:49,119	| IOT107 |	You see some exciting things going on in
EDL	00:51:49,119	00:51:51,679	| IOT107 |	And Technologies
EDL	00:51:52,191	00:51:53,727	| IOT107 |	Space traveling

EDL	00:51:55,007	00:51:56,031	| IOT107 |	Things like self driving
EDL	00:51:57,055	00:52:00,127	| IOT107 |	The things that are happening in microbiology to improve
EDL	00:52:00,127	00:52:00,639	| IOT107 |	Angel
EDL	00:52:01,151	00:52:02,431	| IOT107 |	Revention smartphone
EDL	00:52:02,431	00:52:03,967	| IOT107 |	Earlier
EDL	00:52:04,479	00:52:05,503	| IOT107 |	Amazing
EDL	00:52:06,015	00:52:09,087	| IOT107 |	Rarely told stories about smartphone
EDL	00:52:09,087	00:52:10,623	| IOT107 |	Cell phones is
EDL	00:52:10,623	00:52:14,719	| IOT107 |	We're taking us from a wild wear in mm
EDL	00:52:14,719	00:52:16,767	| IOT107 |	About 1 billion people
EDL	00:52:16,767	00:52:18,559	| IOT107 |	Had access to a telephone
EDL	00:52:19,071	00:52:21,375	| IOT107 |	So that was probably about 20%
EDL	00:52:22,911	00:52:27,007	| IOT107 |	Today that are more phones Than People 120%
EDL	00:52:27,519	00:52:29,823	| IOT107 |	Population has access to a phone
EDL	00:52:29,823	00:52:30,847	| IOT107 |	Bats
EDL	00:52:30,847	00:52:32,383	| IOT107 |	Powerful change
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:34,943	| IOT107 |	Does happen because of Technology
EDL	00:52:35,455	00:52:37,247	| IOT107 |	And it means that
EDL	00:52:37,247	00:52:40,831	| IOT107 |	You know some people can't talk to their mom or whatever
EDL	00:52:40,831	00:52:42,879	| IOT107 |	But they can access information
EDL	00:52:42,879	00:52:44,671	| IOT107 |	In places where they can attract
EDL	00:52:44,671	00:52:45,439	| IOT107 |	Consummation
EDL	00:52:45,439	00:52:50,303	| IOT107 |	So what hola amounts to is you know whatever challenges we see
EDL	00:52:50,815	00:52:53,631	| IOT107 |	Did one of the big ones people talk about now is climate change
EDL	00:52:53,631	00:52:56,447	| IOT107 |	Example which is Real History shows us
EDL	00:52:56,959	00:52:58,495	| IOT107 |	Credibly likely almost certain
EDL	00:52:59,007	00:53:02,591	| IOT107 |	We will overcome and mitigate the effects of
EDL	00:53:02,591	00:53:03,615	| IOT107 |	Climate change
EDL	00:53:03,615	00:53:07,711	| IOT107 |	By proving on technology because
EDL	00:53:08,223	00:53:08,991	| IOT107 |	On that note
EDL	00:53:08,991	00:53:11,551	| IOT107 |	What is the biggest obstacle today
EDL	00:53:11,551	00:53:13,087	| IOT107 |	For your vision
EDL	00:53:13,087	00:53:13,599	| IOT107 |	The internet
EDL	00:53:15,135	00:53:17,439	| IOT107 |	Oh I mean that kind of has really
EDL	00:53:17,439	00:53:19,487	| IOT107 |	But I look when I look around the
EDL	00:53:21,791	00:53:28,191	| IOT107 |	Consumer applications in like things in small firms that use GPS so that the sense you're hot right or whatever
EDL	00:53:28,191	00:53:29,471	| IOT107 |	I'm sorry business
EDL	00:53:29,471	00:53:29,983	| IOT107 |	Incredible
EDL	00:53:31,007	00:53:32,543	| IOT107 |	Largely unseen
EDL	00:53:32,543	00:53:36,639	| IOT107 |	Revolution around Network sensing so there another no autistic
EDL	00:53:36,639	00:53:37,407	| IOT107 |	Post to my page
EDL	00:53:37,407	00:53:38,431	| IOT107 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:53:38,943	00:53:43,039	| IOT107 |	Happening cuz it's already it's already happened we are now surrounded by
EDL	00:53:43,551	00:53:45,599	| IOT107 |	Network sensors and the benefits
EDL	00:53:45,599	00:53:46,879	| IOT107 |	Subnetwork census
EDL	00:53:46,879	00:53:50,719	| IOT107 |	I don't see any any particular all the schools are always new problem
EDL	00:53:51,999	00:53:55,327	| IOT107 |	Yeah that the frontier for the internet of things today
EDL	00:53:55,327	00:53:56,351	| IOT107 |	Is definitely
EDL	00:53:56,351	00:53:56,863	| IOT107 |	Machine learning
EDL	00:53:57,375	00:53:58,911	| IOT107 |	Because you eat cycle this diet
EDL	00:53:59,423	00:54:00,191	| IOT107 |	This coming from
EDL	00:54:00,191	00:54:00,703	| IOT107 |	Census
EDL	00:54:01,215	00:54:06,335	| IOT107 |	And you need a new way to evaluate and analyze it because there's so much of it but
EDL	00:54:06,335	00:54:07,871	| IOT107 |	The 20th century
EDL	00:54:07,871	00:54:09,407	| IOT107 |	Types of paradigm
EDL	00:54:09,407	00:54:12,223	| IOT107 |	Was was kind of the Excel spreadsheet
EDL	00:54:12,223	00:54:14,271	| IOT107 |	Clear coat turned into a pie chart
EDL	00:54:14,271	00:54:15,039	| IOT107 |	On a PowerPoint
EDL	00:54:15,807	00:54:21,439	| IOT107 |	In the mind of a lot of CEOs and Senior executive so I gather these 20th century white guys
EDL	00:54:21,439	00:54:27,071	| IOT107 |	That still want dangerous right you ever report that comes out of something like an sap system or
EDL	00:54:27,071	00:54:28,863	| IOT107 |	Salesforce.com or something
EDL	00:54:29,375	00:54:30,655	| IOT107 |	And some kid
EDL	00:54:31,679	00:54:33,215	| IOT107 |	Into a spreadsheet
EDL	00:54:33,215	00:54:34,751	| IOT107 |	Add makes up pycharm
EDL	00:54:35,263	00:54:41,663	| IOT107 |	And then I arrange a meeting in the Outlook calendar 3 weeks later and they sit there
EDL	00:54:41,663	00:54:42,431	| IOT107 |	I'm stare at it
EDL	00:54:42,431	00:54:45,247	| IOT107 |	Try to understand it decide to have another meeting
EDL	00:54:45,247	00:54:47,807	| IOT107 |	About state or Dialysis in the 20th century
EDL	00:54:48,319	00:54:50,111	| IOT107 |	In the 21st century
EDL	00:54:52,671	00:54:56,255	| IOT107 |	It's ultimated using this technology for machine learning
EDL	00:54:56,255	00:54:57,535	| IOT107 |	So either one of them
EDL	00:54:57,535	00:54:58,303	| IOT107 |	Sweetheart
EDL	00:54:58,303	00:54:59,583	| IOT107 |	People's rehab today
EDL	00:54:59,583	00:55:00,351	| IOT107 |	Is
EDL	00:55:00,351	00:55:02,399	| IOT107 |	Developing Alpha Beta algorithm
EDL	00:55:02,911	00:55:05,471	| IOT107 |	To do machine learning analysis of
EDL	00:55:05,471	00:55:07,775	| IOT107 |	Huge amounts of real time
EDL	00:55:07,775	00:55:09,311	| IOT107 |	It's a lot of things
EDL	00:55:09,823	00:55:11,359	| IOT107 |	Another challenge the
EDL	00:55:11,359	00:55:13,919	| IOT107 |	I don't know how we're going to solve is
EDL	00:55:13,919	00:55:16,735	| IOT107 |	The wild have this
EDL	00:55:17,759	00:55:19,039	| IOT107 |	Really old fashioned
EDL	00:55:19,039	00:55:20,831	| IOT107 |	Approach to radio spectrum
EDL	00:55:21,599	00:55:22,879	| IOT107 |	Kind of like
EDL	00:55:23,903	00:55:24,927	| IOT107 |	Bright House Spectrum
EDL	00:55:24,927	00:55:27,231	| IOT107 |	Is kind of still allocated
EDL	00:55:27,743	00:55:30,559	| IOT107 |	Everybody watched analog broadcast television
EDL	00:55:31,071	00:55:33,375	| IOT107 |	Listen to analog broadcast radio
EDL	00:55:33,375	00:55:36,191	| IOT107 |	There's barely any Spectrum
EDL	00:55:36,191	00:55:38,495	| IOT107 |	Digital computer science like application
EDL	00:55:39,007	00:55:43,103	| IOT107 |	You know you got more 20th century white guys running the world governments
EDL	00:55:43,103	00:55:46,943	| IOT107 |	And then you got big old fashion companies that give them bunch of money
EDL	00:55:47,455	00:55:49,247	| IOT107 |	And tell them what policies to agree to
EDL	00:55:49,759	00:55:51,551	| IOT107 |	It could be hard to get them
EDL	00:55:51,551	00:55:52,575	| IOT107 |	DeGraw
EDL	00:55:52,575	00:55:54,623	| IOT107 |	You know how we need to make
EDL	00:55:54,623	00:55:57,183	| IOT107 |	More radio waves available full
EDL	00:55:57,183	00:55:59,743	| IOT107 |	Internet of Things type applications
EDL	00:55:59,743	00:56:00,511	| IOT107 |	I like your thinking
