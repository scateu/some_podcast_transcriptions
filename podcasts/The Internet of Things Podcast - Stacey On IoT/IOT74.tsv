EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:55,040	| IOT74 |	The most exciting piece of news this week or the most
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:55,808	| IOT74 |	Rising
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:00:56,320	| IOT74 |	Piece of news this week
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:00:59,136	| IOT74 |	I don't know which is which but I
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:02,464	| IOT74 |	I think you want to talk about Nest first all right
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:05,536	| IOT74 |	Oh I don't know that it is
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:09,376	| IOT74 |	I don't I mean it is newsy
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:15,776	| IOT74 |	It is something that's happening I'm going to just real quick to disclose that I do work for Google I do not work with the nest e more smart home
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:16,544	| IOT74 |	Products
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:19,616	| IOT74 |	And I have no knowledge of what's going on here
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:23,200	| IOT74 |	I can't really comment on what's been reported and that's the news
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:28,576	| IOT74 |	And the news is that Nest is going to move under Google
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:33,184	| IOT74 |	Which is part of alphabet so Nest was their own
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:34,464	| IOT74 |	Alphabet company right
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:36,000	| IOT74 |	Yes they were a separate sub
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:36,512	| IOT74 |	Subsidiary
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:40,096	| IOT74 |	Yeah they were young we separate subsidiary but
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:42,400	| IOT74 |	According to Fortune
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:48,032	| IOT74 |	The Nest team is going to become part of Google and reporting to Hiroshi lockheimer
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:51,616	| IOT74 |	Who is in charge of everything Android so that's
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:53,408	| IOT74 |	That's kind of interesting in and of itself that it's
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:56,224	| IOT74 |	Going to be according to reports
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:57,248	| IOT74 |	Mastoid part of
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,016	| IOT74 |	Deandre ayton
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:01:59,296	| IOT74 |	Especially with all of the
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:00,576	| IOT74 |	Grillo
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:02,368	| IOT74 |	Hasbro Louis Cardinal Android
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:03,904	| IOT74 |	Fuchsia
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:06,976	| IOT74 |	There's a lots
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:08,768	| IOT74 |	Beti I think
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:10,304	| IOT74 |	And this is just personal opinion obviously
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:12,864	| IOT74 |	I think this should have happened from day one
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:17,216	| IOT74 |	I don't think it should have been a separate kind of company cuz I think that's what got it into
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:17,984	| IOT74 |	Trouble
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:20,032	| IOT74 |	Right we talked about that many times before
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,568	| IOT74 |	He was kind of autonomous and
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:26,688	| IOT74 |	And then because it was a separate subsidiary it had to show profits and
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:28,736	| IOT74 |	So it's kind of like
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,016	| IOT74 |	If Nest loses money
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,552	| IOT74 |	We probably won't know about that
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,088	| IOT74 |	Right
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:33,856	| IOT74 |	Swell
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:36,416	| IOT74 |	Okay so that's the question right now they're saying
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:37,696	| IOT74 |	Software
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,512	| IOT74 |	Which means the hardware division
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,024	| IOT74 |	Is still there
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,072	| IOT74 |	Somewhere
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:48,448	| IOT74 |	Right there still a what would they be doing without developer
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:50,496	| IOT74 |	Marwan fawaz
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:55,104	| IOT74 |	Is running nest and he's got the hardware guys and he's got all that experience with the
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,128	| IOT74 |	Cable companies
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:56,640	| IOT74 |	Spin selling
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,944	| IOT74 |	Those folks
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:02:59,968	| IOT74 |	Now we have
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:03,296	| IOT74 |	Possibly a hardware division that is stillness
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:05,600	| IOT74 |	Unless they just totally killed up subsidiary
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:09,440	| IOT74 |	It's hard to say because right now all we have are the reports of
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,976	| IOT74 |	The Developers
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,256	| IOT74 |	Moving over
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,792	| IOT74 |	So I know that there's
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:14,560	| IOT74 |	Probably more
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:18,144	| IOT74 |	Unanswered questions here that in Google hasn't officially commented at all
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,936	| IOT74 |	Break Google no comment from Google
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:20,960	| IOT74 |	Yeah
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:25,824	| IOT74 |	Irish at some people later yes or late yesterday but have not heard back from them
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:26,848	| IOT74 |	Cuz I probably still sleeping
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,384	| IOT74 |	So
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:30,944	| IOT74 |	We still don't know those things but I think what we
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:32,224	| IOT74 |	I hope we know
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:34,272	| IOT74 |	Is a Toby a more cohesive
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:37,088	| IOT74 |	Platform play here for
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:37,600	| IOT74 |	The Smart Home
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:40,416	| IOT74 |	As opposed to having two separate groups now
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:45,792	| IOT74 |	And that makes sense because what we've seen with like the Amazon Echo for example is that
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:48,352	| IOT74 |	Smart home plus a personal assistant
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:49,632	| IOT74 |	Makes sense
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:50,400	| IOT74 |	And Google
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:55,008	| IOT74 |	Under alphabet so Google has all the personal assistant uses
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:56,544	| IOT74 |	And intelligent
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:58,848	| IOT74 |	So even
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:04,736	| IOT74 |	Hardware to some degree because it Ayo Google announced the Google home that would it was called to make sure I get it
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:06,528	| IOT74 |	Right so that's that fix
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:10,112	| IOT74 |	Portico Amazon Echo type device with the personal assistants
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:12,672	| IOT74 |	Yeah I seen that says always been this separate Island
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,464	| IOT74 |	I just never understood why
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:15,488	| IOT74 |	Now
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,303	| IOT74 |	Initially
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:20,351	| IOT74 |	There was a different Vision playing out for the smart
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:22,399	| IOT74 |	Please watch this happen
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:22,911	| IOT74 |	4 Lakeshore
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,703	| IOT74 |	A really long time
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:27,007	| IOT74 |	The original thought was you would have these connect
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:33,407	| IOT74 |	Two devices and then without a standards developing we all realize that holy cow that is just crazy talk and now it seems like
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:34,687	| IOT74 |	Like having some sort of
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,735	| IOT74 |	Easy voice control
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:39,551	| IOT74 |	Probably other controls around the house 2
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,087	| IOT74 |	Makes a lot more sense
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,623	| IOT74 |	And
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:45,695	| IOT74 |	To really sell this to Consumers you can't just offer like
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:51,839	| IOT74 |	You can't just tell them hey that we're going to sell you this personal assistant that could be awesome if you buy a bunch of lightbulbs another stock you got to have it
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,375	| IOT74 |	Provide real value
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,399	| IOT74 |	Right
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,703	| IOT74 |	There's that
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:05:02,079	| IOT74 |	I don't know what this means for nest is a hardware company I don't know what it means for all the works with Nest stuff
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:04,127	| IOT74 |	And those Partnerships because that's
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,151	| IOT74 |	Stupid deal so
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:09,759	| IOT74 |	Cannon and maybe we'll only have one thread
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:12,575	| IOT74 |	After all this is said and done as well because do we have
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,343	| IOT74 |	2
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:18,719	| IOT74 |	Give me your threads mixed up with your weaves
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,487	| IOT74 |	Is 2 weeks
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,535	| IOT74 |	Do basically the same thing
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,583	| IOT74 |	So yes that's also a
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,631	| IOT74 |	Okay so that's the
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,143	| IOT74 |	Google
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,679	| IOT74 |	Alphabet
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,191	| IOT74 |	Nest
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:30,239	| IOT74 |	Saga
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:32,031	| IOT74 |	News I know man
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:34,847	| IOT74 |	3.2 billion dollars it's like the bottle reality
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,151	| IOT74 |	My goodness
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:39,199	| IOT74 |	But they're too
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:42,271	| IOT74 |	Really awesome pieces of news this week
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:43,807	| IOT74 |	So
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:44,575	| IOT74 |	Nest fine
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,623	| IOT74 |	What did I call it surprising and
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,159	| IOT74 |	I forgot
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,975	| IOT74 |	I know that you are more
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:51,743	| IOT74 |	Excited about this
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:53,791	| IOT74 |	So excited
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,071	| IOT74 |	Samantha
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,607	| IOT74 |	Is the best and or exciting news
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:57,887	| IOT74 |	If you're facing
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:58,655	| IOT74 |	If your me
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,935	| IOT74 |	Sonos
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,983	| IOT74 |	My favorite sound system
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:07,359	| IOT74 |	Launch today pi and it also launched a strategic partnership with the Amazon
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,895	| IOT74 |	With Amazon so
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:10,943	| IOT74 |	In 2017 you'll be able to
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:11,455	| IOT74 |	Control
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,503	| IOT74 |	Your Sonos
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:15,039	| IOT74 |	From your Echo
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:18,623	| IOT74 |	If I knew you'd be happy when I saw this news
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:21,439	| IOT74 |	Yes and they build some great commands like
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,463	| IOT74 |	What song is playing
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,999	| IOT74 |	Play the song
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:26,559	| IOT74 |	Skip to the next song so there's actually some really
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:30,399	| IOT74 |	Granular controls that they're building in for this which is pretty cool
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:38,079	| IOT74 |	So that's that in the meantime Sonos is also opening up an API so it'll work with a lot of other devices as well
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:41,151	| IOT74 |	This would be cooler I think if
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:45,247	| IOT74 |	Sonos had Mike's built into their speakers none of my Sonos is have Mike's butt
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,527	| IOT74 |	I still think it's great
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:48,319	| IOT74 |	Cuz I've always wanted my Sonos to
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,087	| IOT74 |	To be the voice of my home
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,391	| IOT74 |	Apus hard
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:53,951	| IOT74 |	I could see that change with this
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:56,255	| IOT74 |	New strategic partnership with Amazon
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:07:01,631	| IOT74 |	And it would not surprise me at all if he knew Sonos Hardware at some point in the near future with microphones
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:02,911	| IOT74 |	Antiques
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:05,215	| IOT74 |	She Who Shall Not Be Named voice services
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:06,239	| IOT74 |	Yes
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,543	| IOT74 |	No it's a good guess
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,311	| IOT74 |	Because
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:10,335	| IOT74 |	It makes total sense
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,359	| IOT74 |	It's kind of sad
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:19,551	| IOT74 |	And the other thing is Sonos now integrates with control4 Creston Lutron
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,063	| IOT74 |	In Savannah
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:23,647	| IOT74 |	So all of these bridges are going to let you
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,927	| IOT74 |	Control your Sonos
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:29,023	| IOT74 |	With some of the controllers for these products which is
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:31,327	| IOT74 |	Solutran could introduce
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,375	| IOT74 |	A $50 Pico remote for audio
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:36,703	| IOT74 |	So it's kind of like the ones they use for lighting
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,471	| IOT74 |	And shape control
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,263	| IOT74 |	It'll be used
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:40,287	| IOT74 |	With their soda
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:40,799	| IOT74 |	Play pause
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:46,943	| IOT74 |	So on a rainy day you can say play My Rainy Day mix and close the blinds so I don't have to see the rain today
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,223	| IOT74 |	Yes
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:50,271	| IOT74 |	How many people sit in the Gloom
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,623	| IOT74 |	Life is good
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:57,183	| IOT74 |	So I know
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:08:03,583	| IOT74 |	You're not excited but you have an event
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:05,631	| IOT74 |	It's just I went in a different direction
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:07,679	| IOT74 |	But I know there's a lot of people happy with
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,215	| IOT74 |	Saint Ignatius beso
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:09,983	| IOT74 |	It is exciting
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:14,079	| IOT74 |	So the other really exciting piece of news
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,359	| IOT74 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,895	| IOT74 |	You guys
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:17,663	| IOT74 |	Nazi wave
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:19,967	| IOT74 |	Phillips
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,015	| IOT74 |	I don't want to talk about it
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,527	| IOT74 |	A particular product
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:26,623	| IOT74 |	BR30 lights
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,135	| IOT74 |	It's in white
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:30,719	| IOT74 |	And so far you guys were like what did Stacy just say it doesn't
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:33,791	| IOT74 |	Make any sense these are the downlight so Philips Hue downlight
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,839	| IOT74 |	Have only been in
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,607	| IOT74 |	In color
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,887	| IOT74 |	Austin Peay basketball
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:41,471	| IOT74 |	And this is made me sad because my house is filled with
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,239	| IOT74 |	KFC
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:42,751	| IOT74 |	Can light space
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:45,311	| IOT74 |	And $60 bulb is crazy
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:46,847	| IOT74 |	So now
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,639	| IOT74 |	Phillips
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,407	| IOT74 |	White ones
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,199	| IOT74 |	And they are
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,479	| IOT74 |	They're still
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:56,319	| IOT74 |	I was going to say 40 bucks
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:59,135	| IOT74 |	Yeah I mean you could use your
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:08:59,647	| IOT74 |	Phillips
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,439	| IOT74 |	And change the color to light
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:02,975	| IOT74 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:04,255	| IOT74 |	Yes but why would I spend
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,023	| IOT74 |	$60 on it
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,559	| IOT74 |	Color bulb
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,071	| IOT74 |	Did not used
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:11,423	| IOT74 |	Because you like to play disco music and have different color lights.
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:12,703	| IOT74 |	That is true
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:17,567	| IOT74 |	That is why I didn't answer your question now the rest of the world though you're right
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,335	| IOT74 |	People would rather stay
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,359	| IOT74 |	10:40 or less
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:21,407	| IOT74 |	I just have white are they
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:23,711	| IOT74 |	I'm assuming they're tunable they are
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:26,783	| IOT74 |	Yeah I'm happy about that I like to in football
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,087	| IOT74 |	Yes and if you're like
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,367	| IOT74 |	Stacy $40 is
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:31,391	| IOT74 |	I still way too much
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,415	| IOT74 |	That's okay
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:33,695	| IOT74 |	Your
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:40,095	| IOT74 |	Let's see I've got currently running the GE light Link that are $15 they're running in my house you can also run the
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,375	| IOT74 |	Osram lightify
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,399	| IOT74 |	I think those are a 30 box
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:45,215	| IOT74 |	Those are running on my Philips Hue
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,007	| IOT74 |	In my house
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:47,775	| IOT74 |	And
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:51,871	| IOT74 |	So you don't actually have to go with the Philips Hue but you know if you were holding out for this because
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:52,383	| IOT74 |	Cuz
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:53,919	| IOT74 |	Give me
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:56,479	| IOT74 |	Then actually I haven't been holding out that
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:58,271	| IOT74 |	Checkpoint I was like
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:02,111	| IOT74 |	Yeah I got it I got to put lights in my kitchen
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:03,903	| IOT74 |	So yeah so I'm excited about that
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,951	| IOT74 |	Two pieces of exciting
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,231	| IOT74 |	Is my Sonos is
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:07,999	| IOT74 |	Going to get way more useful
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,303	| IOT74 |	And my Philips lights
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,839	| IOT74 |	In October
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| IOT74 |	I can buy them
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,911	| IOT74 |	Okay now we're going to skip away from Phillips
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,191	| IOT74 |	We'll come back to it and talk about
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,471	| IOT74 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:19,007	| IOT74 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,287	| IOT74 |	A radio
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,591	| IOT74 |	For the connected home
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:24,383	| IOT74 |	Is opening up
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,663	| IOT74 |	And
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,431	| IOT74 |	What this means
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,735	| IOT74 |	Is that they are going
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,759	| IOT74 |	You no longer have to
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,783	| IOT74 |	To buy access
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,063	| IOT74 |	2
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:34,879	| IOT74 |	The software the firmware for a Z-Wave radio
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:39,487	| IOT74 |	The Z-Wave radio is actually been a standard under the eye to you for about 4 years
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,279	| IOT74 |	And two companies
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,303	| IOT74 |	Sigma in
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,119	| IOT74 |	I was going to call at Mitsubishi but it's mitsumi
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,423	| IOT74 |	Z-Wave chips
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:48,447	| IOT74 |	Z-Wave radio chip
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,983	| IOT74 |	Other people haven't really
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:53,311	| IOT74 |	Glommed onto making them because you still had to pay
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:56,127	| IOT74 |	To get access to the firmware in
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,919	| IOT74 |	That the profiles to make it work
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:58,431	| IOT74 |	Basically
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:02,015	| IOT74 |	So what they done here is they open those up so no longer
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,295	| IOT74 |	To pay any money
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:04,319	| IOT74 |	Make a Z-Wave
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:09,439	| IOT74 |	Rights you have access to the code you can create your own software
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,207	| IOT74 |	Sea waves
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:14,047	| IOT74 |	Standards and so on so forth are free so they remove the barrier to entry which is awesome
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,583	| IOT74 |	I don't know what
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,887	| IOT74 |	Used to cost for that I can't imagine it was that expensive
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,399	| IOT74 |	Sunset Bar
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:25,055	| IOT74 |	It was kind of it so there's two issues the fact that there were only two chipmakers meant the prices for Z-Wave radios
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,639	| IOT74 |	People are like
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,175	| IOT74 |	I don't know if this day was going to
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,479	| IOT74 |	You know it was just
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,783	| IOT74 |	It's hard when you develop a standard
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:36,063	| IOT74 |	Right you got to open it up
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,855	| IOT74 |	At some point
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:40,159	| IOT74 |	If you open it up too fast if it's too diluted
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:41,695	| IOT74 |	Did nothing works if you open it
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,719	| IOT74 |	Too slow
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:49,119	| IOT74 |	It was a lot of people are like you know what I'm going to try zigbee Yurts dead or if you're nasty like screw it I'm going to develop
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:49,887	| IOT74 |	Protocol
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,679	| IOT74 |	And they did thread
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:52,959	| IOT74 |	So
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:57,567	| IOT74 |	What is Z-Wave products in my house so I'm excited because this makes it a lot easier for things like
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:12:01,151	| IOT74 |	Amazon could integrate a Z-Wave radio into the echo for example. Without
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,711	| IOT74 |	Putzing around in a way that maybe it just didn't want to do
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,063	| IOT74 |	So what's good
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:08,575	| IOT74 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:12,159	| IOT74 |	So yes good news all around Alyssa
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,183	| IOT74 |	We have
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:13,951	| IOT74 |	What else do we have the
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:16,255	| IOT74 |	Bringing it run through
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:16,767	| IOT74 |	Earthquake news
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:21,375	| IOT74 |	Yeah well there because if he's going on there until going on today and
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:27,263	| IOT74 |	For several days after today so we can't cover everything cuz we don't know everything until next week but what do we know today
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,055	| IOT74 |	Well we know a couple things
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:30,335	| IOT74 |	We know that
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:34,175	| IOT74 |	Drop the kitchen scale that you bought for your wife and she never used
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:42,879	| IOT74 |	Stand up with Bosch and what is going to do is it's got a whole vision for the smart kitchen I'm actually going to write about
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,439	| IOT74 |	So awesome
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:49,791	| IOT74 |	For making hardware and focusing more on making integrated recipes
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,071	| IOT74 |	So
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:57,215	| IOT74 |	If you got to drop scale and you're running a drop recipe and you can import your recipes into the Drop app
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:59,519	| IOT74 |	What'll do as it'll read instructions like
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:02,335	| IOT74 |	Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,151	| IOT74 |	If you have a connected Bosch oven going forward
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,431	| IOT74 |	It'll automatically do that
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:10,015	| IOT74 |	That's Nifty Fifty Nifty
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,831	| IOT74 |	This is a very forward-looking
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,111	| IOT74 |	Can you play this is not something
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,159	| IOT74 |	How often do we bite
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,719	| IOT74 |	I think it's
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,535	| IOT74 |	I think it's a really compelling vision
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,815	| IOT74 |	Hope they can make it work.
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:24,095	| IOT74 |	Because holy cow
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,399	| IOT74 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:27,679	| IOT74 |	So that's the drop stuff
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,471	| IOT74 |	The LG
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:31,519	| IOT74 |	LG has a cool fridge they showed off a Tifa
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,055	| IOT74 |	It's got a big
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:34,591	| IOT74 |	Touch panel look
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,615	| IOT74 |	Something but it's not a touchpad
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:36,895	| IOT74 |	Instead
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:39,199	| IOT74 |	If you knock on it it turns translucent
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:45,599	| IOT74 |	It's pretty cool it's kind of like greyed out like a soda most matches the color of the
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,879	| IOT74 |	The fridge and then if you
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:51,231	| IOT74 |	Do the knock thing on it and becomes translucent now you can see inside the fridge without opening the door
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:56,095	| IOT74 |	I think it's kind of neat and I kind of like that better than what I've seen from Samsung with the
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:58,399	| IOT74 |	Basic with integrated touchscreen tablet in these things
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:00,191	| IOT74 |	Yeah I think
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:00,703	| IOT74 |	Much more
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:04,799	| IOT74 |	Use folded 3lc inside your fridge then to be able to check Twitter
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,311	| IOT74 |	On your fridge

EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:12,479	| IOT74 |	It's kind of like my touch faucet is stiff
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:15,295	| IOT74 |	People I touch it and it turns on and people that are fancy
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,623	| IOT74 |	Is it that practical the faucet is actually totally
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,159	| IOT74 |	I recommend everyone
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,695	| IOT74 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,719	| IOT74 |	Dishwashers
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:24,511	| IOT74 |	Amazon Dash is teaming up with Bashi
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,559	| IOT74 |	So
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,583	| IOT74 |	The dash

EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,143	| IOT74 |	You can now
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,679	| IOT74 |	You're certain
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,447	| IOT74 |	Bosch
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:35,007	| IOT74 |	And Siemens dishwashers will reorder dish
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,055	| IOT74 |	What are those called
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:40,895	| IOT74 |	The little candy looking packs that are too little dish detergent sings
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:41,663	| IOT74 |	So that's going to happen
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:43,199	| IOT74 |	Let's see
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:45,503	| IOT74 |	Slim tile
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,527	| IOT74 |	Tile d
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:47,551	| IOT74 |	Company that makes a
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:48,575	| IOT74 |	Bluetooth tracker
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:51,903	| IOT74 |	They have launched a
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,183	| IOT74 |	Really tiny tile
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:55,487	| IOT74 |	Because the current tile is
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:57,279	| IOT74 |	I don't know it's about a quarter of an inch thick
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:00,095	| IOT74 |	And that's just too fat to stick in your wallet
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,631	| IOT74 |	So
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:04,447	| IOT74 |	They launched one that is now two credit cards thick
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:06,239	| IOT74 |	And you could pop that puppy in your wallet
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:09,311	| IOT74 |	You can just makes it easier to stick on the back of a remote
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,591	| IOT74 |	If you want to get up
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:12,639	| IOT74 |	It was remote the couch all the time
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,711	| IOT74 |	So
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,479	| IOT74 |	That's that
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:20,831	| IOT74 |	And they will also replace your tires so tile has a replacement service
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:22,367	| IOT74 |	That
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,903	| IOT74 |	When the battery runs out after a year
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:26,719	| IOT74 |	You said your old Thailand you get a new tile
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,743	| IOT74 |	If you want
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:33,119	| IOT74 |	Instead of buying the new tile you can send your old tile in if it's up for replacement and get the new fancy or tile
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:39,263	| IOT74 |	Thinner and Slimmer which is awesome it is also bigger than the original tile
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,847	| IOT74 |	Yeah it's kinda like they
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,615	| IOT74 |	Tasty
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:47,967	| IOT74 |	Push down on the original title and stretched it out so it made it almost looks like it's a good
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:50,783	| IOT74 |	What's a 2-inch by 2-inch Square now just much better
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,319	| IOT74 |	Yes cuz it used to be a 1
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,343	| IOT74 |	To 5
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,951	| IOT74 |	So it is a platter
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:58,719	| IOT74 |	And large
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:02,815	| IOT74 |	30 bucks it is $30
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,839	| IOT74 |	If you send it back
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:05,119	| IOT74 |	If you send your old one back to
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:05,887	| IOT74 |	Is a temporary placement
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,935	| IOT74 |	You get to buy the new one
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:09,215	| IOT74 |	For $21
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,543	| IOT74 |	That's it
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,311	| IOT74 |	You can also buy
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,079	| IOT74 |	4 pack 400
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:17,663	| IOT74 |	Okay

EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:50,943	| IOT74 |	Not only did they announce these new lights they also put out a motion sensor
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:52,479	| IOT74 |	And I've been living with that
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:53,503	| IOT74 |	And I have some real thoughts on
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:55,807	| IOT74 |	So

EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:10,399	| IOT74 |	Pros and cons of using different protocols
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,679	| IOT74 |	And the pros and cons of dip
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,447	| IOT74 |	Clouds
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:15,007	| IOT74 |	So dense information packed but it's
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:16,031	| IOT74 |	Really
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:16,543	| IOT74 |	Good
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,591	| IOT74 |	And I try to save my protocol
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:21,151	| IOT74 |	Stay tuned
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:29,087	| IOT74 |	Hey everybody this is Stacy breaking into this week's Internet of Things podcast with a message from our sponsor this
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:30,879	| IOT74 |	Sponsor is macadamia

EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,543	| IOT74 |	Scoreboards
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,335	| IOT74 |	Is the next innovation
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,871	| IOT74 |	In home
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:52,639	| IOT74 |	Sports Entertainer
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:56,991	| IOT74 |	Bringing a piece of the arena or Stadium right into your very own home
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:58,527	| IOT74 |	With a wifi-enabled
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:01,087	| IOT74 |	Scoreboard for the NHL you can customize
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:03,647	| IOT74 |	The scoreboard in your home for your favorite team
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:06,207	| IOT74 |	And what it does is with the iot
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:09,279	| IOT74 |	We've got the in-home live update so it's
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,559	| IOT74 |	An actual scoreboard
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:14,655	| IOT74 |	At what the events are going on at any given Arena across North America for an NHL hockey
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:15,679	| IOT74 |	Taemin
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:16,959	| IOT74 |	How did you guys
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:17,983	| IOT74 |	Help them
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:22,591	| IOT74 |	So if you know with any connected internet product these days
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,383	| IOT74 |	You need a companion app
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:30,015	| IOT74 |	So we helped Tennessee scoreboard develop an app that allows you to pick your favorite team
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:36,415	| IOT74 |	Or if there was a team playing in a specific location that you wanted your scoreboard to show you're at that point in time cuz
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:39,231	| IOT74 |	Do you have friends over from a different state how you could do that
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:42,815	| IOT74 |	Of course we also enabled the scoreboard so that if you're playing
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:49,471	| IOT74 |	Choose ball or ping pong and Anna wanted to control that product entirely through voice interactions alone
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:51,519	| IOT74 |	That you could do that from your Amazon Echo
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:57,919	| IOT74 |	So will as he went to build the fantasy scoreboard what did you encounter
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:58,943	| IOT74 |	How to get the product
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,711	| IOT74 |	Hook up to Wi-Fi
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:06,367	| IOT74 |	We disassemble another product and found some technology in there with steered Us in the direction of macadamia out for narcotics
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:08,671	| IOT74 |	Alright so Thailand
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:10,719	| IOT74 |	What did you guys do to help bring
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:12,255	| IOT74 |	The fantasy scoreboard
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:15,071	| IOT74 |	So with any connected product
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:16,863	| IOT74 |	You need a companion application and
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:21,727	| IOT74 |	You know Android and iOS prevalence you need to support those platforms
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:27,359	| IOT74 |	Is cloud conductivity the provides a connection to the NHL servers with the game stats
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:33,759	| IOT74 |	So there's a connection to the Azure Cloud the connection to the electric in Cloud so that I mentioned earlier lots of moving parts
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:36,063	| IOT74 |	And you need to work with a partner who's
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:39,647	| IOT74 |	Confident in these Technologies in the way to pull them all together
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:45,279	| IOT74 |	And deliver a product like this to Market on time and on budget is bring together for the custom
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:50,143	| IOT74 |	The customer now has the ability to be able to follow their favorite team's games
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:51,167	| IOT74 |	On demand
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:53,727	| IOT74 |	And or any other NHL team that's
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:56,031	| IOT74 |	Playing on any given night and oddly enough
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:57,311	| IOT74 |	It is a global solution
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:59,871	| IOT74 |	I was able to control my scoreboard
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:01,151	| IOT74 |	Nordstrom Las Vegas
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,687	| IOT74 |	With my scoreboard being in Edmonton Alberta
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,735	| IOT74 |	Designer app
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:06,015	| IOT74 |	I can select games
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:07,295	| IOT74 |	No matter where my scoreboard is
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:09,087	| IOT74 |	And it will follow every game I asked at the phone
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:12,671	| IOT74 |	And this is what so incredible with the Internet of Things
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,695	| IOT74 |	And what that
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:15,487	| IOT74 |	Spies in terms of value to Consumers
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:22,399	| IOT74 |	It's at conductivity that ability to stay connected to devices in your home wrapped around with a + credit
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,167	| IOT74 |	User experience
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:26,751	| IOT74 |	Is what we're all about and what we're all their building for a client
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:32,895	| IOT74 |	To learn more about what we do go to www. Macadamia. Com scoreboard

EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:03,103	| IOT74 |	Before I could lose active Lewis's thing called Skynet
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:04,383	| IOT74 |	Was all about making like
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:05,151	| IOT74 |	Everything talks
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:05,919	| IOT74 |	Everything else
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:07,967	| IOT74 |	And now that it's October Blue it's still about that
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,503	| IOT74 |	It's just now owned by Citrix
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:12,831	| IOT74 |	So this week we decided to do something kind of super
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:15,647	| IOT74 |	It's not super nerdy but it is a little bit
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:22,560	| IOT74 |	We wanted to give people who were trying to understand who are in the business of building products or maybe managing iot
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:24,608	| IOT74 |	Products away to think about
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,632	| IOT74 |	The tools that they have available
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:28,704	| IOT74 |	Because Chris has been doing this for
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:29,728	| IOT74 |	Courageous
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,008	| IOT74 |	Aegis
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,104	| IOT74 |	Breakdown
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:37,408	| IOT74 |	What you need to know that internet-of-things Prada
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:38,944	| IOT74 |	So
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:39,968	| IOT74 |	Here we
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:41,504	| IOT74 |	Chris
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,296	| IOT74 |	I want to build
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:44,832	| IOT74 |	Connected products
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:46,368	| IOT74 |	What should I even
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:48,672	| IOT74 |	How should I start what should I think about before I start
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:53,536	| IOT74 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:55,328	| IOT74 |	It's a really wide open
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:58,912	| IOT74 |	Question him we talked earlier there's so many different
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,936	| IOT74 |	Radio choices
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:02,752	| IOT74 |	Platform choices protocol choice
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:06,336	| IOT74 |	You really need to figure out what and its pros and cons
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:06,848	| IOT74 |	All of them
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:10,176	| IOT74 |	There's not a silver bullet. That's Donuts
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:12,480	| IOT74 |	It's heading in the industry so
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:14,528	| IOT74 |	Okay so if I'm thinking about this
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:16,064	| IOT74 |	First I've got to decide
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:17,088	| IOT74 |	A radio
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:20,160	| IOT74 |	And then maybe a messaging protocol
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,952	| IOT74 |	Maybe a cloud
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,256	| IOT74 |	How to post some place to put it
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:27,328	| IOT74 |	Are there other things I need to think about what I'm making
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:31,168	| IOT74 |	I think you've hit the big ones probably battery life
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:35,008	| IOT74 |	Why is another one cuz you know they all got different capabilities as far as like
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:40,384	| IOT74 |	How long will that device live do you like beacons are really good for living couple of years
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:41,664	| IOT74 |	Where is
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,688	| IOT74 |	Wi-Fi device
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:44,992	| IOT74 |	They're always on not so much right
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,296	| IOT74 |	So we'll talk about that in the pros and cons
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:51,392	| IOT74 |	We might want to say the brains of the operation so
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:53,696	| IOT74 |	Is this going to be doing like a hardcore
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:56,768	| IOT74 |	You know Intel or arm a 9 Kenneth
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:23:00,096	| IOT74 |	Brain inside or could we do with the second MCU a microcontroller
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:01,632	| IOT74 |	Itty bitty
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:08,544	| IOT74 |	That's another really good question because I'm depending on how much logic I think you want on the edge of the network with the
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,824	| IOT74 |	Depend on how much
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,872	| IOT74 |	How smart that ship needs to be in
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:13,920	| IOT74 |	Form factor
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:16,480	| IOT74 |	If you're trying to make something really really small
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:18,016	| IOT74 |	Now you're definitely talking
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,808	| IOT74 |	Feeling better
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:24,416	| IOT74 |	Microcontrollers as opposed to being like a Raspberry Pi or something a little bit
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,184	| IOT74 |	Marker bigger
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:26,976	| IOT74 |	Start with Lodge
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:30,304	| IOT74 |	Chemical radios and go messaging
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,888	| IOT74 |	Unless we get off track
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:35,424	| IOT74 |	Which could happen with logic
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:39,520	| IOT74 |	Just big rules about what's out there
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:42,080	| IOT74 |	Do I want to buy something like
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:43,616	| IOT74 |	Do I want to buy my own
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:44,384	| IOT74 |	Macros
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:47,712	| IOT74 |	Controller for Mega stmicro or something or do I want to buy a platform like
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:52,832	| IOT74 |	Yes if you're ever talked about building something right we're going to prototypes
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:55,648	| IOT74 |	New and exciting that we're going to bring the market
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:24:00,512	| IOT74 |	What I usually do they start with something really with a good ecosystem
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:06,912	| IOT74 |	You're like an Arduino type of a microcontroller from going that route and it's okay if it's big and clumsy with a
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,704	| IOT74 |	Fretboard Yaya prototyping
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,472	| IOT74 |	Keep that in mind
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:12,800	| IOT74 |	And as you get to thinking I said it works
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:17,920	| IOT74 |	Successes that works then you can start looking okay
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:19,712	| IOT74 |	There's a lot of form factor
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:21,504	| IOT74 |	Just like this Arduino or other
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:24,064	| IOT74 |	Comprable microsystem devices
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,880	| IOT74 |	And then if you really do need that intelligence
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:29,696	| IOT74 |	Show processing power
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:32,512	| IOT74 |	Maybe start with the Raspberry Pi but then again
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:33,792	| IOT74 |	Tell that the Danube
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,840	| IOT74 |	Shipped the pocket chip
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:38,144	| IOT74 |	Came out there not too long ago there's a new
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:40,704	| IOT74 |	Dixon Oasis
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:45,312	| IOT74 |	Computers are all coming to Market with all various form factors to so
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:50,176	| IOT74 |	I usually start big with a bigger ecosystem and then work my way Indian once you have that success
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:52,224	| IOT74 |	Monkey way into
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:53,760	| IOT74 |	Fine tuning the form factor I think
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:57,856	| IOT74 |	Okay so that doesn't really change how you're going to architect or anything else
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,624	| IOT74 |	Statues down the road
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:03,232	| IOT74 |	Not typically need some of it it does like if you get into something
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:07,072	| IOT74 |	I hate to say proprietary like like maybe the particle. IO
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:13,472	| IOT74 |	Great ship it comes in like a wife ible and 3G
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:16,032	| IOT74 |	Aversion what you build with that
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:16,800	| IOT74 |	Particular product
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:20,128	| IOT74 |	You will be to speak stuck with that one
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:24,224	| IOT74 |	Platform was Hugo something a little bit more open like an Arduino Princeton
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,528	| IOT74 |	Then you got a much bigger ecosystem
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:27,552	| IOT74 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:32,160	| IOT74 |	Again I know this depends on
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:34,208	| IOT74 |	Again
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,792	| IOT74 |	But like how should I be thinking about my radio selection
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:40,096	| IOT74 |	What are kind of the factors at play
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:41,120	| IOT74 |	I would say
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:42,144	| IOT74 |	Probably distance
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,680	| IOT74 |	Battery life
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,448	| IOT74 |	Skip
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,984	| IOT74 |	Baby cost
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:48,032	| IOT74 |	Pernoud I don't know what that's a big deal
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:48,800	| IOT74 |	And then
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:50,080	| IOT74 |	Maybe if it measures or not
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:57,248	| IOT74 |	All of those are very good I came in fact I can't think of another another thing you have to add to that list Wi-Fi you're going to
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:58,784	| IOT74 |	Pretty good range
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:02,880	| IOT74 |	Shell's you may be mentioned earlier but then again there's a big drain on the battery
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:03,904	| IOT74 |	Unless
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:08,768	| IOT74 |	You do it, the Amazon Dash route where it's it's basically offline
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:10,304	| IOT74 |	Until you press the button
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:13,632	| IOT74 |	K'Nex transmission goes back offline
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:17,728	| IOT74 |	It's a brilliant technique of seeing for giving that Wi-Fi
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:19,008	| IOT74 |	Distance
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,032	| IOT74 |	But also
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:23,104	| IOT74 |	Keeping with the battery light that's needed
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:26,432	| IOT74 |	Seems like the only way you're going to need to be closer
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:28,224	| IOT74 |	To Harbor something that
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:28,992	| IOT74 |	Communicating with
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:31,040	| IOT74 |	So that's something that
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:32,832	| IOT74 |	Keep in mind and then
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:33,856	| IOT74 |	Zigbee
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:37,696	| IOT74 |	There's so many different flavors if you will
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,976	| IOT74 |	That's also something else
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:40,000	| IOT74 |	Keep in mind that it's not
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:42,560	| IOT74 |	A Street Fall River protocol is
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:44,864	| IOT74 |	Doesn't think the industry would like
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:46,400	| IOT74 |	YouTube to believe
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:49,472	| IOT74 |	Okay and what about in an industrial setting
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,496	| IOT74 |	What about looking at
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:53,056	| IOT74 |	Proprietary protocols like I'm trying to think like
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:53,568	| IOT74 |	Lakers Hart
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:54,592	| IOT74 |	There's
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,384	| IOT74 |	Old school
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,664	| IOT74 |	Kind of
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:59,200	| IOT74 |	I want try to think
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,552	| IOT74 |	Modbus yeah
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,832	| IOT74 |	And there again
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:05,600	| IOT74 |	You're dealing with
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:07,648	| IOT74 |	There is a legacy
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:10,720	| IOT74 |	Legacy Center Legacy scada controllers
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:14,560	| IOT74 |	Yo at the time cereal was the best option
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,584	| IOT74 |	Charlotte events
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:18,912	| IOT74 |	Technology or those both the hardware components and sensors even so
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:21,984	| IOT74 |	Tell you you can you definitely need to
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:22,496	| IOT74 |	Fly
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:26,080	| IOT74 |	What's right for the environment
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:28,128	| IOT74 |	Sister to move it forward
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:30,176	| IOT74 |	Sentences accommodation
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:31,712	| IOT74 |	Maybe sometimes you might go
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:34,528	| IOT74 |	You might connect with modbus friends
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:36,064	| IOT74 |	Install serial device
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,368	| IOT74 |	And then you might convert it
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:38,880	| IOT74 |	2
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:41,184	| IOT74 |	Yeah like websocket store
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:43,232	| IOT74 |	UT your or something
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:45,280	| IOT74 |	Something a little bit more
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:47,840	| IOT74 |	Modern and adaptable and today's I have to suck one
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:50,144	| IOT74 |	Yes
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:51,424	| IOT74 |	So now we get into
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,008	| IOT74 |	I just have
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,288	| IOT74 |	I cannot remember it
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:59,872	| IOT74 |	Anymore but there was a whole set of the whole verse where I just had to
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:08,320	| IOT74 |	So I'm sad that are a mess
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,088	| IOT74 |	Africa calls
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:10,624	| IOT74 |	We talked about
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:11,648	| IOT74 |	Mqtt
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,672	| IOT74 |	We talked about
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:14,720	| IOT74 |	Costco app there is XMP
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:15,488	| IOT74 |	PP
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:19,584	| IOT74 |	Amqp HTTP websockets DDS
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:21,120	| IOT74 |	Drawing
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:22,912	| IOT74 |	So how do we
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:23,936	| IOT74 |	How are
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:25,472	| IOT74 |	Give people who are not
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:26,752	| IOT74 |	Going to ever want to deal with that
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,800	| IOT74 |	A framework for how to say
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:32,128	| IOT74 |	The world of the web
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:36,736	| IOT74 |	I like to look at the world of the weather's taught us a lot of things about baby
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,296	| IOT74 |	Maybe the physical world like how we connect
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:40,832	| IOT74 |	Physical devices
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:44,672	| IOT74 |	Together and maybe physical devices over the web to other other devices
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:49,792	| IOT74 |	Tandem your HTTP yeah that was the winning protocol of the web
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:51,072	| IOT74 |	Websocket
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:52,096	| IOT74 |	Skim around
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:54,400	| IOT74 |	Castro said maybe a decade ago
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:57,728	| IOT74 |	Secreting like live bi-directional
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:58,496	| IOT74 |	Secure
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:04,640	| IOT74 |	Real-time communication so I think definitely those two are very interesting even even in the day of
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:07,200	| IOT74 |	Beauty and coaxial talk about 2
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:11,808	| IOT74 |	So I definitely don't want to Discount web Technologies or web protocols
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:13,600	| IOT74 |	Connecting
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:17,184	| IOT74 |	Seems like it I think that's a very interesting connectivity
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:20,512	| IOT74 |	But then there's all sorts of these other protocols at
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:23,584	| IOT74 |	Well they turn around 2 for some of them for a long time as well
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,864	| IOT74 |	Focused on
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:29,984	| IOT74 |	M2M Machining Machinery iot Communications in mqtt
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:32,800	| IOT74 |	That's probably that the grandfather
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:35,616	| IOT74 |	5 in 20 years
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:38,432	| IOT74 |	It stands for message queue Telemetry transport
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:43,808	| IOT74 |	And there's lots pros and cons with each of these as we're going to talk through but
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:45,088	| IOT74 |	Are we the best
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:47,648	| IOT74 |	Think about this protocol is
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:48,160	| IOT74 |	You can
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:51,232	| IOT74 |	Literally message a device that's offline
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:52,768	| IOT74 |	And when the device
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,048	| IOT74 |	He's back online
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:56,608	| IOT74 |	There's this concept of quality of service
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:30:00,448	| IOT74 |	Britt you can guarantee delivery of a message so in the device
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:01,984	| IOT74 |	Comes back online it says
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:04,544	| IOT74 |	It wakes up is he that I miss anything and
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:08,640	| IOT74 |	African said yeah you missed these three messages and now now you're all caught up
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:09,664	| IOT74 |	So it's that voice
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:13,760	| IOT74 |	Yes
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:16,320	| IOT74 |	So before we go
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:17,600	| IOT74 |	Before we go any further Chris
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:18,624	| IOT74 |	I got to tell people
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,672	| IOT74 |	What we're talking about here
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:21,696	| IOT74 |	With these protocols
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:24,512	| IOT74 |	Radios are just the physical way for something
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,536	| IOT74 |	Bike Share data
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:26,816	| IOT74 |	So
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:29,632	| IOT74 |	These protocols basically tell
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:36,544	| IOT74 |	The device's what the date is and what things are trying to do is that a fair way to talk about these I just want
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:38,848	| IOT74 |	How to make sure people understand
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:43,712	| IOT74 |	Yet most of these protocols do have like
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:48,064	| IOT74 |	Why refer to the transport layer and then that transports typically like the radio
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:49,344	| IOT74 |	Like you're right it's like
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,112	| IOT74 |	How do I get this
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:53,184	| IOT74 |	Text message from here to here and then what is the mess
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:54,464	| IOT74 |	It's look like inside of that
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:56,000	| IOT74 |	That's your protocol
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:31:00,096	| IOT74 |	So in this messaging layer let's break it down we got Legacy
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:05,984	| IOT74 |	We sat web and then we've got some of that do we have anything new yeah we do we have new things so let's start with Legacy
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:08,288	| IOT74 |	What's out there in the Legacy world
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:09,568	| IOT74 |	That
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:11,872	| IOT74 |	Still in use today or mites
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:12,384	| IOT74 |	Still be used
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:19,040	| IOT74 |	I think in two taquitos Reventon I mean 20 years in the running as an open
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:21,856	| IOT74 |	Open standard there's a lot of
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:23,136	| IOT74 |	New iot
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:25,184	| IOT74 |	Check being built on top of them
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:29,024	| IOT74 |	It's a very basic outside like a
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:31,584	| IOT74 |	Publish subscribe messaging platform
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:37,728	| IOT74 |	So there's other parts of the infrastructure that you need to be concerned about like a
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:39,264	| IOT74 |	Highly available message
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:40,544	| IOT74 |	Broker that knows
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:42,848	| IOT74 |	Mark's basically soap
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:48,224	| IOT74 |	What delivers a message to check that all saying okay I just delivered that to this guy he's good
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:50,272	| IOT74 |	I'll let you know when when I have another message
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:53,856	| IOT74 |	So does that require a lot of logic is part of
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:56,672	| IOT74 |	The message broker needs to be something that has brains inside
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:32:02,560	| IOT74 |	Yeah yeah so it's going to be something that's either going to run in the cloud or you're going to have to
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:07,424	| IOT74 |	Find messaging broker that small enough to fit on a Raspberry Pi 4
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:08,448	| IOT74 |	Incipere building
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,008	| IOT74 |	Encompassing
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:13,568	| IOT74 |	Platform ABC your home and your car
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,360	| IOT74 |	What other than
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,384	| IOT74 |	Should we talk about
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:17,152	| IOT74 |	Is Co-op
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:17,664	| IOT74 |	Old school
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:21,760	| IOT74 |	I think it's going to new school I think
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:24,832	| IOT74 |	Or SMTP burial School
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:28,416	| IOT74 |	Alphabet
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:36,352	| IOT74 |	You know those two are both really old so I think those are those are interesting so sleepy that one
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:40,960	| IOT74 |	What kind of oil Telecom background before this
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:42,496	| IOT74 |	That was like the
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:44,288	| IOT74 |	The protocol of choice for
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:45,824	| IOT74 |	Chat application
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:46,848	| IOT74 |	Teams in the day even
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:49,152	| IOT74 |	Even interactive voice response
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,688	| IOT74 |	Systems in Telecom systems
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,480	| IOT74 |	Managing messages
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:53,760	| IOT74 |	Between
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:55,552	| IOT74 |	Applications was a lot of DXM
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:59,136	| IOT74 |	Codility so very real bus
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:32:59,904	| IOT74 |	Open
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:00,672	| IOT74 |	Inspect
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:02,720	| IOT74 |	Bar security baked into it but
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:05,280	| IOT74 |	It's it's XML and
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:07,840	| IOT74 |	No one today really Developers
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:10,144	| IOT74 |	Anyway don't really want to write XML
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:11,936	| IOT74 |	Anything anymore they're all they're all
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:16,544	| IOT74 |	New message type format
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:17,056	| IOT74 |	Okay
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:19,872	| IOT74 |	So what we'll put that out there but
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:20,896	| IOT74 |	Probably not going to see it
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:22,688	| IOT74 |	So what about
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:23,200	| IOT74 |	Amqp
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:31,136	| IOT74 |	Am amqp
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:34,208	| IOT74 |	We connected aqua blue doll starts with other platforms like
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:36,512	| IOT74 |	Azure AWS bluemix
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:38,560	| IOT74 |	AT&T interaction others
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:41,632	| IOT74 |	Each of those platforms kind of have their preferred
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:44,960	| IOT74 |	Protocol to use and azure
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:47,008	| IOT74 |	Azra 80 is 8
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:49,312	| IOT74 |	So when when we
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:51,872	| IOT74 |	Talk to Azure that's typically the protocol we use it
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:57,504	| IOT74 |	It's similar to mqtt and in that it has a quality of service
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:59,296	| IOT74 |	But what what I've noticed is
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,320	| IOT74 |	It's a very
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:01,600	| IOT74 |	Daddy protocol
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:03,648	| IOT74 |	Skip that that also has it
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:05,696	| IOT74 |	Play snap your dealing with something
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:07,488	| IOT74 |	Very
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:08,768	| IOT74 |	Critical or very
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:12,864	| IOT74 |	State of communication are the states of the
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:14,400	| IOT74 |	Action is very very important
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:17,472	| IOT74 |	I can see that definitely benefits
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:21,056	| IOT74 |	About using a MCPE as a protocol they are as well
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:26,944	| IOT74 |	So that's when you really really really really really need to know what the message went through or if it hasn't
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:27,456	| IOT74 |	What state
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:35,392	| IOT74 |	Exactly so you might have gone through but maybe the device hasn't done anything with it yet amqp will keep tabs
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:38,720	| IOT74 |	It's stater in Flight State at state of action
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:43,072	| IOT74 |	Alright any other kind of these Legacy protocols we should think about her
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:45,888	| IOT74 |	Might be things to think about and cancer
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:53,824	| IOT74 |	But I think there's a DDS protocol we mentioned earlier is also one that I think was competing against in QT quite a bit
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:58,176	| IOT74 |	I still see it out there I still see it in the transportation industry
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:35:00,480	| IOT74 |	Definitely an industrial iot
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:02,528	| IOT74 |	From what I remember
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:04,064	| IOT74 |	It had an interesting approach
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:09,952	| IOT74 |	Using UDP instead of TCP which is also something to remember here is we talk about these protocols
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:13,536	| IOT74 |	I think so far all of them we've discussed it
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:14,560	| IOT74 |	CCP
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:16,608	| IOT74 |	Which means they have air handler
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:18,400	| IOT74 |	Built into the protocol
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:26,848	| IOT74 |	And it's assembling the packets on the way
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:31,456	| IOT74 |	And the way that they're supposed to be in the right order that that if there's
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,992	| IOT74 |	Are receiving a package
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:35,808	| IOT74 |	That TCP higher-level protocol
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:37,600	| IOT74 |	Manages hey
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:39,648	| IOT74 |	Resend packet number three
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:40,928	| IOT74 |	So I can reorder it
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:42,464	| IOT74 |	That's why you get the Jitter
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:47,328	| IOT74 |	Still sometimes like on video or something on a network
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:48,864	| IOT74 |	And TCP
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:50,144	| IOT74 |	The underlying Ark
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:51,424	| IOT74 |	Aventurine
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:52,704	| IOT74 |	That's a fair
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:55,008	| IOT74 |	That is fair
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:57,312	| IOT74 |	Yeah and then
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:59,104	| IOT74 |	Unity yashow
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:01,920	| IOT74 |	Which is coming back though I've seen
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:05,504	| IOT74 |	Some new file transfer protocol today
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:11,136	| IOT74 |	Better trying to start using UDP now with some type of him shaking over the top of it
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:12,672	| IOT74 |	And the reason for that is
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:14,720	| IOT74 |	If you take off all the
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:17,536	| IOT74 |	Hands shaking in the air and air correction
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:19,328	| IOT74 |	You can send
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:20,096	| IOT74 |	I don't know
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:22,656	| IOT74 |	What magnitude but a ton more mess
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:25,472	| IOT74 |	In real-time using UDP
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:29,056	| IOT74 |	So you got much more messages being sent to device
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:32,640	| IOT74 |	Which of the world of you and I were talking at lunch there.
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:35,456	| IOT74 |	If you're trying to control a battlebot
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:38,784	| IOT74 |	You don't really care if it doesn't or does not receive a package
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:42,624	| IOT74 |	Use what the singer receive a hundred times more packets than everyone else
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:44,672	| IOT74 |	More responsive with
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:46,464	| IOT74 |	With its weapons excetera
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:50,816	| IOT74 |	You definitely want to look at UDP because now you can send
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:57,472	| IOT74 |	Is so many more messages to device where you may not care like the the state of the hammer
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:37:00,800	| IOT74 |	Crashing down on the other battlebot use need to know
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:03,360	| IOT74 |	Okay we just got to keep this hammer and swing
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:05,920	| IOT74 |	If it misses a message
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:07,456	| IOT74 |	That very next messages
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,480	| IOT74 |	I was going to be
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:10,272	| IOT74 |	5 more degrees down
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:13,344	| IOT74 |	Cheap it's clean now it picks up where it left off
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:14,624	| IOT74 |	Got it
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:16,160	| IOT74 |	So now we know you're BattleBots
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:18,464	| IOT74 |	Yeah
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:24,864	| IOT74 |	GDP under don't you don't use why it don't use Wi-Fi cuz everyone else is and use UDP because you get
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:25,632	| IOT74 |	Four messages
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:26,400	| IOT74 |	That's how you
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:27,680	| IOT74 |	That's how you compete against me
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:30,496	| IOT74 |	If I have a product or a project
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:33,056	| IOT74 |	And I just need rap
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:40,480	| IOT74 |	And it's kind of an ongoing process that maybe doesn't need find granularity then UDP might be what I'ma
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:43,296	| IOT74 |	Yeah and I think that's for co-op
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:46,368	| IOT74 |	Comes in your some of the newer protocols were talking about
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:47,904	| IOT74 |	If you look at Co-op
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:53,792	| IOT74 |	Constrained application protocol
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:56,352	| IOT74 |	Looks like it's used case or sweet spot
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:38:01,472	| IOT74 |	Is maybe for low bandwidth Communications like maybe satellite Communications or
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:06,848	| IOT74 |	You don't have very large payloads very small little
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:08,640	| IOT74 |	Little packets of information
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:09,664	| IOT74 |	For lots of them
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:12,736	| IOT74 |	I'm Soo Co-op what I've noticed is it looks a lot like
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:15,040	| IOT74 |	Rest API
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:16,320	| IOT74 |	Rest API
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:17,856	| IOT74 |	But it's it's
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:18,880	| IOT74 |	Without handshake
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:19,648	| IOT74 |	King without TC
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:21,184	| IOT74 |	Wtp
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:22,208	| IOT74 |	Very very fast
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:23,488	| IOT74 |	Short
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:24,000	| IOT74 |	Messages
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:25,792	| IOT74 |	Got it
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:27,840	| IOT74 |	Okay what else is in this newer kind of
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:28,608	| IOT74 |	Newer batch
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:36,544	| IOT74 |	Tutu that that that intrigued me one is all joy
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:40,128	| IOT74 |	They were trying to solve back then I am still are it's it's
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:43,456	| IOT74 |	Still very much alive protocol and project
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:44,480	| IOT74 |	But it was trying to
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:47,296	| IOT74 |	6-8 this idea where in a home environment
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:49,344	| IOT74 |	You might have devices that wanted
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:54,720	| IOT74 |	Discover other devices near them or in your in your same home and be able to message
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:56,256	| IOT74 |	I'm in such a way where
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:59,072	| IOT74 |	Earlier about mesh networks like
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:01,376	| IOT74 |	You really do sometimes
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:02,912	| IOT74 |	Want to create a very open
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:06,240	| IOT74 |	Discoverable message local network
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:08,800	| IOT74 |	On on-site in a car in a home
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:10,592	| IOT74 |	The downside is that
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:11,872	| IOT74 |	Not everything
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:13,664	| IOT74 |	Speaks all joints so you still need
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:16,992	| IOT74 |	Gateways to communicate Bridge
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:19,296	| IOT74 |	Other other protocols with all joints
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:20,064	| IOT74 |	When you need
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:21,856	| IOT74 |	I think one of their other
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:24,160	| IOT74 |	We are trying to solve
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:25,184	| IOT74 |	Rosen
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:26,464	| IOT74 |	Device
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:27,232	| IOT74 |	Making a
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:28,768	| IOT74 |	Connection out of your home
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:30,816	| IOT74 |	To the cloud Princeton
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:33,888	| IOT74 |	They were trying to broker all these
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:35,936	| IOT74 |	Messages in the one connection
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:36,704	| IOT74 |	Out of your home
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:39,008	| IOT74 |	And then after all
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:40,288	| IOT74 |	What are we working
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:42,848	| IOT74 |	The other one that I've been
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:43,616	| IOT74 |	Teen clothes
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:46,432	| IOT74 |	Hi Google
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:47,456	| IOT74 |	I think that one's
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:52,064	| IOT74 |	When you when you if you go to I think it's developers. Google.com weaves
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:53,600	| IOT74 |	When you look at how they
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:57,440	| IOT74 |	I look at this as maybe a modern version of all time
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:59,232	| IOT74 |	They looked and said okay
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:02,560	| IOT74 |	Let's identify how a lightbulb should
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:05,632	| IOT74 |	Talk how you should communicate with a light bulb
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:07,936	| IOT74 |	So they've tried to create this mapping
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:13,568	| IOT74 |	That all vendors potentially that that want to join the weaves Alliance and we project
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:17,408	| IOT74 |	Can basically say I'm going to make my light bulbs adapt to this
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:17,920	| IOT74 |	Weave
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:19,200	| IOT74 |	Specification
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:21,504	| IOT74 |	So that now I can just say
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:22,784	| IOT74 |	Light bulb number 6
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:25,344	| IOT74 |	Turn it on and turn it blue and then
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:27,648	| IOT74 |	Delek like we've been experimenting like
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:30,976	| IOT74 |	Top shoes and lifx bulbs and all these other ones that
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:33,024	| IOT74 |	The color blues are different
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:34,816	| IOT74 |	I think we've got some promise
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:37,376	| IOT74 |	I think if we even all join for smartphone stuff
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:40,448	| IOT74 |	Do you think of it as being something that might be used
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:41,984	| IOT74 |	Outsiders
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:44,800	| IOT74 |	Yeah so so
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:45,568	| IOT74 |	I know
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:49,920	| IOT74 |	With Citrix you only have to stop Flying or drones and start focusing on conference rooms
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:52,480	| IOT74 |	I think there's a lot of similarities
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:56,576	| IOT74 |	Smart home on steroids is what I look at Enterprise I
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:59,392	| IOT74 |	I look at it saying
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:02,208	| IOT74 |	1000
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:02,720	| IOT74 |	Conference room
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:05,280	| IOT74 |	You I want to automate like
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:10,144	| IOT74 |	When I walk into conference room that comes to life in the meeting starts in the presentation
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:11,936	| IOT74 |	It's chromecasted in
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:16,032	| IOT74 |	They have the bridge tiles for me in the lights adjustment
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:20,384	| IOT74 |	But now I have to do this at
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:23,200	| IOT74 |	Seymour
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:26,784	| IOT74 |	Does rooms at talkin thousand rooms
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:27,808	| IOT74 |	Workspace
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:31,136	| IOT74 |	Yes it's I think it's it's the next
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:31,648	| IOT74 |	Level
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:34,464	| IOT74 |	Step after home home automation
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:36,512	| IOT74 |	And now
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:37,536	| IOT74 |	Hopefully you guys are finding
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:38,816	| IOT74 |	If
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:40,096	| IOT74 |	You're not
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:41,120	| IOT74 |	We probably already lost you
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:43,168	| IOT74 |	But now we're going to go into the bank account providers
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:45,984	| IOT74 |	I think we've covered them
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:49,312	| IOT74 |	I'm really sad that I can't remember my song to sing
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:51,360	| IOT74 |	Antioch that would have made this whole thing like
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:53,663	| IOT74 |	Or it
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:41:59,551	| IOT74 |	How do I decide the pros and
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:01,343	| IOT74 |	Deciding where to
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:06,719	| IOT74 |	That's another important that part of the conversation in NC
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:07,487	| IOT74 |	Might just
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:12,095	| IOT74 |	Come down to Partnerships that your company already has in place
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:13,631	| IOT74 |	You know if you're big
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:16,191	| IOT74 |	AWS
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:16,703	| IOT74 |	Stop
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:19,775	| IOT74 |	User or maybe your ear Clausen
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:21,055	| IOT74 |	Runs in Austin
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:25,151	| IOT74 |	AWS iot might just be the right the right
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:27,967	| IOT74 |	Iot platform for you
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:29,759	| IOT74 |	Because what what they done in in
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:32,063	| IOT74 |	I love their implementation
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:33,855	| IOT74 |	It basically exposed
EDL	00:42:33,855	00:42:37,183	| IOT74 |	Mqtt and websocket messaging
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:37,951	| IOT74 |	Slayer
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:38,719	| IOT74 |	To AWS
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:41,791	| IOT74 |	So that now you can say when it when
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:45,119	| IOT74 |	I receipt when this device receive the message in AWS
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:48,447	| IOT74 |	Now do all of these other things that aided us
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:49,983	| IOT74 |	Is really good at like
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:50,751	| IOT74 |	Run a Lambda
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:53,055	| IOT74 |	Serverless application or
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:57,663	| IOT74 |	Do something in S3 or use API Gateway to do something else
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:43:02,783	| IOT74 |	What day did I think was very strategic that basically created and iot
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:04,575	| IOT74 |	Front door if you will
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:05,855	| IOT74 |	Belt that allows
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:08,671	| IOT74 |	AMA iot message
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:11,743	| IOT74 |	To interact with anything in the AWS
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:12,255	| IOT74 |	Cloud
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:15,071	| IOT74 |	IBM bluemix
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:21,215	| IOT74 |	If you look at that you know Watson is is getting a lot of mindshare around cognitive
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:22,751	| IOT74 |	Computing and
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:27,871	| IOT74 |	Trying to cure cancer and all these bees really Noble interesting ideas
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:28,639	| IOT74 |	Lumix
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:31,455	| IOT74 |	Is a platform that you think they really like you
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:32,735	| IOT74 |	But they speak
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:34,527	| IOT74 |	Dilapidated
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:36,319	| IOT74 |	Websockets as well
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:37,087	| IOT74 |	And
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:39,135	| IOT74 |	I think if you're an IDM
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:39,903	| IOT74 |	Customer today
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:43,999	| IOT74 |	That platform certainly also has has a lot of Mary
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:45,535	| IOT74 |	You're a soft layer
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:46,303	| IOT74 |	Bloomix
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:47,327	| IOT74 |	IBM customer
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:49,119	| IOT74 |	And you're going to find
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:52,191	| IOT74 |	Once you get into that front door you got a lot of other
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:55,519	| IOT74 |	Ecosystem infrastructure there at play
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:57,567	| IOT74 |	Which is where
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:43:59,615	| IOT74 |	Everybody who's anybody seems
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:00,127	| IOT74 |	To be going this
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:04,735	| IOT74 |	Safety 1st a company earlier this year called Solaire
EDL	00:44:04,735	00:44:05,759	| IOT74 |	And
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:08,063	| IOT74 |	Very focused on on
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:12,415	| IOT74 |	Machine machine Communications layer and again
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:13,951	| IOT74 |	Tell they got asthma Analytics
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:17,279	| IOT74 |	As as an infrastructure play they had a gerbil
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:18,047	| IOT74 |	Morning
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:20,095	| IOT74 |	As another infrastructure clay soap
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:21,887	| IOT74 |	As you get more devices
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:22,655	| IOT74 |	Disconnected
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:26,495	| IOT74 |	Two afternoon again bait they really seem to like amqp
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:28,031	| IOT74 |	Then you can see how you can
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:31,359	| IOT74 |	Move the value of others Thursday
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:34,175	| IOT74 |	If you're streaming a lot since your data you end up platform
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:39,039	| IOT74 |	And you you want use Azure analytics or Azure machine learning
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:41,343	| IOT74 |	I think that simplifies
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:44,415	| IOT74 |	That's just directly connecting
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:46,207	| IOT74 |	Things to to that platform
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:50,047	| IOT74 |	And once once you're through the front door now I can route all of this
EDL	00:44:50,559	00:44:53,887	| IOT74 |	The sensor data to Azrael Dexter Azure machine learning
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:56,447	| IOT74 |	How important is it to
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:57,215	| IOT74 |	The B
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:58,495	| IOT74 |	All in on one platform
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:02,591	| IOT74 |	And I'm asking this because some people might start like
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:05,407	| IOT74 |	It might start their connected Journey with a product that
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:06,431	| IOT74 |	Is buy like
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:13,599	| IOT74 |	Consider using electric imp for connectivity which means they end up hosted on electric gems Cloud they're sending
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:16,159	| IOT74 |	Annotated there which is actually hosted on AWS
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:18,463	| IOT74 |	But let's say they want to pull that data into
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:19,487	| IOT74 |	Sing like Asher
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:22,047	| IOT74 |	Is that just crazy talk is that
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:24,095	| IOT74 |	Make an architecture fail for them
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:27,679	| IOT74 |	Well that's exact reason we started October
EDL	00:45:28,447	00:45:31,519	| IOT74 |	I mean we wanted to be a protocol agnostic
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:32,799	| IOT74 |	And then as we can
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:34,847	| IOT74 |	Matured the OCTA blue platform
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:36,383	| IOT74 |	We've connected it
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:38,175	| IOT74 |	To IBM bluemix
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:42,783	| IOT74 |	To Azure iot to AWS iot so you can now move
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:43,551	| IOT74 |	Messages
EDL	00:45:43,551	00:45:44,831	| IOT74 |	Scrum master
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:47,647	| IOT74 |	Throughout the blue to Blue Mix if you want
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:51,231	| IOT74 |	Or pick any any big data store of your choosing
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:54,559	| IOT74 |	Will Chris wonderful
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:46:00,703	| IOT74 |	But I will say that the inner ankle is so cute. It's so tough
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:01,983	| IOT74 |	So
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:03,007	| IOT74 |	I appreciate
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:05,823	| IOT74 |	You talking to me about this and hopefully
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:10,175	| IOT74 |	For those of you guys out there who are trying to understand what all might go into
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:13,503	| IOT74 |	Platform we just gave you a whole bunch of terms and
EDL	00:46:13,503	00:46:14,783	| IOT74 |	And thoughts for you today
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:16,575	| IOT74 |	Go look up orbi
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:18,879	| IOT74 |	Just start banding around and feeling like
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:19,647	| IOT74 |	You are like
EDL	00:46:19,647	00:46:20,671	| IOT74 |	I got this iot
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:21,695	| IOT74 |	He stuff yeah
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:27,071	| IOT74 |	I would encourage you listen to start small celebrate your wins build spilled something
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:28,607	| IOT74 |	Small and
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:29,375	| IOT74 |	Dad
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:34,239	| IOT74 |	Not small form factor but a little a little concept and then as your your comfort expands
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:39,615	| IOT74 |	Then come back and revisit the form factors and how you're actually going to take that to Market because
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:42,687	| IOT74 |	I think the imagination is the most important
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:44,991	| IOT74 |	Part of what you're trying to solve and if you can make
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:46,527	| IOT74 |	A good user experience
EDL	00:46:47,039	00:46:48,575	| IOT74 |	Yeah I think I think the rest will follow
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:50,367	| IOT74 |	Start with one conference
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:52,159	| IOT74 |	Not a thousand
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:52,927	| IOT74 |	Yes
EDL	00:46:52,927	00:46:53,695	| IOT74 |	All right
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:55,999	| IOT74 |	Chris thanks so much for coming on the podcast
