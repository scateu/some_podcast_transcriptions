EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:27,904	| IOT089 |	Because otherwise
EDL	00:00:28,928	00:00:30,976	| IOT089 |	There's just no room we've got so much stuff

EDL	00:00:34,048	00:00:34,816	| IOT089 |	Don't worry
EDL	00:00:34,816	00:00:36,352	| IOT089 |	I have wonderful guest for
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:36,864	| IOT089 |	Are you guys coming up
EDL	00:00:39,168	00:00:40,704	| IOT089 |	We are going to talk about
EDL	00:00:41,472	00:00:41,984	| IOT089 |	Wow
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:46,848	| IOT089 |	Google did a bunch of news things for the Internet of Things We
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:49,152	| IOT089 |	They got partners for Google home
EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:55,040	| IOT089 |	We talked about Cortana getting an SDK because that could be used for iot and we're going to do a little
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:58,624	| IOT089 |	Quick dive into Amazon's AI as a service and how it might
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:00,160	| IOT089 |	Compared to Google Assistant
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:01,440	| IOT089 |	Then
EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:02,976	| IOT089 |	Where can I get an ad break from
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:04,512	| IOT089 |	Our sponsor Samsung
EDL	00:01:05,024	00:01:07,072	| IOT089 |	And we're going to go in the news cuz we got a new
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:12,448	| IOT089 |	Ble Hub that's Bluetooth hub for you guys we've got some homekit sensors which is a pretty new thing
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:14,496	| IOT089 |	We got zigbee over
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:15,264	| IOT089 |	Thread
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:17,568	| IOT089 |	Industrial news from GE
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:19,104	| IOT089 |	Saint Cloud news from Ala
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:22,688	| IOT089 |	Maybe some government news and we've got some self-driving car stuff
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:25,248	| IOT089 |	I'm out of breath already
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:28,320	| IOT089 |	Me too I didn't even say anything
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:29,600	| IOT089 |	I know just listening
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:30,624	| IOT089 |	Nexen tires
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:35,232	| IOT089 |	So before we get into all that let's take a word from our sponsor this week
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:41,632	| IOT089 |	Our sponsor this week is skybell have you ever wondered who's at your front door when you're at work or what
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:48,032	| IOT089 |	What a package arrives or when your kids get home the skybell video doorbell lets you see who's at your door
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:54,432	| IOT089 |	Or from your smartphone replaces your current doorbell and when a visitor presses the button that sends an alert with live
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:02:00,832	| IOT089 |	Video so you can see hear and speak to the person at your door I love this doorbell I review doorbells for the
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:07,232	| IOT089 |	The Wirecutter and I will say skybell HD was my top pick and because I love
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:13,632	| IOT089 |	Love all of you guys so much and because the CEO skybell loves you we're giving iot podcast blisters
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:18,240	| IOT089 |	Discount you get $50 off using the code Stacy
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:24,640	| IOT089 |	This code is good through Christmas day so by now or don't but I think you should by now if
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:26,944	| IOT089 |	Looking for a video doorbell cuz it is great
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:27,712	| IOT089 |	Now
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:29,248	| IOT089 |	Back
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:30,016	| IOT089 |	2 hour show
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:36,928	| IOT089 |	Where Do We Begin actually we should probably Begin by me saying that I do work for Google as a consultant
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:43,840	| IOT089 |	And I have nothing to do with their IRT efforts and the only mention that because we're going to be talking a lot about the Rio 2 efforts
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:45,888	| IOT089 |	Yes let's just get started with Google
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,424	| IOT089 |	Because
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:50,240	| IOT089 |	By golly they did two pieces of news so
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:53,056	| IOT089 |	We talked about it a little bit last week with
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,104	| IOT089 |	Google opening up its SDK
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,128	| IOT089 |	4
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,920	| IOT089 |	Axel home
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:03,552	| IOT089 |	Is what it's called to the program's actions on Google and it allows you to
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,600	| IOT089 |	Build stuff for Google home
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:09,440	| IOT089 |	You're kind of like the skills for the echo
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:12,000	| IOT089 |	But a little bit different
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:16,352	| IOT089 |	So in this is worth noting so would you build
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:18,912	| IOT089 |	We're going to have to come up with some terminology
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:21,216	| IOT089 |	Hero it's remember how we had to do scene 2
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:22,240	| IOT089 |	Recipes at bows at all
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:25,568	| IOT089 |	So guys skills are for the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:26,848	| IOT089 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:28,896	| IOT089 |	And Google calls them
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,944	| IOT089 |	Actions actions
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:33,504	| IOT089 |	It's okay because I think
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:38,880	| IOT089 |	If I read correctly it's actions and conversations are the two things you can do in a conversation somewhere like
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:41,440	| IOT089 |	Informational chatbots that you can add to
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:42,720	| IOT089 |	The Google Assistant
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:45,792	| IOT089 |	But actions are yes very much like skills
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:52,192	| IOT089 |	So when you do the conversations what happens is you enable this conversation and then and entirely
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:54,496	| IOT089 |	Play new entity pops up in your Google home
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:56,032	| IOT089 |	So it no longer sounds like
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,080	| IOT089 |	Google home voice it is now
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,360	| IOT089 |	Whatever voice
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:01,408	| IOT089 |	Conversation company has chosen
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,456	| IOT089 |	Kind of interesting
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:06,016	| IOT089 |	So if you're talking to WebMD you make it
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,296	| IOT089 |	Eye Doctor Li voice
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,856	| IOT089 |	What a doctor referral
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,392	| IOT089 |	I like I bet it'll be male
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:16,000	| IOT089 |	Pyruvates I write prescriptions very sloppily how can I help you today
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,351	| IOT089 |	12 what the brand thinks is it
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:23,679	| IOT089 |	So that'll be interesting and then the actions
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:26,751	| IOT089 |	No here's a question and I don't know if
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:29,055	| IOT089 |	I could not parse this together so
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:33,407	| IOT089 |	We're going to link to the other big news which actually happened on Tuesday
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:36,479	| IOT089 |	This week which was Google announced
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,295	| IOT089 |	That they changed their Brillo
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:41,599	| IOT089 |	Tiny device OS that is not actually that
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:42,879	| IOT089 |	2
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:46,719	| IOT089 |	Google things is now it's called and it's out of developer preview
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:49,023	| IOT089 |	And they also announced
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,047	| IOT089 |	Weave is avail
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:54,399	| IOT089 |	And we've is their kind of operating system
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,167	| IOT089 |	I guess it's how we should
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:59,007	| IOT089 |	I would say Android things is the operating system
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:02,591	| IOT089 |	You're right and rude things is the operating system and its 4
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:06,687	| IOT089 |	You know it's actually not for sensors that's for slightly bigger things
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,479	| IOT089 |	Communication
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:15,903	| IOT089 |	Right right there that's the one that tells what devices what devices can do what I think my guess it's ask
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:19,743	| IOT089 |	Schema I think Google is technically calling them
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:22,047	| IOT089 |	Oh shoot I forget what it's called now
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:23,583	| IOT089 |	They used to call it a
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,143	| IOT089 |	It's yet
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,167	| IOT089 |	Traits
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,959	| IOT089 |	Traits sound like
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:30,239	| IOT089 |	If you have a lightbulb
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,775	| IOT089 |	The trade can be
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,543	| IOT089 |	On off
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,079	| IOT089 |	Right right song
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:40,479	| IOT089 |	Sprite out of power switch component of a dimmer component the trait for dimmer will be brightness and so on so it's
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:44,831	| IOT089 |	More of explaining what device is telling each other what they can do
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:48,159	| IOT089 |	So this is going to compete directly with iotivity
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:53,279	| IOT089 |	Because that is also device Discovery Communications now they
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:53,791	| IOT089 |	They call it a protocol
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:54,815	| IOT089 |	But
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:06:00,191	| IOT089 |	Whatever it it also gives the the characteristics are the traits of a device
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:03,007	| IOT089 |	Much like all joined it now alljoy did come in
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:05,567	| IOT089 |	And converge with iotivity
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:06,079	| IOT089 |	So
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:07,871	| IOT089 |	That's
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,383	| IOT089 |	That
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,967	| IOT089 |	When we talk about weave that's who you should
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,479	| IOT089 |	Compare it to
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:16,063	| IOT089 |	And there's also Nest weave
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:17,855	| IOT089 |	So is part of the Google
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:24,767	| IOT089 |	And we talked about that before and we wondered why are there two weaves in in Google and
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:28,607	| IOT089 |	But I'd say that you said
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,423	| IOT089 |	What's going to happen is
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:33,215	| IOT089 |	Google's weave and Nest weave
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:37,055	| IOT089 |	Will converge and there will be more information about that
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:40,895	| IOT089 |	Coming out in 2017 according to a Google spokesperson
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:45,503	| IOT089 |	So that's good news that is good news so that means basically
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,271	| IOT089 |	With
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:48,319	| IOT089 |	All of this iot news
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:50,111	| IOT089 |	Things that are using weave
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:54,207	| IOT089 |	Will speak to the Google ecosystem including Google
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:54,719	| IOT089 |	Home
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,255	| IOT089 |	And they
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:07:01,119	| IOT089 |	Google assistant on the pixel phones yes so now you can control your nest on the
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:02,399	| IOT089 |	Actually
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:06,751	| IOT089 |	Good but the other implications of this are
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:11,103	| IOT089 |	That there are a couple of devices that Google said already
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:11,871	| IOT089 |	Support
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:15,967	| IOT089 |	We are already using weave and those devices include products from Honeywell
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,247	| IOT089 |	Wink
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,527	| IOT089 |	Tp-link
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,551	| IOT089 |	And falcon
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:21,343	| IOT089 |	Which is why
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:23,903	| IOT089 |	We also heard on Tuesday that WeMo
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:25,183	| IOT089 |	Is going to work with Google home
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,975	| IOT089 |	So
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:27,999	| IOT089 |	Your
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:28,767	| IOT089 |	That's
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,559	| IOT089 |	Well I'll let you do the butt first
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:32,351	| IOT089 |	But it's not available yet
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,631	| IOT089 |	Is coming soon
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:34,655	| IOT089 |	Yeah but that's okay
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,679	| IOT089 |	Oh I will
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:38,239	| IOT089 |	Reboot your butt with a that's okay because
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:42,591	| IOT089 |	Again I still have not yet bought a Google home is like I bought a Ford
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:45,151	| IOT089 |	Echo have an another. I got two weeks ago
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:51,807	| IOT089 |	Again it's all. What devices these things work with what Partners they have who's supporting what and
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:55,647	| IOT089 |	It's been a little light on the Google home side until now and still is but
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:57,183	| IOT089 |	At least we got news
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:59,743	| IOT089 |	But here's what's coming and that makes me happy
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:02,303	| IOT089 |	And yes and I got confirmation from wink
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,839	| IOT089 |	That a wink version
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,119	| IOT089 |	Are weak support
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:05,631	| IOT089 |	Hyundai
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:06,911	| IOT089 |	Google home
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,703	| IOT089 |	Is also coming
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,727	| IOT089 |	But I don't have any PA
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:14,591	| IOT089 |	So we can probably expect the tp-link outlets those are cute
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,103	| IOT089 |	People love them
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:19,967	| IOT089 |	And Honeywell like There lyric their water sensor there
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,479	| IOT089 |	TV
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:26,623	| IOT089 |	I don't remember the I think it's the T5 thermostat that's slightly cheaper than the lyrics
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,951	| IOT089 |	Lifx bulbs First Alert
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,231	| IOT089 |	Smoke detectors as well
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,767	| IOT089 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,047	| IOT089 |	Should be
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:35,839	| IOT089 |	Coming and I will say
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,143	| IOT089 |	Kevin you didn't buy an echo
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,447	| IOT089 |	So I bought my echo December 2014
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,007	| IOT089 |	$100
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,287	| IOT089 |	We just watched something
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:44,799	| IOT089 |	If you want it
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,871	| IOT089 |	It just came out in November I remember that
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,455	| IOT089 |	USA versus I'm passing on home
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:54,783	| IOT089 |	But they didn't actually announce the Smart Home
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:57,343	| IOT089 |	Features or capabilities until March of 2015
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:59,391	| IOT089 |	That is correct also
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,415	| IOT089 |	And that's when I bought my
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,023	| IOT089 |	They took a little time
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:07,071	| IOT089 |	We're going to let we're going to give Google home the same time
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:08,863	| IOT089 |	That's fair
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,399	| IOT089 |	I give them
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:13,983	| IOT089 |	Them being Amazon more leeway here because they
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:17,567	| IOT089 |	I want to say invented the category but say they brought this
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:20,127	| IOT089 |	Type of product to the mainstream masses
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:23,711	| IOT089 |	Monica said he did it first but they brought to a wide range of people
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:25,759	| IOT089 |	First and therefore
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:30,879	| IOT089 |	I'm okay with them adding Partners overtime and obviously cuz I fought for them
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:36,255	| IOT089 |	I'm disappointed some other following competing products that did not have
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:38,303	| IOT089 |	A wide ecosystem available on day one
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,375	| IOT089 |	I agree but
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,679	| IOT089 |	Well they have apparently had to get weave all in one
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,751	| IOT089 |	That's fine
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:47,775	| IOT089 |	I don't know
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:52,383	| IOT089 |	I will say it's kind of overwhelming like if you imagine these things launching
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:52,895	| IOT089 |	With everything
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:55,455	| IOT089 |	It would be too much like people be like
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:04,671	| IOT089 |	I think it first if you were the first one to do that yes but now that they're
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:07,231	| IOT089 |	You know you can go to Home Depot or Lowe's whatever
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:10,559	| IOT089 |	And by connected light bulbs or a hub or whatever
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,095	| IOT089 |	I think it
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:18,495	| IOT089 |	Canopy who's these products work with all of them that are readily available out of the gate at this point in time
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:21,311	| IOT089 |	Not so much in 2014 when vehicle came out I agree with you
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,591	| IOT089 |	But
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:25,151	| IOT089 |	Or maybe I'm just being too optimistic on the market and I don't know
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:26,943	| IOT089 |	You know I think
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:29,247	| IOT089 |	So
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,271	| IOT089 |	Back to Android.
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:35,391	| IOT089 |	No it's worth delving into a lot because I see
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:39,743	| IOT089 |	Three different hardwood products you can use with it and I have one of them so I can't wait
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:40,511	| IOT089 |	So yes
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,535	| IOT089 |	It's going to suck
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:42,303	| IOT089 |	Support
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,327	| IOT089 |	You can start building with
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,119	| IOT089 |	The Intel Edison
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,143	| IOT089 |	Tnxp
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:46,911	| IOT089 |	Tipico
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,959	| IOT089 |	Raspberry Pi 3
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,311	| IOT089 |	Now there was
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:56,639	| IOT089 |	There was I saw on the Google developer Google Plus page
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:57,919	| IOT089 |	Which
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,711	| IOT089 |	Why not go there
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:03,295	| IOT089 |	Someone asking about Arduino and the response was that that just didn't
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:04,831	| IOT089 |	It wasn't a robust and
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:05,343	| IOT089 |	Platform
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:11,487	| IOT089 |	And I know if you guys remember but back when Android things was Brillo it required I think 64
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,255	| IOT089 |	64
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:15,583	| IOT089 |	Was it megabytes it was megabytes of memory to run
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:17,631	| IOT089 |	Which is a lie
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,423	| IOT089 |	So
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,727	| IOT089 |	It's possible that Arduino is just
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,031	| IOT089 |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:27,103	| IOT089 |	The other thing to know and this is something that I had heard about
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,895	| IOT089 |	Confirmed with Google
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:31,455	| IOT089 |	Is that if you want to use Wii
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:37,343	| IOT089 |	You're going to have to use Google's Cloud which means you're going to need an account and you're going to have to use the weave
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,695	| IOT089 |	Can we server components
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:46,815	| IOT089 |	Security saying and a control so like when they roll out
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,583	| IOT089 |	New traits
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,095	| IOT089 |	Isn't that sort of thing
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:50,911	| IOT089 |	That's also that all goes through one
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:51,423	| IOT089 |	Fun places
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:52,703	| IOT089 |	Taylor & Son
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:53,727	| IOT089 |	Location of Android
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,263	| IOT089 |	I see the
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,031	| IOT089 |	Wisdom
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:57,823	| IOT089 |	Making that
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,847	| IOT089 |	Decision
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:02,687	| IOT089 |	But I can also see people being upset saying what what if I want to use somebody else's cloud
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,783	| IOT089 |	I'm sure there will be some grumbles
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:08,063	| IOT089 |	You're going to have to be by 4
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,855	| IOT089 |	But later on after
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,135	| IOT089 |	Later in the show will talk about
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:17,791	| IOT089 |	Let's see what else do we need to know about the
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:18,815	| IOT089 |	List Aquino
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,327	| IOT089 |	So far
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:22,911	| IOT089 |	I don't know that we know much more
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:25,727	| IOT089 |	America's Best
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,495	| IOT089 |	From Google that's not Kev
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:30,335	| IOT089 |	Actually, that knows what they're talking about
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:34,687	| IOT089 |	Yeah so we don't I don't mean this was just an end developer announcement
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:40,063	| IOT089 |	Developer should say not any consumer announcement or anything to that
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,087	| IOT089 |	Extensive
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,391	| IOT089 |	I don't know that there's much more we know yet
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:47,999	| IOT089 |	In addition to this news we should also talk about Microsoft
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:48,511	| IOT089 |	Which
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:52,351	| IOT089 |	What no
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:55,167	| IOT089 |	Got an SDK that
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,703	| IOT089 |	Also on Thursday
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:57,983	| IOT089 |	Which
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:00,031	| IOT089 |	I think it's actually worth bringing up
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:00,799	| IOT089 |	Because
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:03,871	| IOT089 |	We're all waiting for like what's going to happen with
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:06,175	| IOT089 |	Microsoft in their iot home play
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:10,015	| IOT089 |	And what it looks like is the Cortana SDK
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:11,039	| IOT089 |	Is going to be
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:12,831	| IOT089 |	That
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,343	| IOT089 |	It's answer
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:20,255	| IOT089 |	Which is you can put Cortana on any device much like Amazon let's they have I'm going to say her name every
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,559	| IOT089 |	Alexa voice services
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,863	| IOT089 |	And you can put that on
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,631	| IOT089 |	Any number to buy
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:32,287	| IOT089 |	What is Microsoft's early Cortana s2k Partners is going to be Harman Kardon
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:36,639	| IOT089 |	The premium audio manufacturer which incidentally was bought by Samsung
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:40,223	| IOT089 |	Which is really odd which feels really
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:43,295	| IOT089 |	Yeah not that Samsung. Harmon but that
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:47,391	| IOT089 |	Samsung has their own iot play here and yet there
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:51,743	| IOT089 |	An early device partner with Microsoft to and showing off a
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:54,559	| IOT089 |	Audio speaker that you speak to
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:55,583	| IOT089 |	Cortana
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:58,655	| IOT089 |	Just like you would with an echo it's kind of strange
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,727	| IOT089 |	And so I would be curious given
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:04,543	| IOT089 |	Not necessarily.
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,311	| IOT089 |	Given
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:08,383	| IOT089 |	The SDK is now that are out
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,151	| IOT089 |	And the
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,943	| IOT089 |	It supposed to go home
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:11,455	| IOT089 |	So thick
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,991	| IOT089 |	No actions
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,783	| IOT089 |	We got the echo
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:15,807	| IOT089 |	STK
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:17,343	| IOT089 |	And we got
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:18,879	| IOT089 |	Cortana SDK
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:23,487	| IOT089 |	What is Cortana and Cortana skills kit
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:26,815	| IOT089 |	Cortana skills kit so you can build skills which thank you
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:31,935	| IOT089 |	Cortana for keeping with the skills nomenclature so I don't have to stretch my brain anymore during this show
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:35,519	| IOT089 |	What do we think about all this what are people going to use
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:37,311	| IOT089 |	Who are we going to talk to Kevin
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:40,895	| IOT089 |	Book
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:41,919	| IOT089 |	We're going to talk
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,967	| IOT089 |	Hopefully in the future it won't matter
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:44,991	| IOT089 |	Is my hope
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:48,319	| IOT089 |	I remember one of the first articles I wrote about
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:50,623	| IOT089 |	Voice interface is the invisible interface was
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:52,415	| IOT089 |	It will work because it's
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:59,327	| IOT089 |	Simple it's Universal anybody can use it without cortical learning interface if you know how to ask question
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:00,863	| IOT089 |	Speaker command
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,911	| IOT089 |	You can use this interface
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:04,703	| IOT089 |	Your question though is
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:06,239	| IOT089 |	What about
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:08,031	| IOT089 |	Multiple interfaces in a sentence
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,847	| IOT089 |	How do we manage that
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:14,431	| IOT089 |	This is some strange coming from me but I think
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:16,223	| IOT089 |	Microsoft is actually
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:19,295	| IOT089 |	Best suited for this challenge because
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,831	| IOT089 |	Cortana works on
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,855	| IOT089 |	Windows
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:25,695	| IOT089 |	On Android on iOS it works on my Xbox
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:28,255	| IOT089 |	And then they're going to have these additional devices
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:30,559	| IOT089 |	Hopefully through partners with their SDK
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,607	| IOT089 |	Souffrant terms of
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:34,143	| IOT089 |	Of Brett's of that
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:35,679	| IOT089 |	Invisible interface
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:37,727	| IOT089 |	He might
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,751	| IOT089 |	Beheaded the curfew
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:41,311	| IOT089 |	And they also downstairs
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:45,407	| IOT089 |	Microsoft translator using their AI skills cuz
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,943	| IOT089 |	Microsoft AI
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,479	| IOT089 |	Backend in
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:51,295	| IOT089 |	Speech-to-text in language
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:53,343	| IOT089 |	NLP
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,879	| IOT089 |	Language recognition all of that stuff
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,415	| IOT089 |	Is
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:57,695	| IOT089 |	Freaking
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:59,999	| IOT089 |	Amazing I mean Google has really good stuff
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:03,583	| IOT089 |	But Microsoft on Tuesday also announced real time
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,375	| IOT089 |	Translation
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:09,471	| IOT089 |	Like between groups of people speaking multiple languages
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:10,239	| IOT089 |	Is in person
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:13,311	| IOT089 |	That is insane
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,591	| IOT089 |	That's impressive I mean
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:15,871	| IOT089 |	That's really
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:16,895	| IOT089 |	Amazing
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:17,919	| IOT089 |	So
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,735	| IOT089 |	You may be right
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:24,063	| IOT089 |	Especially if we think about being able to talk and speak to something
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,087	| IOT089 |	Natural
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:26,623	| IOT089 |	Now
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:29,183	| IOT089 |	Let's throw a curveball in here
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:29,951	| IOT089 |	Because
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,231	| IOT089 |	Amazon
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:38,143	| IOT089 |	It was actually at reinvent at the end of November and then they also this week had a pulled it all together in this Nifty little
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,167	| IOT089 |	Blanco
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:44,287	| IOT089 |	Amazon is actually really trying hard to offer an AI product
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,591	| IOT089 |	For Developers
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:47,359	| IOT089 |	That
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:49,151	| IOT089 |	Capri train models basically
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:54,527	| IOT089 |	So you can do both custom algorithms and custom models but they also have
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:57,087	| IOT089 |	Pre tuned stuff for developer
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:58,879	| IOT089 |	And that's all going to be through there
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:16:59,903	| IOT089 |	Cloud
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:05,535	| IOT089 |	So now they have these Amazon AI models that you can run on top of Amazon's machine learning
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,583	| IOT089 |	If you guys are like
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,119	| IOT089 |	Head exploded
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,655	| IOT089 |	Just be aware that
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,215	| IOT089 |	Basically
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:15,775	| IOT089 |	Is giving developers the ability to use the developer state
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:18,079	| IOT089 |	With Amazon's AI
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,871	| IOT089 |	Algorithms
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,895	| IOT089 |	So you can basically
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:26,271	| IOT089 |	Use your stuff to build new smarter things and you don't have to develop all the AI that like
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,855	| IOT089 |	Yeah it seems like the race is on
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,135	| IOT089 |	Or maybe
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,023	| IOT089 |	Come out everybody
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:42,143	| IOT089 |	Everybody wanted to provide a cloud service okay we do that everybody wants to
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:44,959	| IOT089 |	Provide us the case for that cloud okay we all do that now
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:45,983	| IOT089 |	Now everyone's
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,263	| IOT089 |	Provide an AI
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:49,567	| IOT089 |	For people to use so
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:55,967	| IOT089 |	As you were saying Amazon that I see three different things with your kind of interesting just to break it down a little further they got Amazon
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:57,759	| IOT089 |	Text for natural language processing
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:00,319	| IOT089 |	Forgot Amazon poly which is at X
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:02,623	| IOT089 |	Text to speech service and Amazon rekognition which is
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,903	| IOT089 |	And image service
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,183	| IOT089 |	Open the cloud
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:07,743	| IOT089 |	So they're providing all that to developer switch
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:08,511	| IOT089 |	Again a lot of
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:12,351	| IOT089 |	Others do that Google does that Microsoft does that as well so
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:16,191	| IOT089 |	So maybe the race is on is probably the wrong way to say at the races hopefully
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,983	| IOT089 |	Heating up
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:20,799	| IOT089 |	Dot-dot-dot and who is the beneficiary
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,823	| IOT089 |	We are
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:25,151	| IOT089 |	I'm going to play this for you I don't see if I don't know if this is going to work
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,431	| IOT089 |	Let's see if
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:28,991	| IOT089 |	You can hear it but this is Amazon Polly reading quotes
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,271	| IOT089 |	Sufficient
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:32,831	| IOT089 |	Technology is indistinguishable
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,647	| IOT089 |	That was Amazon Polly
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:36,927	| IOT089 |	Just reading
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:39,743	| IOT089 |	So
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:41,279	| IOT089 |	And she's really good in British
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:42,815	| IOT089 |	I guess that's piss
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:43,839	| IOT089 |	Right
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,375	| IOT089 |	Why not
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:48,959	| IOT089 |	Exit
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:50,239	| IOT089 |	Okay
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,007	| IOT089 |	So
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,287	| IOT089 |	That's a lot going on
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:55,103	| IOT089 |	Everybody's got their components
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:59,199	| IOT089 |	If I were to judge today I would say Microsoft is probably the most
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,991	| IOT089 |	Advanced in terms of
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:05,855	| IOT089 |	Speaking back to people and maybe understanding followed by Google maybe they're neck-and-neck
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:09,695	| IOT089 |	Amazon has the biggest ecosystem right now
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:11,999	| IOT089 |	And with their AI stuff there
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,535	| IOT089 |	Place to keep that ecosystem
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:15,327	| IOT089 |	Google
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,631	| IOT089 |	Has the best
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:22,495	| IOT089 |	I can't answer that question.
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:26,591	| IOT089 |	I'm like Google who has the best employees
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:29,151	| IOT089 |	Google probably has the best lake
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:30,943	| IOT089 |	Google knows what I'm talking about
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:31,967	| IOT089 |	When I ask it a question
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:35,807	| IOT089 |	So
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:36,575	| IOT089 |	We'll see
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:38,879	| IOT089 |	This is big you guys so
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:42,207	| IOT089 |	I'm really excited 2017 is shaping up to be really cool
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:45,023	| IOT089 |	Alright let's take a quick a break
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:49,887	| IOT089 |	And then we're going to come back with more
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:56,287	| IOT089 |	Hey everyone we are taking a break in The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is say
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:59,871	| IOT089 |	Samsung Arctic cloud and we have Janine
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:04,991	| IOT089 |	Who is head of developer evangelism for Samsung Arctic Cloud to tell us
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:07,039	| IOT089 |	Samsung artik what is Janine
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:13,439	| IOT089 |	Simple Arctic cloud is an open data exchange platform for the internet of things that provide easy-to-use opening
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:19,071	| IOT089 |	Tools to collect store and Eric on any data from any connected device your cloud service
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,607	| IOT089 |	Transformers
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:23,167	| IOT089 |	To accelerate device interoperability
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:24,703	| IOT089 |	Enable nudata inside
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:26,751	| IOT089 |	And why is interoperability sew in
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:31,359	| IOT089 |	Predicts will be over 20 billion connected devices by 2000
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:33,151	| IOT089 |	All of these things
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:34,175	| IOT089 |	We're not meant to work together
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:38,527	| IOT089 |	You know all in your own to be successful
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:40,063	| IOT089 |	Interoperability is critical
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:44,159	| IOT089 |	There was a study done that is shown that interoperability is required
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:48,255	| IOT089 |	For 40% on average to 60% and some settings
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:54,399	| IOT089 |	Artix headphones the problem of breaking down those silos by allowing for the true interoperability
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,679	| IOT089 |	Between devices in service
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:02,591	| IOT089 |	That sounds like a really powerful platform
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:05,151	| IOT089 |	What are developers doing with it
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:08,479	| IOT089 |	Incredible with developers are doing using or
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:10,015	| IOT089 |	Arctic hotspot formed
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:13,855	| IOT089 |	Recently added houses on where they filled out an industrial iot
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:14,623	| IOT089 |	Solutions
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:15,647	| IOT089 |	Service iot
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:17,952	| IOT089 |	So they used to check
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:20,256	| IOT089 |	To Monitor and troubleshoot the machine
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,048	| IOT089 |	Enter data Within
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:25,888	| IOT089 |	To Arctic Cloud which stores the data for clearing data from the chatbot
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:29,984	| IOT089 |	Issue with machine such as a high temperature reading
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:33,824	| IOT089 |	An article was created to send a notification
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:35,872	| IOT089 |	To the chat bot to communicate
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,920	| IOT089 |	With the operator said something went wrong
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:44,320	| IOT089 |	We also had somebody build a smart City solution which optimizes waste collection and reduces fuel consumption
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:44,832	| IOT089 |	Garbage trucks
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:48,672	| IOT089 |	The sensors are installed in the lead of the garbage container
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:52,768	| IOT089 |	Measure the temperature of the container and the dumpster is full
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:56,352	| IOT089 |	Isn't transmitted article
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:59,168	| IOT089 |	Waste Management Company
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:02,240	| IOT089 |	It's really easy for developers to build an increase in the rate of solution
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:07,104	| IOT089 |	Behind the complexity of iot development
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,384	| IOT089 |	And provide simplicity
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:13,504	| IOT089 |	We provide apis for everything in order to simplify that whole process
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:18,624	| IOT089 |	We have 10 ft kzzu schools in great sample code
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,904	| IOT089 |	Help you get started
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,184	| IOT089 |	And your development efforts

EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:50,368	| IOT089 |	Disconnect low energy object will be doing a demo with crafty I as well as big box
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:56,768	| IOT089 |	Alright we are back and it
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:23:00,864	| IOT089 |	Instead of a guest we are still here both Stacy and
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:01,632	| IOT089 |	Kevin
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:03,168	| IOT089 |	Talking about
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:05,472	| IOT089 |	News we did a big deep dive on
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:07,776	| IOT089 |	Holy cow all the new
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:10,336	| IOT089 |	A iCloud personal assistant
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:12,128	| IOT089 |	Talkin things
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:15,456	| IOT089 |	We should probably come up with a better name for them
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:20,064	| IOT089 |	And now we're going to get into some of the week's news that that we haven't covered yet
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:23,392	| IOT089 |	Such as well just get started with some new products out there in the market
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:26,464	| IOT089 |	Cassia networks has created a
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,744	| IOT089 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:28,512	| IOT089 |	Home
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:29,024	| IOT089 |	Hub
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,328	| IOT089 |	And you guys are like
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:32,864	| IOT089 |	Who cares
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:36,704	| IOT089 |	But know this is great because Bluetooth mesh is not great
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:40,288	| IOT089 |	In this Hub actually makes your Bluetooth
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,056	| IOT089 |	Go further
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,104	| IOT089 |	And supports a lot of
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:46,432	| IOT089 |	So this is good for both home
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:50,784	| IOT089 |	And a lot of people in the industrial world are trying to use Bluetooth to actually because it's already
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,856	| IOT089 |	History of Aquarius
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:55,904	| IOT089 |	Yeah and the short actually the short range of Bluetooth
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:59,232	| IOT089 |	Advantage for them because it's a little bit more secure
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:01,792	| IOT089 |	Like within the factory there like
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:03,584	| IOT089 |	What I like about this and not enough
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:04,864	| IOT089 |	Typical it big
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:07,168	| IOT089 |	I don't say Phantom Bluetooth is I love Bluetooth
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:08,704	| IOT089 |	Very specific things
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:11,008	| IOT089 |	I would not think of it any router but
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:14,080	| IOT089 |	What I like about this and even though you can do this on Wi-Fi
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:16,384	| IOT089 |	I like Bluetooth for presents
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:20,992	| IOT089 |	Not not like Christmas presents but where I am present
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:22,528	| IOT089 |	You don't want blue
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,856	| IOT089 |	That would be cool to the best of both worlds
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:28,928	| IOT089 |	I also like this because right now
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:30,208	| IOT089 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:35,584	| IOT089 |	Things like light switches are sensors it just doesn't make a lot of sense because it just doesn't have the
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,096	| IOT089 |	The range
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:38,400	| IOT089 |	I have in this is going to make this
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:44,544	| IOT089 |	Possible and it should hopefully it will be Bluetooth 5 compatible since they're just lunch again and
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:47,104	| IOT089 |	Bluetooth 5 specs
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:49,664	| IOT089 |	Out so I look forward to seeing this in the real world
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:52,224	| IOT089 |	This is actually an Enterprise version
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:55,296	| IOT089 |	And some of them support power over ethernet
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,696	| IOT089 |	Plug it in have connectivity
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:08,608	| IOT089 |	And you don't actually have to have the cloud Kasia SDK is both on the cloud is and on the rug
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,656	| IOT089 |	Router so yeah you can keep
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:12,704	| IOT089 |	Local
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:13,216	| IOT089 |	Local
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:14,240	| IOT089 |	Disconnect
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:15,776	| IOT089 |	AKA
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:21,152	| IOT089 |	Look all right so I think this is actually really cool product worthwhile
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:24,992	| IOT089 |	The other news in this is big because we didn't talk about her
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,040	| IOT089 |	Siri and app
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:32,928	| IOT089 |	The news here is that fibaro which is a maker of really awesome Z-Wave sensors
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:35,488	| IOT089 |	They're making homekit sensors
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,512	| IOT089 |	And
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:40,608	| IOT089 |	This is significant for two reasons one is for borrow is a Z-Wave hub
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:44,192	| IOT089 |	Company so this is the first time they've gone out of Z-Wave
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:44,704	| IOT089 |	What
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:47,008	| IOT089 |	And these are bushes her
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:47,520	| IOT089 |	Yeah
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:48,800	| IOT089 |	Pair Bluetooth
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:53,152	| IOT089 |	The other is that this is going to give some sensors to homekit
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:53,664	| IOT089 |	Which
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:54,944	| IOT089 |	Has been kind of
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,736	| IOT089 |	Left sensor
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:26:00,320	| IOT089 |	Focused I guess
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:04,672	| IOT089 |	So fibaro is going to launch a flood sensor
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:10,304	| IOT089 |	For $70 a motion sensor for $70 and a door window sensor for $60
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,352	| IOT089 |	They're going to start selling
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:13,888	| IOT089 |	Natsumi
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:15,680	| IOT089 |	So
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:16,960	| IOT089 |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:18,752	| IOT089 |	Yeah that's good
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:25,664	| IOT089 |	And I'm going to get some you guys cuz I don't know
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:29,248	| IOT089 |	Come in my house I'm building at home kit ecosystem I've got the Elgato sensors
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,296	| IOT089 |	Eve sensors in their
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,088	| IOT089 |	Which also Bluetooth
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,136	| IOT089 |	And some
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,416	| IOT089 |	Lights
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,976	| IOT089 |	Some homekit lights
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:39,744	| IOT089 |	Philips Hue
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,536	| IOT089 |	Device
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:43,328	| IOT089 |	Idevices smart plug
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:44,608	| IOT089 |	And then I have some
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,144	| IOT089 |	Lutron
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:48,192	| IOT089 |	Ellucian hub
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:49,472	| IOT089 |	Switch mileage
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,544	| IOT089 |	If you guys are thinking of doing this
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:54,080	| IOT089 |	Know this
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:56,384	| IOT089 |	Are your Lutron stuff it only works on
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,920	| IOT089 |	One system
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:58,688	| IOT089 |	Or it like
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:01,248	| IOT089 |	One thing or the other so I'm going to break my Lutron lights for
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:03,296	| IOT089 |	In my husband going to
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,088	| IOT089 |	See that's gay
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:11,232	| IOT089 |	Shrugging right now
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:16,608	| IOT089 |	Actually yes it be as if it's not over wife over by so if it's a Directv billing
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:18,144	| IOT089 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:20,704	| IOT089 |	Or Lutron those only connect to One Network
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,216	| IOT089 |	At a time
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:22,496	| IOT089 |	So
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:26,336	| IOT089 |	For the Lutron what I'm going to do is I'm going to have to run it to the Lutron hub
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:29,664	| IOT089 |	Which then I can use the Lutron app on my
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:31,712	| IOT089 |	Android devices
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:33,504	| IOT089 |	Just still control them
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:34,272	| IOT089 |	But I can't type
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:37,856	| IOT089 |	Since
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:40,416	| IOT089 |	Might my husband
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:43,488	| IOT089 |	You know
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,512	| IOT089 |	His life is already missed
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:48,608	| IOT089 |	So okay so that's that we should talk about sleepy
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:51,168	| IOT089 |	You know why cuz we got like two other pieces
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:53,216	| IOT089 |	Yeah Evergreen thread
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:56,544	| IOT089 |	Zigbee running over the thread protocol
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:58,592	| IOT089 |	Holy cow guys
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:00,896	| IOT089 |	ZTE running over the thread protocol is
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:04,992	| IOT089 |	Real so now Icees they're going to show this off that this is work
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:06,784	| IOT089 |	And for you guys for like
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:09,344	| IOT089 |	Oh my God Stacy you're breaking my brain
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:13,952	| IOT089 |	Protocol is a wireless is a mesh Wireless protocol
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:18,048	| IOT089 |	Much like zigbee and Z-Wave are mesh Wireless protocols
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:18,816	| IOT089 |	Like those
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:22,656	| IOT089 |	Thread has low and doesn't use a lot of energy
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:24,448	| IOT089 |	Unlike those
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:27,264	| IOT089 |	It is IPv6 compatible so it
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:28,800	| IOT089 |	Can go directly out to record
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:33,152	| IOT089 |	The differences when you're thinking of thread
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:34,688	| IOT089 |	Throw it down at
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,224	| IOT089 |	Zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:39,296	| IOT089 |	Once Bluetooth has its mesh network will throw Bluetooth mesh in there just
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:41,088	| IOT089 |	But now
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:42,624	| IOT089 |	With zigbee running over 3
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,440	| IOT089 |	That means you get the zigbee
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,720	| IOT089 |	Software stack
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:52,608	| IOT089 |	Over the thread protocol in the zigbee software stack has a lot of stuff for lights that's really powerful
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,912	| IOT089 |	For managing huge lighting net
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:55,680	| IOT089 |	Works or big lady
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:58,496	| IOT089 |	So that's that's why that
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:28:59,520	| IOT089 |	Hatteras Sol
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:02,592	| IOT089 |	Probably good for a Industrial
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:08,736	| IOT089 |	An Enterprise has announced that they're going into the Enterprise a couple weeks ago so
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:13,856	| IOT089 |	It also means that anything that supports the red so
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:15,904	| IOT089 |	I kind of think that Google
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:18,464	| IOT089 |	Is going to be a big supporter of thread since it came out of nest
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:19,744	| IOT089 |	And in fact
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:21,280	| IOT089 |	There is a
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:23,072	| IOT089 |	CB radio with a Google WiFi
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:25,888	| IOT089 |	So
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,936	| IOT089 |	I imagine we're going to see
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:31,264	| IOT089 |	Zippy ever thread coming from your Google Wi-Fi routers at some point
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:34,336	| IOT089 |	I Can Only Imagine
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:36,640	| IOT089 |	Can I say otherwise cuz I don't know
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:38,688	| IOT089 |	But I did get my Wi-Fi
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:40,736	| IOT089 |	Something I'm actually using right now
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:41,248	| IOT089 |	We're going to talk about
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:43,808	| IOT089 |	Stay tuned
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:44,576	| IOT089 |	You guys
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:45,344	| IOT089 |	Cool
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:48,928	| IOT089 |	What other things do we have
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:52,768	| IOT089 |	There's lots going on all of a sudden so
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:55,840	| IOT089 |	Google self-driving car efforts
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:30:00,448	| IOT089 |	Which were part of I guess part of the X lab X division
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:05,056	| IOT089 |	Are now a separate company under alphabet called waymo
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:06,336	| IOT089 |	I guess so
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:09,664	| IOT089 |	W what's the next letter to be used in alphabet so
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:11,200	| IOT089 |	Waymo is its own
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,992	| IOT089 |	Company under alphabet
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:15,296	| IOT089 |	And
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:17,856	| IOT089 |	Google is partnering with I want to say
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,392	| IOT089 |	Chrysler Fiat
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:22,464	| IOT089 |	For yeah yeah so
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:26,560	| IOT089 |	This is probably a CES event I suspect we'll see some
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:28,864	| IOT089 |	Demonstrations of self-driving
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:30,144	| IOT089 |	Minivans
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:31,936	| IOT089 |	Are pacifica's I can't recall which
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:34,752	| IOT089 |	Ephraim Chrysler that will use the Google tech
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,544	| IOT089 |	And
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:43,456	| IOT089 |	Yes it's interesting because a lot of people recently were saying Google shutting down and self-driving car business not like really
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:46,016	| IOT089 |	I wouldn't know cuz I don't I got not on that team
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:47,040	| IOT089 |	But then
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:49,856	| IOT089 |	No they're not shut down their spinning off to its own company
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:51,648	| IOT089 |	Yes
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:53,696	| IOT089 |	And then Uber
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:56,256	| IOT089 |	Is like
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:57,536	| IOT089 |	What up
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,888	| IOT089 |	Yasso
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:07,520	| IOT089 |	I'm very curious what Uber drivers think of this but I'm sure Uber Riders
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:08,288	| IOT089 |	Will be
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:08,800	| IOT089 |	Intrigued
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:11,872	| IOT089 |	The first self-driving Ubers are
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:13,920	| IOT089 |	Alive and well in San Francisco
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:15,968	| IOT089 |	So this is a very limited
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:18,272	| IOT089 |	Market but yes so it's starting
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:21,856	| IOT089 |	Well today that they were recording a show witches Wednesday
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:25,952	| IOT089 |	You can get a self-driving Uber even matches one if one is available
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:29,024	| IOT089 |	Trying to figure out did they say that it said how many
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:31,840	| IOT089 |	There are how many Ubers but
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:36,704	| IOT089 |	As far as I know
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:38,240	| IOT089 |	I would hope so
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:44,640	| IOT089 |	That would be a problem if something happened you don't say don't say
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:47,712	| IOT089 |	It's a they're spending their self-driving pilot
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:53,344	| IOT089 |	Williston
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:56,160	| IOT089 |	Depend on Santana local
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:58,208	| IOT089 |	Ordinances and such but
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:03,328	| IOT089 |	Yeah they really don't say anything I'm looking at their blog post right now
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,352	| IOT089 |	There is
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:04,864	| IOT089 |	There is one
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,424	| IOT089 |	So maybe Uber drivers won't care
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:10,752	| IOT089 |	They have less to do
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:11,776	| IOT089 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,104	| IOT089 |	There's going to be a driver in
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:15,872	| IOT089 |	In the car
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:17,408	| IOT089 |	Yay
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:18,944	| IOT089 |	Cuz I would be kind of nervous and
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:21,504	| IOT089 |	Now the drivers don't have to drive
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:22,272	| IOT089 |	Also
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:25,856	| IOT089 |	Yay so yeah this is this is actually happening
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:30,464	| IOT089 |	You guys and I would not want to drive any self-driving in San Francisco seems like a freaking nightmare
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:33,792	| IOT089 |	Cuz people are running in and out and there's construction everywhere
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:41,728	| IOT089 |	I highly recommend we should link to this video in our shonos because I highly recommend people watched the demonstration of the Uber cell
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:43,008	| IOT089 |	Self-driving car because
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:44,800	| IOT089 |	The poor driver
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:49,152	| IOT089 |	It's just sitting there bored as all get-out looking around out the window
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:52,480	| IOT089 |	I will link to that machete
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:33:00,672	| IOT089 |	Yes I'm an Uber car babysitter how can I help you
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:03,488	| IOT089 |	I don't have to keep your eyes on the road
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:04,256	| IOT089 |	I guess I have to be
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:05,024	| IOT089 |	Prepare to take over but
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,096	| IOT089 |	That would not be
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:12,192	| IOT089 |	Okay Industrial
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:14,240	| IOT089 |	So we got some clown news here
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:15,776	| IOT089 |	Ala which is
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:18,848	| IOT089 |	A company that provides a cloud service for
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:22,944	| IOT089 |	Any company that wants to build connected devices basically
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:27,296	| IOT089 |	It works with it's a cloud service that's authenticated and lots of chips you put the chip in your product
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:29,856	| IOT089 |	And it said that you have a cloud back in for all of your
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:30,368	| IOT089 |	Needs
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:33,184	| IOT089 |	Have announced it they are doing
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:35,488	| IOT089 |	The echo skills for people
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:37,280	| IOT089 |	So they will support it
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:38,048	| IOT089 |	They will make
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:43,680	| IOT089 |	All of your stuff you can figure your stuff and then they take those configurations and then they tune it to the echo can
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:44,704	| IOT089 |	Integrations
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:45,984	| IOT089 |	Presumably
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:48,544	| IOT089 |	Stay I did talk to them there and talks with
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:54,688	| IOT089 |	You know all the other providers so presumably they will tune your stuff to the other providers that handle the fact that
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:56,224	| IOT089 |	Google requires you to have
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:57,504	| IOT089 |	To separate
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:00,832	| IOT089 |	There is on cloud implementation so
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:02,112	| IOT089 |	This is great news both
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:05,696	| IOT089 |	For companies that are like
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:06,464	| IOT089 |	Complicated
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:09,280	| IOT089 |	It also for the companies that are
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:10,048	| IOT089 |	Like
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:14,144	| IOT089 |	Hey this world is complicated we will do all of the back in nasty stuff for you and
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:15,168	| IOT089 |	YouTube pays money
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:17,216	| IOT089 |	And so this is great
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:17,728	| IOT089 |	Plus
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:24,640	| IOT089 |	I got the ticket from the Ala guys there were like yeah we had to do this because all of our customers were like we don't want an app we need voice
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,152	| IOT089 |	Recognition
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:26,176	| IOT089 |	So
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:29,760	| IOT089 |	I feel like that's kind of a no-brainer but there's another
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:31,296	| IOT089 |	Example of
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:33,344	| IOT089 |	Voice really winning
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:36,160	| IOT089 |	When it comes to the interaction for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:37,184	| IOT089 |	We will
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:42,816	| IOT089 |	Other cloud news GE is building industrial networking gear for its
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:46,400	| IOT089 |	Iot industrial iot stuff they're using Cisco and HP gear
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:48,448	| IOT089 |	Basically building gateways
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:50,240	| IOT089 |	Randa gateways
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:52,288	| IOT089 |	Sensors that sort of stuff
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:54,080	| IOT089 |	Because you can't
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:57,152	| IOT089 |	You can't get stuff to the predix cloud if you don't give him the hardware
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:35:02,272	| IOT089 |	Kind of strange because I know that GE already works with like
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:03,552	| IOT089 |	Gateway's and stuff from
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:04,576	| IOT089 |	Like Intel Dell
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:06,368	| IOT089 |	There's a bunch of like
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:06,880	| IOT089 |	Really
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:11,232	| IOT089 |	Archaic non-computer vendor kind of Gateway providers
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:14,048	| IOT089 |	That have been in the industrial space for a while that
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:15,840	| IOT089 |	LG also works with so
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:18,656	| IOT089 |	I agree this was kind of strange when
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:22,496	| IOT089 |	When I saw it on the notes and whatnot but then I'm thinking you had the whole products that is
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:24,032	| IOT089 |	Without data
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:27,360	| IOT089 |	It's kind of useless but it needs data
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:33,760	| IOT089 |	So I think they're just trying to remove obstacles to getting at that dated from industrial machines
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:34,784	| IOT089 |	End-to-end solution that
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,320	| IOT089 |	When is right
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:39,904	| IOT089 |	Man you want to talk about Wi-Fi or
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:42,208	| IOT089 |	I feel like we should just skip ahead to Wi-Fi
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:42,976	| IOT089 |	What do you think
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:45,024	| IOT089 |	Yes that's what we talked about
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:47,840	| IOT089 |	MiFi as I said I got my Google Wi-Fi units
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:49,888	| IOT089 |	Which cost me to eat
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:52,704	| IOT089 |	129 I think under $29
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:53,984	| IOT089 |	And you already had that
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:36:01,408	| IOT089 |	I did I did have the onhub and remember when Google Wi-Fi was announced a lot of people are like my own house
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:03,456	| IOT089 |	Done if you don't know
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:07,296	| IOT089 |	It's actually part of this Google wi-fi system
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:10,368	| IOT089 |	Where can be if you already have an onhub so you can
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,392	| IOT089 |	You can actually
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:13,696	| IOT089 |	Create a mesh network with multiple on hubs
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:15,488	| IOT089 |	If you wanted to but that's expensive so
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:19,584	| IOT089 |	I went the cheaper out and added one Google Wi-Fi to my onhub
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:22,400	| IOT089 |	Ramayanam is downstairs on the first floor
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:24,704	| IOT089 |	In a two-story town house about 2000 square feet
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:31,616	| IOT089 |	I had Wi-Fi signal issues and obviously speed therefore issues in the backside of the second floor of the house
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:37,760	| IOT089 |	So am I getting what I want to put a Google Wi-Fi on the second floor and see what that does and oh my goodness
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:38,528	| IOT089 |	Just like
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:42,624	| IOT089 |	You know when hero or Bloomer many other available Solutions
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:43,136	| IOT089 |	It did the trick
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:45,440	| IOT089 |	Time it was very simple to add
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:48,000	| IOT089 |	Alright to the new Google Wi-Fi app
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:50,560	| IOT089 |	The old onhub app is now Wi-Fi
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:52,864	| IOT089 |	Just put branding purposes as I suspect
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:59,008	| IOT089 |	And so I've got this little mesh network of snow 2 nodes and it's working really well
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,312	| IOT089 |	Yay
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:04,384	| IOT089 |	So you really notice the
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:05,408	| IOT089 |	And how did that go
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:15,648	| IOT089 |	You know I did try the Eero and when I got the Wi-Fi and tweeted about it people like
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:16,928	| IOT089 |	Compare the Euro that you tried and so on
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:22,816	| IOT089 |	And I'm not going to compare them I said they both do the job and the reason I'm not doing a strict comparison
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:26,656	| IOT089 |	Is because I tested the Eero 3 pack in my old house
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:28,192	| IOT089 |	Prices
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:29,728	| IOT089 |	And therefore
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:32,032	| IOT089 |	It's not a fair comparison I mean Network
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:36,128	| IOT089 |	Testing you can add variables in and expect a good test
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:37,664	| IOT089 |	Well you can't
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:41,504	| IOT089 |	YouTube
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:45,088	| IOT089 |	But but it's a totally different environment so you know it's hard for me to say
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:48,416	| IOT089 |	This is better or worse than any Rover example or some other
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:50,720	| IOT089 |	Whatever you want
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:53,792	| IOT089 |	I don't I can't compare it cuz I've never tested those here in this house
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:56,352	| IOT089 |	Severe is again
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:38:02,752	| IOT089 |	All right well I also in testing Wi-Fi so I talked about these last week these with a plume pods
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:06,848	| IOT089 |	These are the little WiFi things that there hexagonal
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:10,688	| IOT089 |	Metallic beautiful things that you plug in there's a radio in a network
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:14,272	| IOT089 |	You plug into it electrical outlet
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:17,856	| IOT089 |	What you could do that
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:21,184	| IOT089 |	When you plug into your
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:22,976	| IOT089 |	So
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:23,744	| IOT089 |	I set it up
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:27,328	| IOT089 |	And then I didn't tell you guys about it last week because it's a
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:31,424	| IOT089 |	It's a learning system so I didn't test it until it has been in a week so it would
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:33,216	| IOT089 |	Learn what it needed to know
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:34,496	| IOT089 |	So
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:36,800	| IOT089 |	The key here is it's all connected to the cloud
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:38,336	| IOT089 |	And for me
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:40,640	| IOT089 |	I did notice that my Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:41,664	| IOT089 |	Has improved
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:43,968	| IOT089 |	In places that are hard to get to
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:46,528	| IOT089 |	Now the comparison for me is going to be the Eero
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:49,856	| IOT089 |	Because that's what happening in my house
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:53,952	| IOT089 |	I did notice that the plume Wi-Fi made some less
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:56,000	| IOT089 |	So like my doorbell for example
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:57,280	| IOT089 |	I have a doorbell in
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:59,328	| IOT089 |	It had okay cover
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:01,632	| IOT089 |	Rich writes my Wi-Fi powered doorbell headache
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:04,448	| IOT089 |	Okay coverage but it has better coverage under the blue
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:09,568	| IOT089 |	And I'm assuming that's because it is found a node that's a little
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:10,336	| IOT089 |	The closer
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:12,640	| IOT089 |	Imagine it's using the note that
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:14,176	| IOT089 |	It's the same node
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:19,296	| IOT089 |	Is the doorbell the closest spot to my server closet where is which is where I keep my Hubs and such
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:20,832	| IOT089 |	Is right
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:22,880	| IOT089 |	So that's better
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:26,464	| IOT089 |	So that could just be that the self learning and optimization
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:31,328	| IOT089 |	Aspect if the location obviously you're good the location hasn't changed
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:32,352	| IOT089 |	So
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:34,400	| IOT089 |	It's getting more DVDs
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:36,192	| IOT089 |	I also will say though
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:40,032	| IOT089 |	The plume has been an exercise in frustration for me personally
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:41,568	| IOT089 |	Because
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:43,872	| IOT089 |	They're only there's only one
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:45,664	| IOT089 |	Gigabit Ethernet port
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:46,944	| IOT089 |	On each
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:47,456	| IOT089 |	Little pod
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:51,040	| IOT089 |	The challenge for me
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:53,856	| IOT089 |	Because I run so many hubs
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:55,136	| IOT089 |	Plugged into
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:40:00,512	| IOT089 |	I I run a switch because I have you know my Philips Hue Hub needs access to the internet
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:01,280	| IOT089 |	Right
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:02,560	| IOT089 |	My SmartThings Hub
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:03,840	| IOT089 |	Needs
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:05,120	| IOT089 |	Actually that actually at
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:05,632	| IOT089 |	I think as wife
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:10,496	| IOT089 |	I have my SmartThings Hub which may or may not be his wife I cannot recall
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:13,312	| IOT089 |	My switch is
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:16,128	| IOT089 |	So there are a couple of devices that just
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:17,664	| IOT089 |	Have to be plugged in
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:18,688	| IOT089 |	I also
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:20,992	| IOT089 |	Plugin my TVs
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:22,528	| IOT089 |	I hardwire
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:25,088	| IOT089 |	And this is because my house is new and I have
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:26,112	| IOT089 |	Ethernet
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:26,624	| IOT089 |	In every room
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:29,696	| IOT089 |	So everything is hard everything that can be
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:30,976	| IOT089 |	Hardwired table lamp
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:33,024	| IOT089 |	Is which is great for like
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:34,816	| IOT089 |	My TV
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:37,632	| IOT089 |	It's bad for the plume
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:42,496	| IOT089 |	Because the pluma can't actually plug anything into it so I kind of broke a lot of things in my house
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:43,776	| IOT089 |	What I installed these
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:46,848	| IOT089 |	Now that doesn't mean you will break a lot of things in your house when you install
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:50,176	| IOT089 |	It just means that if you're using a switch
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:51,200	| IOT089 |	This may not be
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:52,480	| IOT089 |	The router its it's
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:53,504	| IOT089 |	You can
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:54,272	| IOT089 |	Set it up
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:56,832	| IOT089 |	There's a way to set it up but it is not the easy
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:40:58,112	| IOT089 |	Option that
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:59,904	| IOT089 |	Kind of
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:04,256	| IOT089 |	And In fairness to what they are selling what they're selling
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:11,168	| IOT089 |	First and foremost is a simple way to have better wi-fi connectivity throughout your house at
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:12,448	| IOT089 |	Coverage and speed
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:16,288	| IOT089 |	Right that's that's the main thing that they're selling enter that
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:19,616	| IOT089 |	I think the plume works from what you described
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:21,664	| IOT089 |	As well as what other reviews I've read
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:26,272	| IOT089 |	It's when you start getting into lots of IRT levels that
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:31,648	| IOT089 |	Many resources are constrained could a lot of only have a single ethernet Jack on what whatever
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:33,696	| IOT089 |	Hardware they have
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:35,744	| IOT089 |	So this is where Kevin and I
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:36,256	| IOT089 |	Spent
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:39,840	| IOT089 |	Because we are we are Kevin and Stacey it was his what
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:41,632	| IOT089 |	We spent a long time discussing
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:42,400	| IOT089 |	The need for
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:43,680	| IOT089 |	Terse
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:47,264	| IOT089 |	Even if your goal is to be like this mesh Network to have to get EBT
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:50,592	| IOT089 |	At least two
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:51,616	| IOT089 |	At least have that is an option
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:53,919	| IOT089 |	I mean I'm fine by me
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:59,039	| IOT089 |	40 bucks if you want to add more for like the people who have a couple devices
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:00,319	| IOT089 |	Great but I feel like
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:04,671	| IOT089 |	That could be a losing game because like I continually add devices to my switch
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:09,279	| IOT089 |	Which of Billy don't reproduce the number devices we have
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:10,303	| IOT089 |	Exactly
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:12,351	| IOT089 |	2/4
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:13,887	| IOT089 |	Euro has to
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:15,935	| IOT089 |	Aunt
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:17,471	| IOT089 |	Google
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:19,007	| IOT089 |	Yeah I think it wise to
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:24,383	| IOT089 |	What is 4
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:30,015	| IOT089 |	Well I'm using 1/4 backhaul and then there is another one that I used my TV so I can watch work at you
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:34,367	| IOT089 |	But if you wanted you to put that into instead of a TV
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:36,671	| IOT089 |	Plug your TV into the switch if you
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:37,439	| IOT089 |	Chester
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:37,951	| IOT089 |	That's true
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:42,303	| IOT089 |	It all gets very complicated the more devices you add
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:44,095	| IOT089 |	Yes networking is not easy
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:48,191	| IOT089 |	And I will also say a lot in the last couple of months
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:51,263	| IOT089 |	Thor I've been testing this concept of
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:53,311	| IOT089 |	Secure devices on
EDL	00:42:53,311	00:42:54,335	| IOT089 |	Like how to secure my network
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:57,919	| IOT089 |	So what I did is I actually put a bunch of devices on my guest net
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:01,247	| IOT089 |	And that's actually worked fairly well
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:04,319	| IOT089 |	But I don't feel like it's any more secure
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:10,719	| IOT089 |	Really it's just harder to get to in the first place and once you're there there's no additional security
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:13,791	| IOT089 |	You know I will throw a bunch of devices that I know don't
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:14,303	| IOT089 |	Need to talk to
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:17,887	| IOT089 |	Thanks but the problem is most of my devices still need to talk to my phone
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:20,191	| IOT089 |	Select my doorbell for example has to
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:23,007	| IOT089 |	My phone and say hey
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:24,031	| IOT089 |	So my phone needs to be on
EDL	00:43:25,055	00:43:27,871	| IOT089 |	That's where it gets tricky you need it when you need to start worrying about what
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:32,735	| IOT089 |	Network Iran to actually use a device that gets back to the hole at the very beginning of this conversation
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:37,599	| IOT089 |	Which interface we talked to you know here it's now it's which interface are we connecting to
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:39,135	| IOT089 |	For networks we can do something at
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:41,695	| IOT089 |	And that's that's just a barrier that we don't need
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:44,767	| IOT089 |	The guest Network solution
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:45,791	| IOT089 |	Is sucky
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:48,351	| IOT089 |	Just going to lay it out there
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:51,423	| IOT089 |	So the other solution is to create
EDL	00:43:51,423	00:43:54,239	| IOT089 |	A completely separate Network it only do
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:56,543	| IOT089 |	Certain things on it
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:59,871	| IOT089 |	And I did that and that worked well but it was kind of
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:00,383	| IOT089 |	Also
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:01,663	| IOT089 |	Silly
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:03,711	| IOT089 |	So everything else
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:06,527	| IOT089 |	Lives 90% of the time on my main
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:07,039	| IOT089 |	Network
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:12,415	| IOT089 |	If I was doing banking or anything that required extra security light paying for stuff
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:14,719	| IOT089 |	Play with switch over to
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:16,511	| IOT089 |	Decorticate securenet
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:21,119	| IOT089 |	Very little fun
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:21,631	| IOT089 |	In excitement
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:24,447	| IOT089 |	People people are not going to want to do that
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:28,799	| IOT089 |	It makes me wonder is there an opportunity for router makers here to
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:34,943	| IOT089 |	Beef things up and really really start integrating internet of things into their products with a better
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:36,735	| IOT089 |	We should probably think
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:37,759	| IOT089 |	First about
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:38,527	| IOT089 |	Making
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:40,575	| IOT089 |	Batters a little bit more secure in the first place
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:43,135	| IOT089 |	Start adding the security
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:49,535	| IOT089 |	Super example there was just a story in ARS Technica that matters that are blue
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:50,303	| IOT089 |	Turbo to a hack
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:51,583	| IOT089 |	Jealous people take
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:53,375	| IOT089 |	Spices
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:53,887	| IOT089 |	And this is
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:59,263	| IOT089 |	This is older router so the r7000 r6400 r8000
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:01,567	| IOT089 |	And some others
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:06,175	| IOT089 |	Tibetan flute a link to the story so you guys can have it
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:07,199	| IOT089 |	Are also
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:07,711	| IOT089 |	Endanger
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:09,503	| IOT089 |	That's just
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:11,039	| IOT089 |	Sample of right now
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:13,087	| IOT089 |	Actually let's just say it
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:14,367	| IOT089 |	Buy someone you love a router
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:17,439	| IOT089 |	If you have another router in like a year
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:19,487	| IOT089 |	Go buy a router
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:24,095	| IOT089 |	And I would say by one of the more modern routers that allow over-the-air updates
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:27,679	| IOT089 |	That actually means a mesh Network in most times I actually
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:31,007	| IOT089 |	Kind of had a conversation over Twitter with Netgear asking about
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:32,799	| IOT089 |	Is there Nighthawk routers Witcher
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:37,663	| IOT089 |	Freaking awesome were updatable over-the-air and they're like no you got to do it over the land
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:38,431	| IOT089 |	But at least they are up
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:40,479	| IOT089 |	There's a wreck
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:40,991	| IOT089 |	Addiction
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:44,831	| IOT089 |	That's a lot of news so we've got Wi-Fi
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:45,599	| IOT089 |	We've got
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:51,231	| IOT089 |	Many many new products we've got the race heating up between Google and Amazon and Microsoft
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:53,279	| IOT089 |	Wechat protocols
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:55,071	| IOT089 |	We have protocols we got it all this week
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:56,095	| IOT089 |	Test
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:45:57,631	| IOT089 |	All right we will be back
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:46:01,727	| IOT089 |	The following week we're going to do our podcast a little bit early because of
EDL	00:46:01,727	00:46:04,543	| IOT089 |	We didn't want to put it out on the day before Christmas Eve
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:08,639	| IOT089 |	You'll probably see your podcast show up a little extra early but
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:09,919	| IOT089 |	Enjoy it
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:12,223	| IOT089 |	Kevin I will talk about exciting things

EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:15,039	| IOT089 |	It will actually be
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:18,623	| IOT089 |	My husband he's going to talk and give a real person's perspective
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:24,255	| IOT089 |	You can play it for your significant other when they open their presents under the Christmas tree and they're like
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:26,047	| IOT089 |	Oh my God why did you give me a connected
