EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:46,400	| IOT221 |	Heaven
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:51,520	| IOT221 |	First off I have to tell everybody I am now in my home studio on Bainbridge Island
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,824	| IOT221 |	Yay yay
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:56,384	| IOT221 |	All the craziness is now behind me
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:58,688	| IOT221 |	Some of the craziness is still ahead of me
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,224	| IOT221 |	Such a setting up my smart home
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:02,016	| IOT221 |	Work so you can expect to hear more
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:02,528	| IOT221 |	About all of that
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,320	| IOT221 |	Probably in the next week or two
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:09,696	| IOT221 |	People have asked about that previously before you
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,232	| IOT221 |	I think you just
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:13,536	| IOT221 |	Mention last week when you miss the most
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,584	| IOT221 |	I did and yes
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:18,912	| IOT221 |	But it is not the first thing
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:20,960	| IOT221 |	I think what I took out all the stuff I realized
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:23,008	| IOT221 |	How much moving a smart home
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:27,360	| IOT221 |	Process of moving impact
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,128	| IOT221 |	Singing organized most
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,432	| IOT221 |	I'm sitting here looking at my boxes of
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,992	| IOT221 |	Surface word
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:34,784	| IOT221 |	But I don't want to set it up right
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:36,832	| IOT221 |	Rent rent
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,904	| IOT221 |	Anyway let's start the show with
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:40,928	| IOT221 |	Updates on
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:41,696	| IOT221 |	Read this is
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:42,976	| IOT221 |	Great news
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,000	| IOT221 |	It's big news
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:47,328	| IOT221 |	Thread is a wireless radio protocol
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:49,888	| IOT221 |	The things that you would need to know about thread is it
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:53,216	| IOT221 |	It is IPv6
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:55,008	| IOT221 |	Compatible which means you can go straight up
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,080	| IOT221 |	And it is low power
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:01,408	| IOT221 |	So this is a network that competes with things like zigbee Bluetooth
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,688	| IOT221 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:08,064	| IOT221 |	We talked about it before what's exciting about it is actually a whole new protocol just for the Smart Home
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:09,856	| IOT221 |	The folks at Nest Samsung
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,904	| IOT221 |	Deep bands
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:14,208	| IOT221 |	And a couple other companies
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,000	| IOT221 |	Designed it several years ago
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,815	| IOT221 |	And we've been waiting for it to like really take off
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:20,095	| IOT221 |	It really has
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,655	| IOT221 |	And with red
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:27,263	| IOT221 |	1.2 this is their latest version of thread they've done three things
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,799	| IOT221 |	They're really
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:29,311	| IOT221 |	Interesting
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:31,359	| IOT221 |	So first off
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:32,895	| IOT221 |	They've been working on this for 3
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:34,431	| IOT221 |	Little longer
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:40,575	| IOT221 |	I think the first thread device or capable device I saw was the original Google
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,599	| IOT221 |	Onhub router
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,135	| IOT221 |	Oh wow yeah that
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,927	| IOT221 |	You still have that
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:47,231	| IOT221 |	That I do not I replace with a regular Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,023	| IOT221 |	Just kidding
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,047	| IOT221 |	I'm so excited for you
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,631	| IOT221 |	But no
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:54,655	| IOT221 |	Nope
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,703	| IOT221 |	Okay
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:58,239	| IOT221 |	So let's talk about this
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:00,031	| IOT221 |	Three main things that thread 1.2
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,335	| IOT221 |	It is
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:04,383	| IOT221 |	Lowering the power requirement
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:07,199	| IOT221 |	So it extends the battery life of iot
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:10,271	| IOT221 |	Yay it puts it in the same
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,039	| IOT221 |	World is Bluetooth
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,367	| IOT221 |	The other thing it's done
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:17,439	| IOT221 |	Is a credit extensions for Bluetooth low in
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,487	| IOT221 |	Which means
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:22,559	| IOT221 |	That this protocol will work over Bluetooth radios
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:26,911	| IOT221 |	This means that if you have a Bluetooth bass device as a note on your network
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,983	| IOT221 |	You can actually have it talk to your
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:30,495	| IOT221 |	Sprint network
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:31,775	| IOT221 |	Provided
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:33,055	| IOT221 |	There's another note
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,847	| IOT221 |	Thread Network that speaks
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,151	| IOT221 |	That sounds really complicated
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,175	| IOT221 |	But it's actually not
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:42,015	| IOT221 |	No it's kind of like if you have a fax machine need to
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:45,855	| IOT221 |	Have somebody else that has a fax machine to or you can use it that makes sense to me
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,647	| IOT221 |	The real question is
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:52,767	| IOT221 |	Is it backwards compatible with existing Bluetooth devices on the mortgage
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:54,303	| IOT221 |	It is
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:57,631	| IOT221 |	No new hardware required
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:00,191	| IOT221 |	You're probably going to have to have a firmware update list
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:02,239	| IOT221 |	You've got like a brand new device
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:04,287	| IOT221 |	Got a chip that already has a firmware in it but
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:06,335	| IOT221 |	It will work with your old Bluetooth stuff
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,103	| IOT221 |	Bluetooth low energy
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,383	| IOT221 |	This is
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:14,527	| IOT221 |	Cool what it can do is if you have maybe a Bluetooth sensor for example and you wanted to work with your
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:17,087	| IOT221 |	Thread based air conditioning or your threat
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:17,855	| IOT221 |	Lights
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:19,391	| IOT221 |	It will actually
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:22,975	| IOT221 |	Become part of that Network so that sensor could easily communicate
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,999	| IOT221 |	With those lights
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,279	| IOT221 |	Yay
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:26,559	| IOT221 |	Awesome
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,839	| IOT221 |	Yeah it is awesome
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:30,399	| IOT221 |	And then the other thing that they've done is
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,447	| IOT221 |	They call it commercial extension
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,727	| IOT221 |	Chance and there's two things they did he
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:36,031	| IOT221 |	The first part is they've made it
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,055	| IOT221 |	Possible to have
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,591	| IOT221 |	Larger networks of thread device
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:39,871	| IOT221 |	Places to thread Taps out
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:42,431	| IOT221 |	An individual Network at around 300
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:43,711	| IOT221 |	Devices is kind of
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,735	| IOT221 |	The General
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,527	| IOT221 |	Which is a lie
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:49,599	| IOT221 |	Yeah it's plenty for a home but not forsake an Enterprise
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:51,135	| IOT221 |	Right word
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,159	| IOT221 |	It's a really big hug
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:52,927	| IOT221 |	I'm like
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,463	| IOT221 |	I'm kind of surprised I mean I have like
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:56,511	| IOT221 |	My other house did you get there
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:07:00,351	| IOT221 |	Butera my current house has no light bulbs there are no light bulbs in this house it's really weird
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:01,631	| IOT221 |	Summer jobs don't have a
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,703	| IOT221 |	Almost none of my Tinder
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,983	| IOT221 |	Yeah I don't know what that is
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,775	| IOT221 |	What has a head a t light
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,567	| IOT221 |	So I can see if you had like
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:13,407	| IOT221 |	80 Light Bulbs Plus temperature sensors and all these other things
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,967	| IOT221 |	And you had a larger house that I had
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,759	| IOT221 |	You could probably get to
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:18,783	| IOT221 |	350
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:19,807	| IOT221 |	The point is
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:23,135	| IOT221 |	Now you're not limited by that what happens is
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:25,695	| IOT221 |	They created like a virtual overlay so
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,463	| IOT221 |	A
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,743	| IOT221 |	Physical Network
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:28,767	| IOT221 |	Thread devices
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:29,791	| IOT221 |	Talk to
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:30,815	| IOT221 |	The router
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,375	| IOT221 |	And you can join them
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:35,423	| IOT221 |	Up with another physical one so
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,959	| IOT221 |	When you're talking to like that
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:39,263	| IOT221 |	IP addresses you can actually address
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:41,823	| IOT221 |	All 700 or all however mininet
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,359	| IOT221 |	Works you have as one Unified
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:44,895	| IOT221 |	So
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:46,431	| IOT221 |	Many networks now look like when
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:47,967	| IOT221 |	That's very
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:50,527	| IOT221 |	And then
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:52,575	| IOT221 |	This is the
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,087	| IOT221 |	Somebody
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:57,183	| IOT221 |	They've added enterprise-grade lifecycle device management
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,463	| IOT221 |	So
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:02,047	| IOT221 |	In the home when I connect a thread device I do QR code why do some
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,583	| IOT221 |	That right
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:05,631	| IOT221 |	In the Enterprise that is stupid
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,399	| IOT221 |	Because
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,935	| IOT221 |	You don't want everybody to be able
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:08,447	| IOT221 |	How to add devices
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,799	| IOT221 |	So they've tied in with Cisco
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:16,383	| IOT221 |	Some other open protocols to give you admin
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,663	| IOT221 |	Rights for
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,199	| IOT221 |	Commissioning and decommissioning
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:19,711	| IOT221 |	Devices
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:26,879	| IOT221 |	That's probably a lot quicker to I wouldn't want to be going around in Enterprise and scanning a QR code for every single device that I was trying to
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,391	| IOT221 |	Choi
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:33,279	| IOT221 |	Can you imagine like having a good day
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:34,559	| IOT221 |	Efficient
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,863	| IOT221 |	Where's the QR code
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:41,471	| IOT221 |	So that's what threads done
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,519	| IOT221 |	And to provide some context here
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:46,591	| IOT221 |	To me this looks like a continual
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:48,895	| IOT221 |	Want to say
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:49,663	| IOT221 |	Retrenchment is
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:52,991	| IOT221 |	The smart home isn't going where we all kind of hoped it
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:53,759	| IOT221 |	We go
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:54,527	| IOT221 |	It is becoming
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:58,111	| IOT221 |	Much more locked into these Fender ecosystems built
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:58,623	| IOT221 |	Voice assist
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:08:59,903	| IOT221 |	Silence
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:06,303	| IOT221 |	And the wireless protocols that we were like I'll be open and cool and everything will talk to each other that's not
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:09,119	| IOT221 |	So it makes sense that thread would say
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,935	| IOT221 |	If we want to remain relevant we got to go to
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,727	| IOT221 |	Verizon Bluetooth is actually
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:14,751	| IOT221 |	Dummy
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:16,799	| IOT221 |	Did there still fine in the
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,591	| IOT221 |	And everywhere else but they've also made of
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,127	| IOT221 |	Branch out in
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,663	| IOT221 |	Price
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,175	| IOT221 |	So
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,967	| IOT221 |	That's I guess the context you
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:29,599	| IOT221 |	Yeah I've always looked at it from the smart home perspective cuz I've been out of Enterprise for 15 years
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,879	| IOT221 |	I've been waiting to see
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,183	| IOT221 |	Some thread implementation
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:38,303	| IOT221 |	At the device level that would be make me go wow this is awesome got to have it and haven't seen that yet
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:40,095	| IOT221 |	But again that you said
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:43,167	| IOT221 |	Everything's going Wi-Fi Bluetooth
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,447	| IOT221 |	Silo digital assistant
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,727	| IOT221 |	So
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:46,495	| IOT221 |	In automatic
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,031	| IOT221 |	So hopefully
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,079	| IOT221 |	We hear about soon some
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:50,847	| IOT221 |	Rehabilitation
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:57,759	| IOT221 |	In the threat group has like osram and Zeidman's they're actually they join the Border
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,807	| IOT221 |	So
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,343	| IOT221 |	You know this isn't crazy
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,647	| IOT221 |	It makes a lot of sense +
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,671	| IOT221 |	Unlike zippy
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:08,255	| IOT221 |	Which is it doesn't go out to
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,535	| IOT221 |	CB is very popular
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:11,071	| IOT221 |	In the Enterprise
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,351	| IOT221 |	It's not IPv6
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:14,143	| IOT221 |	Compatible so you still have to make that
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:14,911	| IOT221 |	Next
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,191	| IOT221 |	Where is thread is
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,471	| IOT221 |	So
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:20,543	| IOT221 |	It'll Tire Lake lighting system
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,055	| IOT221 |	Some directly into
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:26,175	| IOT221 |	You know what we're going to get all the haters now because they always say you're always
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,967	| IOT221 |	Disinfecting and we're not doing that
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:30,783	| IOT221 |	It's just a technical limitation that some people
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,551	| IOT221 |	Can't work with
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:32,831	| IOT221 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:33,855	| IOT221 |	I'm not dissing
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:34,879	| IOT221 |	I have no
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:35,903	| IOT221 |	Feelings whatsoever
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,439	| IOT221 |	Positive or negative
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:42,815	| IOT221 |	So you thread the one other piece of news that they released this week
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,631	| IOT221 |	Switch on the smart home side is interesting is
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,679	| IOT221 |	Lutron has joined the
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,447	| IOT221 |	Thread
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:48,959	| IOT221 |	Word
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:54,079	| IOT221 |	So yeah but which I enjoyed the thread group supported Iraq
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:55,359	| IOT221 |	And
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:57,151	| IOT221 |	The first thing I thought was
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:57,919	| IOT221 |	Holy mackerel
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:00,223	| IOT221 |	What's going to happen to Lucia
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:01,759	| IOT221 |	Proprietary protocols
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:03,039	| IOT221 |	Which
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:06,111	| IOT221 |	Clear connect
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:06,623	| IOT221 |	And then
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,927	| IOT221 |	Fancier larger
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:11,487	| IOT221 |	Professional installations they have
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,255	| IOT221 |	Radio raw 2
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:13,791	| IOT221 |	And
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,839	| IOT221 |	I don't know I reached out to Lutron they have
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:16,351	| IOT221 |	Have not gotten
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:19,167	| IOT221 |	But I will also as a hint
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,191	| IOT221 |	Say that
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:22,751	| IOT221 |	Recently they released the Aurora product
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,031	| IOT221 |	Which works with
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:24,799	| IOT221 |	JPay
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:26,079	| IOT221 |	Which is the same radio that
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,103	| IOT221 |	Runs over
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:29,919	| IOT221 |	They released this product that
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,455	| IOT221 |	Hold your light switch open
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:35,551	| IOT221 |	For your hue light bulbs that works with a hue light bulb system using
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:39,391	| IOT221 |	So I saw that was like Hey That's not using Lutron
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:41,439	| IOT221 |	Interesting
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,463	| IOT221 |	And now it's loose when turning
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:46,303	| IOT221 |	Do I think they totally ditch their proprietary protocol
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,095	| IOT221 |	Probably not
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:48,607	| IOT221 |	But
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,399	| IOT221 |	I like the fact
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:53,215	| IOT221 |	I thought they might be working more broadly with a more open today
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:12:01,151	| IOT221 |	Stick on kind of clamps
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,711	| IOT221 |	Right yeah it's a round dimmer switch that
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,479	| IOT221 |	You screw it it's
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,759	| IOT221 |	It's like tension mounted
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:08,319	| IOT221 |	Screw it
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,343	| IOT221 |	Onto your
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,367	| IOT221 |	Lights
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:11,903	| IOT221 |	Switch but there's no wiring
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:12,927	| IOT221 |	It's $40
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:17,791	| IOT221 |	I actually have it in front of me in the second I get my Hue bulbs in which is going to happen this weekend
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:19,071	| IOT221 |	Can I test this out so weak
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:21,119	| IOT221 |	We can all see
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:27,007	| IOT221 |	Yates by the way that only works with the toggle
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,287	| IOT221 |	Switches that stick out for them
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:33,407	| IOT221 |	Yeah traditional light switch
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:34,943	| IOT221 |	Warrant wine
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:35,711	| IOT221 |	Okay
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:38,783	| IOT221 |	Well it's okay you won't see that you won't see the old ugly light switch anymore
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:40,575	| IOT221 |	That's true you see a beautiful dimmer switch
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:44,927	| IOT221 |	Okay
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,719	| IOT221 |	Let's talk about more enterprisenews
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,511	| IOT221 |	Man this is exciting
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,815	| IOT221 |	Jll which is a
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,583	| IOT221 |	Real estate
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:52,863	| IOT221 |	Behemoth
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:59,519	| IOT221 |	They've teamed up with Google Assistant to create a smart assistant
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:01,055	| IOT221 |	Four offices
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:01,823	| IOT221 |	So this is like
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:05,407	| IOT221 |	Asking hey assistant is the conference room open
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,199	| IOT221 |	And getting an answer
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:09,247	| IOT221 |	This is
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:12,575	| IOT221 |	Dick Amazon is working with other companies to try to bring
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:16,415	| IOT221 |	Listen to businesses so is Microsoft with Cortana that's actually where
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,207	| IOT221 |	Are most likely to Secor
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:18,975	| IOT221 |	Cortana succeed
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:23,327	| IOT221 |	And lo and behold Google's just like sweat. In
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:25,119	| IOT221 |	And made this work
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:31,007	| IOT221 |	Yeah and I remember when I used to work at Google I go into the New York City office once a week
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,287	| IOT221 |	We didn't use
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,311	| IOT221 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,871	| IOT221 |	Carpenters and such
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:37,663	| IOT221 |	It was an automated
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,431	| IOT221 |	System
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:40,479	| IOT221 |	Using the Google Calendar what not you could search
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:43,039	| IOT221 |	Say find me a room from
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,343	| IOT221 |	This time this time it's open
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,367	| IOT221 |	I'd like to have
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:48,927	| IOT221 |	Video whiteboard or video calling whatever
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,975	| IOT221 |	And the system will just do it I mean
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,767	| IOT221 |	Basically they had everything
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:55,327	| IOT221 |	There but the voice capability right
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:56,351	| IOT221 |	So
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:14:01,727	| IOT221 |	I'm not surprised at that Google is the want to do this today probably didn't take much effort to extend what they already have
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:05,055	| IOT221 |	Yes indeed jll they managed offices
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:06,847	| IOT221 |	Like we said their system is called Jill
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:14,015	| IOT221 |	Of course it is in there because I have been given to understand that you really were
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:17,343	| IOT221 |	Want a double or triple syllable word is your voice assistant
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,367	| IOT221 |	Because it's harder to
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:20,415	| IOT221 |	It's easier for the AI to differentiate
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:24,255	| IOT221 |	Which I have to say hey Jill
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:27,071	| IOT221 |	Hey Jill
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,119	| IOT221 |	Book me up
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:33,215	| IOT221 |	Okay don't butcher my
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:38,079	| IOT221 |	Kevin can handle a lot of my singing
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,407	| IOT221 |	All right
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:43,711	| IOT221 |	So that you're a bad singer it's what you're doing to the world
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:44,735	| IOT221 |	Yeah okay
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:50,367	| IOT221 |	This is on your smartphone this is not actually on a physical device in the room
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:50,879	| IOT221 |	Just yet
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,159	| IOT221 |	This is
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,719	| IOT221 |	Download the app
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,023	| IOT221 |	But it does bring in stuff
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,071	| IOT221 |	You would normally
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:00,607	| IOT221 |	I need to do like Hayes
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,375	| IOT221 |	Are these deaths Abuela
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:02,655	| IOT221 |	Book me a task if
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:03,679	| IOT221 |	Hot desking
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:04,703	| IOT221 |	Place
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:10,079	| IOT221 |	I like the fact that even though it runs on Google Cloud on the back that's obviously using
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:10,591	| IOT221 |	Google
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:18,271	| IOT221 |	It doesn't just integrate with G Suite calendars it also will integrate with Microsoft 365 which is obvious
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,807	| IOT221 |	The Behemoth of
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,343	| IOT221 |	Activity Suites
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:24,159	| IOT221 |	It is it the Kraken of office
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,439	| IOT221 |	Sweets
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:25,951	| IOT221 |	Yes
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,303	| IOT221 |	So they're trying this out with customers one of the first customers is going to be
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:30,815	| IOT221 |	Procter & gamb
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,631	| IOT221 |	My Hope Is
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,911	| IOT221 |	I actually
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:41,311	| IOT221 |	Reached out to the jll team
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:42,335	| IOT221 |	How people are actually using this
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,615	| IOT221 |	If
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,127	| IOT221 |	People are actually
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:46,431	| IOT221 |	So hopefully that will happen
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:47,711	| IOT221 |	All right
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,759	| IOT221 |	Moving right along
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:50,527	| IOT221 |	Dish
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:53,087	| IOT221 |	The satellite company satellite TV is
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:57,439	| IOT221 |	They have launched a smart
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:58,719	| IOT221 |	Home Services Unit
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:01,791	| IOT221 |	And they're going to basically come in and help
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,327	| IOT221 |	Set up your smartphone
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:07,423	| IOT221 |	They will be working with Nest ring
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,447	| IOT221 |	Linksys
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,215	| IOT221 |	Rio 2
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:12,031	| IOT221 |	And a couple audio companies
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:17,151	| IOT221 |	Comcast has been doing this for a while AT&T and Verizon both started these business units but they
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:20,735	| IOT221 |	Actually backed out of them so Comcast is only one I know if it's doing it right
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,015	| IOT221 |	Indeed
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:22,783	| IOT221 |	Diospi space
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:27,903	| IOT221 |	I don't see this as a big Market I think that's why
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:32,511	| IOT221 |	The others were already in it at scaled-back so surprised at this is doing this
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:36,095	| IOT221 |	There are definitely people who just like you to hate 7-Eleven
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:39,935	| IOT221 |	But I don't think it's a large percentage of people because the products these days
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,727	| IOT221 |	Pretty easy to set up
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,751	| IOT221 |	Yes
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:43,775	| IOT221 |	And
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:46,335	| IOT221 |	Are we still going to do what the Amazon
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,127	| IOT221 |	Guided for you and like
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,407	| IOT221 |	What kind of routine is Yuan
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,711	| IOT221 |	Richest device setup
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:55,551	| IOT221 |	For like
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,319	| IOT221 |	Routines
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:56,831	| IOT221 |	And that sort of thing
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,111	| IOT221 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,903	| IOT221 |	So and I will say
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:00,927	| IOT221 |	You may not be aware of the
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:01,951	| IOT221 |	Does Kevin butt dishes
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:02,719	| IOT221 |	Shed
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:04,255	| IOT221 |	They have not done it yet
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:06,559	| IOT221 |	But they are said they're going to launch an NB iot
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,095	| IOT221 |	So
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:13,983	| IOT221 |	Yeah I could see that and it would tie into this yes
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:17,055	| IOT221 |	They're vying for the Spectrum from
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,335	| IOT221 |	T-Mobile Sprint
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:20,639	| IOT221 |	If it was to get together and have to divest some things
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:23,711	| IOT221 |	Even look at the Boost Mobile
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:25,247	| IOT221 |	Investment as well so
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:27,551	| IOT221 |	Yeah okay
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:32,415	| IOT221 |	I don't know if this is going to be huge but you also a man think about like alarm.com has done
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:34,207	| IOT221 |	Pretty good job building
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:38,047	| IOT221 |	A smart phone capability as well now they offer the devices
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:40,607	| IOT221 |	Exact services
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:41,375	| IOT221 |	Sodus Vivint
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,911	| IOT221 |	So yeah it's
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,703	| IOT221 |	I don't know I mean
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:46,239	| IOT221 |	I think there is a market
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,007	| IOT221 |	For this sort of thing
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:50,591	| IOT221 |	I don't know how big it is I think there's lots of little independent
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:51,871	| IOT221 |	Companies that was won in Austin
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:52,895	| IOT221 |	Smart House
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,407	| IOT221 |	H o u
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,783	| IOT221 |	Smart home systems
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,551	| IOT221 |	4 people and I
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:01,599	| IOT221 |	Actually think there's
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,111	| IOT221 |	There's a tiny
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:06,719	| IOT221 |	I don't know the scale but I think it feels more like a Consulting
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:08,511	| IOT221 |	I agree
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:10,303	| IOT221 |	But we'll see
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,351	| IOT221 |	Let's talk security
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,887	| IOT221 |	Because OMG
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,167	| IOT221 |	The world went nuts
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,447	| IOT221 |	This week
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:17,215	| IOT221 |	Because they noticed
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:19,775	| IOT221 |	Because Samsung
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,287	| IOT221 |	Told them
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:24,895	| IOT221 |	Samsung tweeted something that will read word for word in a second
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,687	| IOT221 |	Potentially that the Tweet witch
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:28,479	| IOT221 |	Is really interesting in and of itself
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:31,551	| IOT221 |	So I don't have any Samsung Smart TV that I have you do
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,319	| IOT221 |	I do not
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:34,367	| IOT221 |	I'm sure some of our listeners to
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:37,439	| IOT221 |	So this is the Tweet that's Samsung support USA Center
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:42,303	| IOT221 |	Scanning your computer for malware viruses is important to keep it running smoothly
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:47,935	| IOT221 |	This is also true for your qled TV if it's connected to Wi-Fi
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:51,007	| IOT221 |	Prevent malicious software texting your TV
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,031	| IOT221 |	Scanning for viruses
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:54,079	| IOT221 |	Is on your TV every few weeks
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:54,591	| IOT221 |	Here's how
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:56,127	| IOT221 |	That's
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,663	| IOT221 |	Not smart Samsung
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:01,247	| IOT221 |	So I think a lot of people if they saw that tweet we're like
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:04,319	| IOT221 |	Why do they send it I could have viruses on my
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:06,879	| IOT221 |	Sure you could
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,415	| IOT221 |	So and yes
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:11,743	| IOT221 |	Smart TVs are in Notorious place for
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:12,511	| IOT221 |	Pirates SB
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:13,023	| IOT221 |	Because they're not up to
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:18,399	| IOT221 |	Some people might be like gay Samsung pointing out that there's fire the antivirus
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:25,311	| IOT221 |	I don't think we want to live in a future where are connected devices are so badly engineered
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,847	| IOT221 |	We have to run virus scan
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,383	| IOT221 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:28,895	| IOT221 |	Enter
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:33,503	| IOT221 |	Samsung Smart TVs run Samsung tizen
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:38,623	| IOT221 |	So it's not a platform to talk about offense it's probably not a platform that really is
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:42,975	| IOT221 |	Attacked all that much either because I should know it was attack remember they had like
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:45,535	| IOT221 |	40 security vulnerabilities in
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:48,095	| IOT221 |	Because Samsung originally wanted everything
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:50,399	| IOT221 |	Right that's right
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:52,191	| IOT221 |	That's right I do recall that
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:54,495	| IOT221 |	That was for about 2 years ago
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:59,615	| IOT221 |	I haven't heard about it since then that's kind of why I was like
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:03,967	| IOT221 |	But you're right it wasn't engineer with security in mind I would say
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,247	| IOT221 |	Yasso
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:08,831	| IOT221 |	When we're doing our Sonos I just put this on the show that says this is a bad fuse
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,879	| IOT221 |	This is a future I don't want
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:11,903	| IOT221 |	But
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,183	| IOT221 |	For me
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:13,951	| IOT221 |	I don't
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:18,559	| IOT221 |	Connect my TV to the internet I instead use a Roku and connect it to the internet via real
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:20,095	| IOT221 |	I also
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,887	| IOT221 |	Another option here
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:24,703	| IOT221 |	It would help is I know I've been skeptical
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:26,495	| IOT221 |	That maybe this sort of thing will change my
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:29,311	| IOT221 |	Is having a connected
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:30,847	| IOT221 |	Service that
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:31,359	| IOT221 |	Monitors are
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:36,223	| IOT221 |	And says hey did you know your TV is sending Dobbs of data
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:38,015	| IOT221 |	Not just when it's on but to weird places
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:41,599	| IOT221 |	Malaysia I'm so glad you said that because
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:44,671	| IOT221 |	I'm hoping we're going to review a product that will help with that
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:50,815	| IOT221 |	Want to get into right now but I'm looking for something along those lines and we stumbled upon one
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:52,095	| IOT221 |	Earlier this morning
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:53,375	| IOT221 |	You should just tell people what it is
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:54,911	| IOT221 |	Excited
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,703	| IOT221 |	Look at themselves
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:57,471	| IOT221 |	Now I don't
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,263	| IOT221 |	Oh you're such a tease
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:00,799	| IOT221 |	I'll tell people cuz I
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,591	| IOT221 |	It's called the firewalla
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:05,151	| IOT221 |	Yes and I think it was
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:07,199	| IOT221 |	Cisco people to put it together it
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:13,343	| IOT221 |	To be honest it's like a consumer derivative of something like that you could do on your own with a Raspberry Pi if you wanted to
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:16,416	| IOT221 |	Silversmith plug-and-play and you have to worry about
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:18,464	| IOT221 |	Setting up your figuring coating etcetera
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:19,232	| IOT221 |	But it does
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:24,096	| IOT221 |	Many things I'm one of the thing says yes it's monitoring where your traffic is going from all your devices
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:27,424	| IOT221 |	So something like that could help and then you could be like
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:29,728	| IOT221 |	Holy cow it's time to run virus scan
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,752	| IOT221 |	And get rid of those on my
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,312	| IOT221 |	Ideally
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:35,616	| IOT221 |	If you're going to make something smart you need to make acid
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:36,384	| IOT221 |	Secure as well
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:38,176	| IOT221 |	I didn't know you were set top.box person
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:40,992	| IOT221 |	Yeah I mean I've been a core cutter forever and
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:44,064	| IOT221 |	Same here same here I use to Android TVs
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:46,624	| IOT221 |	Nvidia Shield or iWatch directly on my Chromebook
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:51,232	| IOT221 |	I do have both a Fire TV stick and a Chromecast but we actually don't use them
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:53,792	| IOT221 |	We're pretty simple we only have one TV in our
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,328	| IOT221 |	House
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:58,144	| IOT221 |	I'm not going to tell you how many we have how many strings are here
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:59,424	| IOT221 |	Well you know I guess we
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:21:59,936	| IOT221 |	Peking watch
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,520	| IOT221 |	Amazon Echo Show
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,568	| IOT221 |	Okay
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:07,616	| IOT221 |	Let's talk about other security
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:09,408	| IOT221 |	Kevin
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,944	| IOT221 |	TPM
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:14,784	| IOT221 |	TPM trusted platform module and I said this
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:18,880	| IOT221 |	Adderall 5 times in the last 2 years
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:22,464	| IOT221 |	I want trusted platform module in my iot devices
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,256	| IOT221 |	Why do I want that
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:25,792	| IOT221 |	Because
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:30,400	| IOT221 |	The same reason I have them and want them in my Chromebooks that I did was praise she should tell people what it is
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:32,704	| IOT221 |	Trusted platform module
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:40,128	| IOT221 |	So basically it is a specific chip although I think it can be implemented
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:41,920	| IOT221 |	Coprocessor
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:43,968	| IOT221 |	And I say I'm thinking yes
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:45,504	| IOT221 |	Yes
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:47,808	| IOT221 |	Either way
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:48,832	| IOT221 |	It's an Authentication
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:51,648	| IOT221 |	Basically
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:54,720	| IOT221 |	It has cryptographically stored keys
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:55,488	| IOT221 |	That
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:58,048	| IOT221 |	Protect your device from having say the
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:23:02,912	| IOT221 |	Operating system Flash without your knowledge or tweak without your knowledge where maybe a virus could
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:06,752	| IOT221 |	Actually say wet install this routine and get all the information from your computer
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:08,544	| IOT221 |	Behind the scenes
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,592	| IOT221 |	What does several
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:14,688	| IOT221 |	Things are very low-level but at a high-level it protects your device from being
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:18,272	| IOT221 |	Change without your knowledge purification systems of the yes
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:21,344	| IOT221 |	This is working as intended is not an acid cetera
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:22,624	| IOT221 |	Got it
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:24,416	| IOT221 |	So I'm curious because
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,440	| IOT221 |	In the world of can
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:26,464	| IOT221 |	Computing arm
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:28,000	| IOT221 |	For example has a trusted
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:29,792	| IOT221 |	At The Trestle
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:33,376	| IOT221 |	And they have that actually on microcontroller switches
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:35,424	| IOT221 |	One of the challenges of these types of
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:36,448	| IOT221 |	Devices that don't work
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:38,240	| IOT221 |	No resource
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:40,288	| IOT221 |	Devices so things with microphone
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:40,800	| IOT221 |	Controllers without
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:42,848	| IOT221 |	And so
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:45,408	| IOT221 |	Arm has had something and they brought it down to the MCU
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:46,944	| IOT221 |	And
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:51,552	| IOT221 |	Nxp in a couple other microcontroller makers are now implementing
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,832	| IOT221 |	So you can buy these
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:59,744	| IOT221 |	I wonder if there's a difference though with the trust in zone because I think like to the iPhone where they have the trusted Enclave for your finger
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:03,840	| IOT221 |	My understanding I can very well be wrong is that doze
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:05,120	| IOT221 |	Zones
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:07,168	| IOT221 |	AR for storing
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:07,936	| IOT221 |	Protective
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:11,776	| IOT221 |	Data not for verifying the system
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:13,568	| IOT221 |	Has or hasn't been compromised
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,848	| IOT221 |	So trust so
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:17,664	| IOT221 |	It will run a check
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:18,688	| IOT221 |	To make sure
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:20,736	| IOT221 |	It's basically a Sandbox to run
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:22,272	| IOT221 |	Secure
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:24,064	| IOT221 |	Program so you can run an app
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:26,368	| IOT221 |	In that area so you can load the app in that area
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:28,416	| IOT221 |	And nothing can modify
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:31,744	| IOT221 |	Okay so there is a slight difference in please a TPM is
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:36,864	| IOT221 |	It's not a Sandbox it doesn't run app verifies like the BIOS
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:39,424	| IOT221 |	Okay so then that sounds like
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:40,960	| IOT221 |	I just read about it
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:46,080	| IOT221 |	And they don't do it on a processor side they do it on the flash memory size
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:47,616	| IOT221 |	Which is
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:49,664	| IOT221 |	When is something gets in over the air update
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,432	| IOT221 |	For example
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,712	| IOT221 |	It checks it and says
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:52,736	| IOT221 |	Hey this is actually fun
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:56,576	| IOT221 |	Right way to use Etc
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:58,112	| IOT221 |	Does it have signed keys
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:25:00,160	| IOT221 |	And is it trying to change some
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:00,928	| IOT221 |	Something
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,696	| IOT221 |	Mission Beach
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:02,464	| IOT221 |	Change
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:04,512	| IOT221 |	So that happened but that's on the memory size
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:07,584	| IOT221 |	So I think
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,352	| IOT221 |	I agree with you
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,656	| IOT221 |	I think we have to be a lot smarter to
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:11,680	| IOT221 |	Figure out the proper
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:12,448	| IOT221 |	Mechanism
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:13,216	| IOT221 |	To do this
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:13,984	| IOT221 |	But I'm with you
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,264	| IOT221 |	We do need this sort of
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:15,776	| IOT221 |	Functionality
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:23,712	| IOT221 |	Yeah it's me it's it's not going to protect my iot data it's not going to stop something from sending data somewhere else
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:27,040	| IOT221 |	Right
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:30,368	| IOT221 |	Is malicious prevent someone from trying to take over your
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,648	| IOT221 |	Your device
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:34,976	| IOT221 |	We're all in agreement
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,256	| IOT221 |	Unsure
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:37,536	| IOT221 |	The right
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:38,816	| IOT221 |	Do it
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:39,328	| IOT221 |	Imagine
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:42,400	| IOT221 |	Everybody's going to have a slightly different take
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:44,704	| IOT221 |	But feel free to talk to us if you're smarter than this
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:47,520	| IOT221 |	Cuz we're working our way through it
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:48,288	| IOT221 |	Slowly but surely
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:51,360	| IOT221 |	All right let's do some quick news bits
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:53,152	| IOT221 |	Kevin iPhone camera
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:55,968	| IOT221 |	IPhone camera so a paper
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:58,528	| IOT221 |	By the Royal Society of chemistry
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:02,368	| IOT221 |	Is coming soon get ready yet
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:04,672	| IOT221 |	They demonstrate the use of an iPhone
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:07,232	| IOT221 |	And thin-film Jamaica
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:10,560	| IOT221 |	Spectrometer
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:13,632	| IOT221 |	Spectrometry sensor
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:14,912	| IOT221 |	Okay
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:15,680	| IOT221 |	Yes
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:18,752	| IOT221 |	So basically what they're doing is they're using the Flash
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:20,800	| IOT221 |	I have an iPhone and it's thin
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:21,312	| IOT221 |	Film
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:22,592	| IOT221 |	2
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:24,384	| IOT221 |	Hold some type of
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:26,688	| IOT221 |	Bodily fluid or DNA Etc
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:28,992	| IOT221 |	And what they can do is
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:30,272	| IOT221 |	Literally performance
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:32,576	| IOT221 |	Imma treat analysis
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:35,392	| IOT221 |	On the iPhone with it
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:36,672	| IOT221 |	I was kind of cool
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:37,440	| IOT221 |	It is cool
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:42,816	| IOT221 |	Another update is on Ikea blinds we had talked to your block who's head of the
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:44,096	| IOT221 |	Ikea
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,120	| IOT221 |	Smart home efforts
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:48,704	| IOT221 |	He told us that these smart blinds that were also excited about
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:49,984	| IOT221 |	Is there going to be cheaper and
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:51,264	| IOT221 |	From Ikea
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:54,080	| IOT221 |	Those are delayed
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:55,360	| IOT221 |	And they were going to be out in August
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:59,200	| IOT221 |	They're still going to be out in August in Europe but in the US we're going to see
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:00,224	| IOT221 |	October 1st
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:00,992	| IOT221 |	Launch date
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,576	| IOT221 |	And yet still cool
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:07,392	| IOT221 |	All right we still we still don't have a price on those two
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,672	| IOT221 |	We don't
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:09,952	| IOT221 |	I think if they're going to be about a hundred
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:14,048	| IOT221 |	Okay and it depends on the size
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:16,608	| IOT221 |	What about this homekit
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:21,984	| IOT221 |	Can I look for you I'll get folks you can now
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,520	| IOT221 |	Jewelsmart
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,288	| IOT221 |	Outlet
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:27,360	| IOT221 |	From Hitachi and I don't know if I'm saying that correctly
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:28,640	| IOT221 |	It's
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:32,992	| IOT221 |	Just like any other smart home Outlet it's a dual plug so you turn one of your
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:34,528	| IOT221 |	Plugs into
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:35,552	| IOT221 |	Two outlets
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:37,088	| IOT221 |	And then you can control
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:41,696	| IOT221 |	Tyson application because it's
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:44,000	| IOT221 |	Obviously it's WiFi
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:48,352	| IOT221 |	Apple
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:48,864	| IOT221 |	That is true
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:51,680	| IOT221 |	I see a price it is
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:55,776	| IOT221 |	T999 which sounds like a lot for Smart Eye leopard again
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:57,312	| IOT221 |	You kind of getting to outlets

EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:13,088	| IOT221 |	This is actually something we've
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:13,856	| IOT221 |	Talked about in the
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:14,880	| IOT221 |	Switches
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:18,208	| IOT221 |	The children's online protection and something something

EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:22,816	| IOT221 |	Privacy protection
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:24,096	| IOT221 |	Protection and Privacy Act
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:24,608	| IOT221 |	Prevents
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:27,936	| IOT221 |	Japanese from Gathering data from children under the age of
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,216	| IOT221 |	13
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:29,984	| IOT221 |	And
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:32,544	| IOT221 |	A long time ago when I had my echo device I was like hey
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:35,360	| IOT221 |	Recording my daughter's voice she is not yet
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:37,664	| IOT221 |	That feels like Batman
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:38,176	| IOT221 |	I like that
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:41,504	| IOT221 |	The FTC actually did a
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:44,320	| IOT221 |	Noted like a year maybe
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:45,600	| IOT221 |	A year-and-a-half ago that said
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:48,928	| IOT221 |	We're not super worried as long as your
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:49,952	| IOT221 |	Selling that
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:51,488	| IOT221 |	But
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:52,768	| IOT221 |	Two lawsuits were filed
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,816	| IOT221 |	Last week in Seattle
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:55,584	| IOT221 |	All that said
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:57,120	| IOT221 |	Hey you know what this is a problem
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:59,424	| IOT221 |	And it's a problem for a couple reasons
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:01,216	| IOT221 |	They basically said that Amazon is
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:02,496	| IOT221 |	Recording all of these boys
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:03,008	| IOT221 |	Friends of Children
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:04,288	| IOT221 |	And
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:05,568	| IOT221 |	That's not
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:07,872	| IOT221 |	Cool it's without their consent or the consent of
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:08,384	| IOT221 |	Their parents
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:11,968	| IOT221 |	They are saying that Amazon's privacy policies
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:12,992	| IOT221 |	Isn't this is the important thing
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:16,320	| IOT221 |	Sing to me that say if you use the Amazon
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:17,600	| IOT221 |	Echo device
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:18,624	| IOT221 |	And talk to madam
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:19,392	| IOT221 |	M a
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:20,416	| IOT221 |	You're basically
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:20,928	| IOT221 |	Consenting
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,464	| IOT221 |	To this
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:22,976	| IOT221 |	Privacy
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:26,048	| IOT221 |	If you don't accept it you may not user
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:27,328	| IOT221 |	But
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:28,864	| IOT221 |	The lawsuit is saying
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:32,192	| IOT221 |	In the you here because this is a device that's in a household
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:33,984	| IOT221 |	Are all people in the household
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:35,008	| IOT221 |	Consenting to this
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,288	| IOT221 |	No
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:37,056	| IOT221 |	Probably not
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:38,592	| IOT221 |	Which is kind of interesting because
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:42,176	| IOT221 |	I often consent to privacy policies on behalf of my entire home
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,712	| IOT221 |	And you know
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:44,736	| IOT221 |	I can see my husband being
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:47,040	| IOT221 |	No
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:48,832	| IOT221 |	So
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:51,904	| IOT221 |	And what about guess what about people just come over to your house
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:52,416	| IOT221 |	Yeah
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:53,952	| IOT221 |	I never thought of that
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:55,232	| IOT221 |	To be honest from the consent stand for
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:58,048	| IOT221 |	Yeah I mean it's a mean if you have like my mom
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:30:59,584	| IOT221 |	She is very privacy
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,376	| IOT221 |	She does not like
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:04,448	| IOT221 |	My house she actually will walk through my house like
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:04,960	| IOT221 |	Turning off the mic
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:06,752	| IOT221 |	Even though she knows she's like
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:08,544	| IOT221 |	Physical kill switches
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:14,688	| IOT221 |	There's a lot of meat here in this lawsuit and
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:15,456	| IOT221 |	You know it's worth
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:17,248	| IOT221 |	Look at the following song
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:17,760	| IOT221 |	Put them in there

EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:48,640	| IOT221 |	Let's hear it
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:50,944	| IOT221 |	Hi Stacy and Kevin
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:52,736	| IOT221 |	The question is
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:11,680	| IOT221 |	Longest wait is was cuddling on the counter and
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:21,152	| IOT221 |	Clever and make sure that you know Amazon order
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:22,176	| IOT221 |	Make targets music
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:26,784	| IOT221 |	Exporting answering keep up the great work
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:28,320	| IOT221 |	Turquoise Adidas on the Shelf thank you
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:35,232	| IOT221 |	So we got this question like once every 6 months and I love this question because it kind of confirms what I've been saying we have to
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:37,792	| IOT221 |	Too many smart speakers in the house cluttering up every single
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:44,192	| IOT221 |	Would you can do something about that Jeff as you said you know you asked if they're ceiling mounts are any lights
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:47,776	| IOT221 |	There are several ceiling mounts available for either
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:48,800	| IOT221 |	Echo dots
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:50,848	| IOT221 |	Home Minis
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:54,176	| IOT221 |	Witcher similarly-sized what did you have to buy the proper amount for it
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:58,272	| IOT221 |	I'm not going to recommend one because there's so many to choose from on Amazon
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:02,368	| IOT221 |	They're all run around 15 to $18 each
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:04,672	| IOT221 |	It doesn't look too difficult to install in fact
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:09,792	| IOT221 |	Some people that would recommend these two if
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,608	| IOT221 |	That'll get your speaker out of the way
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:14,400	| IOT221 |	Up in the ceiling
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:17,984	| IOT221 |	If you want if you don't feel like installing anything for about the same price
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:20,800	| IOT221 |	There's a couple vendors on Amazon that also make
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:23,360	| IOT221 |	Plug-in modules that you literally
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:26,176	| IOT221 |	It's a mount system and you mount your
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:32,320	| IOT221 |	Smart speaker small smart speaker to the wall essentially you plug this into an outlet and your speaker sits on top of it and it's plugged in
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:36,672	| IOT221 |	So that way you don't have cords all over either and it's out of the way
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:38,976	| IOT221 |	You good
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:43,072	| IOT221 |	As far as other devices with smart speakers that can remove the traditional ones
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:47,424	| IOT221 |	I know Stacy you tried the first alerts the smoke detectors that have died
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:48,704	| IOT221 |	Marinade
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:52,544	| IOT221 |	Pretty sure they're working on it I can see you after I said Google Assistant as well
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:58,176	| IOT221 |	Yes so the First Alert smoke detectors they're expensive they're like $200
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:34:59,200	| IOT221 |	Is there a smoke detector
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:02,272	| IOT221 |	It sounds really good it actually has an amazing speaker in there
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:05,088	| IOT221 |	And they mount to your ceiling
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:06,368	| IOT221 |	Exactly where
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,392	| IOT221 |	Your old smoke detector
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:09,440	| IOT221 |	Here's my issue
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:12,768	| IOT221 |	If you want just to talk to her and you don't want it to play music
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:18,656	| IOT221 |	This is a good option but a lot of the devices like I've had met him inside light switches
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:21,472	| IOT221 |	Thermostat with Madam inside
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:25,056	| IOT221 |	It's weird the placement is not ideal for a lot of pee
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:26,080	| IOT221 |	Bee stings for like listening
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:26,592	| IOT221 |	Music
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:27,872	| IOT221 |	My thermostats are
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:30,176	| IOT221 |	Come to the back of a hallway
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:31,968	| IOT221 |	Even your smoke detectors are in a
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:32,480	| IOT221 |	Weird spot
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:33,504	| IOT221 |	Ring sometime
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:35,552	| IOT221 |	They're not in the middle of the sea
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:38,880	| IOT221 |	Not going to be full Fidelity sound there
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:41,952	| IOT221 |	If you're just wanting to talk to it then yes it is
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:43,232	| IOT221 |	It's totally fine but
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:46,048	| IOT221 |	Sometimes it's a little weird having your light switch play music
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:47,072	| IOT221 |	Your mileage may vary
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:50,400	| IOT221 |	He may not care about sound quality maybe like this is totally sufficient
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:51,936	| IOT221 |	Get rid of stuff on my
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:52,960	| IOT221 |	Chosen
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:54,240	| IOT221 |	Places it's all out there for
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:57,568	| IOT221 |	The one caveat I will say with a lot of these devices
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:36:01,152	| IOT221 |	You want to check to see which Amazon services are
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:05,504	| IOT221 |	Example the First Alert does not support the newest amazon echo
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:11,392	| IOT221 |	That's kind of common with third-party implementations of these voice services
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:13,952	| IOT221 |	Now that's typically the newest features come to
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:18,560	| IOT221 |	Name brand eat the ones made by Amazon her by Google Etc
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:22,656	| IOT221 |	Eventually a lot of them filter down to third parties but not always
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:25,472	| IOT221 |	Yeah like some of the smart light switches and I think my
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:25,984	| IOT221 |	Ecobee
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:28,032	| IOT221 |	Thermostat doesn't play me
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:29,824	| IOT221 |	Right
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:30,592	| IOT221 |	Timothy
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:32,640	| IOT221 |	Vector
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:36,992	| IOT221 |	Which does have met him a built-in that you can get one pretty cheap since the company is
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:43,136	| IOT221 |	Perfect for turning lights on or asking the weather isn't such but I wouldn't play music
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:44,672	| IOT221 |	Actually
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:46,976	| IOT221 |	Which is a shame cuz you know DJ Roomba
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:49,536	| IOT221 |	He does dance if you're asking
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:51,328	| IOT221 |	All right
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:53,888	| IOT221 |	I feel like we're moving off now that we're talking about
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:54,400	| IOT221 |	What robots can do
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:37:01,312	| IOT221 |	Let's call it quits for this segment of the show I'd love for you to stay tuned because I have Elizabeth haakenson

EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:49,184	| IOT221 |	Excited to be here and sponsor this second
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:51,232	| IOT221 |	First people on the podcast probably know that
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,536	| IOT221 |	Surveillance cameras
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:58,144	| IOT221 |	For over 20 years
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:01,216	| IOT221 |	Don't be a sensor to become much more intelligent
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:03,264	| IOT221 |	Much more capable are driving a lot
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:06,848	| IOT221 |	This is requiring a customer
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:07,616	| IOT221 |	Look at 6
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:09,664	| IOT221 |	Security in a very new paradigm
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:12,992	| IOT221 |	Insecurities
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:15,808	| IOT221 |	And also wanted to integrate this video
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:16,832	| IOT221 |	Iot data
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:19,136	| IOT221 |	They wanted to apply analytics to make better decisions
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:21,952	| IOT221 |	This is happening
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:22,976	| IOT221 |	All about customer service
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:24,000	| IOT221 |	Oliver cast
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:27,072	| IOT221 |	It's a real challenge that we have right now
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:32,960	| IOT221 |	A few months ago Dell Technologies lunch the Dell Technologies iot solution for surveillance
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:36,288	| IOT221 |	He told me that this solution can handle
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:38,080	| IOT221 |	Some enormous use cases
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:42,176	| IOT221 |	I believe you got one customer with over 250000 cameras
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:43,968	| IOT221 |	And another who is dealing with
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:44,736	| IOT221 |	100 in
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:45,760	| IOT221 |	20 petabytes
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:46,528	| IOT221 |	A video store
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,832	| IOT221 |	That is an enormous amount of
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:50,368	| IOT221 |	Cameras and data
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:52,672	| IOT221 |	How has the solution changed
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:53,952	| IOT221 |	From the time that you've launched
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:56,768	| IOT221 |	We started with those complex cost
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:57,792	| IOT221 |	Bat size range
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:00,864	| IOT221 |	Challenges
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:03,680	| IOT221 |	Density of cameras and not quantity
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:07,264	| IOT221 |	Storage want to stop there
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:09,568	| IOT221 |	Downtobuck smaller system
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:12,384	| IOT221 |	What customers still have complexities and deployment
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:16,736	| IOT221 |	Envoy management life cycle management of all that begins
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:17,760	| IOT221 |	10 days.
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:18,272	| IOT221 |	Just 30 days
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:20,320	| IOT221 |	Years
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:25,184	| IOT221 |	Make it easier more scalable
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:27,488	| IOT221 |	Technology and Storage
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:29,280	| IOT221 |	That's what all right
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:30,560	| IOT221 |	Who would benefit most
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:31,072	| IOT221 |	From this type of
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:35,168	| IOT221 |	What great things about today

EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:49,312	| IOT221 |	How do you view your role
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:50,592	| IOT221 |	Is a CIO
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:52,895	| IOT221 |	When we're in the midst of this big digital transfer
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:59,551	| IOT221 |	Ayo for quite some time now I would say it's probably one of the most
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:00,831	| IOT221 |	Exciting times
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:02,367	| IOT221 |	To be a CIA
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:08,767	| IOT221 |	Even the digital transformation because it doesn't matter what industry that you are in
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:13,119	| IOT221 |	Your customers are what countries are located in we're all experienced
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:14,911	| IOT221 |	And seeing the benefits
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:21,311	| IOT221 |	Digital Technologies in so as CIO it's really important to get
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:26,175	| IOT221 |	Close to your customers and your business peers and determine how best
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:26,687	| IOT221 |	We go on
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,223	| IOT221 |	Digital Journey
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:33,599	| IOT221 |	Together and depending upon the company or with some cios are actually the one
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:34,111	| IOT221 |	Leading
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:35,647	| IOT221 |	The company
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:38,719	| IOT221 |	Digital efforts and then there's like Schneider
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:45,119	| IOT221 |	It was so big and we have so much going on with digital that two years ago the company
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:48,703	| IOT221 |	Decided to create a new rule called the chief digital officer
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:51,263	| IOT221 |	And Reporting into that role
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:52,799	| IOT221 |	Are folks like me
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:57,663	| IOT221 |	Myself she is the chief data officer
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:42:58,431	| IOT221 |	Other
EDL	00:42:58,431	00:43:00,991	| IOT221 |	Levels at the at the sea level
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:03,039	| IOT221 |	Who are also focusing on
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:04,319	| IOT221 |	Customer experience
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:06,623	| IOT221 |	Car services experience
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:07,903	| IOT221 |	So we're really a
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:08,927	| IOT221 |	Collection
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:10,719	| IOT221 |	Individual
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:14,047	| IOT221 |	To have deep experience and everything
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:17,119	| IOT221 |	From marketing service R&D
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:20,191	| IOT221 |	It security all coming together
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:23,263	| IOT221 |	Under the chief digital officer
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:24,287	| IOT221 |	Umbrella
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:27,103	| IOT221 |	To help lead the digital transformation
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:27,871	| IOT221 |	The company
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:34,271	| IOT221 |	Other companies do it could be very different from that in and asking either a CTO or
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:35,295	| IOT221 |	Ciot
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:41,695	| IOT221 |	Digital transformation but here we have a much broader scope of individuals working together to drive the tree
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:42,463	| IOT221 |	Information
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:46,303	| IOT221 |	That's why it's with a hundred thirty thousand people I can't imagine trying to
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:48,607	| IOT221 |	Change the course of that ship so
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:50,143	| IOT221 |	Makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:57,055	| IOT221 |	So in the role of CIO I'm really curious because we talked a lot about in these digital transformations
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:44:00,127	| IOT221 |	There's an itot divide and that's the
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:00,895	| IOT221 |	IT staff
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:02,943	| IOT221 |	An operational staff
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:05,759	| IOT221 |	You talked about it as a convergence which I think is totally Act
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:12,159	| IOT221 |	Can you talk a little bit about how that is working inside Schneider Electric as you guys undergo this digital
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:13,183	| IOT221 |	Transformation
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:18,047	| IOT221 |	As you mentioned we believe I can OT is about a convergent
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:22,655	| IOT221 |	And not a divided although it may be some who continue think that way
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:25,727	| IOT221 |	When cyber security started to become
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:28,287	| IOT221 |	More and more of a concern
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:31,359	| IOT221 |	Accompanies we realize that as we began
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:36,479	| IOT221 |	Take these traditional OT devices that didn't connect
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:40,063	| IOT221 |	2 to the internet and now do connect to the internet that's with B
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:43,135	| IOT221 |	Acronym of all your tears we realize that
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:44,927	| IOT221 |	There was no longer
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:46,207	| IOT221 |	The separation
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:52,095	| IOT221 |	Between OT and it they now we're going to begin to be on the same network communicate
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:53,119	| IOT221 |	Did together
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:54,911	| IOT221 |	Different types of
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:45:00,031	| IOT221 |	Systems that might be in factories excetera so it's blinking really be Enterprise
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:03,871	| IOT221 |	Systems to the systems that were contained in the past
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:06,687	| IOT221 |	But saying factories for example
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:07,967	| IOT221 |	So which is Convergence
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:09,759	| IOT221 |	We found that
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:16,927	| IOT221 |	More started to come into the IT realm or even to the CIO because
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:19,231	| IOT221 |	Many of our colleagues
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:21,279	| IOT221 |	Let's say here in plants and factories
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:27,167	| IOT221 |	Dismiss early pay a lot of attention to systems in the past most of what they use for self
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:33,567	| IOT221 |	Contained and all of a sudden they have their systems being exposed to the internet which means that they are now.
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:36,895	| IOT221 |	Vulnerable potentially for a Cyber attack
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:39,967	| IOT221 |	So I would say that the it organization and
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:43,551	| IOT221 |	Has been managing
EDL	00:45:43,551	00:45:45,087	| IOT221 |	Cyber-security for
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:47,647	| IOT221 |	Hazard enterprise system
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:54,047	| IOT221 |	I've been on the internet for you know at least a decade is not war we were very knowledgeable and aware
EDL	00:45:54,047	00:45:55,327	| IOT221 |	Of the different
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:46:01,727	| IOT221 |	Security practices that you would need only from access control but also different uses of software
EDL	00:46:01,727	00:46:03,519	| IOT221 |	To protect from cyber-attacks
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:05,311	| IOT221 |	So this convergence
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:06,079	| IOT221 |	For us
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:06,591	| IOT221 |	Schneider
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:08,383	| IOT221 |	Probably easier
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:10,175	| IOT221 |	Then maybe others
EDL	00:46:10,175	00:46:11,455	| IOT221 |	Just you two are
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:12,479	| IOT221 |	Extensive
EDL	00:46:12,479	00:46:17,855	| IOT221 |	It footprint not only in our offices but also within our plants in our factories
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:23,999	| IOT221 |	And I'm curious because when I go and visit plants and factories and I talked to them about security
EDL	00:46:23,999	00:46:27,583	| IOT221 |	I feel like a lot of these operationally focused individuals
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:28,351	| IOT221 |	They have
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:30,399	| IOT221 |	Wonderful training
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:36,543	| IOT221 |	And they have things like OSHA rules are ISO rules that they have to follow for security and safety
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:37,823	| IOT221 |	And I look at that and I think
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:44,735	| IOT221 |	Hey a lot of times that's sort of training and probably documentation would be actually really X
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:47,807	| IOT221 |	Excellent in the IT world and we don't have things like that
EDL	00:46:47,807	00:46:50,623	| IOT221 |	Go out maybe to all of the employees for example
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:56,767	| IOT221 |	And I'm curious maybe what are the best practices each side could take from each other to improve security
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:46:59,839	| IOT221 |	I would say that it's a partnership
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:01,375	| IOT221 |	Speak about
EDL	00:47:01,375	00:47:07,775	| IOT221 |	Our company because that's the one I'm I'm closest to on the subject in the gentleman who leads our
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:08,287	| IOT221 |	Supply chain
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:11,615	| IOT221 |	His team and I would say the chief
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:12,895	| IOT221 |	Digital officer
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:13,663	| IOT221 |	Teams
EDL	00:47:13,663	00:47:16,991	| IOT221 |	We are very tightly coupled as well as our chief
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:17,759	| IOT221 |	Information
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:19,295	| IOT221 |	Security officer so
EDL	00:47:19,295	00:47:22,367	| IOT221 |	We look at the group's working hand-in-hand
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:30,559	| IOT221 |	So while we certainly will I Upon Our plants in our distribution center
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:34,399	| IOT221 |	To implement the nist standards and framework
EDL	00:47:35,935	00:47:38,751	| IOT221 |	For cyber-security you know obviously we're always willing
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:39,519	| IOT221 |	To learn
EDL	00:47:39,519	00:47:41,055	| IOT221 |	And in fact
EDL	00:47:41,055	00:47:43,103	| IOT221 |	The way we look at protecting our FAQ
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:47,455	| IOT221 |	Factories in our distribution centers is with an individual from the global
EDL	00:47:48,479	00:47:50,015	| IOT221 |	Who is coming from
EDL	00:47:50,015	00:47:51,807	| IOT221 |	More of the safety background
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:52,575	| IOT221 |	In the plant
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:54,623	| IOT221 |	And we're we're merging
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:57,183	| IOT221 |	Viewpoint the best of both
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:48:02,047	| IOT221 |	Operational best practices as well as it in cyber best
EDL	00:48:02,559	00:48:04,607	| IOT221 |	And I do believe that
EDL	00:48:04,607	00:48:08,191	| IOT221 |	The pace at which we are moving and implementing
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:08,703	| IOT221 |	Our plans
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:10,751	| IOT221 |	Is phenomenal
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:16,895	| IOT221 |	I know I talked to a lot of other cio2 Vikings are still trying to figure out maybe the the division
EDL	00:48:17,407	00:48:22,527	| IOT221 |	Between the organizations and what we decided to do and I think it was just part of
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:23,295	| IOT221 |	The wave
EDL	00:48:23,295	00:48:29,183	| IOT221 |	Some of the leaders are we took down all the higher keys and and the different lines between us
EDL	00:48:29,183	00:48:35,071	| IOT221 |	And we realized that we were better working together than as a as a divide
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:38,911	| IOT221 |	And being open to any of the best practices that we could bring to the table
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:40,447	| IOT221 |	Excellent
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:42,751	| IOT221 |	And another challenge on this side
EDL	00:48:42,751	00:48:43,519	| IOT221 |	What is that
EDL	00:48:43,519	00:48:44,287	| IOT221 |	It
EDL	00:48:44,287	00:48:45,567	| IOT221 |	Typically has
EDL	00:48:45,567	00:48:48,383	| IOT221 |	You know you think of things like a child which is a very big
EDL	00:48:48,383	00:48:52,223	| IOT221 |	Development process that everyone's espousing and you think of things like
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:54,015	| IOT221 |	Hey if your plant manager
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:58,111	| IOT221 |	You don't want to change everything you just want something that works and you want to stick with it
EDL	00:48:58,111	00:49:03,231	| IOT221 |	Hopefully it doesn't break right so it feels like these are very different worldviews that have evolved for
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:09,887	| IOT221 |	Really good reasons how do you build compromise how do you take from each world how do those things work in practice it
EDL	00:49:10,399	00:49:13,727	| IOT221 |	Because I know that you know I've got cio's of hospitals were like
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:16,287	| IOT221 |	Don't know how I talk to these people
EDL	00:49:16,287	00:49:21,919	| IOT221 |	This is a big challenge people don't know where things are and you don't talk to cios in other Industries and they're just
EDL	00:49:21,919	00:49:23,711	| IOT221 |	Are flummoxed they don't know how
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:24,479	| IOT221 |	How to do this
EDL	00:49:24,991	00:49:27,551	| IOT221 |	What I would say that one needs to start with
EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:29,599	| IOT221 |	Maybe
EDL	00:49:29,599	00:49:30,623	| IOT221 |	The internet
EDL	00:49:30,623	00:49:32,671	| IOT221 |	The iot products
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:34,463	| IOT221 |	Because
EDL	00:49:34,463	00:49:38,815	| IOT221 |	We have to be talking to someone in our company would be
EDL	00:49:38,815	00:49:44,191	| IOT221 |	The head of the plan for the distribution center and Hospital you know it would probably be the facilities group
EDL	00:49:44,191	00:49:47,775	| IOT221 |	They are getting very excited about these internet
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:51,615	| IOT221 |	Things because it's allowing them to better manage
EDL	00:49:51,615	00:49:53,663	| IOT221 |	Are acid they can
EDL	00:49:53,663	00:50:00,063	| IOT221 |	And get real-time visibility and insight into the connected assets they can look at energy efficient
EDL	00:50:00,063	00:50:01,599	| IOT221 |	Be more readily
EDL	00:50:01,599	00:50:03,903	| IOT221 |	As we get excited about implement
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:09,791	| IOT221 |	These new capabilities in the conversation that has to happen about
EDL	00:50:09,791	00:50:10,559	| IOT221 |	Safety
EDL	00:50:10,559	00:50:12,863	| IOT221 |	Around this because in many cases
EDL	00:50:12,863	00:50:16,191	| IOT221 |	Again the information is being stored on
EDL	00:50:16,191	00:50:19,775	| IOT221 |	Cloud so there is an internet connection and even though
EDL	00:50:20,799	00:50:24,639	| IOT221 |	You were and maybe the data encrypted on the way up and down
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:26,431	| IOT221 |	You're still vulnerable
EDL	00:50:26,431	00:50:28,735	| IOT221 |	Tubitv a cybersecurity attack
EDL	00:50:29,247	00:50:30,527	| IOT221 |	So you have to
EDL	00:50:30,527	00:50:32,831	| IOT221 |	Talk to each other in terms that you want
EDL	00:50:34,111	00:50:36,927	| IOT221 |	Not talking in fiber Buzz language
EDL	00:50:36,927	00:50:38,463	| IOT221 |	And it's talking about
EDL	00:50:38,463	00:50:39,743	| IOT221 |	What are the risk
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:41,791	| IOT221 |	What are the mitigation Settlers Ridge
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:43,327	| IOT221 |	How do we work together
EDL	00:50:43,327	00:50:45,887	| IOT221 |	And again listening to each other because I
EDL	00:50:45,887	00:50:52,287	| IOT221 |	I feel what happens is that sometimes you put the wrong people in front of each other we take the technical
EDL	00:50:52,287	00:50:58,431	| IOT221 |	Cheap person or the heavy technical cyber person and we're putting them in front of
EDL	00:50:58,943	00:51:02,783	| IOT221 |	Maybe an individual who knows how to run their plant or Hospital
EDL	00:51:02,783	00:51:05,599	| IOT221 |	But he's not as familiar with what
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:06,367	| IOT221 |	A cloud
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:09,183	| IOT221 |	What do you mean my information is being stored somewhere else
EDL	00:51:09,183	00:51:10,975	| IOT221 |	So I really think it's about
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:12,511	| IOT221 |	Listening to each other
EDL	00:51:12,511	00:51:14,815	| IOT221 |	And making sure that you're using the most
EDL	00:51:14,815	00:51:16,351	| IOT221 |	Basic terms in Landen
EDL	00:51:17,119	00:51:23,519	| IOT221 |	Because this is so very new to a lot of people and I think the first thing we do is just not her headache
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:24,543	| IOT221 |	Each other
EDL	00:51:24,543	00:51:26,591	| IOT221 |	You don't think okay that I don't know what that person
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:32,991	| IOT221 |	Nothing but I believe them and I I just moved over with my job instead of really taking the time to say I don't
EDL	00:51:32,991	00:51:37,343	| IOT221 |	Understand what that means I don't understand the risk how does this work and really be able to talk
EDL	00:51:37,855	00:51:39,647	| IOT221 |	People at their level
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:41,439	| IOT221 |	And using language that sings Aaliyah
EDL	00:51:42,975	00:51:43,999	| IOT221 |	I like it
EDL	00:51:43,999	00:51:45,279	| IOT221 |	I think that's always a good idea
EDL	00:51:45,791	00:51:52,191	| IOT221 |	So you actually are doing something with this at Schneider Electric you guys not only have launched
EDL	00:51:52,191	00:51:54,495	| IOT221 |	A product called ether structure which is
EDL	00:51:54,495	00:51:57,055	| IOT221 |	Organize building management infrastructure
EDL	00:51:57,055	00:51:57,823	| IOT221 |	But
EDL	00:51:57,823	00:52:02,431	| IOT221 |	You guys are implementing this in your own facilities so can you tell us a little bit about ecostruxure
EDL	00:52:02,943	00:52:04,735	| IOT221 |	And what you're doing with that
EDL	00:52:05,759	00:52:08,575	| IOT221 |	So we can structure fits nicely into what we call our
EDL	00:52:09,087	00:52:10,367	| IOT221 |	Factory program
EDL	00:52:10,367	00:52:15,743	| IOT221 |	So we use the our ecostruxure iot Technologies in our manufacturing plant
EDL	00:52:16,255	00:52:16,767	| IOT221 |	Facilities
EDL	00:52:17,279	00:52:20,351	| IOT221 |	And even many of our offices as we would offer it
EDL	00:52:20,351	00:52:20,863	| IOT221 |	To our custom
EDL	00:52:21,375	00:52:27,775	| IOT221 |	Start everything from building Energy Management to Internet of Things
EDL	00:52:27,775	00:52:28,799	| IOT221 |	Operators
EDL	00:52:28,799	00:52:34,175	| IOT221 |	We actually showcase these to our customers and we've done this in France
EDL	00:52:34,175	00:52:35,199	| IOT221 |	India
EDL	00:52:35,199	00:52:37,247	| IOT221 |	In China we implemented
EDL	00:52:37,247	00:52:43,647	| IOT221 |	A couple of our products Under the ecostruxure Umbrella one was augmented operator advisor and
EDL	00:52:43,647	00:52:44,415	| IOT221 |	Enables
EDL	00:52:44,927	00:52:45,951	| IOT221 |	Are operators
EDL	00:52:45,951	00:52:49,791	| IOT221 |	To use augmented reality to speed up an operation and maintenance
EDL	00:52:50,303	00:52:54,143	| IOT221 |	And we've been delivering between 2 and 7%
EDL	00:52:54,143	00:52:55,167	| IOT221 |	Guinea productivity
EDL	00:52:55,679	00:52:59,775	| IOT221 |	We also have implemented our ecostruxure resource advisor
EDL	00:53:00,287	00:53:03,615	| IOT221 |	Which delivers up to 30% Energy savings
EDL	00:53:04,127	00:53:05,407	| IOT221 |	And contribute
EDL	00:53:05,407	00:53:08,223	| IOT221 |	Two continuous Improvement throughout the years
EDL	00:53:08,223	00:53:10,271	| IOT221 |	So those are just two examples of us
EDL	00:53:10,271	00:53:14,367	| IOT221 |	Showcasing to our customers ecostruxure iot
EDL	00:53:14,367	00:53:16,159	| IOT221 |	Products that we are
EDL	00:53:16,159	00:53:17,439	| IOT221 |	Using ourselves
EDL	00:53:17,439	00:53:18,719	| IOT221 |	And sharing
EDL	00:53:18,719	00:53:20,511	| IOT221 |	Obviously the productivity gains
EDL	00:53:21,023	00:53:22,047	| IOT221 |	And where the energy
EDL	00:53:22,047	00:53:22,559	| IOT221 |	Keysavings
EDL	00:53:23,071	00:53:24,863	| IOT221 |	And we plan to implement
EDL	00:53:24,863	00:53:27,167	| IOT221 |	These products and services in
EDL	00:53:27,679	00:53:28,959	| IOT221 |	Our Industrial
EDL	00:53:28,959	00:53:31,007	| IOT221 |	Footprint which today includes
EDL	00:53:31,007	00:53:32,799	| IOT221 |	Over 200 factories
EDL	00:53:32,799	00:53:34,079	| IOT221 |	8 / 44
EDL	00:53:34,079	00:53:36,383	| IOT221 |	Countries that we are Representatives
EDL	00:53:37,407	00:53:41,247	| IOT221 |	As part of this implementation how involved do you get
EDL	00:53:41,247	00:53:47,391	| IOT221 |	And what is your role is the CIO in trying to roll this ecostruxure platform out to more and more
EDL	00:53:47,903	00:53:48,927	| IOT221 |	Plants or building
EDL	00:53:49,951	00:53:53,791	| IOT221 |	The first thing we need to do is make sure that the connectivity
EDL	00:53:53,791	00:53:58,655	| IOT221 |	Is available in the planter the Distribution Center so that traditionally
EDL	00:53:58,655	00:54:00,703	| IOT221 |	Those clients have not been opened up
EDL	00:54:00,703	00:54:04,287	| IOT221 |	To the Internet so we have to make sure one that they have the right level of
EDL	00:54:04,287	00:54:10,175	| IOT221 |	Connectivity and bandwidth to this is all wireless connected so we have to make sure there's enough
EDL	00:54:10,175	00:54:12,479	| IOT221 |	Points within the facilities
EDL	00:54:12,991	00:54:16,063	| IOT221 |	To ensure that the Internet of Things devices
EDL	00:54:16,063	00:54:19,903	| IOT221 |	Can actually communicate and if I talkin to cio's out there
EDL	00:54:19,903	00:54:22,719	| IOT221 |	I would say this is probably the biggest learning
EDL	00:54:23,231	00:54:25,279	| IOT221 |	Is one having enough bandwidth
EDL	00:54:25,279	00:54:27,839	| IOT221 |	Ain't you making sure that there are enough taxes
EDL	00:54:27,839	00:54:28,607	| IOT221 |	Points because
EDL	00:54:29,119	00:54:35,263	| IOT221 |	Access twins get congested very very quickly even within being 20 to 25 feet apart
EDL	00:54:35,775	00:54:38,335	| IOT221 |	So that's a big learning how do we make sure that we have all the
EDL	00:54:38,335	00:54:39,359	| IOT221 |	Connectivity in place
EDL	00:54:39,871	00:54:42,687	| IOT221 |	Then it's really ensuring that
EDL	00:54:42,687	00:54:44,479	| IOT221 |	We can protect
EDL	00:54:44,991	00:54:51,135	| IOT221 |	The assets that are in that facility from a cyber perspective so it's putting in different types of
EDL	00:54:51,135	00:54:52,415	| IOT221 |	Software
EDL	00:54:52,415	00:54:53,695	| IOT221 |	One two names
EDL	00:54:53,695	00:54:56,767	| IOT221 |	Is Clarity which allows us to discover assets
EDL	00:54:56,767	00:54:57,535	| IOT221 |	In
EDL	00:54:57,535	00:55:00,095	| IOT221 |	The plant or the Distribution Center
EDL	00:55:00,095	00:55:02,143	| IOT221 |	And alert us if something new
EDL	00:55:02,143	00:55:05,727	| IOT221 |	Is identify we put in all of our best practices around
EDL	00:55:07,007	00:55:08,799	| IOT221 |	Certain pieces of equipment
EDL	00:55:08,799	00:55:12,383	| IOT221 |	And then of course we're layering different authentication layers as to who
EDL	00:55:12,895	00:55:15,711	| IOT221 |	Maintain these systems and maybe upgrade them
EDL	00:55:15,711	00:55:17,759	| IOT221 |	So aside from ensuring
EDL	00:55:17,759	00:55:24,159	| IOT221 |	Add all of these pieces of equipment can actually communicate to each other then we move into ensuring that there is proper
EDL	00:55:24,159	00:55:25,695	| IOT221 |	Security around the environment
EDL	00:55:26,463	00:55:26,975	| IOT221 |	Got it
EDL	00:55:27,487	00:55:32,095	| IOT221 |	Real fast on the security front because I think this is something that's really important
EDL	00:55:32,095	00:55:32,863	| IOT221 |	Drive-In
EDL	00:55:32,863	00:55:33,887	| IOT221 |	Which is
EDL	00:55:33,887	00:55:35,423	| IOT221 |	An IT side
EDL	00:55:35,423	00:55:36,447	| IOT221 |	I see a lot of
EDL	00:55:36,447	00:55:37,727	| IOT221 |	People emphasizing
EDL	00:55:38,239	00:55:40,543	| IOT221 |	Two different types of security one is Network
EDL	00:55:40,543	00:55:43,359	| IOT221 |	Apus security so monitoring device traffic on your network
EDL	00:55:44,127	00:55:46,175	| IOT221 |	Sample and saying hey this is behaving weird
EDL	00:55:46,175	00:55:47,455	| IOT221 |	And then to
EDL	00:55:47,455	00:55:53,855	| IOT221 |	Is are things like Microsoft Azure sphere is one it's this device base security
EDL	00:55:53,855	00:55:55,903	| IOT221 |	It also does a handshake
EDL	00:55:55,903	00:55:58,463	| IOT221 |	To the cloud it's usually key based
EDL	00:55:58,463	00:56:01,023	| IOT221 |	So Microsoft has something arm PSA
EDL	00:56:01,023	00:56:03,071	| IOT221 |	Is a way to implement this as well
EDL	00:56:03,071	00:56:05,119	| IOT221 |	Those two things seem very complimentary
EDL	00:56:05,887	00:56:06,655	| IOT221 |	But
EDL	00:56:06,655	00:56:13,055	| IOT221 |	I'm curious if that's enough for the OT World which historically hasn't been as security
EDL	00:56:13,055	00:56:14,335	| IOT221 |	Focused because
EDL	00:56:14,335	00:56:15,615	| IOT221 |	It hasn't been on the internet
EDL	00:56:16,639	00:56:18,943	| IOT221 |	Or are you seeing other
EDL	00:56:18,943	00:56:21,247	| IOT221 |	Types of security related to
EDL	00:56:21,759	00:56:22,783	| IOT221 |	The address to physical
EDL	00:56:24,831	00:56:27,903	| IOT221 |	That's what we're seeing very targeted companies
EDL	00:56:27,903	00:56:28,671	| IOT221 |	Focused on
EDL	00:56:28,671	00:56:29,695	| IOT221 |	Unsecured eGo-T
EDL	00:56:30,207	00:56:31,487	| IOT221 |	So the first thing that we
EDL	00:56:31,487	00:56:33,023	| IOT221 |	We need to do is make sure that weird
EDL	00:56:33,023	00:56:33,791	| IOT221 |	Discovering
EDL	00:56:33,791	00:56:35,071	| IOT221 |	All of the assets
EDL	00:56:35,071	00:56:36,095	| IOT221 |	That are
EDL	00:56:36,095	00:56:37,119	| IOT221 |	Within the plant
EDL	00:56:37,119	00:56:39,679	| IOT221 |	Or the distribution center in so we are using
EDL	00:56:40,191	00:56:41,471	| IOT221 |	Suffer from a company
EDL	00:56:41,471	00:56:42,495	| IOT221 |	Cold clarity
EDL	00:56:42,495	00:56:43,519	| IOT221 |	So that's helping us
EDL	00:56:43,519	00:56:46,079	| IOT221 |	Identify things that maybe we didn't know
EDL	00:56:46,079	00:56:47,871	| IOT221 |	Run the network but then we also have
EDL	00:56:47,871	00:56:49,407	| IOT221 |	Have to figure out once we identify some
EDL	00:56:50,175	00:56:51,711	| IOT221 |	That is new what do we do with it
EDL	00:56:51,711	00:56:53,247	| IOT221 |	Containerize it
EDL	00:56:53,247	00:56:54,527	| IOT221 |	Is it actually a thread
EDL	00:56:55,039	00:56:57,599	| IOT221 |	Is it just a new piece of equipment that
EDL	00:56:57,599	00:56:59,391	| IOT221 |	Came onto the scene that we
EDL	00:56:59,391	00:57:00,671	| IOT221 |	Might not have known about
EDL	00:57:00,671	00:57:01,951	| IOT221 |	So those types of
EDL	00:57:02,463	00:57:03,487	| IOT221 |	Technologies
EDL	00:57:03,487	00:57:03,999	| IOT221 |	AR
EDL	00:57:05,279	00:57:06,303	| IOT221 |	And
EDL	00:57:06,303	00:57:07,839	| IOT221 |	I would say that at this
EDL	00:57:07,839	00:57:08,607	| IOT221 |	Point
EDL	00:57:08,607	00:57:11,935	| IOT221 |	The best approaches multi-layered which is
EDL	00:57:11,935	00:57:13,727	| IOT221 |	What I believe we're doing from
EDL	00:57:14,239	00:57:16,287	| IOT221 |	The network perspective shows
EDL	00:57:16,287	00:57:17,311	| IOT221 |	Securing
EDL	00:57:17,311	00:57:18,079	| IOT221 |	And
EDL	00:57:18,079	00:57:18,847	| IOT221 |	Segmenting
EDL	00:57:19,359	00:57:23,199	| IOT221 |	Let's say the factories the distribution centers the hospital
EDL	00:57:23,199	00:57:25,247	| IOT221 |	And then having a discovery layer
EDL	00:57:25,759	00:57:28,063	| IOT221 |	On top of that then having policies
EDL	00:57:28,575	00:57:32,927	| IOT221 |	That can help us determine if we identify a new acid should it be there
EDL	00:57:32,927	00:57:36,767	| IOT221 |	And then we're also beginning to test software
EDL	00:57:37,279	00:57:38,047	| IOT221 |	On
EDL	00:57:38,047	00:57:39,071	| IOT221 |	Behavioral Analytics
EDL	00:57:39,839	00:57:40,863	| IOT221 |	So there is
EDL	00:57:41,375	00:57:44,191	| IOT221 |	A lot of data that can be captured
EDL	00:57:44,703	00:57:47,007	| IOT221 |	And we can look for Behavior pattern
EDL	00:57:47,007	00:57:49,567	| IOT221 |	But I think we're going to continue to see the advancement
EDL	00:57:50,079	00:57:51,103	| IOT221 |	A multi-layered
EDL	00:57:51,103	00:57:51,871	| IOT221 |	Security
EDL	00:57:51,871	00:57:53,151	| IOT221 |	Not
EDL	00:57:53,151	00:57:57,759	| IOT221 |	Very similar to what we already have been building for decades in the traditional it sent
EDL	00:57:58,527	00:57:59,295	| IOT221 |	Excellent
EDL	00:57:59,295	00:58:01,343	| IOT221 |	All right will Elizabeth this is been really
EDL	00:58:01,855	00:58:02,623	| IOT221 |	Helpful
EDL	00:58:02,623	00:58:06,463	| IOT221 |	I feel smarter about the OT it convergence I feel
EDL	00:58:06,463	00:58:09,023	| IOT221 |	Less terrified about cyber-physical security
EDL	00:58:09,535	00:58:15,935	| IOT221 |	And I appreciate you coming on the show this week thank you so much that's it for this week
EDL	00:58:15,935	00:58:22,335	| IOT221 |	Thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like more iot news sign up for my newsletter at today
EDL	00:58:22,335	00:58:26,175	| IOT221 |	Stacey on iot. Cam will see you next week
