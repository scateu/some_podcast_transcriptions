EDL	00:00:25,600	00:00:30,976	| cesfinal |	Platform abridging specification and open source implementation and a certification program
EDL	00:00:30,976	00:00:34,304	| cesfinal |	It allows devices to communicate regardless of form factor
EDL	00:00:34,304	00:00:35,584	| cesfinal |	Operating system
EDL	00:00:35,584	00:00:38,144	| cesfinal |	Service provider transport technology
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:38,912	| cesfinal |	Or
EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:39,424	| cesfinal |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:44,288	| cesfinal |	At this year's CES The Internet of Things was the default setting
EDL	00:00:44,288	00:00:46,848	| cesfinal |	Booth after Booth featured sensors
EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:49,920	| cesfinal |	Hubs or Randall devices that connected to the internet
EDL	00:00:49,920	00:00:51,968	| cesfinal |	Even among the major chip vendors
EDL	00:00:51,968	00:00:53,760	| cesfinal |	There were stations dedicated to
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:57,600	| cesfinal |	Retail and beacons Telehealth or 5G technology
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:01:01,440	| cesfinal |	And the pig topic was how to connect more things to the internet
EDL	00:01:02,464	00:01:08,864	| cesfinal |	So with that in mind I interviewed all kinds of people on the show floor and in meetings along the strip to get a sense of where
EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:10,912	| cesfinal |	The Internet of Things is headed and why it matters
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:14,240	| cesfinal |	Connectivity and power consumption were big
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:17,312	| cesfinal |	But so is the lingering concern about the viability of the
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:18,080	| cesfinal |	Consumer Market
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:18,592	| cesfinal |	For startups
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:20,384	| cesfinal |	Just a note for you guys
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:22,944	| cesfinal |	I know that Madame a and
EDL	00:01:23,456	00:01:24,992	| cesfinal |	Google home or everywhere
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:28,064	| cesfinal |	And that's the big story that most people took away
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:28,832	| cesfinal |	From the show
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:31,136	| cesfinal |	But I'm trying to go a little bit deeper
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:32,160	| cesfinal |	Cell
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:37,024	| cesfinal |	Let's kick off the show first with a focus on the consumer news in insights
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:37,792	| cesfinal |	Starting with Comcast
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:42,400	| cesfinal |	Comcast purchase stringify last year's one of the mini smart home deals that are
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:49,312	| cesfinal |	And now we know what they're going to do with it is Chris specialty EVP and chief product officer at the cable Giant
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,664	| cesfinal |	You guys are
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:56,224	| cesfinal |	Smart home automation for all
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:02:00,832	| cesfinal |	That's a lot of our listeners
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:01,856	| cesfinal |	Stone In Love
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:05,184	| cesfinal |	So what exactly are you doing the stringify for your custom
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:10,560	| cesfinal |	So we we love stringify because they have a great number of adopters
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:13,632	| cesfinal |	Steeple relationship zip login
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:18,752	| cesfinal |	Taken
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:19,776	| cesfinal |	Paradoxes
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:21,056	| cesfinal |	Little Dalmatian system
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,848	| cesfinal |	Combined it with our own that we were building
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:31,552	| cesfinal |	Available
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:35,136	| cesfinal |	Initially for everybody with an ex by Kate we were Moss gateway to everybody
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:39,744	| cesfinal |	Eventually
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:41,792	| cesfinal |	Home automation making it just a layer in the home
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:45,888	| cesfinal |	So as a user what is this going to look like for me when it
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,168	| cesfinal |	Pops into my Comcast world
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:49,216	| cesfinal |	So imagine the system
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:54,336	| cesfinal |	Knows what you do everyday and Sons if you leave in the morning because you on the alarm system
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:56,640	| cesfinal |	You lock your door the camera sees you leave
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,688	| cesfinal |	What we can do is
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:07,648	| cesfinal |	Set up for you
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:12,512	| cesfinal |	And all for you that is a single sub is so that you never have to get any of that again it don't go through all those steps
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,584	| cesfinal |	So you're basically turning my 8 steps into one
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:19,424	| cesfinal |	Will send you a steps into one I'm making it simple to integrate
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:25,056	| cesfinal |	I'm not in the Comcast service area so what happened
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:26,080	| cesfinal |	Stringify for me
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:31,200	| cesfinal |	Are you still be able to use string find the Comcast Lobster you know to lose your stringify kind
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,736	| cesfinal |	An older great Services already provided
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,272	| cesfinal |	Alright thank you

EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,343	| cesfinal |	You should expect is
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:54,623	| cesfinal |	Much
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,183	| cesfinal |	More Innovation higher spacepaste
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,231	| cesfinal |	Invasion of the course the next couple
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,255	| cesfinal |	You seen it
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:04,351	| cesfinal |	Point where more than 50000 Developers
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,119	| cesfinal |	Sign up for a new
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:06,143	| cesfinal |	Developer tools
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:07,167	| cesfinal |	This new app.
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,471	| cesfinal |	On every device with a
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:10,751	| cesfinal |	Screen
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:11,519	| cesfinal |	Innovating
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,311	| cesfinal |	New ways and create new interfaces
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:15,103	| cesfinal |	Does an apps that run on any
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:15,871	| cesfinal |	Of these devices
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,639	| cesfinal |	Around the world
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,687	| cesfinal |	And so I just think that that is
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,967	| cesfinal |	It's going to open up a new
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:21,503	| cesfinal |	A whole new space of
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:23,295	| cesfinal |	Mission by the developer
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,575	| cesfinal |	That'll make
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,111	| cesfinal |	Some awesome things happen
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:35,839	| cesfinal |	Let's take a quick break for message when they open connectivity Foundation
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:42,239	| cesfinal |	Alright Dave last year we heard for the open connectivity
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,263	| cesfinal |	Foundation
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:46,335	| cesfinal |	And it was after the merger with the all seeing Alliance
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,871	| cesfinal |	And I owe tivity was out
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:51,199	| cesfinal |	But then we didn't hear a lot from you guys in this last year
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:51,967	| cesfinal |	You're so
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,991	| cesfinal |	Where are you today
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:57,855	| cesfinal |	2017 was really a year for a say retrenching
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:04,767	| cesfinal |	And re-establishing the work that was underway in 2016 prior to the all seeing I'll join
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,815	| cesfinal |	Merger with the OIC
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:11,935	| cesfinal |	Perform the open connectivity Foundation we've been on a path to publish the first
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:16,031	| cesfinal |	Release of our specification and open source code through Teva t
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:22,431	| cesfinal |	And we had actually done that we were just in the process of getting some of the first implementation
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:25,503	| cesfinal |	When the murder occurred and to be honest post
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:27,039	| cesfinal |	Of the organization
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:29,343	| cesfinal |	Involved in the merger and the leadership said
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:32,415	| cesfinal |	Hey look slow down the work-in-progress
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:35,231	| cesfinal |	Let's take a look and make sure that we're bringing the best
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,279	| cesfinal |	Both of these organizations
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:40,095	| cesfinal |	New technologies and specifications to bear
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,119	| cesfinal |	EXO
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:43,935	| cesfinal |	Each of the respective groups underneath basically took
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,703	| cesfinal |	The time
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:49,823	| cesfinal |	And you know what may have seemed dormant to a lot of folks in Industry actually wasn't we were
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:54,175	| cesfinal |	Deep in the throes of going through reviewing the specs bring the best out
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,967	| cesfinal |	Reincorporating nose and
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,759	| cesfinal |	Quite honestly had a
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:10:02,623	| cesfinal |	Very effective results from that in the recent announcement in publication
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:05,439	| cesfinal |	Of the new specification to come out post-merger
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:07,743	| cesfinal |	Less known associate version 1.3
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:13,631	| cesfinal |	And with the corresponding release of the activity open source code
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,423	| cesfinal |	To go along with it
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:18,751	| cesfinal |	The results of the specification open source and surf
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,543	| cesfinal |	Application from the 1.3 effort
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:26,687	| cesfinal |	Has now resulted in products coming to Market and the first wave of rocf
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,711	| cesfinal |	Logo devices
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:38,463	| cesfinal |	For the final day consumer story I spoke with Ben Nader CEO of butterfly
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:38,975	| cesfinal |	About
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,279	| cesfinal |	Puma acquiring his smart camera
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:45,119	| cesfinal |	We discuss the deal the saturation in the camera Market
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:48,447	| cesfinal |	And what other consumer startups should look for in an acquisition partner
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:51,263	| cesfinal |	Because you're probably going to need
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:58,431	| cesfinal |	My name is Ben Nader and I am the founder of butterfly and now I am the GM for the butterfly product line
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:05,343	| cesfinal |	Great the first thing I noticed is that I have been saying butterfly wrong cuz I'm always like butterfly I
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:06,879	| cesfinal |	So
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,183	| cesfinal |	Saturnino you guys just got bought by Uma
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:13,791	| cesfinal |	Can you talk to me about the decision to sell your company and how that came about
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:18,911	| cesfinal |	Yes I I really think it was one of those situations that one plus one equal to 3
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:24,799	| cesfinal |	So we built this great product we put a lot of engineering and R&D into it I thought it was very differentiating
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:27,871	| cesfinal |	What woman had a really great
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:30,943	| cesfinal |	Security system but it was missing the camera piece
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:36,063	| cesfinal |	As well as they have a well-established brand name to have a big sales and marketing team
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:39,647	| cesfinal |	What are they wanted to grow butterfly name and Brandon get the product out there
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:41,951	| cesfinal |	Are we going to have a large sales and marketing team
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:46,559	| cesfinal |	Say what's a cat it was a great match it's like what I said one plus one equal three
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,327	| cesfinal |	IHOP
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:51,167	| cesfinal |	A lot of companies that build smart home devices in the last
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,447	| cesfinal |	Couple months of seoul
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:57,311	| cesfinal |	Because they found the market to be just really tough to be like differentiated and sell to Consumers
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:59,103	| cesfinal |	Was that your experience at all
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:05,503	| cesfinal |	You know that the camera Market was crowded but we were we were backed by some good to be seasoned
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:08,575	| cesfinal |	We had opportunity to continue and and raise more money
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:11,647	| cesfinal |	But I really appreciate it was to accelerate the sale
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:15,487	| cesfinal |	An accelerator Channel access to channel and sugar to the market
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:17,535	| cesfinal |	Various marketing and branding opportunities
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,047	| cesfinal |	We have

EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:21,631	| cesfinal |	Other
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:23,423	| cesfinal |	Connected devices
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,191	| cesfinal |	Smart home companies
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:25,727	| cesfinal |	Going into this year
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:29,567	| cesfinal |	Find this one plus one equal three
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:33,919	| cesfinal |	Find this visit just a marriage that one plus one can add something bigger
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:37,503	| cesfinal |	Lumineers is whole security complete Security System
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:43,903	| cesfinal |	As well as a bigger sales in China that day one that can attach to your company I'm be able to to groin
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:45,695	| cesfinal |	Awesome thank you thank you
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:49,279	| cesfinal |	And now let's move on to the Enterprise
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:56,191	| cesfinal |	CES is obviously about the consumer but people probably show floor from all Industries seeking the next big thing
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:13:01,055	| cesfinal |	I ran into a gentleman who worked in R&D at a Building Products Manufacturing
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:05,151	| cesfinal |	Explain what technologies might Inspire our future housing
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,455	| cesfinal |	I work for a building product manufacturer
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:09,503	| cesfinal |	Okay what are those guys do
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:11,039	| cesfinal |	I pretty
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:11,807	| cesfinal |	Zenni
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:12,831	| cesfinal |	I'm not anybody
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,111	| cesfinal |	Building products that are used in
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,391	| cesfinal |	Construction global
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,463	| cesfinal |	What are you doing at CVS what are you looking for
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,023	| cesfinal |	Well our team is a
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,559	| cesfinal |	Research and development group
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:26,655	| cesfinal |	Looking for emerging Technologies new could leverage for the building industry
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:29,727	| cesfinal |	Okay and it sounded like you were excited about the
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:30,495	| cesfinal |	Smart home stuff
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,799	| cesfinal |	Are like have you seen anything that
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:34,079	| cesfinal |	Caught your eye
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,359	| cesfinal |	Not yet
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:37,151	| cesfinal |	Only been here very short amount of time
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,431	| cesfinal |	Baidu
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:40,735	| cesfinal |	Anything that could be
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,271	| cesfinal |	Applicable to products
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:44,831	| cesfinal |	It weather is tracking materials or
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:48,159	| cesfinal |	Connected devices is something we're very interested in
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:49,183	| cesfinal |	Visualizing
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:52,255	| cesfinal |	Materials like augmented reality and virtual reality
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,279	| cesfinal |	Reading Plus right now
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:54,815	| cesfinal |	One of the things
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:59,423	| cesfinal |	Things that people are kind of talking to me about is the idea we're going to build our sensors into walls
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,191	| cesfinal |	Which to me sounds
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:01,215	| cesfinal |	The same because power
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:02,751	| cesfinal |	Consumption and all this other stuff
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:05,567	| cesfinal |	Are those are the kind of far-fetched things you're thinking about
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:07,359	| cesfinal |	I think I'd say
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,383	| cesfinal |	Construction level heads
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,407	| cesfinal |	Intriguing to us because
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:12,735	| cesfinal |	It could add value to what we offer
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,015	| cesfinal |	If we have something that's smart and
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,063	| cesfinal |	Gives us Competitive Edge
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,879	| cesfinal |	Don't we know what it's looking for and why people want them
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:22,463	| cesfinal |	What are the big challenges for the Building Product manufacturing business
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:25,279	| cesfinal |	Disconnect
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:27,583	| cesfinal |	Between the manufacturer and the end-user
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:32,703	| cesfinal |	Because there are many Distributors and the contractors are not the same people as the people manufacturing the product
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:33,983	| cesfinal |	So
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:35,775	| cesfinal |	Our group is mainly made up of Architects
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,055	| cesfinal |	Who have
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:39,615	| cesfinal |	An overlapping to technology so we understand that
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:40,383	| cesfinal |	People specifying
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:43,455	| cesfinal |	Maybe not always the people that'll be occupying space
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:44,735	| cesfinal |	So
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,271	| cesfinal |	We have to understand the technology
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,039	| cesfinal |	She said that we can
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,855	| cesfinal |	But we're looking for
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,391	| cesfinal |	Awesome thank you
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,719	| cesfinal |	Construction was also an 8 Williams
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:58,047	| cesfinal |	Williams is an entrepreneur-in-residence at Kleiner
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:01,119	| cesfinal |	Who spoke with me about what he's thinking about
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,143	| cesfinal |	In Enterprise
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:02,911	| cesfinal |	Coyote
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:05,727	| cesfinal |	Any guess what are you excited about
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:12,895	| cesfinal |	Yeah this is my 13th straight show 13 years in a row and I'm excited about the evolution of connectivity
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:14,175	| cesfinal |	For the Enterprise
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,967	| cesfinal |	So things are really interesting to me
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:17,247	| cesfinal |	Number one would be
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:19,039	| cesfinal |	The idea of Transportation Logistics
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,855	| cesfinal |	Examples 35 billion dollars
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:23,647	| cesfinal |	Pharmaceuticals each year
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,415	| cesfinal |	Are lost
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,463	| cesfinal |	Stolen or broken during Transit
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:28,511	| cesfinal |	I think we could solve that issue using sense
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:31,071	| cesfinal |	Second thing is the idea of iot
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,351	| cesfinal |	Securities we talked about
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,143	| cesfinal |	Are utilities
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:35,679	| cesfinal |	Hisun Pharmaceuticals and other things
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,215	| cesfinal |	But have to be secure
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:38,751	| cesfinal |	Is a bunch of great companies are doing that
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:41,311	| cesfinal |	And lastly an industry where I think there's going to be a
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,103	| cesfinal |	Unmoor a Technologies Chinese
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:43,871	| cesfinal |	The show is construct
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,919	| cesfinal |	Can we look at making these
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,687	| cesfinal |	Construction site
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,455	| cesfinal |	Safer
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,735	| cesfinal |	It'll get better building Tech
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,503	| cesfinal |	Regency
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:51,039	| cesfinal |	Autonomous robots helping
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,063	| cesfinal |	Built some of these next generation
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:56,671	| cesfinal |	What are the main issues in the construction industry that you're looking at
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:03,839	| cesfinal |	Yeah first thing if construction is been traditionally one of the bigger businesses and expansion
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:05,375	| cesfinal |	Tracks with the economy
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:07,679	| cesfinal |	We're seeing is the last 30 years
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:09,727	| cesfinal |	Process technology hasn't changed much
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:13,567	| cesfinal |	Tell me like Altair and others that are out there
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,359	| cesfinal |	They're actually adding sensors
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:17,663	| cesfinal |	Robotics another autonomy to the
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:18,431	| cesfinal |	Construction
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:23,039	| cesfinal |	So couple things first day is number one better quality so we looking like drywall finishing
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:26,879	| cesfinal |	Play something called level five how you can get to the best type of drywall finish
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:29,695	| cesfinal |	To make an office building with greater house
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,719	| cesfinal |	Second to safety
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:33,023	| cesfinal |	There's a company out of text are called killer Tech
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,559	| cesfinal |	Which is actually measuring
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:35,327	| cesfinal |	Things like
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,095	| cesfinal |	Humidity
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:39,679	| cesfinal |	And decibels Xterra make sure you're complying for OSHA
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:41,983	| cesfinal |	Flossing is just in terms of overall worker safety
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:46,847	| cesfinal |	Christina company that can allow worker to understand when they're using their back to live
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,383	| cesfinal |	So here she may have an issue
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:50,175	| cesfinal |	So what we'll see this year is the
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:54,015	| cesfinal |	Application of sensor Tech and other autonomy robotics
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:17:00,159	| cesfinal |	2 Construction in a way to make better outcomes with more safety and ultimate try to bring some profitability into the
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,975	| cesfinal |	Once iot changes how we built
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:06,303	| cesfinal |	Can it also change how we access building
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:11,423	| cesfinal |	I met a few people thinking about using digital identities as a way to get into their office
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:14,751	| cesfinal |	Work may be in place if their social security number
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:16,031	| cesfinal |	Centos keep getting hacked
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:19,103	| cesfinal |	So I asked Todd Graves but Allegiant
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:23,455	| cesfinal |	About how iot can change access as well as what he's looking for
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:23,967	| cesfinal |	At the show
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:28,575	| cesfinal |	I'm taught Graves and I'm the senior vice president for engineering and Technology at Allegiant
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:31,647	| cesfinal |	Wow that is a big title okay
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,951	| cesfinal |	A lot of people are talking about why can't I use my
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,719	| cesfinal |	Digital identity
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,255	| cesfinal |	In the real world
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:39,583	| cesfinal |	What are the kind of challenges are things you have to think about when
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:40,351	| cesfinal |	People are asking that kind of
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:44,959	| cesfinal |	Well I mean first there's it's important to distinguish between identity and a credential
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:46,495	| cesfinal |	Right identity is something that you
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:48,031	| cesfinal |	Uniquely identifies you
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,591	| cesfinal |	In a my mind there's really only
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:53,407	| cesfinal |	2 today to robust forms of identity
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:55,455	| cesfinal |	There's government identity
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:55,967	| cesfinal |	So
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:59,295	| cesfinal |	Here in the US you've got a social security number
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:01,343	| cesfinal |	You probably got a driver's license
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:03,391	| cesfinal |	And maybe you got a passport and those are all
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:06,719	| cesfinal |	Uniquely identifiable to you very hard.
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:09,023	| cesfinal |	The fake so they are robust forms of identity
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:12,863	| cesfinal |	The second robust form of identity that's more private is the bank
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,935	| cesfinal |	But it ties back to government identity
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:19,519	| cesfinal |	You can't establish a bank account and get a credit card without a government ID
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:25,919	| cesfinal |	Online forms of identity unless you've used a credit card to establish it I would say is non robust
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:28,479	| cesfinal |	So I can set up a Google account
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:34,111	| cesfinal |	An Apple ID or establish a new Facebook account and call myself Joe Blow and there's really no
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,647	| cesfinal |	Cross-checking of that identity
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,951	| cesfinal |	So there's a really
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:44,095	| cesfinal |	Really radically different level of robustness between what we normally use for online identity and what we use as
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:48,703	| cesfinal |	Credential based identity in the world
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:53,567	| cesfinal |	So I'm probably not going to ditch my key card to my office anytime soon for my Facebook ID
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:56,639	| cesfinal |	Yes because if you think about an Enterprise
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,431	| cesfinal |	First day you show up at work
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:05,343	| cesfinal |	You fill out an I-9 form and you show the HR department a government ID and then they log you into the EHR system with
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:07,391	| cesfinal |	Something that ties back to your government identity
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:09,439	| cesfinal |	Mountain Enterprise could say
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,487	| cesfinal |	We're going to eat then tight
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:17,119	| cesfinal |	Your Facebook identity your Facebook login to that but they're always going to need to tie back what's in their system
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:20,447	| cesfinal |	To a robust form of government idea that's the law
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,983	| cesfinal |	But there are opportunities to
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,519	| cesfinal |	To tie
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,567	| cesfinal |	Your online identity with your Enterprise.
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:28,895	| cesfinal |	Okay and one more question for you since you were the CTO
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:29,919	| cesfinal |	At a very large
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:33,759	| cesfinal |	What are the technologies that you're looking for here at CES
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,063	| cesfinal |	I'm looking for conductivity
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:37,599	| cesfinal |	At low power
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,391	| cesfinal |	Because
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,183	| cesfinal |	The most critical devices
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:43,743	| cesfinal |	For us are battery-powered iot devices
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:45,279	| cesfinal |	Their security devices
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,815	| cesfinal |	And so yes it's
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:48,863	| cesfinal |	It's about power and reliable connectivity
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:55,007	| cesfinal |	Graves wasn't the only person thinking about connectivity
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:20:01,919	| cesfinal |	After this message from our sponsor will talk to Two Fellas from John Deere who discussed 5G and how to train a machine
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:08,319	| cesfinal |	Need to learn when it's on the edge of an unreliable Network stated
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:12,415	| cesfinal |	Yes we've so far seen a couple products with the ocf sticker on it
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:14,719	| cesfinal |	What should we look for in the year ahead
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,487	| cesfinal |	From the group
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:21,887	| cesfinal |	When we first started ocf the vision was to have a horizontal standard that can work across a variety of different
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,655	| cesfinal |	How to use case
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:24,959	| cesfinal |	Including Smart Home in order to get
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:26,751	| cesfinal |	It's thing started to this be
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:32,639	| cesfinal |	The organization did have to focus until we chose smart home being one of the fastest-growing and most interesting areas
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:35,967	| cesfinal |	For a members in for the consumer Community alike
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:42,623	| cesfinal |	Until what you seen in the initial C yes introductions are things that are much more smart home Centric
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:43,903	| cesfinal |	But will
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,951	| cesfinal |	Definitely evolved and I think a big
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:49,535	| cesfinal |	Change in activity in 2018 will be the addition in the
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:50,559	| cesfinal |	Result of
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:56,447	| cesfinal |	Work that we have a new group focused on other verticals that expand Beyond this morning
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,727	| cesfinal |	I'm so for example
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:21:00,031	| cesfinal |	Batting over the
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:04,127	| cesfinal |	Over-the-top kind of services with iot for personal and digital
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:04,895	| cesfinal |	Care
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:11,295	| cesfinal |	Aging-in-place Solutions connected car connected home and the interoperability
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:14,623	| cesfinal |	And media and control and security sharing between those
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:17,952	| cesfinal |	Even spanning out into things like
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:19,488	| cesfinal |	Community Management
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:21,792	| cesfinal |	Smart Building Solutions
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:24,352	| cesfinal |	Smart cities acceptor so
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,888	| cesfinal |	Play the number of
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:27,680	| cesfinal |	Different Landing zones where
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,960	| cesfinal |	Millwork of us yeah
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:30,752	| cesfinal |	And the use of Iowa City
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:32,800	| cesfinal |	Will find its way into products
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:35,360	| cesfinal |	And services and by the way that also include software
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:38,944	| cesfinal |	So think now about having his community of ocf devices
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:42,016	| cesfinal |	And connected ecosystem that service providers
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:42,784	| cesfinal |	Can you
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:44,320	| cesfinal |	And developed application
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,856	| cesfinal |	To run from the cloud
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:47,392	| cesfinal |	And to be able to
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:49,952	| cesfinal |	Deploy deliver and monetized
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:56,096	| cesfinal |	These capabilities on top of these ocf connected devices
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:03,008	| cesfinal |	And now here's Wally Pelon Juan Sanchez from John Deere on edge architectures and
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:03,520	| cesfinal |	5G
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:07,104	| cesfinal |	Willie talk director of new technology of Blue River technology
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,384	| cesfinal |	Okay
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,408	| cesfinal |	You guys were recently
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:12,480	| cesfinal |	Play acquired by John Deere you do computer vision on
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:13,248	| cesfinal |	Farming equipment
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:15,296	| cesfinal |	You can detect weed is very exciting
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:20,160	| cesfinal |	Can you talk to me about what it takes to do the kind of machine learning you guys do
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:22,720	| cesfinal |	Basically it was the edge of a
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,512	| cesfinal |	Baby not awesome Network
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:27,328	| cesfinal |	Yes so we trained everything off
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:30,400	| cesfinal |	So we have dab carts that we start pushing through
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:31,936	| cesfinal |	Fields and relax
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:35,520	| cesfinal |	Thousands of images we haven't even labeled with Mechanical Turk
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:37,568	| cesfinal |	We then
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:39,360	| cesfinal |	Trainees networks on a GPU
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:41,152	| cesfinal |	The office
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:42,944	| cesfinal |	And then deploy the models out to the field
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:44,224	| cesfinal |	I'm weak and attacked
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:48,576	| cesfinal |	When those models are performing poorly or a low confidence
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:52,672	| cesfinal |	We prioritize that data for upload so that the network continuously
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,208	| cesfinal |	And
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:55,744	| cesfinal |	II
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,280	| cesfinal |	More
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:58,816	| cesfinal |	Different fields of exposed
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,328	| cesfinal |	The machine to the bat
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:02,144	| cesfinal |	So what happens is when I'm out
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:02,656	| cesfinal |	Farming
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:06,752	| cesfinal |	I spraying for weeds
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,800	| cesfinal |	Spraying for weeds
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:09,568	| cesfinal |	And
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:11,616	| cesfinal |	I've got your your your information
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:13,408	| cesfinal |	It's running through that and it's
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:16,224	| cesfinal |	I don't know what this is in your life
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:18,016	| cesfinal |	As a farmer do I have to
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,296	| cesfinal |	Do anything or is it just
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,320	| cesfinal |	Strictly yorkin
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,344	| cesfinal |	Computer is like oh
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:23,136	| cesfinal |	This date is super important
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:23,904	| cesfinal |	Let's do something with
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:24,928	| cesfinal |	When we get back to the
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,464	| cesfinal |	Garage
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,232	| cesfinal |	The barn
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:29,280	| cesfinal |	Extreme and say that guy
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:29,792	| cesfinal |	Safeway
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,072	| cesfinal |	Save the cotton
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:33,120	| cesfinal |	Machine
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:36,704	| cesfinal |	Rights if they drive it into a soybean field or corn field
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:37,984	| cesfinal |	Our network has not been performed
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:40,288	| cesfinal |	Do we need to build alert them and say hey
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:40,800	| cesfinal |	Something's wrong
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,360	| cesfinal |	Either you're a
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:45,152	| cesfinal |	Something is wrong
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:49,760	| cesfinal |	And then they can make a decision what they want to keep going or not
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:53,600	| cesfinal |	And then they can also upload the data that machine will automatically upload any low coffee
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:54,368	| cesfinal |	Prince data
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:56,160	| cesfinal |	To us we can assess it now in that case
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:00,512	| cesfinal |	In some cases
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,024	| cesfinal |	Hail damage
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:02,816	| cesfinal |	Which is
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,608	| cesfinal |	Actually looks quite different than regular car
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:08,448	| cesfinal |	We're going to
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:10,752	| cesfinal |	Take a bunch of these images off the machine
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,032	| cesfinal |	And train
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:12,800	| cesfinal |	What's on in the next days
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:17,152	| cesfinal |	Do you pull all data from every path eventually to the cloud
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:23,040	| cesfinal |	It depends when we are in the in the development process early in the development process yes and yes she's FedEx to get it all back at 6
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:23,808	| cesfinal |	Too much. Blood
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:26,368	| cesfinal |	Further down the road in the development process when
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:28,160	| cesfinal |	We start uploading the
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:29,696	| cesfinal |	Places where we're performing for aliens
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,000	| cesfinal |	Alright thank you
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:41,472	| cesfinal |	Julia Sanchez director John Deere Technology Innovation
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:48,384	| cesfinal |	What kind of connectivity environment and connectivity technology are you guys looking for precision
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:55,808	| cesfinal |	We certainly still recognized at rural areas suffer from connectivity so traditionally we've looked
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:57,600	| cesfinal |	That store and push architectures
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:25:04,000	| cesfinal |	Where we we don't always rely on constant productivity or high bandwidth connectivity we are constantly exploring
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:10,400	| cesfinal |	Low-power a broad range a type of solutions and then expecting things like 5G and Technology
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,424	| cesfinal |	Just like 5G
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:15,008	| cesfinal |	Will really help us redefine what real-time means for us
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:18,592	| cesfinal |	Real real time for us right now memes probably around 32nd
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:21,152	| cesfinal |	With 5G technology
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:23,712	| cesfinal |	It'll really redefine our store and push model
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:28,320	| cesfinal |	And really help us use the cloud in the true Real Time with say less than one second back in
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:31,648	| cesfinal |	You guys are actually great for 5G because
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:33,184	| cesfinal |	Spell their crops to get in the way of the
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:40,096	| cesfinal |	But that's right it is all the sudden it removes the the barriers that prevented the network companies from investing in that in
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:42,400	| cesfinal |	Awesome thank you
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,216	| cesfinal |	Again
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:48,288	| cesfinal |	I know we didn't talk about Madame a doll in the show
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:51,872	| cesfinal |	And that's supposed to because it's all anyone else who went covered
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:54,176	| cesfinal |	The rise of voice is important
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:56,224	| cesfinal |	But it's also an established interface right now
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:26:00,064	| cesfinal |	Which brings me to one of the cooler things I saw at the show
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:06,976	| cesfinal |	So stay tuned for that after one final message from our sponsor
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:09,536	| cesfinal |	And Dave
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:10,816	| cesfinal |	Before we leave today
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,864	| cesfinal |	What are you most excited about
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:16,192	| cesfinal |	I think that we're really excited about it ocf
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:16,960	| cesfinal |	Is the fact that
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:20,544	| cesfinal |	Getting these devices now into the market that can
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:22,592	| cesfinal |	Discover each other in
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,872	| cesfinal |	Securely share data
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:25,920	| cesfinal |	Can create all kinds of
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:26,944	| cesfinal |	Possibilities
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,224	| cesfinal |	In terms of services and
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:28,736	| cesfinal |	Intelligence
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:30,528	| cesfinal |	And really building
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:32,064	| cesfinal |	Not only
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:34,112	| cesfinal |	Controllable home
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:36,672	| cesfinal |	But actually the truly smart autonomous
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:38,976	| cesfinal |	Home environment
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:40,512	| cesfinal |	And deliver the experience
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:43,584	| cesfinal |	Did you see on the shows and you hear on the radio
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,632	| cesfinal |	And finally will be able to
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:50,752	| cesfinal |	Bye and deploy and enjoy
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:58,176	| cesfinal |	Bosch showed off of men's projector that fit on the module less than half the size of a credit card
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:02,528	| cesfinal |	And that module can be embedded on a lamp or even an Amazon Echo
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:08,928	| cesfinal |	This man is projector can projected interactive touchscreen on any surface including our skin
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:11,744	| cesfinal |	A complete videos at 480p
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:15,328	| cesfinal |	Or 720p depending on how far away the projector is
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:19,168	| cesfinal |	So just imagine if you ask matinee to show you something
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:22,240	| cesfinal |	And your Echo projected the options on the table it was sitting on
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:25,824	| cesfinal |	And then you could use your finger to select whatever option you chose
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:29,920	| cesfinal |	I thought it was really cool and would love to see this embedded in
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:30,432	| cesfinal |	Devices
