EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:06,304	| IOT225 |	And our guest this week
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:06,816	| IOT225 |	Is
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:08,864	| IOT225 |	Rags srinivasan
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:10,656	| IOT225 |	Of Seagate
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:15,008	| IOT225 |	He's talking about how Seagate has implemented a i and
EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:15,520	| IOT225 |	Cameras
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:17,824	| IOT225 |	To improve their manufacturing process
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:21,408	| IOT225 |	It's a really great interview he really
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:22,688	| IOT225 |	Does a great job explaining
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:24,480	| IOT225 |	How they did this
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:26,784	| IOT225 |	And why they made the decisions they did
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:30,624	| IOT225 |	And anybody who's trying to implement any sort of iot or
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:32,416	| IOT225 |	Shooting at the edge should really listen
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:34,720	| IOT225 |	Elvis
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:36,768	| IOT225 |	Coming up but first
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:38,560	| IOT225 |	IMessage from another one
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:39,328	| IOT225 |	One of our sponsors
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:42,144	| IOT225 |	This week sponsor is a pharaoh
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:44,448	| IOT225 |	We're doing multiple iot projects
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,728	| IOT225 |	The work well together
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:48,288	| IOT225 |	In a single app that strengthens your brand
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:54,688	| IOT225 |	That's really hard and it requires the right platform with a pharaoh Kenmore Lodge 42 smart
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:02:01,088	| IOT225 |	Appliance models in just two years apparel customers have experienced as much as a 80% reduction in time to mark
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:06,464	| IOT225 |	99% pure support calls and a 10x higher activation rate
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:10,816	| IOT225 |	Plus we can reuse 90% of their work from one project to the next
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:17,216	| IOT225 |	Make a pharaoh like Kenmore Mitsubishi baked and dealing did and beat your competition with a solution that you're
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:20,544	| IOT225 |	13 loves to build and your customers love to use
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:24,640	| IOT225 |	Learn more at a pharaoh. IO flash go big
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,432	| IOT225 |	Okay
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,456	| IOT225 |	Hey Kevin
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:28,480	| IOT225 |	Right after
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,016	| IOT225 |	Recorded the show last
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,296	| IOT225 |	We heard
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:33,088	| IOT225 |	Big news from
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:34,624	| IOT225 |	Belgian Dulce
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:37,440	| IOT225 |	The journalist at
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:40,512	| IOT225 |	Svrta Belgian broadcaster brought the news
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:47,168	| IOT225 |	That's rather scary I guess we shouldn't be surprised by this because smart speakers we know they listen to us
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:50,752	| IOT225 |	But what happens after that we're finding out more
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:54,080	| IOT225 |	Google is saving all of those voice recordings
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:57,152	| IOT225 |	And using contractors to
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,688	| IOT225 |	Transcribe them which
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,736	| IOT225 |	I supposed to improve the voice
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,528	| IOT225 |	Results right
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,552	| IOT225 |	They're using it to make sure every
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:04,832	| IOT225 |	Correct
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,344	| IOT225 |	But
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:08,928	| IOT225 |	What was shocking to me was I had read in
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:10,464	| IOT225 |	How to say was a CNET article
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:13,792	| IOT225 |	When Amazon had the same story come out about them
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,328	| IOT225 |	Probably a month ago
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:20,448	| IOT225 |	Google said that they actually use voice modulation so people couldn't understand
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:22,240	| IOT225 |	Or identify the voices
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:24,800	| IOT225 |	And this is proving that completely wrong
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,592	| IOT225 |	Sound like
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:29,664	| IOT225 |	That's really sad cuz I really thought that was a good thing for
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,432	| IOT225 |	Google to be doing
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:35,808	| IOT225 |	Yeah it's that was probably one of the I should laugh out of it one of the funniest things in this
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,112	| IOT225 |	In this article that came from brt
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:41,696	| IOT225 |	We let ordinary Flemish people hear some of their own recordings it says
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,720	| IOT225 |	And here's a quote
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:46,816	| IOT225 |	This is undeniably my own voice says one man clearly surprised
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,352	| IOT225 |	Yeah
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,120	| IOT225 |	And
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,912	| IOT225 |	The big thing for me
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:51,936	| IOT225 |	Isn't it
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,472	| IOT225 |	Google or Amazon
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,264	| IOT225 |	Annotate sand has to
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,032	| IOT225 |	Pick up
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,592	| IOT225 |	Will recordings and make sure you're in check it for
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,360	| IOT225 |	Accuracy
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,384	| IOT225 |	I feel like that has to have
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:03,456	| IOT225 |	And it makes sense that that happens I would like to see
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,480	| IOT225 |	Any
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:05,760	| IOT225 |	Buddy who's doing this
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,296	| IOT225 |	And sending it on
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,832	| IOT225 |	The contractors to actually
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:11,136	| IOT225 |	Modular people's voices so that's not
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:14,464	| IOT225 |	Grenadier still be identifiable in
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,000	| IOT225 |	Information if there's addresses since
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:16,512	| IOT225 |	Stuff in there
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:20,863	| IOT225 |	What really caught my eye here and made me really uncomfortable
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,911	| IOT225 |	What's the false positives
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:26,239	| IOT225 |	So brt had over a thousand recordings
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:27,519	| IOT225 |	In
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,031	| IOT225 |	That
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,335	| IOT225 |	153
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,895	| IOT225 |	We're triggered without someone saying the words
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:34,943	| IOT225 |	Haji
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:35,711	| IOT225 |	I don't want to say the words
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,271	| IOT225 |	So
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:39,295	| IOT225 |	Tennessee
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,087	| IOT225 |	Rentable
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:41,855	| IOT225 |	False positive
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,367	| IOT225 |	That's
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,671	| IOT225 |	15% at its highest
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,463	| IOT225 |	We don't actually know
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,999	| IOT225 |	What more than a thousand is
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,279	| IOT225 |	Less than 2000
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:50,559	| IOT225 |	But wear them
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,095	| IOT225 |	That's too high
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:56,959	| IOT225 |	It is and you think at this point considering all of the
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:59,007	| IOT225 |	Breakthrough analysis and
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:02,591	| IOT225 |	Syrian technology and math that Google has been applying to its NLP
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:05,407	| IOT225 |	You would think they wouldn't have that
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,431	| IOT225 |	Iowa
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,991	| IOT225 |	False positive rate by now
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,271	| IOT225 |	Yeah well
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:12,831	| IOT225 |	You would think that and I remember someone
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,111	| IOT225 |	From Google talking about
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,647	| IOT225 |	Using a a I in
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:17,439	| IOT225 |	Smart Homes and
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:18,719	| IOT225 |	Using AI to
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,231	| IOT225 |	Autonomy
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:22,303	| IOT225 |	And he talked about the false positive
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:25,119	| IOT225 |	Rates in for something to actually automatically happen
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,423	| IOT225 |	They wanted to see a false positive
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:29,471	| IOT225 |	1%
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,007	| IOT225 |	Port to take action
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,287	| IOT225 |	Now
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:34,079	| IOT225 |	Privacy is not the same as like ordering
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:35,871	| IOT225 |	You think someone's
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,663	| IOT225 |	If you think someone wants
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:38,431	| IOT225 |	A pizza
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:38,943	| IOT225 |	But
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:41,247	| IOT225 |	I would like to see privacy move
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:42,015	| IOT225 |	Up in
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:45,599	| IOT225 |	Is there a steam or rankings so
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:47,903	| IOT225 |	Maybe your false positive rate is more like
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,719	| IOT225 |	5%
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,511	| IOT225 |	That's still pretty high but
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:54,815	| IOT225 |	To me it makes up for the inconvenience if you
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:57,119	| IOT225 |	So what I I guess
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:58,911	| IOT225 |	It's time to stop talking
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,447	| IOT225 |	About
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:02,495	| IOT225 |	Things like this is a violation of
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:03,519	| IOT225 |	Our privacy and I think it
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:05,567	| IOT225 |	It's time to actually talk about what we should see
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:08,383	| IOT225 |	So our Dimension voice modulation
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,919	| IOT225 |	I would also like to
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:14,271	| IOT225 |	Public audit independent yes
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,039	| IOT225 |	Independent public
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,831	| IOT225 |	Got its worst case scenario
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,855	| IOT225 |	I would like to see
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,415	| IOT225 |	Google published
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:20,927	| IOT225 |	Are false positive
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,231	| IOT225 |	And
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:23,999	| IOT225 |	Probably
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,815	| IOT225 |	Publish the percent of recordings
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:27,839	| IOT225 |	That are sent to
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,119	| IOT225 |	Contract
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:32,447	| IOT225 |	Discus people information that
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:34,751	| IOT225 |	Could really help them decide cuz right now it's like
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,287	| IOT225 |	And
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,567	| IOT225 |	They should say where those car
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:44,223	| IOT225 |	Wendy's in the story these contractors were actually local to the area where the recordings were
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:45,759	| IOT225 |	Where the speakers were
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,295	| IOT225 |	It's not like they're
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,599	| IOT225 |	In this case they were farmed around the world
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,111	| IOT225 |	Look like
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,159	| IOT225 |	And I should say
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:55,487	| IOT225 |	I was a contractor for Google for 18 months
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,791	| IOT225 |	And I had to sign all the same nda's and all that
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:01,887	| IOT225 |	In my case I presume that standard practice ER
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,935	| IOT225 |	Just to get people that information
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,983	| IOT225 |	Sure Google is really pissed Google's
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:08,799	| IOT225 |	Google slide is like yeah but these guys broke
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:09,823	| IOT225 |	Brocar NBA
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:10,847	| IOT225 |	I'm like Google
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:14,687	| IOT225 |	They did but what you're doing here isn't
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,199	| IOT225 |	Exactly right
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:19,039	| IOT225 |	I know a lot of people are saying hey this is how these things
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:21,087	| IOT225 |	And I agree with that
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:25,439	| IOT225 |	That doesn't mean they have to be that way yeah and it doesn't mean that that's
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:29,023	| IOT225 |	That particular false positive rate is okay or that
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:32,095	| IOT225 |	You know you shouldn't take steps to preserve people's privacy in the
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,631	| IOT225 |	When you're using
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:35,423	| IOT225 |	Real contractors and not just
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:39,775	| IOT225 |	Kind of related to this actually very religious and very Timely
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,335	| IOT225 |	How does Amazon actually
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,895	| IOT225 |	Check the recordings will they give you the option
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:45,919	| IOT225 |	In the app
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:46,943	| IOT225 |	2
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:50,015	| IOT225 |	Spaceway say hey I heard this
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:52,575	| IOT225 |	Padme says that this is what you meant is
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,855	| IOT225 |	Do the right thing right
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:56,927	| IOT225 |	So in a sense we all helped train or can that waste
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:58,719	| IOT225 |	I bet most people don't go in there and do this but
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:01,023	| IOT225 |	We all help Madame a
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,303	| IOT225 |	The funny thing is
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,839	| IOT225 |	And the story broke
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:04,607	| IOT225 |	Last week
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:05,887	| IOT225 |	Over the weekend
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:08,191	| IOT225 |	An infectious yesterday
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:10,751	| IOT225 |	I got the Google Assistant
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:13,823	| IOT225 |	Pop up on my screen on my Chromebook
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,615	| IOT225 |	And said hey
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:20,735	| IOT225 |	Please read that last voice command and I had actually said to come into my Google
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,527	| IOT225 |	Home device my smart display
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:24,831	| IOT225 |	To raise the volume I was listening to Spotify
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:28,159	| IOT225 |	And they gave me a ranking and then I can leave a comment as well
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:32,255	| IOT225 |	So I had never seen that before the story
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:32,767	| IOT225 |	Coincidence
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:33,791	| IOT225 |	Maybe
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,839	| IOT225 |	I'm wondering
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,399	| IOT225 |	How recently
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:39,679	| IOT225 |	I don't know
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:41,471	| IOT225 |	Time is like a river for me
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:42,495	| IOT225 |	Close
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:46,079	| IOT225 |	Cuz I'm on these devices all day long and
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:48,127	| IOT225 |	It's built into my Chromebook and I have all the
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:50,431	| IOT225 |	Display I never seen it
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:50,943	| IOT225 |	Don't care about your opinion
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:53,247	| IOT225 |	Maybe they only care about buying them
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:57,087	| IOT225 |	People like you made it obvious he doesn't work anymore for a reason that's not even bother with this guy
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,903	| IOT225 |	Yes so I will say
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:01,951	| IOT225 |	Given this news and
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:02,719	| IOT225 |	The lack of
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,023	| IOT225 |	For me it was the false positive
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:05,535	| IOT225 |	The Lacs
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:06,559	| IOT225 |	Protection here
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:12,191	| IOT225 |	Does this change your comfort level with having these around your house is the convenience still
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:12,959	| IOT225 |	Worth it to you
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,263	| IOT225 |	Well it's
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:19,359	| IOT225 |	It's funny you say that because I am not having a change of heart and things because I've always
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:23,455	| IOT225 |	Just put myself out there with all these devices and sensors and social networks
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:28,575	| IOT225 |	But over the past couple weeks I have been rethinking everything as more and more these
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,087	| IOT225 |	Types of
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,135	| IOT225 |	Privacy intrusions in
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:31,903	| IOT225 |	Data
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,927	| IOT225 |	Hacks and things
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,207	| IOT225 |	Going to
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,231	| IOT225 |	You know up here
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:41,375	| IOT225 |	I'm probably not going to change the way I use these devices
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,655	| IOT225 |	But I think I'm
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:44,191	| IOT225 |	A little more aware of
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:48,287	| IOT225 |	Basically maybe when I want to say and why don't at times
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:51,359	| IOT225 |	And it sounds silly cuz I'm in my own home and I should be able to say what I want
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:52,895	| IOT225 |	Well here
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,175	| IOT225 |	Let me tell you
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:57,247	| IOT225 |	So there's some options for people who still want to use
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,271	| IOT225 |	Space and they range from
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:01,087	| IOT225 |	You probably should do this to
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:05,439	| IOT225 |	Wow this is pretty extreme so first option is you can switch off recording
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,207	| IOT225 |	For Google
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:06,719	| IOT225 |	Devices
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:08,511	| IOT225 |	And you just go into
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:11,071	| IOT225 |	Your Google account in web and app at
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:14,399	| IOT225 |	You can manage your activity
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:15,679	| IOT225 |	Controls
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:18,751	| IOT225 |	And there's a section called voice and audio activity
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,287	| IOT225 |	And you can
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:22,591	| IOT225 |	Pause that so I have mine pause
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:25,663	| IOT225 |	And that means it doesn't make recordings
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,199	| IOT225 |	Voice so I can't send those
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,015	| IOT225 |	What does mean I'm not
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,575	| IOT225 |	But I did turn that off
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,087	| IOT225 |	A while back
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,135	| IOT225 |	So anyone can do that
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:38,207	| IOT225 |	You can always go and delete your old recordings as well
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,743	| IOT225 |	And so those will be gone
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:41,023	| IOT225 |	And
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:42,303	| IOT225 |	Going forward
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:45,119	| IOT225 |	If you're really uncomfortable you can turn off the microphone
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:48,703	| IOT225 |	On your Google devices and on your Amazon
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,471	| IOT225 |	Devices
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:50,495	| IOT225 |	And then
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,519	| IOT225 |	It won't be listen
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,287	| IOT225 |	And then I won't be listened
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:54,079	| IOT225 |	But then it also when you shout across the room
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:11:00,479	| IOT225 |	To be honest I've actually done that little more than I used to do as of late
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:04,575	| IOT225 |	Like if I'm not going to be accurately
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:07,903	| IOT225 |	Google do something for me here at my office or example
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,183	| IOT225 |	Like if I know I
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:15,327	| IOT225 |	Just want peace and quiet I'm not going to want music I don't care if somebody sure comes the doorbell even it was still show me that
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,351	| IOT225 |	Manhattan Town Center in
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:17,631	| IOT225 |	I have in my coffee
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,423	| IOT225 |	If I know I'm going to be
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,703	| IOT225 |	Changing music and
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:23,007	| IOT225 |	You know maybe want to ask Google some questions
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:24,031	| IOT225 |	I turn it back on
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,103	| IOT225 |	Additionally again
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:29,919	| IOT225 |	My Chromebook has Google Assistant built-in
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:32,991	| IOT225 |	There's an option if you have a Chromebook that has the support
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:35,295	| IOT225 |	You can in the settings
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:39,647	| IOT225 |	You can have it on for always listening or not always listening which is effectively
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,415	| IOT225 |	Shutting off B
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:44,767	| IOT225 |	The microphone from listening all the time and it said there's a Google Assistant key that you can hit
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:47,839	| IOT225 |	To any basically take the place of a
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:51,167	| IOT225 |	Awake work that's exciting cuz if you're working at your desk you leave them
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:56,031	| IOT225 |	All right yeah interior I could still change things
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:56,799	| IOT225 |	Music
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:57,311	| IOT225 |	What not so
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:00,127	| IOT225 |	There are options and we should probably mention
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,431	| IOT225 |	Only because we talked about it last week I believe
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:06,271	| IOT225 |	The Google home local SDK
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:09,599	| IOT225 |	Is now available for developers and what that should do
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:12,159	| IOT225 |	Is not send I think
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:15,231	| IOT225 |	You should send a recording to the cloud because all going to happen all the
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,023	| IOT225 |	Language should happen on the device
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:19,327	| IOT225 |	Yes we'll see it how that actually
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,375	| IOT225 |	Exactly
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:22,655	| IOT225 |	We're looking for today
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,191	| IOT225 |	All right
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:25,215	| IOT225 |	Moving on
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:25,983	| IOT225 |	This week
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:27,775	| IOT225 |	Big news in the
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,567	| IOT225 |	I'm going to call the pro
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:31,871	| IOT225 |	And even sort of the DIY smart home front
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:35,711	| IOT225 |	Which is a company called azlo his bought the assets of central
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:38,015	| IOT225 |	Probably back in
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,295	| IOT225 |	I don't know was it April
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:41,343	| IOT225 |	We talked about centralite
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:43,647	| IOT225 |	I filed for bankruptcy and centralite mayday
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,671	| IOT225 |	A bunch of
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:47,743	| IOT225 |	Sensors they made a bunch of zigbee sensors
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:52,095	| IOT225 |	They didn't see me anyway
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:54,655	| IOT225 |	They made a bunch of sensors they were lovely
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:57,215	| IOT225 |	I'm thinking in the world for a long time
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:58,239	| IOT225 |	And all of a sudden
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:12:59,519	| IOT225 |	It went bankrupt
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:02,079	| IOT225 |	Azlo
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:02,847	| IOT225 |	Has bought that
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,383	| IOT225 |	However
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:08,479	| IOT225 |	I had an email conversation with James Busby who is the
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:10,271	| IOT225 |	One of the founders of centralized
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:10,783	| IOT225 |	Original Sin
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:14,367	| IOT225 |	Just to check in on where things were
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,927	| IOT225 |	And he says that
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,695	| IOT225 |	He's forming
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:19,743	| IOT225 |	2
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:21,791	| IOT225 |	Support old Central
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:22,303	| IOT225 |	Projects
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:23,327	| IOT225 |	And
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:25,887	| IOT225 |	Tire repair in Salisbury
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:27,935	| IOT225 |	Hearts so hopefully
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,727	| IOT225 |	If you got a legacy system
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,775	| IOT225 |	You can
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:32,287	| IOT225 |	Still
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:33,823	| IOT225 |	Akai service that
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:38,687	| IOT225 |	And you can find that at www. Centralite support
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:39,967	| IOT225 |	Dot-com
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:41,503	| IOT225 |	And
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,295	| IOT225 |	He's hoping that
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:46,623	| IOT225 |	After all of this goes down he'll be able to
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:50,975	| IOT225 |	Make new products as well and so it could be another company that is going to develop new II
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:58,655	| IOT225 |	That's a rather smart move on his part cuz usually when these companies go under that's it you know they're they're done people move on
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:01,727	| IOT225 |	Products are bought acquired Etc
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:03,007	| IOT225 |	But your support
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:04,799	| IOT225 |	Potential for older
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,823	| IOT225 |	Devices now
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:06,847	| IOT225 |	I didn't see that happened to us
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:08,639	| IOT225 |	Yeah you really don't
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:10,943	| IOT225 |	And I should add that as low they actually
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:15,039	| IOT225 |	Acquired a company called me a house that was a smart home services platform
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:17,087	| IOT225 |	That made the Vera Z-Wave products
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:19,391	| IOT225 |	And they also in
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,695	| IOT225 |	October of last year purchased a couple
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,719	| IOT225 |	Fortress
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:24,767	| IOT225 |	Which was a leak detection in
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,535	| IOT225 |	Sandfly prevention
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:29,631	| IOT225 |	So so is probably a company that we're going to see more of
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,447	| IOT225 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:37,567	| IOT225 |	600 Kevin
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,847	| IOT225 |	This is exciting chipped
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:45,759	| IOT225 |	It is you're the chip girl I mean it I like having chips but you really get into and I mean really in a ditch
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,039	| IOT225 |	Baidu
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:49,087	| IOT225 |	Intel announced
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,855	| IOT225 |	A new chip
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,391	| IOT225 |	It mimics
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,415	| IOT225 |	Brain computer
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,207	| IOT225 |	And why does this matter
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:56,767	| IOT225 |	Okay long story short is
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,047	| IOT225 |	We have reached
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:58,559	| IOT225 |	Buford
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:14:59,839	| IOT225 |	Of
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,911	| IOT225 |	Which means we cannot pack more chips
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:04,959	| IOT225 |	McKenna
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:07,775	| IOT225 |	Get the power advancements and the energy
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:08,799	| IOT225 |	Advancements
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,567	| IOT225 |	That we used to get
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:12,383	| IOT225 |	So no more shrinkage
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:12,895	| IOT225 |	Catch and
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,687	| IOT225 |	This is a problem
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,455	| IOT225 |	Because now we
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:18,015	| IOT225 |	Right we're going to try a new architecture
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:20,575	| IOT225 |	So Intel's new architecture is
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:25,695	| IOT225 |	Oh here we go he's names they're hard for me practice we practice but
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:30,559	| IOT225 |	Why don't African Palace 100 Intel announced an 8 million or under amorphic system
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:34,143	| IOT225 |	Price of 64 of what they called loihi
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,167	| IOT225 |	Research chip
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:38,239	| IOT225 |	That particular system is called
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:39,519	| IOT225 |	I'll do it
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,311	| IOT225 |	Poke
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:42,335	| IOT225 |	Pohoiki Beach
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,639	| IOT225 |	So all of this is on their
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:47,711	| IOT225 |	So lot of Hawaiian names
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,759	| IOT225 |	Okay sure
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,807	| IOT225 |	But what this is is
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:53,343	| IOT225 |	They change the architecture such that
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:56,415	| IOT225 |	This particular chip can
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:58,975	| IOT225 |	Process information a thousand times faster
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:02,047	| IOT225 |	In ten thousand times more efficiently than a CPU
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,119	| IOT225 |	For certain Apple
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:05,631	| IOT225 |	Locations
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:06,911	| IOT225 |	And
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:08,959	| IOT225 |	Some of those applications include
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:10,751	| IOT225 |	Mapping so the kind of
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,031	| IOT225 |	Mapping the
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:13,311	| IOT225 |	Like your Roomba does in a room
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:13,823	| IOT225 |	The car does
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,615	| IOT225 |	Something called sparse
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,127	| IOT225 |	Coding
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:17,407	| IOT225 |	I don't know what's up
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:24,063	| IOT225 |	Will I have a general idea remember I'm only my third semester hero cop side but
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:26,879	| IOT225 |	Sparse learning is
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:29,695	| IOT225 |	Basically trying to take a lot of data
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:32,767	| IOT225 |	It is something and putting into something like a structure
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,791	| IOT225 |	Meridian dictionary
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:36,607	| IOT225 |	Not that Webster's Dictionary but take a dictionary
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:37,119	| IOT225 |	Encode
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:38,399	| IOT225 |	And
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:39,935	| IOT225 |	What's parse
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,727	| IOT225 |	Learning should do
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,263	| IOT225 |	Is
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:46,079	| IOT225 |	Kind of represent the data with a few inputs as path
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:47,615	| IOT225 |	Aunt without losing
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:48,383	| IOT225 |	Too much
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,943	| IOT225 |	What it really means if that makes sense
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:52,479	| IOT225 |	So
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:54,527	| IOT225 |	If you have like a machine learning model flask
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:56,319	| IOT225 |	I have like a gazillion
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,343	| IOT225 |	Data points
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:59,647	| IOT225 |	We need a lot of computing power to get through all of them
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:03,231	| IOT225 |	But you can model that data in a dictionary with far fewer points
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:04,255	| IOT225 |	Accurately
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:04,767	| IOT225 |	You can
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,815	| IOT225 |	Run the computer for FasTrak
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,583	| IOT225 |	Safeway
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,351	| IOT225 |	Plants versus
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,191	| IOT225 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:12,959	| IOT225 |	So
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:18,335	| IOT225 |	Intel has announced this it this is not something we expect to see used anytime
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:18,847	| IOT225 |	Truly so
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:21,919	| IOT225 |	They're researching how to put this particular
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,455	| IOT225 |	The loihi
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,991	| IOT225 |	On a USB stick
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:28,063	| IOT225 |	If they could do that we would see something like what they did with the
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,599	| IOT225 |	The movie Dias a position where they
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:30,623	| IOT225 |	Put those
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:34,463	| IOT225 |	I put those chips on a USB stick in allowed people
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,231	| IOT225 |	Go to play with them is
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:35,743	| IOT225 |	Set developer
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:40,863	| IOT225 |	So that was at the video computer vision
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,655	| IOT225 |	Chip acquisition so
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:44,191	| IOT225 |	That's kind of where I was
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:46,239	| IOT225 |	Expect to see this next that's the
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,775	| IOT225 |	The next thing I would see here
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:52,127	| IOT225 |	And if you're wondering ibm has been working on neuromorphic
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:52,895	| IOT225 |	Computing
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:55,967	| IOT225 |	Other companies in the chip space have been working on this this is
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,527	| IOT225 |	Kind of one of the next big things but
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:00,831	| IOT225 |	What's likely to happen is where
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:01,855	| IOT225 |	Probably going to
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,367	| IOT225 |	Figure
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,695	| IOT225 |	Some jobs for this
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:10,815	| IOT225 |	Amber still can have CPUs or still can have gpus but basically we're going to have more Ark
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,095	| IOT225 |	Pictures
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:14,399	| IOT225 |	Only because you mentioned neuromorphic
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:16,703	| IOT225 |	And we talked about architectures
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:20,543	| IOT225 |	The whole idea here if I'm understanding it is
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:22,079	| IOT225 |	The architecture they're using
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,383	| IOT225 |	Is cartoon mimic
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,919	| IOT225 |	The human brain
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:28,991	| IOT225 |	Synapses and so on would that be accurate
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:34,367	| IOT225 |	The brain is the most efficient computer and I remember as far back is like 2008 talking to
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,647	| IOT225 |	People who were trying to mimic
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:37,439	| IOT225 |	The brain
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:38,719	| IOT225 |	There's dozens of different
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,743	| IOT225 |	Ways to do this
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:40,767	| IOT225 |	A lot of them hit
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:42,815	| IOT225 |	It's both a complex Computing problem
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:44,607	| IOT225 |	Just designing the stuff
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,143	| IOT225 |	Encoding problem
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:48,191	| IOT225 |	So this is
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:48,959	| IOT225 |	So far
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:51,263	| IOT225 |	Been promising but it's not scalable
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:52,799	| IOT225 |	By any stretch
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,103	| IOT225 |	Take all of this with the greatest
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:59,711	| IOT225 |	But speaking of chips here something that's actually real arm
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:00,479	| IOT225 |	This week
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:02,271	| IOT225 |	Has announced a new licensing
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:05,087	| IOT225 |	And I look at this and I'm like
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,879	| IOT225 |	Who who are
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,391	| IOT225 |	You are
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:09,695	| IOT225 |	You are reacting to
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:11,231	| IOT225 |	Threats at risk 5
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:13,279	| IOT225 |	Respite
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,815	| IOT225 |	Open source architecture
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:15,327	| IOT225 |	Free chips
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:16,607	| IOT225 |	But
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:19,679	| IOT225 |	What arm has decided is they have a new licensing strata
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,471	| IOT225 |	So initially
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,263	| IOT225 |	If you want to build
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:24,799	| IOT225 |	An arm-based chip
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:26,335	| IOT225 |	Youlicense the Arctic
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:27,103	| IOT225 |	Texture from them
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:27,615	| IOT225 |	And then
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,151	| IOT225 |	You
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:30,175	| IOT225 |	Add stuff to it
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:32,223	| IOT225 |	So add stuff to their
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,063	| IOT225 |	Or you can buy an architectural
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:37,599	| IOT225 |	And that allows you to
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,367	| IOT225 |	Change
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:39,903	| IOT225 |	The architecture
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:42,463	| IOT225 |	A little bit and so the big companies like Amazon Apple
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,255	| IOT225 |	Qualcomm
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:47,327	| IOT225 |	Etc day he'll have architecture licenses so they can
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,607	| IOT225 |	Tweak that
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,375	| IOT225 |	A little bit
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,143	| IOT225 |	More granularly
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,167	| IOT225 |	But
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:54,239	| IOT225 |	What are missing now is
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:57,055	| IOT225 |	Instead of Licensing at the
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:58,335	| IOT225 |	The front end you can actually
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:01,151	| IOT225 |	Get access to the license
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,199	| IOT225 |	Design for a little bit
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:05,503	| IOT225 |	And then pay when you start taping out and see
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:06,527	| IOT225 |	Finger chips
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:08,575	| IOT225 |	This is a big
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,087	| IOT225 |	Change
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,623	| IOT225 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:12,671	| IOT225 |	Well this opens up access for a lot of
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:15,999	| IOT225 |	Smaller companies that maybe don't have
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:18,047	| IOT225 |	The funds to pay the current
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:19,327	| IOT225 |	Licensing terms
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:22,143	| IOT225 |	And therefore they can't even get into this market for their product
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:24,447	| IOT225 |	That is so they can get in for much
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:26,495	| IOT225 |	Cheap price upfront
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:31,103	| IOT225 |	And then of course in both cases are charges a per-unit royalty
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,127	| IOT225 |	You don't have to worry about
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:32,895	| IOT225 |	Bat
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,687	| IOT225 |	Until you taste
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:37,247	| IOT225 |	Yeah but here's my question.
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:41,343	| IOT225 |	Okay I assume that you when you would license these things you have like some type of
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,623	| IOT225 |	NDA or something
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:43,903	| IOT225 |	Like how much
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:47,487	| IOT225 |	Inside information on the arm architecture going to have before you actually have to start
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:51,071	| IOT225 |	Oh but I think this is like any other lice
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,095	| IOT225 |	Which is now you
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:54,143	| IOT225 |	Get everything
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,423	| IOT225 |	You need to design a chip
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:56,959	| IOT225 |	When you sell it
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:57,471	| IOT225 |	Is when you pee
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,519	| IOT225 |	I think you get
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:01,823	| IOT225 |	Annie maybe they're Secret
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:03,103	| IOT225 |	Ricky's someone else who
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:04,639	| IOT225 |	Works with biscuit LS
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,919	| IOT225 |	For manufacturing
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,991	| IOT225 |	And there are two things that matter
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:11,551	| IOT225 |	What is what we just talked about with Intel how we
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:15,391	| IOT225 |	Hit the end of Moore's Law we've got so many different applications out there as weave
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:15,903	| IOT225 |	Got chips yet
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,184	| IOT225 |	The range hood light
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:21,024	| IOT225 |	Supercomputing type jobs are cloud computing type jobs all the way down to like
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,304	| IOT225 |	Turning on and off
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,072	| IOT225 |	Sensor
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:23,584	| IOT225 |	So
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:26,912	| IOT225 |	Arm is hoping to take advantage of
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:29,472	| IOT225 |	That and let other companies licenses stuff
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:32,544	| IOT225 |	The other thing is what I said about risc V
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,336	| IOT225 |	They are seen
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,872	| IOT225 |	Companies choose to
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:39,200	| IOT225 |	Use the risc V architecture for things like iot
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:41,504	| IOT225 |	And I don't want to lose that business
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,784	| IOT225 |	So that's that's what happen
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,088	| IOT225 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:45,856	| IOT225 |	Chips
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:47,136	| IOT225 |	God
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,416	| IOT225 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:54,048	| IOT225 |	Wise last week I talked about the wise bulbs and I said something that was wrong
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,072	| IOT225 |	Cuz I couldn't
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,096	| IOT225 |	Kevin Quinn
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,424	| IOT225 |	Why is people could
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:01,728	| IOT225 |	And I told us about it so
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:04,032	| IOT225 |	When I talk about the wise balls I said you
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,056	| IOT225 |	Could not tie it
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:09,664	| IOT225 |	To the sets are actually what I said I could not find a way to tie it to the sensors and that frustrated
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:14,272	| IOT225 |	And why's let me know that there is a way to tie the bulbs
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,040	| IOT225 |	Turn them on and off
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:16,064	| IOT225 |	To the sensors
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:18,624	| IOT225 |	The way you do that is you going to the home screen
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:21,696	| IOT225 |	And then you go into edit shortcuts
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:23,744	| IOT225 |	And you have to create a shortcut
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,048	| IOT225 |	You click on create a shortcut
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:28,352	| IOT225 |	You're going to pick your action
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:30,144	| IOT225 |	Your action is going to be a bulb
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,424	| IOT225 |	And then you're going to
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:33,216	| IOT225 |	Click on an automation
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:34,752	| IOT225 |	Are you going to say autumn
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,032	| IOT225 |	And then you're going to
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:36,800	| IOT225 |	Pek
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:37,824	| IOT225 |	Bee sensor
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,104	| IOT225 |	And then
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:39,616	| IOT225 |	Walla
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:43,712	| IOT225 |	Yeah I'm glad it's there because it is
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:45,760	| IOT225 |	Just didn't make sense to not have the functionality
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:48,576	| IOT225 |	Maybe it's just because I really don't have one
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:51,392	| IOT225 |	Why is product at One wyze cam version 2
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:52,160	| IOT225 |	Side door
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:53,440	| IOT225 |	Have anything connected
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:55,488	| IOT225 |	Too but even so I was looking all around
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,536	| IOT225 |	I can't find this thing
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,048	| IOT225 |	I didn't love
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:00,608	| IOT225 |	That but as I said last weekend.
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:03,936	| IOT225 |	I think this is design for people who may not
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,728	| IOT225 |	Neither want all of that
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:07,264	| IOT225 |	It's so cheap
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:09,824	| IOT225 |	30 bucks for a bulbs in
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:10,848	| IOT225 |	People can just buy this
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:12,896	| IOT225 |	Play with a nap and
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:14,432	| IOT225 |	They may not want all this
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:16,224	| IOT225 |	Crazy stuff that you and I try to do
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:19,552	| IOT225 |	So otherwise newses
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:24,672	| IOT225 |	Yes and speaking of cheap
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,696	| IOT225 |	And why is that
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,720	| IOT225 |	The products are
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:29,280	| IOT225 |	Cheap crappy products there cheap good products
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,816	| IOT225 |	And wise
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:34,912	| IOT225 |	Debuting a Wi-Fi smart plug
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,680	| IOT225 |	2Pac
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,472	| IOT225 |	According to Home Depot's website
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:39,008	| IOT225 |	I'm looking at it right now it says
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:41,312	| IOT225 |	$19.98
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:41,824	| IOT225 |	Package
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,872	| IOT225 |	So they've got
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:45,664	| IOT225 |	2Pac Lee's Wi-Fi smart
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,712	| IOT225 |	Slugs they are just single
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,480	| IOT225 |	Slugs
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:52,320	| IOT225 |	Some of them have two outlets know they may take one out and turn into two
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:54,368	| IOT225 |	But that's not the case
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,904	| IOT225 |	141 Outlets
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:57,696	| IOT225 |	Will work according to this with
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:23:59,488	| IOT225 |	Google
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:01,024	| IOT225 |	Also
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:04,608	| IOT225 |	Scheduling and as you just pointed out you can automate
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,888	| IOT225 |	Bwise plug
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:08,960	| IOT225 |	WIS license based on open closed and motion detection
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:11,008	| IOT225 |	Again according to this product website
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:13,056	| IOT225 |	Cool alright we'll look for that
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:15,360	| IOT225 |	Alright Chinese Wi-Fi
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:15,872	| IOT225 |	It is Wi-Fi
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:17,408	| IOT225 |	Because it's got power
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:18,688	| IOT225 |	It makes sense
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:19,968	| IOT225 |	Why is only does
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:23,808	| IOT225 |	A proprietary protocol for the sense devices cuz they're battery
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:26,368	| IOT225 |	Battery make sense so
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:27,392	| IOT225 |	All right
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:30,976	| IOT225 |	Quick news bet so we've got to run through these fast so let's go
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:34,304	| IOT225 |	Alphabet swing lunch is the Open Sky air traffic
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,584	| IOT225 |	Control platform for trone
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:40,704	| IOT225 |	This is interesting and it's already been in use in Australia
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:43,520	| IOT225 |	Alphabet swing group has
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:48,128	| IOT225 |	Got to post on medium for people who want to see all the bits of details but essentially
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:50,432	| IOT225 |	Things created Open Sky which is
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:50,944	| IOT225 |	A
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:57,856	| IOT225 |	A method of platform rather to understand flight rules with buildings roads trees and terrain all the stuff that
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,624	| IOT225 |	Google has
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,648	| IOT225 |	Google Maps
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:02,976	| IOT225 |	And the idea is to help drones navigate safely
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:07,584	| IOT225 |	They'll even get information like if your drone is flying too close to a restricted area
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:11,168	| IOT225 |	Where there's an emergency in the area need to clear the air so
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,704	| IOT225 |	We'll see if people
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:15,520	| IOT225 |	Legends opensky platform as an expense
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:17,312	| IOT225 |	All right and my news is from
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:21,664	| IOT225 |	Ubiquiti link which is a satellite that I have to satellite play
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,712	| IOT225 |	And they have raised
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:25,760	| IOT225 |	5.2 million in seed funding
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:27,552	| IOT225 |	Total funding to 12 million
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:31,648	| IOT225 |	And this weekend they are going to do another satellite
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,416	| IOT225 |	Launch
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,184	| IOT225 |	I wrote about this
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:33,952	| IOT225 |	A while back
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,024	| IOT225 |	Basically they have built modules that allow
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:39,584	| IOT225 |	Devices to connect to their satellite Network
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:41,632	| IOT225 |	Satellite they don't have
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:42,400	| IOT225 |	Universal
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:44,192	| IOT225 |	Coverage yet so what happens is like
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:45,472	| IOT225 |	A couple times a day
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:47,520	| IOT225 |	The satellite will pass overhead and
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:48,544	| IOT225 |	You'll be able to send it
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:50,080	| IOT225 |	Little tiny message
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:51,616	| IOT225 |	They already have customers
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,384	| IOT225 |	So
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:53,664	| IOT225 |	It's a big deal
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:55,456	| IOT225 |	And funding is going to be
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:56,992	| IOT225 |	Useful
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:59,808	| IOT225 |	Obviously they have to launch and build all those smallsat
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:00,832	| IOT225 |	That's so there we have it
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,368	| IOT225 |	Next up
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,136	| IOT225 |	Eve
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:07,744	| IOT225 |	The maker of homekit enabled Bluetooth sensors has announced
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:08,256	| IOT225 |	Brand new
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:12,096	| IOT225 |	Ble extender will be available in August in Europe
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:12,864	| IOT225 |	4
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:15,168	| IOT225 |	Almost fifty Euros which is about $56
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,472	| IOT225 |	And
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:20,544	| IOT225 |	This particular device basically extend your Bluetooth range
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:21,568	| IOT225 |	Yay
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:25,152	| IOT225 |	Because I hate Bluetooth that is not Bluetooth mesh because
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:29,248	| IOT225 |	Go upstairs you like I can't control my lights anymore
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:31,552	| IOT225 |	So that device will work
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:34,112	| IOT225 |	With Bluetooth accessories
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:36,160	| IOT225 |	And it will show you what
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:36,672	| IOT225 |	Range
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:41,792	| IOT225 |	Pick which ones it wants to assign to eat extend and
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:48,704	| IOT225 |	Yeah it seems like a good product for anyone who's all in on homekit and wants to add
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:50,752	| IOT225 |	Make their sensor experience
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,312	| IOT225 |	Finally
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:55,104	| IOT225 |	You got our source ads
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:55,616	| IOT225 |	Security story of the day
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:59,968	| IOT225 |	Yeah we talked about this a while back and it
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:01,760	| IOT225 |	Soda has been mitigated but it's worth
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:02,784	| IOT225 |	Bring up again
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:06,624	| IOT225 |	Medtronic which makes insulin pumps
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,392	| IOT225 |	They have
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:09,696	| IOT225 |	Some older models that are still in use
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,488	| IOT225 |	My people that
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:14,304	| IOT225 |	Essentially can easily be hacked
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,584	| IOT225 |	And
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:16,864	| IOT225 |	Medtronic hainan
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:19,168	| IOT225 |	Left it off and then say it's a big deal
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:20,192	| IOT225 |	So
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,472	| IOT225 |	Two researchers actually
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:25,312	| IOT225 |	Build an Android app to prove it is a problem
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:29,408	| IOT225 |	Basic saying hey this app we know that we reverse-engineer the frequency
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:32,736	| IOT225 |	To the Medtronic pump and we can send it commands to
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:37,344	| IOT225 |	Shut up somebody's insulin Spike their insulin or whatever we could kill somebody
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:41,696	| IOT225 |	They did this to Spur Medtronic to do exactly what Medtronic has finally done
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:45,024	| IOT225 |	They've issued a recall and they're going to replace those pumps which is great
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:46,560	| IOT225 |	I'm not surprised by this because
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:49,120	| IOT225 |	I actually I know the frequency
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:50,144	| IOT225 |	For that because I thought
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,936	| IOT225 |	A radio
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:56,288	| IOT225 |	Hat for Raspberry Pi to send commands to electronic but we used it for good
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,312	| IOT225 |	To help
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:59,872	| IOT225 |	Automatically regulate insulin based on
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:02,176	| IOT225 |	Blood sugar readings for RCS class so
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:04,736	| IOT225 |	Good on these guys more white hats
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:07,040	| IOT225 |	Showing that these things need to be resolved
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:10,880	| IOT225 |	Yes and initially it would be awesome if these things
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:11,392	| IOT225 |	Kingston happening
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:14,208	| IOT225 |	We're getting
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:18,816	| IOT225 |	Okay I think now it is time for The Internet of Things

EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:09,504	| IOT225 |	It's Steve Steve alright this week's color is Steve who has a pressing question that I imagine a lot of us have
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:10,784	| IOT225 |	Let's hear it
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,832	| IOT225 |	Hey guys my name is
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:16,672	| IOT225 |	Steve Zahn from Dallas Texas I was recently outside
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:19,488	| IOT225 |	Grilling and I had an idea that it was
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:20,000	| IOT225 |	The Great
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:22,048	| IOT225 |	Anime
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:23,328	| IOT225 |	Type object
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,096	| IOT225 |	2
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,888	| IOT225 |	Do communication between
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:28,192	| IOT225 |	Devices I already have which include
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:29,216	| IOT225 |	Show
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:31,264	| IOT225 |	Couple.
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,544	| IOT225 |	And a regular Echo
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:35,104	| IOT225 |	And have something outside
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:38,176	| IOT225 |	I in order to play music and communicate with my wife
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:43,040	| IOT225 |	Any suggestions or ideas you might have would be great leap
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:44,064	| IOT225 |	Thank you
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:46,112	| IOT225 |	Okay Steve
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:46,624	| IOT225 |	We have
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:48,160	| IOT225 |	Pretty much bad
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:54,560	| IOT225 |	The particular use case you're looking for the drop in
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:57,888	| IOT225 |	That is only something that can be found on Amazon
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:58,656	| IOT225 |	Echo devices
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:03,008	| IOT225 |	Does third-party third-party outdoor capable speaker
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:04,544	| IOT225 |	Is it going to work
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:05,312	| IOT225 |	For this
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:05,824	| IOT225 |	Sorry
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:06,848	| IOT225 |	But
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:09,920	| IOT225 |	You can buy at a third party
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:11,712	| IOT225 |	Outdoor capable speaker in
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,992	| IOT225 |	Plug the Amazon
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:13,760	| IOT225 |	Input
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:16,320	| IOT225 |	Intuit this is a $35 device
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:20,416	| IOT225 |	You will have to plug it in using the 3.5 L
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:20,928	| IOT225 |	Your headphone jack
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,208	| IOT225 |	So
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:23,744	| IOT225 |	Using that cable
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,280	| IOT225 |	Plug that in
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:27,328	| IOT225 |	You're also going to have to plug it into power
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:30,144	| IOT225 |	And you probably shouldn't leave it outside
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:32,448	| IOT225 |	So what is awesome
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:34,240	| IOT225 |	Not right now
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:37,824	| IOT225 |	But if you can live without the calling in the drop-in
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:43,200	| IOT225 |	I didn't know this until just this morning you could get a Madam a speaker
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:47,552	| IOT225 |	For outdoors that's water-resistant and dust-resistant IP67 rated
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:50,624	| IOT225 |	Ultimate Ears makes the blast which is a small
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:54,464	| IOT225 |	Battery powered Wi-Fi and Bluetooth speaker with Madame a built-in
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:57,792	| IOT225 |	Again because it's third-party you can't use the calling in the drop-in
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:59,072	| IOT225 |	But at least you could
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:02,400	| IOT225 |	You listen to music outside change it by voice and so on so forth
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:07,008	| IOT225 |	And I'm even wondering maybe there's some skills out there or you could use if this the naturally
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:10,592	| IOT225 |	Send a text message to the family there might be a way to do it but
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:14,176	| IOT225 |	Needily that's not going to work for the eagle with the Ultimate Ears blast
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:16,224	| IOT225 |	You can just bring your smartphone outside
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:19,808	| IOT225 |	I know that's true that's not it
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:21,600	| IOT225 |	It's not exciting
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:22,624	| IOT225 |	But
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,160	| IOT225 |	Do you really have to have dropped
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:28,256	| IOT225 |	Good-news-bad-news
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:32,608	| IOT225 |	Couple options I also looked for outdoor enclosures for the Amazon Echo devices
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:34,656	| IOT225 |	I didn't find anything
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:35,680	| IOT225 |	That was for
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:37,472	| IOT225 |	Sorry Steve
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:40,032	| IOT225 |	I feel like you're trying failed you
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:41,056	| IOT225 |	It's not us
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:41,568	| IOT225 |	Amazon
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:45,408	| IOT225 |	Maybe it'll make an outdoor speaker I imagine the reason it doesn't
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:47,456	| IOT225 |	Is because it doesn't want to give flake
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:48,992	| IOT225 |	Controller something
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,552	| IOT225 |	To somebody walking by 2
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:53,088	| IOT225 |	Lean over the fence and be like
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:57,440	| IOT225 |	Unlock the door
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:32:00,000	| IOT225 |	Or that's what voice matches for that's why I work so well
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:03,584	| IOT225 |	Maybe maybe it's a call Voice match but
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:04,096	| IOT225 |	Oh I was
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,632	| IOT225 |	I thought that was Google but yes
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:08,192	| IOT225 |	Guess you could do that but
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:10,752	| IOT225 |	Be aware that if you leave one of these outside
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:12,288	| IOT225 |	You are opening up
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:15,104	| IOT225 |	A whole world of excitement to mischievous Neighbors
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:16,896	| IOT225 |	Who know you have
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,432	| IOT225 |	Already
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:22,784	| IOT225 |	That concludes this portion of the show please

EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:14,976	| IOT225 |	We met a couple months ago and you talk to me about bringing AI into
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:15,744	| IOT225 |	Your Manufacturing
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:17,536	| IOT225 |	The Wayfarer menu
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:20,096	| IOT225 |	We'll talk a little bit about
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:23,936	| IOT225 |	What that entails and the choices that you made around
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:25,728	| IOT225 |	Iot and AI
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:27,264	| IOT225 |	In your business operations
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:33,152	| IOT225 |	First. Explain to people most people know what Seagate does
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:35,968	| IOT225 |	But you may want to explain a little bit about
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:38,528	| IOT225 |	How you do it and why you guys decided to
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:39,040	| IOT225 |	To update your mail
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:46,464	| IOT225 |	The most people Noah's from the diet most people run into me in the street say I saw your advice that the cost
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:48,256	| IOT225 |	It's it's that's all they know us

EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:55,680	| IOT225 |	Run most of the Claudia Sanchez everywhere like we could use about tens of millions of fives at Porter
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:58,752	| IOT225 |	Caleb would be a Manufacturing
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:37:00,800	| IOT225 |	Otis technology company
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:02,848	| IOT225 |	A lot of manufacturing behind
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:07,968	| IOT225 |	To produce 30 + million units of guys every quarter and make sure the war
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:10,528	| IOT225 |	Black inside the driveway
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:12,576	| IOT225 |	Truly and engineering
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:16,160	| IOT225 |	Ikeda's multiple pliers and drive it
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:21,536	| IOT225 |	All bags in such a small form-factor is like a drive head
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:23,072	| IOT225 |	Floating over
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:24,352	| IOT225 |	Spinning platter
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:27,168	| IOT225 |	Delete coolant all like a 747

EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,520	| IOT225 |	Close to the ground
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:33,568	| IOT225 |	So it is every bit of it is
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:35,616	| IOT225 |	Complex and high position matters
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:39,456	| IOT225 |	On anything we can do there to improve the process
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:40,736	| IOT225 |	Improve depression
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:42,272	| IOT225 |	All the quality
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:45,600	| IOT225 |	Is going to have a direct impact on a business
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:52,000	| IOT225 |	So that's why we decided to take a careful look at our retirement election process I'm take advantage of
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:52,768	| IOT225 |	Coyote mint
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:54,816	| IOT225 |	So what you guys decided to
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:55,840	| IOT225 |	Upgrade your manufacturer
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:59,168	| IOT225 |	Check process what was your first Insider what was your first
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:03,776	| IOT225 |	When we started out we started like most people be
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:07,872	| IOT225 |	Got in the room and started talking technology first
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:14,272	| IOT225 |	But we looked at the iot sensors we looked at our entire manufacturing process that Got7 Factory
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:16,320	| IOT225 |	The central machinery
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:21,696	| IOT225 |	I got excited by what we see and hear about happening in the AI instead of there
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:24,768	| IOT225 |	Very quickly recognized
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:30,400	| IOT225 |	Everything that we do our Starwood technology is not the direct
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:31,168	| IOT225 |	Answered
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:33,984	| IOT225 |	Do what we want to solve intensive business and back
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:35,520	| IOT225 |	Although
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:36,800	| IOT225 |	All these projects
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:40,640	| IOT225 |	You can start off bite off much bigger than you could going to begin with
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:44,224	| IOT225 |	So we also needed to scale a CO2 emissions
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:50,624	| IOT225 |	Every bit of the cycle you can put them in categorization DHS simple
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:53,440	| IOT225 |	Manufacturing product inventions project
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:58,560	| IOT225 |	It could be a quality improvement process where is it we want to start
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:02,656	| IOT225 |	Reasonably hard enough but others I'm not done it
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:06,752	| IOT225 |	As well as solving it will have a direct business impact
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:11,104	| IOT225 |	Narrow down the public space to pick that one aspect
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:12,384	| IOT225 |	Drive
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:13,920	| IOT225 |	Head quality
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:18,272	| IOT225 |	In the whole chain drive had manufacturing process has aborted.
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:20,320	| IOT225 |	Takes 6 months to complete
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:28,000	| IOT225 |	Solving. One with a I and II RT will give us the biggest energy of wind that we wanted
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:31,584	| IOT225 |	And then from that scale back to the rest of the processes
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:34,656	| IOT225 |	Awesome
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:36,960	| IOT225 |	You guys basically said hey
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:42,080	| IOT225 |	We could like do this low-hanging predictive maintenance on our machines and maybe make our factories
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:43,616	| IOT225 |	Perform a little bit more efficiently
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:44,384	| IOT225 |	Or
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:45,152	| IOT225 |	We could go big
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:47,968	| IOT225 |	And say hey we're going to take this
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:51,296	| IOT225 |	Really intricate process and see how we can improve it
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:52,576	| IOT225 |	And that's hopefully have
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:53,088	| IOT225 |	Away Barrett
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:58,464	| IOT225 |	That is exactly correct focus on the outcomes more
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:04,096	| IOT225 |	If you look at that the commercial that has seen better salesman coming out before that everybody's dogs
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:10,496	| IOT225 |	Everyone's imagination very quickly but what really matters is if you go down to the real heart number
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:16,640	| IOT225 |	Please like if I can predict a particular entity that we're making is going to be flawed
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:19,200	| IOT225 |	Before we go to the 1400 steps
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:25,600	| IOT225 |	Stop flow directly into our body
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:31,488	| IOT225 |	Outside to tell a bigger story but he has a great comeback so that's where we roll back and start it there and yes
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:36,096	| IOT225 |	It will be a big enough problem for us to take on Unsolved
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:39,424	| IOT225 |	That's a really good thing I mean yes no I don't think anyone
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:44,800	| IOT225 |	Is like yes I want to make spinning platters and the heads that read those more efficient
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:46,592	| IOT225 |	The number one problem facing
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:48,640	| IOT225 |	Production line but for you
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:49,408	| IOT225 |	It makes sense
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:50,176	| IOT225 |	So
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:50,944	| IOT225 |	How much is that per
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:54,016	| IOT225 |	Just getting to it like figuring out
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:55,040	| IOT225 |	What you guys were going
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:56,832	| IOT225 |	What did you learn
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:04,256	| IOT225 |	Twisted our initial setup brainstorming analysis
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:10,656	| IOT225 |	Problems faced reduction if you will
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:15,264	| IOT225 |	We wanted to do a lot of things we have very qualified very smart Buy
EDL	00:41:15,264	00:41:16,544	| IOT225 |	Wanted to try a few things
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:23,712	| IOT225 |	What you brought in this like I got involved with the tmb put it more of a structure around
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:30,112	| IOT225 |	Games focus on the priorities ourselves of more aggressive gold starting from the point to do
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:31,136	| IOT225 |	One thing
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:32,928	| IOT225 |	Promise to
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:34,464	| IOT225 |	How much bigger
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:37,792	| IOT225 |	Across-the-board going to do it for one Factory
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:38,560	| IOT225 |	One Pilot
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:45,472	| IOT225 |	And then from there I have a plan how am I going to scale that from that one line one Factory do 7
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:46,496	| IOT225 |	Other taxis worldwide
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:48,800	| IOT225 |	And the first thing also we did it
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:55,199	| IOT225 |	Branded the project first easier to going in there and say like I'm going to do it
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:56,991	| IOT225 |	Turn everything but after that abuses
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:59,807	| IOT225 |	Internal organizational attachment
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:04,159	| IOT225 |	We branded the Catalyst project Athena
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:05,695	| IOT225 |	That helped us
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:12,095	| IOT225 |	Create a rallying cry around the entire organization we got the name out in front of the execs we got the
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:13,887	| IOT225 |	Exact Pi in to do this
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:16,703	| IOT225 |	How do you saw that everyone riding around let's
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:20,799	| IOT225 |	Let's all work together to make project Athena SX
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:24,895	| IOT225 |	Everyone was able to Define
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:26,175	| IOT225 |	What's part of it
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:29,503	| IOT225 |	Decided that this is about anomaly detection
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:34,367	| IOT225 |	Braverman factoring from the way of the papers. Cut into head
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:38,975	| IOT225 |	Illegally this is about delivering the quality improvement improvement
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:41,791	| IOT225 |	Reduction in the need for future Investments
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:47,167	| IOT225 |	Keymander the one common umbrella and then everyone started speaking the language
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:48,191	| IOT225 |	Gateway
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:51,007	| IOT225 |	Enough of momentum that is needed to get going
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:57,407	| IOT225 |	I'm from the completion it was about 12-15 months or so to complete the pilot
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:59,711	| IOT225 |	The process of taking this
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:06,111	| IOT225 |	And then how you can become scalable and Deployable in a way it's easier without the
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:08,927	| IOT225 |	Same level of Steven Waldman Insanity Factory
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:09,951	| IOT225 |	Sisters VR app
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:11,231	| IOT225 |	Okay
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:15,327	| IOT225 |	So let's talk about what you guys learned initially with project
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:17,119	| IOT225 |	Athena you started out
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:18,911	| IOT225 |	You were using cameras
EDL	00:43:18,911	00:43:20,959	| IOT225 |	Brett to analyze the
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:22,239	| IOT225 |	Defects in
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:23,007	| IOT225 |	Wafers
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:29,407	| IOT225 |	And let's see there was like 10 I think was 10 terabytes of data add a 17 million photos there's there's a lot
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:30,687	| IOT225 |	That was happening so
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:32,479	| IOT225 |	Talk to me exactly about
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:34,271	| IOT225 |	What you guys did
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:35,551	| IOT225 |	And even how
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:37,087	| IOT225 |	Cute Ranger neural network to
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:38,367	| IOT225 |	Analyze the state
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:43,231	| IOT225 |	Listen to Parts I make sure I'll hit the second tiny parts
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:43,999	| IOT225 |	Basketball
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:46,815	| IOT225 |	TriStar you got the numbers right in there so
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:47,839	| IOT225 |	This is.
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:50,655	| IOT225 |	17 million images just for that one process
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:53,983	| IOT225 |	Where we talked with us 200 nanometer wafers
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:44:00,127	| IOT225 |	And then to let the 49ers stuff we cut them into multiple sliders that are then stacked into
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:03,711	| IOT225 |	I would go into the desk
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:04,479	| IOT225 |	Assembly there
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:10,111	| IOT225 |	There are multiple stages where we have
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:13,439	| IOT225 |	Electron microscopes located that take pictures
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:19,839	| IOT225 |	Today in some of these parts as well he's analyzed by the human operators the experts
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:21,631	| IOT225 |	For anomalies
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:25,983	| IOT225 |	But we have complemented this with certain level of Rude by AJR
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:30,079	| IOT225 |	You go on to write down
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:32,127	| IOT225 |	All the known anomalies
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:34,431	| IOT225 |	What it looks like I fired
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:43,647	| IOT225 |	Operator gets in wall
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:50,047	| IOT225 |	Even if we were asking our operators to make coasters
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:51,839	| IOT225 |	Way too complicated
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:56,703	| IOT225 |	The problem says the anomalies are not fixed
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:45:01,823	| IOT225 |	We can't codify everything changes over time out of gross as well
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:04,895	| IOT225 |	Created a real
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:08,223	| IOT225 |	Ideal space where we can apply machine learning
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:10,783	| IOT225 |	Let it learn the anomaly patterns
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:13,599	| IOT225 |	I didn't continue to claim that every 3 months
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:14,879	| IOT225 |	Spell the patterns change
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:17,183	| IOT225 |	So the model is always up-to-date
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:18,975	| IOT225 |	For us to use it
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:20,255	| IOT225 |	A better way
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:22,047	| IOT225 |	Do you make those predictions
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:27,423	| IOT225 |	What would be the New Orleans are there
EDL	00:45:27,423	00:45:31,775	| IOT225 |	If you take the image classification there are many models are there
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:34,847	| IOT225 |	We are using one of the standard image classification models there
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:40,223	| IOT225 |	But we did about 30 different zomato to see which one works
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:45,855	| IOT225 |	Spellforce
EDL	00:45:45,855	00:45:49,183	| IOT225 |	Remodeled has about 20 + layers
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:55,583	| IOT225 |	I need to find out the pixel level
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:45:58,399	| IOT225 |	Ridges in at 6:11 and be able to say if it's a defect
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:45:59,167	| IOT225 |	Or not
EDL	00:45:59,167	00:46:00,703	| IOT225 |	Does that allows
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:07,103	| IOT225 |	To find it a very high level of accuracy whether a particular way for has an anomaly or not
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:08,895	| IOT225 |	A weak acid
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:13,247	| IOT225 |	We stopped us from going through the process being made into dryvit
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:16,575	| IOT225 |	Which failed or worse
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:20,927	| IOT225 |	The customer side which is data management all those things
EDL	00:46:21,439	00:46:23,743	| IOT225 |	So we helped to avoid all the things
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:26,815	| IOT225 |	By finding those defects
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:29,375	| IOT225 |	Much much earlier in the production process.
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:30,911	| IOT225 |	Got it
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:33,727	| IOT225 |	Yay finding defects early as is
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:37,311	| IOT225 |	So what is the underlying architecture that you using
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:38,847	| IOT225 |	Because I
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:40,127	| IOT225 |	I think that's a lot of data
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:41,919	| IOT225 |	It's happening in real time
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:44,991	| IOT225 |	I don't know how fast your Wafers come off the manufacturing
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:48,575	| IOT225 |	For that particular process but it seems like
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:50,623	| IOT225 |	There's a lot of data processing
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:54,207	| IOT225 |	Edge so what is it that you're using what are you calculating
EDL	00:46:55,999	00:47:02,399	| IOT225 |	We are processing things like 1 billion x uses tens of millions of guys 1/4
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:04,703	| IOT225 |	We actually wanted to focus on process
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:07,263	| IOT225 |	Much much earlier
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:11,103	| IOT225 |	Rather than trying to improve down the chain quality improvement process
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:12,895	| IOT225 |	So we have looked at
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:16,735	| IOT225 |	It's 17 million are so images. Coming through
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:24,159	| IOT225 |	WeChat label all supervised learning when you go it depends on
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:25,439	| IOT225 |	Someone looking at
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:29,535	| IOT225 |	All images trying to label them say this is a good one this is a bad one
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:32,607	| IOT225 |	Stop possible to onexton we can do that
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:35,423	| IOT225 |	So we devised our own internal algorithm
EDL	00:47:35,935	00:47:36,959	| IOT225 |	But can't look at
EDL	00:47:36,959	00:47:39,263	| IOT225 |	These images
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:44,383	| IOT225 |	Are segmentation off them cuz this could be in The Bachelor this could be in the other set
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:46,687	| IOT225 |	Other music human interpretation
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:50,015	| IOT225 |	Do you stumble a sampling from it to say is this correct
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:53,087	| IOT225 |	Labeling algorithm
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:54,623	| IOT225 |	Can be corrected
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:48:01,791	| IOT225 |	I hate running in the Free Loop there once we have it kind of training day. We were able to build out
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:08,703	| IOT225 |	A Chooser process with the training like they're on the edge because 10 terabytes of data per day is not
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:10,495	| IOT225 |	Something we can head over to the cloud
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:15,615	| IOT225 |	Inference that happens quite there on the manufacturing line
EDL	00:48:16,127	00:48:19,199	| IOT225 |	Good morning about 20 or so decisions per second
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:26,111	| IOT225 |	What's the sauce is good food to make which river is good in between fridge not bad and do so at a high level of confidence
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:28,671	| IOT225 |	So we can end up with a much better quality there
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:33,791	| IOT225 |	It sounds like you have done a lot of the work already that a lot of companies are trying to
EDL	00:48:34,303	00:48:35,327	| IOT225 |	You're out so
EDL	00:48:35,327	00:48:37,887	| IOT225 |	How did you set this up was it easy
EDL	00:48:37,887	00:48:39,679	| IOT225 |	Did you have to hire in
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:40,959	| IOT225 |	Experts to
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:41,983	| IOT225 |	Create this platform
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:46,847	| IOT225 |	If there existed an off-the-shelf solution
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:53,247	| IOT225 |	13 /
EDL	00:48:53,247	00:48:56,063	| IOT225 |	People who wanted to solve the problem not just
EDL	00:48:56,063	00:49:00,671	| IOT225 |	Let me go and invented a game here mentality but when we looked outside something that takes
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:06,047	| IOT225 |	And use it to solve anomaly detection there was none existed
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:12,447	| IOT225 |	So we brought into HP Park as a partner
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:13,471	| IOT225 |	Two main exports
EDL	00:49:13,471	00:49:19,615	| IOT225 |	With a good understanding of how the machine learning and deifies worth
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:25,759	| IOT225 |	I'm having deployed in a similar scale but something else
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:28,319	| IOT225 |	Together the team help develop an architecture
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:33,183	| IOT225 |	An easier orchestration where the model gets trained
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:34,719	| IOT225 |	Correctly
EDL	00:49:34,719	00:49:36,511	| IOT225 |	Homologous deploy easily
EDL	00:49:37,023	00:49:38,047	| IOT225 |	Orange red
EDL	00:49:38,047	00:49:44,447	| IOT225 |	Alan you have a way to retrain them all ugly deployed over the pier is not just one and done
EDL	00:49:44,447	00:49:46,495	| IOT225 |	Take me to work continuously
EDL	00:49:46,495	00:49:49,823	| IOT225 |	So that helped us having HPV as a partner
EDL	00:49:49,823	00:49:51,103	| IOT225 |	We need help.
EDL	00:49:51,103	00:49:51,615	| IOT225 |	Build
EDL	00:49:52,127	00:49:55,967	| IOT225 |	Amore maintainable solution that grows or the time
EDL	00:50:02,623	00:50:04,671	| IOT225 |	Existed
EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:11,071	| IOT225 |	So we wanted to Cheryl experience as well that's one of the reasons why we go to lightsaber defining or problems
EDL	00:50:11,071	00:50:13,119	| IOT225 |	Architecture
EDL	00:50:13,119	00:50:19,519	| IOT225 |	Weed and applying to different architectures the one we usually built out with HP
EDL	00:50:19,519	00:50:22,847	| IOT225 |	The one is without the hitch.
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:26,687	| IOT225 |	We did with the dgx the big one from Nvidia
EDL	00:50:26,687	00:50:30,015	| IOT225 |	And use that as a parallel architecture to test this will knock
EDL	00:50:30,015	00:50:32,063	| IOT225 |	How does architecture work
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:38,463	| IOT225 |	One you end up with a lot more then in our case than what we needed but both of those definitely would work
EDL	00:50:38,463	00:50:40,511	| IOT225 |	For anyone wanting to build
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:41,791	| IOT225 |	Image-based
EDL	00:50:42,303	00:50:43,839	| IOT225 |	Spell isolation in the factory
EDL	00:50:44,351	00:50:49,983	| IOT225 |	Different from iot but I'll say this
EDL	00:50:50,495	00:50:51,263	| IOT225 |	The most
EDL	00:50:51,775	00:50:55,103	| IOT225 |	Pulisic IAT sensor that is out there is a camera lens
EDL	00:50:55,103	00:50:57,151	| IOT225 |	I'm getting stressed out thinking about those
EDL	00:50:57,151	00:50:59,711	| IOT225 |	Camera first use cases lochmoor
EDL	00:50:59,711	00:51:02,783	| IOT225 |	I'm just looking at say a few sensors here and there
EDL	00:51:03,295	00:51:07,135	| IOT225 |	A camera captured so much more information that is which
EDL	00:51:07,135	00:51:10,463	| IOT225 |	I need to work in ways that we did not even think of
EDL	00:51:11,231	00:51:12,767	| IOT225 |	That is true
EDL	00:51:12,767	00:51:14,047	| IOT225 |	Totally on board with
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:15,583	| IOT225 |	The camera being the most important
EDL	00:51:15,583	00:51:17,631	| IOT225 |	Center especially in things like Manufacturing
EDL	00:51:18,399	00:51:19,423	| IOT225 |	Industrial
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:20,191	| IOT225 |	Applications
EDL	00:51:20,191	00:51:22,239	| IOT225 |	Obviously it's awesome and Holmes 2
EDL	00:51:22,239	00:51:23,519	| IOT225 |	But I have
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:24,031	| IOT225 |	Issues with
EDL	00:51:25,311	00:51:26,079	| IOT225 |	Everyone's home
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:27,615	| IOT225 |	Let's go into
EDL	00:51:27,615	00:51:31,199	| IOT225 |	You've obviously done this you guys did a little bit faster than I thought
EDL	00:51:31,199	00:51:33,247	| IOT225 |	3 months getting into it and then
EDL	00:51:33,247	00:51:35,551	| IOT225 |	12215 actually implementing it
EDL	00:51:35,551	00:51:38,879	| IOT225 |	Until your next step is to bring this to all 7 of your Manufacturing
EDL	00:51:38,879	00:51:40,415	| IOT225 |	Plantain and maybe
EDL	00:51:40,415	00:51:42,975	| IOT225 |	Doing some additional use cases
EDL	00:51:42,975	00:51:43,743	| IOT225 |	Talk to me about the next day
EDL	00:51:45,023	00:51:48,095	| IOT225 |	Able to achieve
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:49,887	| IOT225 |	Because of Define
EDL	00:51:49,887	00:51:55,007	| IOT225 |	Are goals clearly to one process one aspect
EDL	00:51:55,007	00:52:01,407	| IOT225 |	Elevate my entire Factory every part of it into smart manufacturing lights
EDL	00:52:01,407	00:52:02,431	| IOT225 |	One line
EDL	00:52:02,431	00:52:08,831	| IOT225 |	So that helped as well so we do not deviate we did not try to add on one thing or the other
EDL	00:52:08,831	00:52:15,231	| IOT225 |	Casas Renta long so we focus on one thing
EDL	00:52:15,231	00:52:19,839	| IOT225 |	Is we have a timeline we want to take this one and then replicated and 7UP
EDL	00:52:19,839	00:52:25,983	| IOT225 |	This requires a bit of packaging with any of those projects anything else you do
EDL	00:52:26,751	00:52:33,151	| IOT225 |	We all focus on solving the problem not about shipping it or not about how other people use it like so weird
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:35,711	| IOT225 |	Making sure the second aspects come through
EDL	00:52:35,711	00:52:39,039	| IOT225 |	Where is this becomes more of a package solution
EDL	00:52:39,039	00:52:42,111	| IOT225 |	How are teams can ticket deployed across
EDL	00:52:42,111	00:52:43,391	| IOT225 |	Please have another factories there
EDL	00:52:45,951	00:52:50,815	| IOT225 |	All the AI in cameras and everything is Kim. What is it
EDL	00:52:50,815	00:52:54,399	| IOT225 |	You're solving it came down to its anomaly detection
EDL	00:52:54,399	00:52:57,983	| IOT225 |	Is this one fits within the pattern of acceptable range
EDL	00:53:00,287	00:53:02,079	| IOT225 |	Synonym for doesn't matter
EDL	00:53:02,079	00:53:08,479	| IOT225 |	Your environment are the Domaine doesn't matter easy to comes out to the anomaly detection case
EDL	00:53:08,479	00:53:10,271	| IOT225 |	She has a lot of potential
EDL	00:53:10,271	00:53:11,295	| IOT225 |	Outside
EDL	00:53:11,295	00:53:17,695	| IOT225 |	Affectionate could we use Public Safety yard could be smart cities are you in
EDL	00:53:17,695	00:53:18,719	| IOT225 |	Having a direct
EDL	00:53:18,719	00:53:19,743	| IOT225 |	Application
EDL	00:53:19,743	00:53:21,791	| IOT225 |	To check the solution on a clock
EDL	00:53:21,791	00:53:23,071	| IOT225 |	We are not looking at
EDL	00:53:23,071	00:53:25,119	| IOT225 |	Seeking some of the models of rebuilt
EDL	00:53:25,119	00:53:31,007	| IOT225 |	Any direct application in WhatsApp for collecting making another use case is as what
EDL	00:53:32,287	00:53:35,615	| IOT225 |	We talked about a lot of the technical stuff we've been dumped into some of the biz
EDL	00:53:36,127	00:53:37,663	| IOT225 |	What is your advice to
EDL	00:53:37,663	00:53:41,247	| IOT225 |	People who are listening to this and they're like oh that sounds awesome I totally want to do it
EDL	00:53:41,247	00:53:42,271	| IOT225 |	How should they do this from
EDL	00:53:43,807	00:53:48,927	| IOT225 |	Getting the management on board a wheelie number one
EDL	00:53:48,927	00:53:53,279	| IOT225 |	Connie Jo it's not going and making a pitch that is still with
EDL	00:53:53,279	00:53:55,839	| IOT225 |	Machine learning and deep-learning
EDL	00:53:55,839	00:54:01,983	| IOT225 |	Jorgensen there but moral focus on what is it we're going to do that's going to move the needle there
EDL	00:54:01,983	00:54:06,335	| IOT225 |	It's really celebrate like our Carly purses
EDL	00:54:06,335	00:54:07,615	| IOT225 |	It's time consuming
EDL	00:54:07,615	00:54:13,247	| IOT225 |	Alone on Valentine's Day
EDL	00:54:13,247	00:54:14,783	| IOT225 |	We are operating at
EDL	00:54:14,783	00:54:19,647	| IOT225 |	Full capacity and we needed a way to get more order for existing Investments
EDL	00:54:20,415	00:54:24,511	| IOT225 |	Put forward a solution that help directly address
EDL	00:54:24,511	00:54:30,143	| IOT225 |	Does business challenges there
EDL	00:54:30,143	00:54:32,191	| IOT225 |	Using a machine learning pod
EDL	00:54:32,191	00:54:37,567	| IOT225 |	Make sure you put in
EDL	00:54:37,567	00:54:42,175	| IOT225 |	Expect to see by even doing the initial pilot investment
EDL	00:54:42,687	00:54:49,087	| IOT225 |	We actually have any children collected at 300% return of Hawaii Polynesian
EDL	00:54:49,087	00:54:51,903	| IOT225 |	Time to get there
EDL	00:54:51,903	00:54:58,303	| IOT225 |	The second part is I just said getting people exact not just that small group
EDL	00:54:58,303	00:55:02,911	| IOT225 |	Direct organizational
EDL	00:55:02,911	00:55:05,727	| IOT225 |	Turn the story that's why we had the brand
EDL	00:55:05,727	00:55:08,543	| IOT225 |	Be able to tell everyone what's happening with
EDL	00:55:08,543	00:55:11,615	| IOT225 |	I'm getting them at full view of
EDL	00:55:12,895	00:55:13,663	| IOT225 |	As well as
EDL	00:55:13,663	00:55:19,807	| IOT225 |	Dealing with them the initial excitement of the results
EDL	00:55:21,599	00:55:27,231	| IOT225 |	Today is it going to take away all our jobs
EDL	00:55:27,231	00:55:32,863	| IOT225 |	If we help solve this problem you actually freezes up to do some of the higher the changes
EDL	00:55:32,863	00:55:36,191	| IOT225 |	We don't need to stand there and look at those for the Glen
EDL	00:55:36,191	00:55:37,983	| IOT225 |	We could be solving way out
EDL	00:55:37,983	00:55:40,799	| IOT225 |	Erection quality in the manufacturing process
EDL	00:55:42,335	00:55:43,615	| IOT225 |	Starting with execs
EDL	00:55:43,615	00:55:49,759	| IOT225 |	Getting any excitement from everyone with proper branding even if it is in Channel you need to do The Branding and marketing why
EDL	00:55:50,271	00:55:54,111	| IOT225 |	I've been getting the buy-in from all the other teams that is involved with numbers
EDL	00:55:55,391	00:55:56,415	| IOT225 |	Help us get there
EDL	00:55:57,439	00:55:58,207	| IOT225 |	Excellent
EDL	00:55:58,207	00:55:59,231	| IOT225 |	Alright well racks
EDL	00:55:59,231	00:56:05,631	| IOT225 |	Thanks so much for coming on the show today I feel smarter and I think a lot of people will find this really helpful as they embark on their own
