EDL	00:00:13,824	00:00:14,592	| IOT054 |	My co-host
EDL	00:00:14,592	00:00:17,408	| IOT054 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:17,408	00:00:18,688	| IOT054 |	We're going to talk about the brand new
EDL	00:00:19,200	00:00:22,528	| IOT054 |	Free to talk about for the best switch for the
EDL	00:00:23,552	00:00:25,856	| IOT054 |	Sabbatical Miracles thanks to the Internet of Things
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:28,160	| IOT054 |	Trouble at SmartThings
EDL	00:00:28,928	00:00:30,720	| IOT054 |	And our guest today is
EDL	00:00:30,720	00:00:31,744	| IOT054 |	Matt Manley
EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:33,792	| IOT054 |	A fiord who's going to be talking to us about
EDL	00:00:34,304	00:00:37,376	| IOT054 |	Wearables and specifically designing smart jewelry
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:38,144	| IOT054 |	Which
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:39,680	| IOT054 |	You like what you like I was going to say
EDL	00:00:41,728	00:00:42,752	| IOT054 |	You still wear that by the way
EDL	00:00:44,544	00:00:50,944	| IOT054 |	The ring way that's what I meant to mention this like two weeks ago in the show but they now have a bracelet
EDL	00:00:50,944	00:00:52,736	| IOT054 |	Call the Aries bracelet that
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:53,248	| IOT054 |	Is
EDL	00:00:53,760	00:00:54,272	| IOT054 |	Very attractive
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:01:00,672	| IOT054 |	It's a thin gold band with a jewel in it and the Jewel is just like the Ringley tools so it's got the Bluetooth
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:05,536	| IOT054 |	The LEDs and it connects to your smartphone notifications
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:07,328	| IOT054 |	Be at the very attractive bracelet on your wrist
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,376	| IOT054 |	And
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:10,912	| IOT054 |	I was really excited about it
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:14,752	| IOT054 |	I believe you can order it for $195 during the
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:15,264	| IOT054 |	A priori
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:17,568	| IOT054 |	And yes early supporters
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:18,848	| IOT054 |	20% off
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:21,920	| IOT054 |	When you said the price 195 I cringed a little bit
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:23,200	| IOT054 |	But but but
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:24,736	| IOT054 |	This technically is
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:27,296	| IOT054 |	Jewelry that's not just a notification light.
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:28,576	| IOT054 |	Is designed to be
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:30,368	| IOT054 |	Jewelry yes and it
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:32,160	| IOT054 |	It's something that
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:36,000	| IOT054 |	I tend to wear so the actual and I should tell you the list price is actually
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:36,768	| IOT054 |	279
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:39,584	| IOT054 |	If you really think about this you should
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:42,400	| IOT054 |	With the ring
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:44,704	| IOT054 |	I don't wear it everyday but I do wear it
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:46,240	| IOT054 |	But I want to look nice
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:49,312	| IOT054 |	The nice thing about the Aries bracelets
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:50,080	| IOT054 |	Probably have mint
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:52,384	| IOT054 |	Is it is also acts as a fitness tracker
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:54,688	| IOT054 |	That makes a big difference
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:55,968	| IOT054 |	So yes
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:56,736	| IOT054 |	Sorry my bad
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,528	| IOT054 |	What is a step tracker
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:00,832	| IOT054 |	Plus provides all these notify
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:02,112	| IOT054 |	Vacations and
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:03,904	| IOT054 |	Movies in October
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:06,976	| IOT054 |	So later on this year you're going to actually be able to make payments
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:08,256	| IOT054 |	With it because they have this
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:09,280	| IOT054 |	Tie up with MasterCard
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:17,728	| IOT054 |	This is like a feature-packed device for people like me who don't like to carry their smartphone maybe in their paw
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:22,336	| IOT054 |	Pockets around with them all the time or who don't want to wear something that looks like technology
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:23,104	| IOT054 |	Right
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:23,872	| IOT054 |	This is pretty
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:26,432	| IOT054 |	It's it's very attractive
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:26,944	| IOT054 |	If I would wear it
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:32,832	| IOT054 |	What notifications are you getting right now on your ring wake that you probably would get also with us
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:35,904	| IOT054 |	Just like your diesel for emails if it were certain
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,720	| IOT054 |	Because the Ringley is so much more personal
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:41,536	| IOT054 |	I use it more for it so any time I get a text
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,304	| IOT054 |	A phone call
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:45,376	| IOT054 |	I also use it for Uber notice
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:48,704	| IOT054 |	Applications so if especially because if you're I'm waiting around like
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:53,312	| IOT054 |	And it's dark and weird outside I want to be like distracted by my smartphone
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:55,616	| IOT054 |	So when they River arrives my
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:01,760	| IOT054 |	And I tend to get Ubers like leaving very loud places like a bar or place like that n
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,784	| IOT054 |	You can't hear
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,320	| IOT054 |	The phone buzzing like
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:10,464	| IOT054 |	You can actually see that that's not nice
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,232	| IOT054 |	Feedback it vibrates
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:16,096	| IOT054 |	You can also see it because it glows I think my
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:16,608	| IOT054 |	Turn the LED
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:21,472	| IOT054 |	But you program it yourself so you can do Facebook notifications UK
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:22,752	| IOT054 |	Twitter
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:23,776	| IOT054 |	Email
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,824	| IOT054 |	It's not like
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:30,688	| IOT054 |	Massive amount of Airstream of notifications you're selecting which specific ones
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,456	| IOT054 |	You want them
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:33,504	| IOT054 |	Is it limited to certain numbers a certain like
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:40,160	| IOT054 |	Can you only do three different types of medications for samples and you have four
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:42,720	| IOT054 |	Different levels of haptic feedback it's like
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:43,744	| IOT054 |	1 vibration
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:44,256	| IOT054 |	2 vibrations
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:45,280	| IOT054 |	Before
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:50,400	| IOT054 |	You can make as many as you want I think after a while you might be
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:53,728	| IOT054 |	Hangouts
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,800	| IOT054 |	The other final thing I'll say about this
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:57,568	| IOT054 |	This is
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:59,872	| IOT054 |	They have a setting called Your Inner Circle
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:00,896	| IOT054 |	Armada Center
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:06,016	| IOT054 |	You can actually turn off notifications except for certain
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,552	| IOT054 |	People from your contacts
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,064	| IOT054 |	Craigslist
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,368	| IOT054 |	So then if your liking a super Inn
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,648	| IOT054 |	Meeting
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:14,720	| IOT054 |	Only distraction you're going to get from that thing is like
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:17,791	| IOT054 |	If your husband calls or if your daughter School calls would be my exam
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:23,423	| IOT054 |	I love it I think it's really applicable I don't wear it everyday it is expensive
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,471	| IOT054 |	It's probably one of those
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,495	| IOT054 |	It's a it's an add-on
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,287	| IOT054 |	I like the way it looks like actual
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:29,567	| IOT054 |	End
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:34,175	| IOT054 |	I do think the future of wearables is probably really cheap electronics stuck into every
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:37,247	| IOT054 |	Yeah yeah and we'll talk about that actually
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,367	| IOT054 |	So
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:44,159	| IOT054 |	And you know you could do in cufflinks to
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,927	| IOT054 |	Guys
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:45,439	| IOT054 |	Stay tuned
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:46,719	| IOT054 |	Okay
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:48,255	| IOT054 |	After that day
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,303	| IOT054 |	Fruitful day crash
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,375	| IOT054 |	Let's talk about routers
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:54,143	| IOT054 |	Woohoo
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,191	| IOT054 |	Routers we have to talk about routers
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:05:01,823	| IOT054 |	For two reasons one is because I'm sending back one that you loaned to me that you use in the past
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:04,895	| IOT054 |	But more importantly because another router company just got some
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,687	| IOT054 |	Funding dollars
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,735	| IOT054 |	I from Amazon
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:12,063	| IOT054 |	Which is
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:12,831	| IOT054 |	Honey
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:15,391	| IOT054 |	Saginil how many sides are there I don't know they're not sir
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:15,903	| IOT054 |	Six sides
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,183	| IOT054 |	Hexagon
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:20,767	| IOT054 |	Hexagons in your choice of colors white gray
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,303	| IOT054 |	Beige brown and orange
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,863	| IOT054 |	Aluminum
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,983	| IOT054 |	Make sense make sense
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:30,751	| IOT054 |	Lisa Rinna
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:36,639	| IOT054 |	Previously they're still available for pre-order they're very similar to the Eero devices which
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:39,199	| IOT054 |	We talked about before we'll talk about them with more 3 minutes
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:46,367	| IOT054 |	There's a lot less expensive at least get the pre-order level I know we talked about the prices before but just real quick they're 149
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:48,415	| IOT054 |	My First Single device 299 for 3 pack
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:53,023	| IOT054 |	As the police the pre-order price is cuz they're not quite available yet you can go on Amazon get them
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:55,071	| IOT054 |	I'll get on the list and pay for them I guess
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:57,631	| IOT054 |	But the years are 199 and
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:58,399	| IOT054 |	499
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:05:59,423	| IOT054 |	Side for a single in
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,447	| IOT054 |	3 pack soap
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,983	| IOT054 |	Big price difference at least
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,007	| IOT054 |	Initially put
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:06,079	| IOT054 |	How much did they take out I think it was
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:12,223	| IOT054 |	I was thinking how much did they raise
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:14,527	| IOT054 |	2.5 million.
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:20,159	| IOT054 |	Kneeling with a bunch of factors including though
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:20,671	| IOT054 |	Amazon
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:22,463	| IOT054 |	Excel
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,487	| IOT054 |	Amazon
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:30,143	| IOT054 |	Yeah former AT&T CEO
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:31,935	| IOT054 |	Results are back
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:38,335	| IOT054 |	And its founder Paul Judge one of the founders
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:38,847	| IOT054 |	Is
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:41,919	| IOT054 |	Big security guy he actually found a pin drop
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:42,431	| IOT054 |	Security
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:43,455	| IOT054 |	And
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:44,991	| IOT054 |	You know he's
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:47,039	| IOT054 |	The firm is based in in I believe Atlanta
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:50,367	| IOT054 |	And the idea with Luma is that
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:53,951	| IOT054 |	It improves your coverage using a mesh Network much like Eero does
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,743	| IOT054 |	But the big selling
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:56,767	| IOT054 |	When is going to be
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:57,279	| IOT054 |	Cheap rental car
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:00,863	| IOT054 |	Yes they have a really nice UI for
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:02,911	| IOT054 |	I I think it actually is done by
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:05,471	| IOT054 |	RPG and Chee
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:06,239	| IOT054 |	So you can
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,543	| IOT054 |	10 of Define the levels of
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,847	| IOT054 |	Access your kids can have
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:13,151	| IOT054 |	The Eros
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,431	| IOT054 |	Today
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:14,943	| IOT054 |	Hopefully that will change
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:17,247	| IOT054 |	They actually have kind of
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:22,367	| IOT054 |	Did they have much more granular permissions like you can turn off devices after certain times and that's
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:28,511	| IOT054 |	And in addition to the financing at they just to have sale serving out to

EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,631	| IOT054 |	If you wait until Junior
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:07,167	| IOT054 |	You're probably going to pay a lot more because
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:07,935	| IOT054 |	Is the pricing
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:13,567	| IOT054 |	We'll go up to what looks like 199 and 499 for the one device or three devices
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:16,639	| IOT054 |	Which is exactly the same as that you're also if you want to get in
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,431	| IOT054 |	Tulum azerli
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:20,223	| IOT054 |	Now's the Time to do it to save yourself a bunch of money
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:21,503	| IOT054 |	So I got to ask
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,527	| IOT054 |	What did you think
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:26,367	| IOT054 |	Hero
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:28,927	| IOT054 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:36,095	| IOT054 |	So this weekend I ripped out the Eros because you loan in the meeting I don't know two or three weeks ago I replaced the Google
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:36,863	| IOT054 |	P******
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:37,631	| IOT054 |	With the Eros
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,167	| IOT054 |	And guess what
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:43,775	| IOT054 |	I got a fever and the only prescription is more mesh Network
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,103	| IOT054 |	Oh man it was great it was
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:50,687	| IOT054 |	Great I mean I have my onhub back now and I already do
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,199	| IOT054 |	Miss
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:54,783	| IOT054 |	Average wind speed in some areas of my house that I had
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:57,087	| IOT054 |	With a 3-pack of Eros that you
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,879	| IOT054 |	Got for me to borrow and
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,391	| IOT054 |	Review
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:01,951	| IOT054 |	I almost want to send them back but I have to
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,791	| IOT054 |	By those by those Lumas now
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:08,607	| IOT054 |	Well that's a thing I mainly because if I went and bought the Eros now
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:12,191	| IOT054 |	It's 199 for what I reviewed
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,471	| IOT054 |	Yeah they were fantastic
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:18,335	| IOT054 |	Everything Titus 1:15 actually know about pre-ordering the lumos because I can get
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,359	| IOT054 |	Hopefully the same experience
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:22,431	| IOT054 |	At a much lower price but we will see
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:28,831	| IOT054 |	They were fantastic I couldn't say enough I did see some people complaining about them either reviewers or peep
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,599	| IOT054 |	Bottom
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,391	| IOT054 |	You know they're like I don't see a difference
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:36,255	| IOT054 |	You know it's so tricky with networking because there's so many variables every configurations differ
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,303	| IOT054 |	Every house or business
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,607	| IOT054 |	Is different architecture early materials are different
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:44,447	| IOT054 |	I don't know it my house all I can tell you is they worked
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:44,959	| IOT054 |	Great
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,239	| IOT054 |	I
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:49,055	| IOT054 |	Well second that I did notice though and they fixed it
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,359	| IOT054 |	But I did notice that when my
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,663	| IOT054 |	Internet access when offline
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,943	| IOT054 |	It took them
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,991	| IOT054 |	A little extra longer to come back up
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,063	| IOT054 |	Cuz sometimes during the day my internet get
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,855	| IOT054 |	Would get kind of spotty
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,391	| IOT054 |	Fix now but
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:09,535	| IOT054 |	When I was happening I would be offline and it would take them another five or 10 minutes to all boot back up again that was a
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:15,935	| IOT054 |	Yeah that's certainly frustrating I I did not have any I have FiOS here at the house 150 megabits up
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:16,959	| IOT054 |	Up and down never
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:20,799	| IOT054 |	How many outages while I was testing me so I can't I can't speak to it
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,311	| IOT054 |	I don't know
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,871	| IOT054 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,151	| IOT054 |	So let's talk about
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:28,991	| IOT054 |	Best switch out on the market today
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,783	| IOT054 |	Because The Wirecutter
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,807	| IOT054 |	Actually put out
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:32,319	| IOT054 |	The guide
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:38,463	| IOT054 |	To the best smart home Outlets when they were they called everybody and calls it a switch but you and I know it is a
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:38,975	| IOT054 |	Outlet
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,511	| IOT054 |	Right now these are
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,791	| IOT054 |	Technically switches are
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:42,559	| IOT054 |	Trellis Spa
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,143	| IOT054 |	That's okay
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:51,263	| IOT054 |	Yes they reviewed I don't know 7 or 8
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:56,895	| IOT054 |	For people who are not familiar with The Wirecutter that's what they do they they pick a device type
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,175	| IOT054 |	And they going yet
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,455	| IOT054 |	All the different competitors
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,991	| IOT054 |	Anime
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:03,039	| IOT054 |	Spend hours and hours and hours testing
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:06,367	| IOT054 |	And tell you what they think is the best in its class
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,135	| IOT054 |	So
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,415	| IOT054 |	I don't agree with
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,439	| IOT054 |	There
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,463	| IOT054 |	Zyrtec actually
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:14,047	| IOT054 |	I do too actually cuz I have one
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:16,863	| IOT054 |	This is a controversial I will say
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:21,471	| IOT054 |	Yeah they picked up Belkin WeMo Insight switch
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:23,007	| IOT054 |	We've talked about it before
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:26,847	| IOT054 |	You send me one I think makes my birthday to work all day was Christmas
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,359	| IOT054 |	Cuz I like
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:34,271	| IOT054 |	Thank you. Do you still have one or multiple cities or not
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,039	| IOT054 |	Amazon sale for Lake
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:37,087	| IOT054 |	40 bucks on Amazon
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:39,647	| IOT054 |	Actually goes on sale
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:41,951	| IOT054 |	Regularly
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,463	| IOT054 |	Keep an eye out
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,047	| IOT054 |	You know we used it actually 2
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:48,095	| IOT054 |	Find out how much energy are fish tank consume
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,119	| IOT054 |	Because I felt like
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,167	| IOT054 |	Consuming a lot of
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:54,495	| IOT054 |	I realized it
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:57,567	| IOT054 |	I can actually plug it into the fish tank light and only the 50
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,639	| IOT054 |	And now I'm going to turn off when I tell
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,199	| IOT054 |	Play Echo to turn off downstairs at night
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:03,967	| IOT054 |	Is an awesome
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:11,135	| IOT054 |	This does integrate with Echo obviously am with if this then that
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,927	| IOT054 |	It's great because it's
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:16,255	| IOT054 |	Cross-platform so whether use iOS or Android you can use the app
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:20,863	| IOT054 |	The app will is Stacy just said show you the amount of electricity consumed
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:22,655	| IOT054 |	Buy anything plug into the switch
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:24,191	| IOT054 |	It's 80 Wifi switch
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,007	| IOT054 |	Just hope the folks know that you don't need a
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:29,823	| IOT054 |	Don't need a hub or anything it's it works directly with an app
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,871	| IOT054 |	But it does Heather's integration
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:33,663	| IOT054 |	If it was a downside I would say
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:34,943	| IOT054 |	Tumi
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,223	| IOT054 |	It's just a single outlet
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:41,343	| IOT054 |	You know it would be nice if I had I can connect two things to this was just a single 3 prong outlet
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:43,903	| IOT054 |	It is although it's much smaller than the original
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,975	| IOT054 |	It doesn't take up your entire Outlet
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:50,303	| IOT054 |	It's also very sensitive the switch on top
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,839	| IOT054 |	Find myself
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:55,167	| IOT054 |	Oh this is something to note because I plugged it into a fish tank
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:58,239	| IOT054 |	When WeMo did its firmware updates
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:13:00,031	| IOT054 |	It would actually turn the fish tank off
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:03,103	| IOT054 |	And one day that happened in none of us noticed
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:05,407	| IOT054 |	Everybody to bed in
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:06,943	| IOT054 |	Thermometer
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:07,967	| IOT054 |	This is not a
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:09,247	| IOT054 |	The heater
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:12,063	| IOT054 |	That one off to in frozen fish
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:13,599	| IOT054 |	Yes we came to
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:15,647	| IOT054 |	Very sluggish fish than exmoor
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,159	| IOT054 |	Morning so
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,463	| IOT054 |	Get into something.
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:20,767	| IOT054 |	Fishdom
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:23,071	| IOT054 |	That would not be good
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:26,399	| IOT054 |	Some of the other ones they tested should we just at least mention us
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:27,935	| IOT054 |	Idevices
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,543	| IOT054 |	That was a runner-up by the way
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:34,591	| IOT054 |	And it's $40
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,895	| IOT054 |	Set a little cheaper and if your home kit family
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:41,759	| IOT054 |	Go for it cuz it also has a night light that has a little LED strip that changes colors
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:46,367	| IOT054 |	Some of the other ones in the competition that they
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:50,207	| IOT054 |	Tested but they didn't add to their best Paycor runner-up was the
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:52,767	| IOT054 |	Connectsense smart outlet
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:56,607	| IOT054 |	Not her that when I say it's the most expensive switch they test it so I don't know how much
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,631	| IOT054 |	It cost
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:00,447	| IOT054 |	So connectsense is a Internet of Things
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,727	| IOT054 |	Division of a larger
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:05,567	| IOT054 |	Actually interviewed Adam Justice they're smart home.
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:08,127	| IOT054 |	Related to some apple stuff on the show before
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:10,943	| IOT054 |	People who care about Wi-Fi
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:15,039	| IOT054 |	Should know about them because they make a lot of wifi-connected sensors
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:16,319	| IOT054 |	Like water
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:19,135	| IOT054 |	Water sensors that some other things and
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:22,975	| IOT054 |	It's nice because they're Wi-Fi they're not like zigbee or Z-Wave so you don't need a hug
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,767	| IOT054 |	Pecan to them
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,535	| IOT054 |	Is they are super
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:29,375	| IOT054 |	You know if you want to go out
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:29,887	| IOT054 |	Do the guys you should look
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:33,471	| IOT054 |	Gotcha yeah I'm looking these are $80
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:35,007	| IOT054 |	Switch on Amazon right now
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:36,799	| IOT054 |	What is a 82 Outlet
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,335	| IOT054 |	Bible say that
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,871	| IOT054 |	And does have him connect to
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,407	| IOT054 |	Certification
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:46,527	| IOT054 |	So who else had a look at the iHome isp5
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,575	| IOT054 |	They say was the only
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:52,415	| IOT054 |	Homekit compatible device they tested that has an Android app so
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:55,487	| IOT054 |	Obviously you can't use the homekit bit but at least
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:58,815	| IOT054 |	If you have an Android device have Android you can still use the switch
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,607	| IOT054 |	So that's good but
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,911	| IOT054 |	Play problems with it in homekit
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:03,935	| IOT054 |	So that's
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:06,239	| IOT054 |	Why didn't didn't make the cut
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:09,055	| IOT054 |	Feeling we all know
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,847	| IOT054 |	But they have a DSP w215
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,639	| IOT054 |	It just rolls off the tongue
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:14,943	| IOT054 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:17,759	| IOT054 |	What is a Bluetooth plugin
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,271	| IOT054 |	Witches
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:20,063	| IOT054 |	So they're using Avion
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:26,463	| IOT054 |	Which is a back-end for actually some of I believe it's ge's light switches to Bluetooth powered light switches
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:29,791	| IOT054 |	It's a Bluetooth mesh
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:35,679	| IOT054 |	I haven't been thrilled with the performance of any of the Bluetooth mesh devices that I've tried so far
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:39,519	| IOT054 |	So it becomes a challenge if you a don't have enough of them in your home
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:41,823	| IOT054 |	Create an actual mass in b
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:44,383	| IOT054 |	If you get too far away from it from your phone
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,919	| IOT054 |	You can actually control it
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,943	| IOT054 |	So depending on
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,735	| IOT054 |	Besides your house or
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:50,015	| IOT054 |	What you want to control it
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:50,527	| IOT054 |	Becomes kind of like
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,319	| IOT054 |	Forsook
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,879	| IOT054 |	Knock knock
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:57,439	| IOT054 |	Hidden rounding out the list with the Enemy
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,743	| IOT054 |	SP 2101w
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,535	| IOT054 |	Comes up with these names
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,375	| IOT054 |	I suppose yes
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:11,007	| IOT054 |	They said it'd be knocked down to the bottom of the list cuz it was the only one they tested that doesn't offer any sort of smart home integration
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:15,615	| IOT054 |	What I don't see though is
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:17,663	| IOT054 |	Like there are antech
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:18,431	| IOT054 |	Make something
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,199	| IOT054 |	Switches
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,735	| IOT054 |	Did actually
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:24,063	| IOT054 |	Tie into the SmartThings platform so they didn't try any of those
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:28,415	| IOT054 |	And maybe it's because they only work with SmartThings although there's a b switches sound like
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:29,183	| IOT054 |	Not really
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:30,719	| IOT054 |	Lowe's actually has some smart
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:31,999	| IOT054 |	Consider
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:34,047	| IOT054 |	Oh I probably know why cuz they're not wife
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:35,327	| IOT054 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:35,839	| IOT054 |	These were all hub
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:39,167	| IOT054 |	Consider make sense
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,703	| IOT054 |	Zulily
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,471	| IOT054 |	And
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:45,055	| IOT054 |	I don't know if you remember but I'm super keen on Zulily and they are
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:47,615	| IOT054 |	Bee smart Outlets that have the presence monitor
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,407	| IOT054 |	And it is I like
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,175	| IOT054 |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:50,943	| IOT054 |	I thought they were fun
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:54,783	| IOT054 |	They've actually since we last talked about them integrated with Philips Hue
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,575	| IOT054 |	So now like
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:58,623	| IOT054 |	Your Hue bulbs can come on when you enter the room
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:02,463	| IOT054 |	Which is kind of nice it's not just anything plugged into the outlet
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:05,023	| IOT054 |	So that feels like something they should probably
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,071	| IOT054 |	Very different
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:12,191	| IOT054 |	I'm betting you could reach out to them and make that happen
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:13,727	| IOT054 |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:14,495	| IOT054 |	So
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:15,519	| IOT054 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,287	| IOT054 |	And
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,055	| IOT054 |	That's kind of the
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:18,847	| IOT054 |	The Smart Switch you should buy
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:21,919	| IOT054 |	Moving right along we've got news from
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,967	| IOT054 |	I know the medical world
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,503	| IOT054 |	So
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:27,039	| IOT054 |	This is kind of a wacky story
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:29,855	| IOT054 |	It sounds I think cooler than it really was
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:31,391	| IOT054 |	But basically the story is
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,439	| IOT054 |	Intuit
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:33,951	| IOT054 |	A seizure
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:36,767	| IOT054 |	And doctors actually used his
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,535	| IOT054 |	Fitbit
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,559	| IOT054 |	2
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:40,607	| IOT054 |	See if they were able to give him
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:43,679	| IOT054 |	Some medicine to help bring down his heart rate
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,447	| IOT054 |	So
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:49,055	| IOT054 |	Just saved his life
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,383	| IOT054 |	That may be overstating it
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:54,431	| IOT054 |	Little Foot
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:58,783	| IOT054 |	So what happened is he came in after having a seizure
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,063	| IOT054 |	And
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:02,367	| IOT054 |	I noticed that he had a drill
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,391	| IOT054 |	Fibrillation
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:05,439	| IOT054 |	I'm so super fast heart rate
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,207	| IOT054 |	Heartbeat that
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,743	| IOT054 |	Is a regular
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:08,511	| IOT054 |	And
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:10,559	| IOT054 |	They have medicine they can give you
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:11,839	| IOT054 |	To treat that if
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:13,375	| IOT054 |	It's not a chronic issue
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:17,215	| IOT054 |	So what they did is say with the skies permission cuz he was up in conscious
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:20,543	| IOT054 |	Does Fitbit data to see if his heartbeat was always that wacky
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,591	| IOT054 |	Him and I found out today
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:25,663	| IOT054 |	It wasn't and it was because of the onset of the seizure
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,943	| IOT054 |	That his heartbeat at all
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,711	| IOT054 |	Call crazy
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,991	| IOT054 |	They were like
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:29,759	| IOT054 |	We could probably give you this medal
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,087	| IOT054 |	And that is the story
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:38,207	| IOT054 |	Actually I think I'm looking at the story now and I heard I seen the headlines
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:42,815	| IOT054 |	I'm just going to call that the doctors decided to reset his heart rate with electrical cardioversion
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:44,863	| IOT054 |	So
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:46,655	| IOT054 |	The Gamers app or something now
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:47,935	| IOT054 |	You're right
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:50,495	| IOT054 |	Yeah I was reading about this
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:57,151	| IOT054 |	This is this is why we don't talk medicine too much
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:19:00,735	| IOT054 |	The drive specified
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,527	| IOT054 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,295	| IOT054 |	Yeah so
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:08,415	| IOT054 |	I mean they're taking that just what the device is showing at that I'm looking at the guy but
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:10,463	| IOT054 |	As you said they're looking at his
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,487	| IOT054 |	The day that
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:12,255	| IOT054 |	It had collected
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:15,327	| IOT054 |	And that gave them the PetSmarts in the data
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:16,351	| IOT054 |	Decide what to do next
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:22,751	| IOT054 |	So it brings up some interesting questions the first one
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:24,031	| IOT054 |	Which for me is
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:26,591	| IOT054 |	These things are notoriously inaccurate so
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,895	| IOT054 |	I don't know how I feel about that
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:32,735	| IOT054 |	You can learn a lot from the trends
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:37,855	| IOT054 |	So let's let's say in certain situations you don't need 100% accuracy and when we say these things are not accurate
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,391	| IOT054 |	A lot of them
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:45,279	| IOT054 |	Have some glitches here and there or they're like 95% as accurate as a better actual
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,303	| IOT054 |	Heart rate monitor
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:52,447	| IOT054 |	That's good enough to get Trends and I think give them like in this case give the doctor's information they need to make a smart decision
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:54,495	| IOT054 |	So
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,775	| IOT054 |	Also speaking of Medicine
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:58,079	| IOT054 |	Because I thought this was really cool last
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,359	| IOT054 |	Was
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,127	| IOT054 |	Pfizer
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:00,895	| IOT054 |	You may have heard of
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:01,919	| IOT054 |	Lots of drugs
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:03,967	| IOT054 |	Teamed up with IBM
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:07,551	| IOT054 |	To basically build a Parkinson's monitoring
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:09,855	| IOT054 |	I'm going to call it a service because
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:11,647	| IOT054 |	It's not out yet
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:14,207	| IOT054 |	It's this isn't a theoretical we're talking about its age
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,743	| IOT054 |	And it's not one thing
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:19,583	| IOT054 |	So basically what they want to do is they want to wait
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:22,911	| IOT054 |	Monitor Parkinson's patients 24/7
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:24,703	| IOT054 |	Various different aspects of
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:26,239	| IOT054 |	You know how a patient's feeling
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:29,567	| IOT054 |	So they can start creating personalized treatment regimen
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:32,639	| IOT054 |	Which I think is really interesting
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:36,991	| IOT054 |	Also think it's really hard so I reached out to Pfizer to ask him a little bit more about this
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:43,903	| IOT054 |	Cuz they they want to build a clinical model by 2018 and start testing it and then have something they could prescribe to patients bite
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:44,415	| IOT054 |	20/20
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:46,207	| IOT054 |	So I was like wow that's
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:47,743	| IOT054 |	Big order
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:50,047	| IOT054 |	So they said what they're looking for
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:51,839	| IOT054 |	Is off-the-shelf sensors
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:52,863	| IOT054 |	So this could be anybody
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:56,447	| IOT054 |	And that they're looking for things that measure
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:58,751	| IOT054 |	Motion acceleration
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:20:59,263	| IOT054 |	Position
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:02,591	| IOT054 |	Interactions of a person with objects in their environment
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:04,127	| IOT054 |	Muscle activity brain Act
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:07,967	| IOT054 |	Breathing patterns in language production in organization
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:12,575	| IOT054 |	So some of those things actually can be done today with the smartphone they're actually apps
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,343	| IOT054 |	Detect
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:13,855	| IOT054 |	Parkinson's
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:16,928	| IOT054 |	Symptoms
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:17,952	| IOT054 |	They're not
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:20,000	| IOT054 |	You would then go to the doctor
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:26,144	| IOT054 |	So they're also looking for things that typically elderly and people who are struggling with motor disabilities can use which
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:29,728	| IOT054 |	That is a tall order because
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:31,776	| IOT054 |	A lot of the current Tech is really
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:33,312	| IOT054 |	Complicated to kind of implement
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:39,712	| IOT054 |	So you guys are trying to work with IBM to basically pull in all this off-the-shelf stuff and create
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:42,272	| IOT054 |	I really easy to use system and I'm not sure if they can do it in three
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:43,808	| IOT054 |	Tears
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:45,600	| IOT054 |	It's at I think it's a big ask
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:47,136	| IOT054 |	In in 3 years
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,672	| IOT054 |	I'm sorry two years
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:54,816	| IOT054 |	It's even bigger ass now to me whether they do it or not is that they putting out
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:22:02,240	| IOT054 |	An opportunity here because they've got this vision and they're specifying here's what we're going to be looking for from sensors and so on
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:04,032	| IOT054 |	We're going to work with IBM
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:06,592	| IOT054 |	To sift through the data and make these modern systems
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:10,176	| IOT054 |	I mean you might see a couple of businesses pop up as a result of these kind of
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:12,480	| IOT054 |	Announcements and that's very interesting to me
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:15,296	| IOT054 |	Is awesome it speaks to the fact
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:16,832	| IOT054 |	That Hardware is going to be kind of a
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:17,344	| IOT054 |	Commodity here
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:21,952	| IOT054 |	Looking for is to create the data and Analytics
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:26,048	| IOT054 |	Around how to measure Parkinson's and that's going to be super
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:27,328	| IOT054 |	Best hard part
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:31,680	| IOT054 |	Yes and if you think about how then you might prescribe treatment to some
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:36,288	| IOT054 |	You're no longer just getting like a handful of drugs you're going to be prescribed like a
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:37,824	| IOT054 |	A monitoring system
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:38,848	| IOT054 |	Before you make it your
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:42,688	| IOT054 |	There's things like Holter monitors which measure your heartbeat
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:44,224	| IOT054 |	Like all the time
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:45,760	| IOT054 |	You get those if they're trying to figure out life
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:47,552	| IOT054 |	Mycase why you keep thinking
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,904	| IOT054 |	People that got yours already
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,696	| IOT054 |	Prescribed medical devices but they are
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:55,744	| IOT054 |	Horrible clunky terrible things
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,560	| IOT054 |	So it'll be really interesting to see how this goes
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:22:59,840	| IOT054 |	I look
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:02,144	| IOT054 |	Exciting
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,424	| IOT054 |	I can't wait to hear more
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:06,240	| IOT054 |	And speaking of smarts
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:10,336	| IOT054 |	Sore not-so-smart depending on the situation
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:10,848	| IOT054 |	Exactly
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,456	| IOT054 |	Set home hub in Platte
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:17,760	| IOT054 |	Was purchased by Samsung
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:18,784	| IOT054 |	For the last
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:19,808	| IOT054 |	August month
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:20,576	| IOT054 |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:24,416	| IOT054 |	SmartThings users have been experiencing some trouble and I'm really sorry about that
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:29,536	| IOT054 |	What did you do stay safe
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:30,816	| IOT054 |	Mess with their databases
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:33,376	| IOT054 |	Apparently they had database weeks ago
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:36,704	| IOT054 |	Still having trouble
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:39,264	| IOT054 |	It's caused a lot of the rules to stop working
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:50,272	| IOT054 |	Yes there are 1207 replies currently with an estimated read time of 184 minutes so we're going to save you three
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,040	| IOT054 |	3 hours
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:52,064	| IOT054 |	And tell you what's what's what
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:54,112	| IOT054 |	A lot of upset people
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:55,648	| IOT054 |	A lot of upset
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:57,184	| IOT054 |	People talking about how
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:59,488	| IOT054 |	They need to fix the underlying
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,256	| IOT054 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:01,536	| IOT054 |	SmartThings is
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,072	| IOT054 |	They said on the thread
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:06,400	| IOT054 |	Situation they tell me that they are working on it
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:10,752	| IOT054 |	They don't have a time frame for that fix that they're willing to share
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:13,312	| IOT054 |	So I can't tell you anything more than
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:19,968	| IOT054 |	If you have SmartThings and if you noticed your rules not working or things going some people have reported there alarms going off in Hawaii
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,528	| IOT054 |	If that's happening to you
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:23,552	| IOT054 |	You're not alone
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,088	| IOT054 |	And
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:25,600	| IOT054 |	Effects of Cipro
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:30,208	| IOT054 |	It's interesting to me because just last week we did talk about
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:31,488	| IOT054 |	Revolve
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:35,072	| IOT054 |	The backend service is getting shut down so basically anybody who owns a revolve
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:37,120	| IOT054 |	They have nothing going to come May
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:38,144	| IOT054 |	Was the 15th or 16th
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:40,192	| IOT054 |	And I know I had mentioned
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,216	| IOT054 |	As I have in the past
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:47,360	| IOT054 |	Maybe you know a local bass system setup a server-side system cloud-based is the way to go
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:50,432	| IOT054 |	And sure enough I mean you can almost have the same thing again here because
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:57,088	| IOT054 |	What Samsung is saying is the issue the degradation of the system is because it on the database and messaging
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,624	| IOT054 |	So
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,392	| IOT054 |	You know
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:01,696	| IOT054 |	You're lying on the backend services and it's
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:05,024	| IOT054 |	Interesting that it's a high load on the infrastructure because
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:10,656	| IOT054 |	They know how many products are selling their for they know how many people there supporting with this and what the
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,448	| IOT054 |	Infrastructure needs to be able to do
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:13,984	| IOT054 |	But
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:14,752	| IOT054 |	It's not doing
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:15,520	| IOT054 |	Please not right now
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:16,544	| IOT054 |	And I'm trying to
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:17,568	| IOT054 |	Remember I don't
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:22,944	| IOT054 |	So that's another good question
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:23,968	| IOT054 |	A lot of companies
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:24,992	| IOT054 |	Is are using
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:25,504	| IOT054 |	Amazon
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:26,784	| IOT054 |	Uibe
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:29,856	| IOT054 |	Is there using a will say a well-known
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:31,392	| IOT054 |	High-profile
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,160	| IOT054 |	Cloud
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:33,952	| IOT054 |	Service for everything which is
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:34,976	| IOT054 |	I presume that they are
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:37,280	| IOT054 |	All of those are highly scalable
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:41,632	| IOT054 |	That's a good question
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:42,912	| IOT054 |	Yeso
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,680	| IOT054 |	What we don't know
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:44,960	| IOT054 |	We can only speculate
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:49,056	| IOT054 |	For next week
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:51,104	| IOT054 |	Well maybe it will be fixed by next
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:53,408	| IOT054 |	That would be the best solution ever
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:54,432	| IOT054 |	So what
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:57,248	| IOT054 |	So just so you know
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,016	| IOT054 |	Oh
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:59,040	| IOT054 |	Oh what
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:01,088	| IOT054 |	I think they might be hosted right now on
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,624	| IOT054 |	Samsung Sammy
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:06,208	| IOT054 |	For the internet Sammy cloud
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,536	| IOT054 |	Yes I'm looking at a blog post from
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,328	| IOT054 |	2015
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:17,728	| IOT054 |	State of Butte SmartThings open Cloud of suffering data aggregation service powered by Sammy which is Samsung Cloud for
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:18,496	| IOT054 |	Coyote
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:20,288	| IOT054 |	I'm biting my tongue
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,312	| IOT054 |	I'm biting my tongue
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:23,872	| IOT054 |	Maybe that's
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:26,944	| IOT054 |	What's happening cuz Sammy is actually still in beta it's supposed to
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,552	| IOT054 |	Okay I'm not going to
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:39,744	| IOT054 |	If there is dating Samsung Smart Home a smart things are hosting this on a beta cloud services
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,256	| IOT054 |	They have
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:43,072	| IOT054 |	Why would you run a production service
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:44,352	| IOT054 |	On a beta cloud service
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:46,144	| IOT054 |	That is a big No-No to me
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:46,912	| IOT054 |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:47,680	| IOT054 |	We'll have to ask some
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:51,520	| IOT054 |	This blog post is not making me feel like
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:53,824	| IOT054 |	That's not giving you a warm Sammy
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,104	| IOT054 |	It's not given
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,432	| IOT054 |	Alright so that's it
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:00,224	| IOT054 |	Stay tuned for our guest

EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:48,864	| IOT054 |	Family who's a group design director at Fjord Chicago
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:50,656	| IOT054 |	Hi Matt how are you doing
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:53,216	| IOT054 |	Great great thanks for having me
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:56,800	| IOT054 |	Oh I'm so glad because I am a sucker
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:59,104	| IOT054 |	For wearables and smart
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:27:59,872	| IOT054 |	Jewelry
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:02,432	| IOT054 |	Which is the topic for today so
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:06,272	| IOT054 |	I'm very curious because you and I had this conversation before the show
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:07,552	| IOT054 |	About
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:09,344	| IOT054 |	Your thoughts on where this is going to go
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,368	| IOT054 |	And so
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,904	| IOT054 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:13,952	| IOT054 |	The future of smart jewelry
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:14,976	| IOT054 |	Are we can have lots of it
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,512	| IOT054 |	None of it
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,024	| IOT054 |	What do you think
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:20,096	| IOT054 |	That's kind of interesting
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:24,704	| IOT054 |	The way I would look at it as we probably will have lots of it but we won't know it
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:28,800	| IOT054 |	I think that's kind of the underlying can a premise is all of the
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:32,640	| IOT054 |	That Notions of snow jewelry Society is kind of ambient intelligence so
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:37,248	| IOT054 |	At some point I think maybe the way it will kind of Eliza's you'll get used to just assuming that
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:40,064	| IOT054 |	Any particular kind of trinket or pieces
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:41,600	| IOT054 |	Baby wearing
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:43,904	| IOT054 |	Might actually kind of Hardware that little
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:46,208	| IOT054 |	Inside intelligence there other kind of smart
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:49,792	| IOT054 |	So what do we need to get there cuz right now
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:52,864	| IOT054 |	I've Loved smart jewelry because I hate looking at my phone
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:56,960	| IOT054 |	And my phone is off in my bag so I need something on my person that's like
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:59,264	| IOT054 |	This is ringing this is happening but right now it's
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:00,800	| IOT054 |	It's really hideous
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:01,312	| IOT054 |	I mean
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:04,384	| IOT054 |	Icy necklaces that look like little Kindles on
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:06,432	| IOT054 |	On ropes in its
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:08,736	| IOT054 |	I'm not wearing that
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:12,832	| IOT054 |	Yeah totally and I think we've we've kind of hit that point where people say you know
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:16,928	| IOT054 |	And one of the things that we we kind of joke about young in the studio is
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:20,256	| IOT054 |	Really you think about the first piece of smart jewelry or kind of connector
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:22,304	| IOT054 |	Text Amy this a house arrest bracelet
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:25,632	| IOT054 |	You know that's the thing that people kind of wearing their ankle
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:29,216	| IOT054 |	This is kind of announces hey this is a smart piece of jewelry
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:31,776	| IOT054 |	And we've kind of moves through that
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:35,872	| IOT054 |	Little segments as well where you look at these big kind of cocky
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:39,200	| IOT054 |	If screen that are sitting on somebody's wrist and it absolutely announces
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:43,040	| IOT054 |	This is basically a slave to my phone that's trapped in my body
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:50,208	| IOT054 |	People are kind of cleaning out of the market today in
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:53,792	| IOT054 |	And I love looking at the overall kind of kick-started universe
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:54,560	| IOT054 |	Just thinking
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:56,608	| IOT054 |	Keeping it like real-time ideas as how
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,632	| IOT054 |	People are checking these
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:58,144	| IOT054 |	Forms
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:01,216	| IOT054 |	Ideas
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:02,240	| IOT054 |	Let's just kind of
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:04,032	| IOT054 |	Create an object
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:05,312	| IOT054 |	That is really good
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:07,616	| IOT054 |	At signifying change or some kind of
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,384	| IOT054 |	Change in status
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:10,944	| IOT054 |	And how elegant we can we just
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:12,480	| IOT054 |	Acknowledge that that happen
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:14,528	| IOT054 |	This increasingly not becoming a screen.
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:17,600	| IOT054 |	Okay so I am
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:22,720	| IOT054 |	With you on that I have compared my two devices that I wear most often
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:25,280	| IOT054 |	When is an old school Pebble which has a screen
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:27,584	| IOT054 |	And the other is a Ringling
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:29,120	| IOT054 |	Which
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:32,448	| IOT054 |	And really is a beautiful piece of jewelry to me
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:34,752	| IOT054 |	I am kind of curious because it seems like
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:41,152	| IOT054 |	There's an issue of like the information we want at any one time for these devices and maybe something about
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:43,200	| IOT054 |	How we're handling notifications
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,224	| IOT054 |	Looks like maybe we need to
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:46,784	| IOT054 |	Accommodate ourselves to fewer
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:49,600	| IOT054 |	Notifications are only the most important ones
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:55,744	| IOT054 |	You're the only the most important I think is Witcher is what you're really kind of getting it and again something that we see everybody
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:01,888	| IOT054 |	You is kind of the right level engagement for them
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:06,240	| IOT054 |	This really get the initial kind of idea of what we would call Cam technology
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:10,336	| IOT054 |	Abacus Xerox Parc
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:12,640	| IOT054 |	Over 20 years ago now
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:13,152	| IOT054 |	At this point
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:15,968	| IOT054 |	Call David notion of Cam Technologies
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:20,576	| IOT054 |	It's some kind of change in status or gold kind of change in the Ambien
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:22,112	| IOT054 |	The world around us it happens
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:29,024	| IOT054 |	You may not need to know exactly what that changes at that moment or depending on how you set up your notifications
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,048	| IOT054 |	And you may know exactly
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:31,840	| IOT054 |	The type of changes happen
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:33,888	| IOT054 |	Really need to know that one woman is a
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:37,984	| IOT054 |	But when you talk about in a few minutes ago you some since you want to read a text
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:42,336	| IOT054 |	Since you want to get a little long form with and kind of know exactly what details
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,872	| IOT054 |	That's a completely different mode of thinking
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:48,992	| IOT054 |	And maybe you're not in the meeting maybe hopefully you know you're not driving you're not doing any of those kinds of things here
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:49,760	| IOT054 |	You're the moment of rest
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:51,552	| IOT054 |	You kind of get into that
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:54,368	| IOT054 |	Let's that frankly is probably a different device
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:56,160	| IOT054 |	And that's something that gets away
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:57,440	| IOT054 |	Anyway
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:32:02,560	| IOT054 |	I think overall smart jewelry is going to so if we if we accept that jewelry is going to be
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,352	| IOT054 |	Place for contact
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:06,400	| IOT054 |	How many
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:08,704	| IOT054 |	Variations of notifications do you think
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:09,728	| IOT054 |	Creatinine
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:14,592	| IOT054 |	There are things
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:16,640	| IOT054 |	I want to know very specific
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:19,200	| IOT054 |	So like
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:20,480	| IOT054 |	Is my daughter's school called
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:28,928	| IOT054 |	And that's a different from the haptic feedback I get for if an Uber has arrived which is another great place for
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:29,440	| IOT054 |	Totally
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:32,512	| IOT054 |	I mean that's kind of a great question when you think about me
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:35,840	| IOT054 |	How many in and what's the changing texture here that we have
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:40,960	| IOT054 |	Frankly that's a rolling question that is something that we always have to just kind of watching and it gets
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:41,984	| IOT054 |	And no pun intended there
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:45,312	| IOT054 |	But it gets into your basically personal app
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:47,104	| IOT054 |	I mean for some people
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:53,504	| IOT054 |	The notion of saying okay 1 buzz on my wrist needs an Uber is here and two buses mean 5th and all might my ring lit up
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:54,272	| IOT054 |	Color
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:56,320	| IOT054 |	Things like that that's actually the complexity
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:57,088	| IOT054 |	Some people
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:59,136	| IOT054 |	But I don't know if there's ever
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:01,696	| IOT054 |	Going to be one kind of canonical
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:04,512	| IOT054 |	If this is it
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,280	| IOT054 |	Space to play in
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:07,840	| IOT054 |	Is getting people kind of the freedom
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:09,888	| IOT054 |	And see what we've got all these different devices
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:13,728	| IOT054 |	With all these different applications that offer certain survey
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:18,336	| IOT054 |	The way we look at it is this notion of everything that we do is a little
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:19,360	| IOT054 |	Service
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:21,920	| IOT054 |	Give people the opportunity
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:24,224	| IOT054 |	To make their own orchestration
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:25,248	| IOT054 |	But what about
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:29,600	| IOT054 |	The particular devices because that's another way I could have my ring be my
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:32,160	| IOT054 |	Child
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:33,696	| IOT054 |	But I'm totally
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:40,608	| IOT054 |	You know a watch that gives me something else or I'm thinking that there's a bracelet I think it's called the June bracelet that tracks your
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:41,120	| IOT054 |	UV exposure
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,656	| IOT054 |	Actually
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:43,936	| IOT054 |	I think it doesn't
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:44,704	| IOT054 |	The color
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:51,104	| IOT054 |	I'm going to be stuck with not one device that's getting us everything like a smartphone and we're just having
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:52,128	| IOT054 |	First threat of her body
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:54,688	| IOT054 |	I think again
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:59,808	| IOT054 |	People wanted to do it that way I wanted articulated they absolutely could you the way that something is
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,088	| IOT054 |	You put it on now that's
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:02,624	| IOT054 |	Qi devices right there there on the market
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:04,672	| IOT054 |	And there's many others or you could
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:08,256	| IOT054 |	Kind of divide and conquer if you will types of information
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,560	| IOT054 |	Fur type of device stipend
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:15,680	| IOT054 |	It might be kind of a mental look like for people to kind of know if this happens it's this classification is
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,192	| IOT054 |	Information
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:17,984	| IOT054 |	I think it's entirely possible
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:21,056	| IOT054 |	I think one other thing that you can see that again is
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:23,360	| IOT054 |	Bring it down to one device
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:26,176	| IOT054 |	Could basically use things like light haptic feedback
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:33,088	| IOT054 |	My other screen color changing with the light as it is a very interesting thing every kind of looking at 2 but it just really kind of gets into
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:35,648	| IOT054 |	Articulation how complex you wanted
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:38,208	| IOT054 |	I'm some of these devices
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:39,488	| IOT054 |	Once you get past qunar
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:40,256	| IOT054 |	Light
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:41,536	| IOT054 |	And vibration
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:43,072	| IOT054 |	As a general color changes
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:45,376	| IOT054 |	You can do a lot with your sister
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:47,424	| IOT054 |	Two simple things so I don't know if we need
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:48,960	| IOT054 |	Necessarily more and more
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:51,264	| IOT054 |	Plx devices I think it comes down to
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:53,312	| IOT054 |	A personal choice
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:54,336	| IOT054 |	Individual
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:59,712	| IOT054 |	I think I could actually use one of these for like dessert or eating too many calories I could use like a little
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:06,112	| IOT054 |	A joke about that to all the time just kind of been negative feedback
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:06,880	| IOT054 |	Sky devices
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:11,232	| IOT054 |	It's funny when we do our user research all the time you see
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:13,024	| IOT054 |	You see people kind of phone that's really the one
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:14,560	| IOT054 |	Cancel
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:15,072	| IOT054 |	Campaign
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:19,424	| IOT054 |	All about it can't wait to have a can't wait to think about the power that they could
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:21,984	| IOT054 |	Kind of harness for this to make your day that much more fluid
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:24,800	| IOT054 |	And then there's the other Camp it automatically goes into
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:26,080	| IOT054 |	Dog leash territory
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:28,640	| IOT054 |	I'm kind of a slave to be
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:32,992	| IOT054 |	And so we kind of jokingly in a get into geofencing and things like that
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:40,672	| IOT054 |	If in your case with dessert If You Walk This Way
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:41,696	| IOT054 |	Or whatever
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:43,488	| IOT054 |	Yeah we just kind of
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:45,280	| IOT054 |	You gently remind you your
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:48,352	| IOT054 |	You're flying too close to the Sun here you're kind of going a little bit
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:49,632	| IOT054 |	You're too far over there but
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:56,032	| IOT054 |	Rest assured that if I break my dessert diet I am not doing for carrot cake
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:59,360	| IOT054 |	To get these things as ubiquitous as I feel like you're
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:00,128	| IOT054 |	You're saying they might be
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:02,688	| IOT054 |	I feel like they have to be a lot cheaper
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:04,992	| IOT054 |	Are we going to war
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:09,088	| IOT054 |	I don't see a reason why it wouldn't follow the the basic premises tomorrow slots
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:11,904	| IOT054 |	Increase power cheaper price
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:16,512	| IOT054 |	As you see the proliferation of these things happen and then frankly is the market kind of
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:19,584	| IOT054 |	Find new ways to use this Intelligencer
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:22,656	| IOT054 |	New situations that could be benefited from this intelligence
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:26,240	| IOT054 |	I don't see why there wouldn't be a driver to help keep in
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:27,776	| IOT054 |	Several causes of
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:28,800	| IOT054 |	NBA games into device
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:32,896	| IOT054 |	No sew when I'm using these devices
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:35,456	| IOT054 |	And as they become more ubiquitous
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:38,016	| IOT054 |	There's a challenge associated with
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:38,784	| IOT054 |	Programming them
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:42,368	| IOT054 |	So designers could go one of two ways
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:45,184	| IOT054 |	They could make it basically a soft programmable
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:46,464	| IOT054 |	Kind of devices
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:48,768	| IOT054 |	Myron Lee in many ways is that
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:49,792	| IOT054 |	Because I've got
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:51,584	| IOT054 |	So many options with the app
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:54,912	| IOT054 |	I assigned you this ice I knew that we could just go with a 1
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:56,448	| IOT054 |	Function device
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:36:59,264	| IOT054 |	Set selected UV monitor
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,824	| IOT054 |	Maybe a health bracelet
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:07,712	| IOT054 |	Looking for a wearable that has an accelerometer on it and just
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:09,504	| IOT054 |	Tells people when I fall down
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:12,064	| IOT054 |	That's all I wanted to do on cuz I faint a lot
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:13,088	| IOT054 |	I wanted to
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:16,160	| IOT054 |	Say oh my God Stacy
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:18,208	| IOT054 |	Call frigates the new phone and I can't get up
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:21,024	| IOT054 |	Mantra
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:24,608	| IOT054 |	Exactly
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:26,656	| IOT054 |	So I guess the question there is
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:31,776	| IOT054 |	How do we think about do I develop a soft programmable button or do I develop
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:33,056	| IOT054 |	Dedicated function
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:35,104	| IOT054 |	Is there really any bifurcation there I don't
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:36,896	| IOT054 |	Sure
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:38,432	| IOT054 |	So I think again
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:44,064	| IOT054 |	I tend to kind of go more towards a programmable just because if a if I look at this from the marketability standpoint
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:47,904	| IOT054 |	And there's a couple of days a couple days to cut this frankly but
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:49,184	| IOT054 |	If I look at it from a programmatic
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:50,208	| IOT054 |	And points
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:52,512	| IOT054 |	And again we were talking you before
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:54,304	| IOT054 |	Ford about if this then that
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:57,632	| IOT054 |	The nature of being able to kind of give a lot of people
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:38:00,960	| IOT054 |	Very easy ways to string together events
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:01,728	| IOT054 |	The daily program
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:07,360	| IOT054 |	Having a kind of agnostic kind of language to again chain things together in an easy way
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:10,944	| IOT054 |	My mind anyway would only increase the ability for a device to be except
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:14,016	| IOT054 |	Because it's either something that I can with
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:16,064	| IOT054 |	Little to no programming knowledge but
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:18,624	| IOT054 |	Am I pretty easy to grasp mental model
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:21,952	| IOT054 |	You can put these things together to make this device work for me
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:23,232	| IOT054 |	I got it
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:27,840	| IOT054 |	On the flip side though another way to cut it nothing at the kind of concert
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:35,520	| IOT054 |	Something that you can bring out this it's kind of like the Google search bar and an idea to do one thing or do one
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:41,664	| IOT054 |	What we talked about the Studio's is kind of the Polaroid camera are the gumball machine affected only does one thing
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:45,248	| IOT054 |	Put a nickel in it I get a gumball I push the button I get a picture
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:46,016	| IOT054 |	SimpliSafe
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,064	| IOT054 |	The sing about that
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:50,880	| IOT054 |	Is when it's a single-minded object
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:52,672	| IOT054 |	Those markets are they there now
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:59,328	| IOT054 |	I'm so depending on how good quote-unquote the idea is kind of depends and kind of dictates on the marketability of the Opera
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:03,680	| IOT054 |	I tend to lean more towards programmatic so people have choice
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:05,472	| IOT054 |	Make the device shape-shift
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:06,752	| IOT054 |	I'm a little bit more for that purse
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:13,664	| IOT054 |	Okay well in those devices would probably be more expensive because they have more sensors or more outputs
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:16,224	| IOT054 |	Where is a single function device might be
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:20,320	| IOT054 |	I assume one day we'll get to the point where we have like
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:22,112	| IOT054 |	I can be bracelet that's
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:25,440	| IOT054 |	It's just everywhere and maybe it's really cheap so
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:29,536	| IOT054 |	Sure
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:35,680	| IOT054 |	I think it's totally fair especially in the near-term and I think again that that follows the same general kind of premises
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:40,032	| IOT054 |	You know right now that multi-sensor device may be more expensive
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:45,152	| IOT054 |	36 months from now so I don't know if I could be a part of the conversation
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:46,688	| IOT054 |	Gosh I hope
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:47,456	| IOT054 |	Not cuz I
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:51,296	| IOT054 |	My theory is that wearable technology will be
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:52,832	| IOT054 |	Pretty much
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:53,600	| IOT054 |	Ubiquitous
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:55,392	| IOT054 |	And hopefully
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:57,696	| IOT054 |	In as many things as possible much like yourself
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:40:00,512	| IOT054 |	In the big questions I have about it are
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:02,560	| IOT054 |	How are we going to program them
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:03,840	| IOT054 |	And
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:07,168	| IOT054 |	And I also have questions about the environmental aspects of that
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:09,472	| IOT054 |	And
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:13,056	| IOT054 |	How do we assign functions to them cuz I can think of
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:16,128	| IOT054 |	Well I can think of so many things I mean
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:18,176	| IOT054 |	Like that the golf club is a great example
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:22,016	| IOT054 |	I don't know if I would have thought payments with a glove but
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:27,136	| IOT054 |	It makes a lot of sense if you think about winter you know going through Subway turnstile and having mittens with
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:31,744	| IOT054 |	So
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:32,512	| IOT054 |	Totally
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:37,120	| IOT054 |	Yeah it's a it's kind of a short hop from you know here were talking about the spirit objects with
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,912	| IOT054 |	Necklace or ring what have you
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:45,312	| IOT054 |	Pretty short hop is leasing to get more and more Ambien going to give me work talk about outer outer edges of things but not
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:46,080	| IOT054 |	Terribly far away
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:48,128	| IOT054 |	Conductive
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:49,664	| IOT054 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:52,480	| IOT054 |	How to weave these things into
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:55,296	| IOT054 |	More more can an interesting objects it's a
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,320	| IOT054 |	It's not far off
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:58,112	| IOT054 |	Ethereality,
EDL	00:40:58,624	00:40:59,904	| IOT054 |	Google has projects
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:02,720	| IOT054 |	Jacquard they're working with Levi's
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:10,656	| IOT054 |	I actually at South by Southwest side backpack that was made by a company that does costumes for Rihanna and Lady Gaga
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:15,520	| IOT054 |	When you're listening to music the back of the backpack has like
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:16,032	| IOT054 |	This little light show
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:22,176	| IOT054 |	Everybody behind you loves you and you
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:27,552	| IOT054 |	Exactly exactly
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:28,320	| IOT054 |	It was very pretty
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:32,160	| IOT054 |	So I enjoyed it but I was like man that's going to cost a lot
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:34,976	| IOT054 |	Can't really see a lot of utility there
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:36,512	| IOT054 |	So yeah
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:43,424	| IOT054 |	What's interesting about your payment
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:44,192	| IOT054 |	Going to go
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:46,496	| IOT054 |	I don't know if you seen you've probably seen the Top Shop
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:47,776	| IOT054 |	The Barclays Topshop
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:53,407	| IOT054 |	Penetrate gets a little payment object that they've done a little jewelry that's all payment
EDL	00:41:53,407	00:41:55,455	| IOT054 |	Air bases in the UK but
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:42:02,367	| IOT054 |	Super super interesting kind of fun form-factor obviously they're their kind of geared towards the Top Shop
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:05,695	| IOT054 |	It's a huge Market kind of thing but
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:11,839	| IOT054 |	Just really interesting Begley kind of J-pop kind of form factors and things like that there's a barclaycard integrated with it
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:16,703	| IOT054 |	As well so can you starting to see
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:18,751	| IOT054 |	Is this kind of interesting intersection
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:22,591	| IOT054 |	Greensky payment logic in all these different kinds of objects
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:24,383	| IOT054 |	Pushed into all different kinds of
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:26,431	| IOT054 |	Mia bracelets Rebel just
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:28,735	| IOT054 |	Interesting statement pieces that don't
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:30,271	| IOT054 |	Explicitly look like
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:31,551	| IOT054 |	Your computer
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:32,319	| IOT054 |	On my wrist
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:33,599	| IOT054 |	Things like that so
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:36,415	| IOT054 |	Obviously the Disney Magic Band and all that kind of stuff
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:39,999	| IOT054 |	Gone over that ground well as well as coffee ground for them to
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:42,303	| IOT054 |	Well and I feel like we've gotten
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:44,351	| IOT054 |	So used to
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:45,119	| IOT054 |	Before
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:47,423	| IOT054 |	We've gotten so used to bands with like the jaw bone
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:50,495	| IOT054 |	Fitness trackers in them
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:54,079	| IOT054 |	I'm trying to remember when that started but
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:57,919	| IOT054 |	Aldi Livestrong bracelets those those
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:01,759	| IOT054 |	Big fat yellow bracelet
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:06,111	| IOT054 |	I feel like we've been training ourselves to add to becoming
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:06,879	| IOT054 |	Used to this kind of
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:09,695	| IOT054 |	Conky plastic ugliness underarms
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:11,999	| IOT054 |	I totally think at one point
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:15,327	| IOT054 |	What's really interesting is in you look at with Tory Burch did with Fitbit
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:21,471	| IOT054 |	Yes it is the classic men's black plastic form factor going to just kind of Screams and technological object
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:24,799	| IOT054 |	Yeah it's up here at the end they get together with toy birds
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:28,127	| IOT054 |	You look at their site you look at their kind of merchandising
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:33,503	| IOT054 |	It's the Tory Burch X Fitbit kind of thing in there and their jewelry sleeves their their sleeves
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:35,551	| IOT054 |	Just like the Fitbit with indicted
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:39,647	| IOT054 |	These are upwards of $200
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:47,071	| IOT054 |	Interesting thing of logic and fashion and you can look at it and go it's
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:49,887	| IOT054 |	Basically a container to hide the Fitbit Within
EDL	00:43:50,399	00:43:53,983	| IOT054 |	People don't advertise you that big chunky piece of plastic
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:43:58,847	| IOT054 |	I kind of look at that again is another read from the culture that
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:02,687	| IOT054 |	Some people might want to display the fact that it's a smart object with have you but
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:05,503	| IOT054 |	Once the kind of moment if this is
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:10,367	| IOT054 |	Kind of disappears or maybe there's other statuses that are more important
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:11,135	| IOT054 |	What you mean
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:13,183	| IOT054 |	Then showing that I've got a technological apps
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:17,023	| IOT054 |	Then you see these other companies coming out of it snow
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:20,863	| IOT054 |	Be very kind of consciousness
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:24,703	| IOT054 |	Other brands going to move into that space that's obviously signal sensitive
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:27,007	| IOT054 |	Osher and
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:30,847	| IOT054 |	That's one of the things I'm curious about because if you think about building 2
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:32,383	| IOT054 |	Containers for these devices
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:34,687	| IOT054 |	It limits where you can put them
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:36,735	| IOT054 |	It limits the style of jewelry
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:38,527	| IOT054 |	And also
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:42,111	| IOT054 |	Because these devices change their form factor overtime
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:46,207	| IOT054 |	I don't know how long the Toria at like if I spend $200 on a bracelet
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:49,279	| IOT054 |	Promoted bit I'm really hoping that Fitbit doesn't
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:53,375	| IOT054 |	Make a form factor that's bigger than my bracelet or
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:54,399	| IOT054 |	Venusaur
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:56,703	| IOT054 |	Yeah
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:59,263	| IOT054 |	Totally and I think that's always going to be
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:00,031	| IOT054 |	Kakashi
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:02,335	| IOT054 |	Elizabeth fairy Liquid Marketing General in fashion
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:08,223	| IOT054 |	Generals of is a pretty liquid market so I think you're right the kind of had some kind of caution about changing forms and
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:11,807	| IOT054 |	You can work now we're kind of getting into the idea of him
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:12,575	| IOT054 |	Tekken
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:13,343	| IOT054 |	Standards oh that's
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:15,135	| IOT054 |	You know that's never a problem
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:16,671	| IOT054 |	Internet
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:19,743	| IOT054 |	Yeah they mean so that's it I think you're very right to going to bring that up
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:27,935	| IOT054 |	Things like that so they don't
EDL	00:45:27,935	00:45:33,055	| IOT054 |	Didn't necessarily hide the fact that there might be some form factors from the Fitbit line that aren't
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:34,847	| IOT054 |	I'm going to work with you
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:36,127	| IOT054 |	What do sleeves but
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:40,735	| IOT054 |	I think that's something to kind of be caught and who knows maybe the bracelet
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:42,271	| IOT054 |	I'm attractive enough
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:44,063	| IOT054 |	Just work on its own even if it doesn't have any
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:44,831	| IOT054 |	Macon haidian weekend
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:47,391	| IOT054 |	Do I have to ask
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:48,159	| IOT054 |	Before we go
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:49,695	| IOT054 |	What is your thought
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:50,975	| IOT054 |	On SmartWatches
EDL	00:45:51,487	00:45:51,999	| IOT054 |	Or watches
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:53,791	| IOT054 |	How do you
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:57,375	| IOT054 |	I think they're great I mean honestly there is about a year-and-a-half ago
EDL	00:45:57,887	00:46:02,751	| IOT054 |	I was kind of the doubting Thomas other than said you know we're going to look and see what we were working on a wearable
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:07,103	| IOT054 |	Point of view that a little bit over a year ago and we can't really
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:10,943	| IOT054 |	You talk about it and if we kind of live with it and kind of bring it in and kind of
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:14,783	| IOT054 |	I'll be able to speak from experience as opposed to just secondhand heard of it and
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:16,831	| IOT054 |	I was pretty surprised
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:17,855	| IOT054 |	Intransigent
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:21,439	| IOT054 |	Personal relationship to the watch me there were times I felt like it this is Jeff
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:26,559	| IOT054 |	You just a thing that's kind of telling you what I already knew was going to happen and I'm maybe a little bit slave to it
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:28,607	| IOT054 |	But there are certain situations
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:30,911	| IOT054 |	Particularly with driving and driving directions
EDL	00:46:30,911	00:46:32,447	| IOT054 |	I was really kind of helps me but
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:36,031	| IOT054 |	But in general don't look at the watch and you see again
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:38,847	| IOT054 |	The nature of the four factors of watches
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:39,359	| IOT054 |	Is kind of
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:42,175	| IOT054 |	Disappearing away from those ideas
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:44,735	| IOT054 |	Object and getting back tomorrow rethinking this
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:46,271	| IOT054 |	The classic golden quotes
EDL	00:46:46,271	00:46:50,111	| IOT054 |	Your representation of a lot so if you look at something like that I call here and they're connected Lots
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:53,695	| IOT054 |	I'm a look at their faces and some of these luxury watches that are coming out
EDL	00:46:55,231	00:46:56,767	| IOT054 |	Are they still kind of
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:46:58,559	| IOT054 |	Hide their smartness a little bit
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:02,399	| IOT054 |	I think it's a piece of jewelry as a way to kind of
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:07,007	| IOT054 |	Convenient relationship status I think it said it's a Greek in the middle of the line piece
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:09,311	| IOT054 |	Be simple as he watches for notification
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:10,847	| IOT054 |	Amore
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:13,919	| IOT054 |	Just some point can give you a little bit more information
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:16,479	| IOT054 |	The first notifications and things like that
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:17,247	| IOT054 |	If you need to
EDL	00:47:18,271	00:47:21,343	| IOT054 |	I think it's xbaby just another way of looking at a piece of
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:23,391	| IOT054 |	Piece of jewelry or another object that
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:25,439	| IOT054 |	Can be assumed to be smart
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:27,231	| IOT054 |	It's totally fine
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:30,815	| IOT054 |	Okay and I would like to see all of this stuff
EDL	00:47:30,815	00:47:32,863	| IOT054 |	All of the data move into
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:33,887	| IOT054 |	A kind of
EDL	00:47:33,887	00:47:36,703	| IOT054 |	Unified place like a healthcare or jewelry kit
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:37,983	| IOT054 |	Maybe it's a way to think of it
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:41,311	| IOT054 |	Because I really would like to be able to like
EDL	00:47:41,311	00:47:43,359	| IOT054 |	Linked my jewelry of the day
EDL	00:47:43,359	00:47:44,383	| IOT054 |	To my phone
EDL	00:47:45,407	00:47:47,455	| IOT054 |	All of the information that I'm trying to
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:48,223	| IOT054 |	Today
EDL	00:47:48,223	00:47:50,527	| IOT054 |	Worried all of the things that I've decided work with
EDL	00:47:50,527	00:47:51,295	| IOT054 |	Each piece of jewelry
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:55,391	| IOT054 |	Sent to it each day so it like authenticate each day
EDL	00:47:55,391	00:47:56,415	| IOT054 |	As opposed to
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:47:59,743	| IOT054 |	Having a device that have to individually program
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:01,535	| IOT054 |	Or the missing
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:02,815	| IOT054 |	Does that make sense
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:14,079	| IOT054 |	I think the closest way to get it that is through some sort of third-party aggregator
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:18,431	| IOT054 |	Again where you can kind of raita recipe or something like that so you're not
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:20,991	| IOT054 |	And stuck with all of these individual
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:25,087	| IOT054 |	And I have to choreograph everything on the device by device levels opposed
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:31,231	| IOT054 |	Maybe these things can all just kind of integrate with one particular Harbor one centralized area and get all of it since
EDL	00:48:32,255	00:48:36,863	| IOT054 |	I'm that way that's when it's almost like a style sheet for all the devices and kind of cascade from there
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:39,423	| IOT054 |	Got it so it's been 10 minutes on it
EDL	00:48:39,423	00:48:40,703	| IOT054 |	As opposed to spending
EDL	00:48:40,703	00:48:44,543	| IOT054 |	Every morning opening up different
EDL	00:48:45,055	00:48:45,567	| IOT054 |	Applications
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:46,847	| IOT054 |	Totally
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:49,407	| IOT054 |	I mean it just seems to be kind of a drag
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:52,991	| IOT054 |	If your home nature and whole kind of idea underneath all of this
EDL	00:48:52,991	00:48:55,039	| IOT054 |	Yo sensibly is CID has Ambien and teller
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:56,063	| IOT054 |	Okay great
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:48:59,647	| IOT054 |	If I have to spend the first part of my day
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:03,999	| IOT054 |	And it's raining these things I'm telling you what to do and everything on the Nikes Wikispaces
EDL	00:49:04,767	00:49:07,071	| IOT054 |	There's not much that's ambien or intelligent
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:11,935	| IOT054 |	Hopefully the ideas of these things can also learn a little bit
EDL	00:49:11,935	00:49:13,727	| IOT054 |	If you want more anticipatory once
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:14,239	| IOT054 |	You set the basic
EDL	00:49:15,263	00:49:18,335	| IOT054 |	Awesome but I eagerly await my earrings that
EDL	00:49:18,335	00:49:19,359	| IOT054 |	Can you give me directions
EDL	00:49:21,151	00:49:22,175	| IOT054 |	There you go
EDL	00:49:22,175	00:49:24,223	| IOT054 |	Actually done a couple
EDL	00:49:24,223	00:49:27,551	| IOT054 |	Exactly like that but snooze haptic based navigation
EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:29,599	| IOT054 |	I'm using different devices
EDL	00:49:29,599	00:49:33,439	| IOT054 |	Just like hearing some things like that's a really interesting kind of projects we can put it together
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:36,767	| IOT054 |	It's that whole notion it's very silent
EDL	00:49:36,767	00:49:38,815	| IOT054 |	Very kind of just-in-time intelligence to help
EDL	00:49:38,815	00:49:39,583	| IOT054 |	Eagle owl
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:40,863	| IOT054 |	And that's not going to the day
EDL	00:49:41,375	00:49:43,935	| IOT054 |	Get you away from glancing at screens all day and helps you
EDL	00:49:43,935	00:49:45,983	| IOT054 |	How to be more heads up in and presents
EDL	00:49:45,983	00:49:49,055	| IOT054 |	I can do realize that supposed to kind of falling down from digital hole 15
EDL	00:49:50,079	00:49:56,223	| IOT054 |	Awesome alright with Matt thanks so much for coming on the show this week thanks for having me it's been a pleasure talking to you
EDL	00:49:56,735	00:50:02,879	| IOT054 |	Thank you so much for listening to this week's podcast will see you next week
