EDL	00:00:20,992	00:00:22,272	| IOT037 |	I think it's going to be kind of late
EDL	00:00:22,784	00:00:23,552	| IOT037 |	A downer of a show
EDL	00:00:24,064	00:00:26,112	| IOT037 |	I was just going to say that if you are
EDL	00:00:26,112	00:00:31,744	| IOT037 |	Expecting something peppy and bright and cheerful for the holidays were acting to start off with some not-so-happy stuff
EDL	00:00:32,512	00:00:37,888	| IOT037 |	Yeah I'll do it if you want I'll sing a song we can we can have a cheerful holiday rendition of like Deck the Halls
EDL	00:00:37,888	00:00:38,400	| IOT037 |	Later on
EDL	00:00:39,424	00:00:41,472	| IOT037 |	Or or an item
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:44,544	| IOT037 |	It's the truth but I'm still listening
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:45,568	| IOT037 |	Well
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:47,616	| IOT037 |	Okay
EDL	00:00:47,616	00:00:49,408	| IOT037 |	So let's get started with
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:50,688	| IOT037 |	Earlier this week
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:51,456	| IOT037 |	Start with my
EDL	00:00:51,968	00:00:53,504	| IOT037 |	Instigation
EDL	00:00:54,016	00:00:54,784	| IOT037 |	I caused it
EDL	00:00:55,552	00:00:58,368	| IOT037 |	Stacy is the IRT instigator of things
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:02,976	| IOT037 |	So I tweeted this week that my nest
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:06,048	| IOT037 |	Was roasting my family in the middle of the night
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:06,560	| IOT037 |	In
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:11,424	| IOT037 |	It's true it is what's happening is for the last about six weeks
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:14,496	| IOT037 |	On random nights but usually on the weekend
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:16,032	| IOT037 |	My Nest Thermostat
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:16,800	| IOT037 |	Which is upstairs
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:17,824	| IOT037 |	Is
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:24,480	| IOT037 |	Turning on and confusing my summertime air conditioning settings with my winter time heat setting
EDL	00:01:24,992	00:01:27,808	| IOT037 |	So instead of keeping it like 68
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:29,344	| IOT037 |	At night for heat
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:31,904	| IOT037 |	It is turning it up to 76
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:34,464	| IOT037 |	Switches what we have it set for AC in the middle
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:35,488	| IOT037 |	Summer
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:38,048	| IOT037 |	So like at 4 in the morning
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:40,096	| IOT037 |	I wake up and I'm like
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:41,376	| IOT037 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:43,168	| IOT037 |	I am dehydrating
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:45,984	| IOT037 |	Sona mode
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:47,264	| IOT037 |	Yes but it
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:49,056	| IOT037 |	A dry heat
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:53,152	| IOT037 |	It's pretty bad last weekend this happened and it woke my daughter up
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:55,200	| IOT037 |	It usually prompts a migraine in me
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:58,272	| IOT037 |	And my husband would probably sleep through it only I am
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:00,064	| IOT037 |	Highly dramatic and so I
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:00,832	| IOT037 |	Wake up in
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:03,392	| IOT037 |	Like I said of throwing off the covers and I'm like oh my God
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,952	| IOT037 |	And this time my daughter did wake up
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:07,488	| IOT037 |	Like an hour or so
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:10,048	| IOT037 |	I was a little cranky and I fired off at
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,608	| IOT037 |	What's open late to eat
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,120	| IOT037 |	It's a polite
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:14,912	| IOT037 |	Yeah I was like
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:15,680	| IOT037 |	Nest
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:19,520	| IOT037 |	What's happening you're roasting my family I think a hard reset is the only way to go
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,056	| IOT037 |	I heard from like
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:23,872	| IOT037 |	4 people maybe five
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:24,640	| IOT037 |	Maybe 6 I don't
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:29,760	| IOT037 |	They're also having this issue and I also more importantly heard from dust
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:31,552	| IOT037 |	Instead they will they help me troubleshoot
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:33,344	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:35,136	| IOT037 |	Which is good that they're monitoring
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:35,904	| IOT037 |	Twitter
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:37,952	| IOT037 |	They are Fitness is good and I did at nest
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:41,536	| IOT037 |	Right so a couple things to know
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:42,816	| IOT037 |	1
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:44,608	| IOT037 |	I did look at my schedule
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:46,144	| IOT037 |	To make sure that
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:47,168	| IOT037 |	I wasn't
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:48,448	| IOT037 |	You don't like
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,472	| IOT037 |	I didn't have it set on my skin
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,264	| IOT037 |	Retinue
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,544	| IOT037 |	I actually this is
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:56,128	| IOT037 |	Been going on for a while and I had been resetting it back hoping
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:56,896	| IOT037 |	To teach the nest
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,200	| IOT037 |	I didn't want this to happen
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:01,504	| IOT037 |	My heat settings
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:06,624	| IOT037 |	I'm so I had been actually playing by The Nest rules for a couple weeks and that just wasn't
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,184	| IOT037 |	So with that in mind
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,976	| IOT037 |	Polite
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:13,024	| IOT037 |	Height of discombobulated tweet later
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:17,120	| IOT037 |	I heard back from nest and they asked me for some information
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,656	| IOT037 |	About my account
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,960	| IOT037 |	If I was using any works with Nest program
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:21,472	| IOT037 |	And
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:22,752	| IOT037 |	Yes I was
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,800	| IOT037 |	They pinpointed the issue
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,848	| IOT037 |	As being something with
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:28,640	| IOT037 |	It's works with Nest specifically
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:31,200	| IOT037 |	It looks like they decided it was my
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:34,016	| IOT037 |	My MyQ my Chamberlain MyQ settings
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:36,832	| IOT037 |	Your garage door opener is messing up your thermostat
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,112	| IOT037 |	Just what the
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:38,880	| IOT037 |	They said
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:43,488	| IOT037 |	I'm raising an eyebrow I know nobody can see it but I'm sitting here with my face
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:49,632	| IOT037 |	Yes so that they asked me the question I asked was do you have any worse with Nest products or service
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:54,496	| IOT037 |	You do would it be all right for me to check your account activity log to see if they could be adjusting the nest
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,008	| IOT037 |	Best temperature
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:57,824	| IOT037 |	So first of all I want to give them huge crops
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:58,336	| IOT037 |	For asking
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:03:59,872	| IOT037 |	Like all kinds
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:00,896	| IOT037 |	The permissions before they go
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:03,456	| IOT037 |	Skip and being very specific and what they are
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:05,504	| IOT037 |	So yes they did that
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,784	| IOT037 |	They decided that
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:08,576	| IOT037 |	They implicated the MyQ home
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,088	| IOT037 |	Control settings
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,136	| IOT037 |	And they asked me
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,696	| IOT037 |	Turn off
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:15,488	| IOT037 |	Maya Maya
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,768	| IOT037 |	Control arm IQ
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,815	| IOT037 |	Works with Nest integration
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,583	| IOT037 |	And I did that
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:22,655	| IOT037 |	I also got with the MyQ
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,423	| IOT037 |	Soak City
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:26,495	| IOT037 |	And I was like hey whatsup
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:30,847	| IOT037 |	Hey we're looking into this too cuz this is strange and you know this is hard
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:36,479	| IOT037 |	Making things work together on the back end while making it really super easy
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:36,991	| IOT037 |	For the front end
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,551	| IOT037 |	It's hard I don't disagree with that
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:41,087	| IOT037 |	The sawed off the top of my head
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:43,135	| IOT037 |	Is that
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:49,279	| IOT037 |	It's really mess that's in charge of everything that's going on with the nest because it's their API that gets used in the
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,559	| IOT037 |	Words for death program
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,863	| IOT037 |	And I can't imagine that
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:55,167	| IOT037 |	Non Nest devices
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:58,495	| IOT037 |	Call go take control of a nest and make changes
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:00,287	| IOT037 |	Ness would take information maybe
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:02,847	| IOT037 |	And perhaps do something but
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,639	| IOT037 |	I'm not following
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:07,199	| IOT037 |	The thought process here from The Nest box
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:11,551	| IOT037 |	So I talked to a lot of developers about working with
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,343	| IOT037 |	And
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,647	| IOT037 |	Most of them say
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:19,487	| IOT037 |	When they choose to work with Nest or some of them say they've chosen not to work
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:24,607	| IOT037 |	With nest because it's one of the companies out there with the most restrictive partnership program
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,887	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:29,471	| IOT037 |	It doesn't allow companies to take data from
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:29,983	| IOT037 |	Nest
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:32,799	| IOT037 |	It doesn't allow companies to really
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:37,407	| IOT037 |	Interact with the nest API you can only
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,199	| IOT037 |	Give Nest information
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,479	| IOT037 |	You can't really take in
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:40,991	| IOT037 |	Information from
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,783	| IOT037 |	Has been
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:46,623	| IOT037 |	I really should be I think, I have no problem with that
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,647	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:49,183	| IOT037 |	Kind of makes me question
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,487	| IOT037 |	How old am IQ
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,255	| IOT037 |	Which
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:55,839	| IOT037 |	Can tell the way the MyQ setting works right now
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:56,863	| IOT037 |	With my garage door opener
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,143	| IOT037 |	Is
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:00,703	| IOT037 |	It can tell the it based on me
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:05,055	| IOT037 |	You know opening and closing the garage door it tells the nest if I'm home or away
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:08,383	| IOT037 |	Now at 4 in the morning on
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,663	| IOT037 |	The weekends or
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,431	| IOT037 |	Saturday in this
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:13,503	| IOT037 |	I'm not actually opening or closing
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,015	| IOT037 |	My garage door
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:16,063	| IOT037 |	It doesn't actually mean any
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:17,343	| IOT037 |	Cuz buggy software
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:23,999	| IOT037 |	True it could be that my cue software is sending off a trigger event that you didn't actually do
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:24,767	| IOT037 |	Possible
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,535	| IOT037 |	But
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,071	| IOT037 |	My understanding of how these things
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:29,119	| IOT037 |	It's work is that it would just be saying
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,399	| IOT037 |	Hadoop
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,935	| IOT037 |	The garage door opened
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,215	| IOT037 |	Stacy Lattisaw
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,007	| IOT037 |	You could go to a wedding
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:37,055	| IOT037 |	And then ask it's to say
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,847	| IOT037 |	All right what do I want to do with that
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:42,175	| IOT037 |	In this case the nest is saying
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:43,455	| IOT037 |	How can I turn the
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:44,991	| IOT037 |	All the way up
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:50,879	| IOT037 |	Will you know it is winter time and maybe thinks you left the garage door open I don't know
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:52,671	| IOT037 |	Letter fry
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,463	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:58,047	| IOT037 |	I still have my face on because
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,839	| IOT037 |	Something is not jiving
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,887	| IOT037 |	Compared to the bottom of it but
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,423	| IOT037 |	Again
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:06,495	| IOT037 |	You provide apis so that way you have control over things
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,031	| IOT037 |	And
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:08,543	| IOT037 |	Unless
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:12,383	| IOT037 |	Somebody's using a nest API in a way that Ness has
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:14,943	| IOT037 |	Planned for I'm just not seeing it
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:18,271	| IOT037 |	Chamberlain is going to get back to
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,319	| IOT037 |	Hopefully we'll get back
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:21,855	| IOT037 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:24,671	| IOT037 |	This weekend I will not be roasted out of my bed
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:26,975	| IOT037 |	5 -
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:33,375	| IOT037 |	Yeah I have to say I have a question because a couple people did respond or tweet saying they are having similar problems with their nest
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:37,983	| IOT037 |	Did any of them say they have any other devices I'm just curious
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:43,871	| IOT037 |	Who is experiencing the same problem and they don't have a mic
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,991	| IOT037 |	That changes things
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:54,367	| IOT037 |	I'm so I was going to say guys who are listening who have a nest thermostat
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:56,927	| IOT037 |	Email me info at iot podcast
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,207	| IOT037 |	Do you have an S
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,999	| IOT037 |	Are you having a similar issue
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,815	| IOT037 |	Do you have other works with nest
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,327	| IOT037 |	Problems
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:04,863	| IOT037 |	Because
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:06,911	| IOT037 |	This kind of seems
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:09,471	| IOT037 |	Something
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,751	| IOT037 |	There's a bear there
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:17,663	| IOT037 |	There is I am trying to recall I don't think it's all that long ago when a firmware update we're not to the mess I'm not trying to pin pointer pointer
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,943	| IOT037 |	Fingers here I'm not saying that's what it is
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,223	| IOT037 |	I'm just trying to
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,271	| IOT037 |	Consider all the potential
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,063	| IOT037 |	Potential root causes here
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,343	| IOT037 |	It wasn't that long ago
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:30,207	| IOT037 |	Have you been how long have you been having this problem just out of curiosity
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:31,743	| IOT037 |	So winter in Texas
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,767	| IOT037 |	Is
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:33,791	| IOT037 |	Not really
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:38,399	| IOT037 |	Devastating so I don't think we turned on or heater until sometime towards the end of October
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,703	| IOT037 |	So not until
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,519	| IOT037 |	Not until we turned on our heater
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,079	| IOT037 |	So yes
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,359	| IOT037 |	Whatever that happen
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,407	| IOT037 |	You know
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:51,967	| IOT037 |	Again this is one of those things where
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:53,503	| IOT037 |	You know the nest is
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,295	| IOT037 |	One it's irritating
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:56,319	| IOT037 |	2
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:09:00,927	| IOT037 |	This is costing me money because
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:04,767	| IOT037 |	It's expensive and it happens you know once maybe twice a week but
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:08,095	| IOT037 |	Running your thermostat up to 76 degrees in the middle of winter is
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:11,935	| IOT037 |	And when you're asleep you don't actually notice until it starts getting
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:12,959	| IOT037 |	Real hot
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:15,263	| IOT037 |	And
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,543	| IOT037 |	Waking up my kid
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,055	| IOT037 |	Not fun
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:19,103	| IOT037 |	Triggering a migraine
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:19,871	| IOT037 |	Really not
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:24,479	| IOT037 |	I'll be curious to see what the end result is assuming wanted
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,503	| IOT037 |	When is found
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:29,343	| IOT037 |	Ultimately I say that again I'm not trying to point fingers
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:31,647	| IOT037 |	But the way this whole platform is set up
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,951	| IOT037 |	Nest has to own the works with Nest program
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,463	| IOT037 |	Ivory
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:36,511	| IOT037 |	I want to hear back
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,047	| IOT037 |	I want to understand
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:38,559	| IOT037 |	And
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:42,399	| IOT037 |	At the end of the day this has to be something that Nest solves
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,679	| IOT037 |	For not just me
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:51,871	| IOT037 |	Imagine you know people don't have your contacts in this industry Avenue been able to reach out to a bunch of companies here
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:54,175	| IOT037 |	But yeah Joe Schmo off the street
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:57,503	| IOT037 |	Just going to sit there and scratches head contact Nest support and
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:58,783	| IOT037 |	Things get workout
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,575	| IOT037 |	And a lot of people are like well I'm going to buy a
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,599	| IOT037 |	I'm going to buy an ecobee
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:07,999	| IOT037 |	We'll talk about that in a second but you know spending $250 on a thermostat
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:13,119	| IOT037 |	Then having to rip it out of the wall by another connected thermostat or just
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:15,423	| IOT037 |	Staying screwing
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,447	| IOT037 |	Got the answer
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,983	| IOT037 |	That's a really crappy
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,495	| IOT037 |	Decision
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:20,543	| IOT037 |	Speaking of the ecobee
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,567	| IOT037 |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,615	| IOT037 |	Kevin you want to talk about what
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,151	| IOT037 |	Well
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:32,319	| IOT037 |	I don't because it's more bad news but I will now this is not a problem that you are I have had I do not have actually
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,343	| IOT037 |	Abaniko pig11 s
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,135	| IOT037 |	Which is working fine
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:35,903	| IOT037 |	For the record
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:42,303	| IOT037 |	But apparently Reddit a few days ago somebody posted at their ecobee3 remote sensor was
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,839	| IOT037 |	Wasn't detecting occupancy
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,631	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,679	| IOT037 |	They reached out to ecobee support
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,727	| IOT037 |	And I hope you're sitting down folks
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,263	| IOT037 |	Ecobee Support Center
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:57,151	| IOT037 |	Take one of the sensors apart and see if the motion sensor which is a small circular pillar with a little plate
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:58,175	| IOT037 |	Kinda like a solar panel
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:01,503	| IOT037 |	To see that it's a line properly with the little window on the front
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,551	| IOT037 |	It turns out it wasn't
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:07,903	| IOT037 |	So is person check his other two sensors and they were on wrong as well
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:09,951	| IOT037 |	All three are fixed so that's the good news
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:12,767	| IOT037 |	And the information is out there publicly available to the other two
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:17,631	| IOT037 |	Search for this type of problem we're on ecobee3 is not detecting occupancy
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:23,519	| IOT037 |	You just learned that hey if you kind of take this little bit of part and you can rely on the sensor of your okay
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:25,567	| IOT037 |	Not great but you know what
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:31,711	| IOT037 |	At least it's an easy fix it's something that once you have the information you know you have you how to fix it and can fix it
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:34,271	| IOT037 |	So good on ecobee to actually say
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:38,111	| IOT037 |	Hey you know what we think this might be the problem can you check it out and sure enough it was
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:39,647	| IOT037 |	So there you go and you know
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:42,207	| IOT037 |	Ecobee3 is actually
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,231	| IOT037 |	When is the product
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:45,023	| IOT037 |	I have an ecobee SI downstairs
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:51,935	| IOT037 |	I really like my ecobee I'd love to get an ecobee3 but I can't really justify spending $750 on 3rd
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:52,959	| IOT037 |	Thermostats in my house
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:55,007	| IOT037 |	Gwine to run all night
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,031	| IOT037 |	Well yeah
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:56,799	| IOT037 |	Well
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:59,103	| IOT037 |	If I if I do give up the nest this is
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:01,151	| IOT037 |	The ecobee3 is actually the
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:01,663	| IOT037 |	Thermostat for me
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,223	| IOT037 |	Although I will have to check my okapi
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:07,295	| IOT037 |	Okay moving right along
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:07,807	| IOT037 |	Guess
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,087	| IOT037 |	What
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:09,599	| IOT037 |	Everyone

EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:53,631	| IOT037 |	It's going to continue I ask him about the product roadmap they're not ready to talk about that until after
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,423	| IOT037 |	Because
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:55,935	| IOT037 |	They just closed
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:13:03,103	| IOT037 |	Well they just closed it at the Consumer Electronics Show is all kinds of other competing products with my give them some good ideas and
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,127	| IOT037 |	I'm at
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:05,663	| IOT037 |	But yes

EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,111	| IOT037 |	Iot skills
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:15,135	| IOT037 |	You don't hey
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:16,927	| IOT037 |	, anyway so
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,439	| IOT037 |	Nice
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,487	| IOT037 |	The good news out of this is
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,791	| IOT037 |	The wink is planning to continue
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:23,327	| IOT037 |	Its investment in
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,095	| IOT037 |	Both
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:26,143	| IOT037 |	Help desk functions adding
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:26,655	| IOT037 |	Devices
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:27,935	| IOT037 |	Also
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:32,287	| IOT037 |	By having flex and I keep calling at Flextronics so if you hear that please
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:34,591	| IOT037 |	Mentally correct it to flask
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,359	| IOT037 |	Because Flex
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:38,431	| IOT037 |	Tronix became Flex earlier this year
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:41,503	| IOT037 |	And I know I've covered Flex 4
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:43,039	| IOT037 |	Like over a decade
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,063	| IOT037 |	And vibrates just knock
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:49,439	| IOT037 |	Flexes I used to be just a contract manufacturer and now they're like all designed to
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:52,255	| IOT037 |	Scale so basically they help you build
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,071	| IOT037 |	Now they help you build products
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:58,911	| IOT037 |	From start to finish if you're a startup or if you're like
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:00,959	| IOT037 |	Nokia
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,567	| IOT037 |	So this
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:09,663	| IOT037 |	Changes my potential purchase plans because I was going to buy a SmartThings
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,199	| IOT037 |	House anthem
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,479	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:17,599	| IOT037 |	I've been playing with SmartThings for a while and I hate to do this but SmartThings is turned into an 80%
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,647	| IOT037 |	Isn't it only works 80%
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:22,463	| IOT037 |	But we the same even more money
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,231	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:23,743	| IOT037 |	Just
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,815	| IOT037 |	Unless you're cool with it being 84
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,095	| IOT037 |	No
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:31,935	| IOT037 |	Okay cuz wink is week is actually becoming more reliable for
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:35,007	| IOT037 |	SmartThings there still a lot of things I don't like about
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:39,103	| IOT037 |	The new SmartThings is really only about eighty per
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:45,247	| IOT037 |	You know I think a lot of it will also be dictated by what devices are actually connecting to the hub
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:49,599	| IOT037 |	You got a ton of different things a whole range of devices
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:51,391	| IOT037 |	Add sensors and so on
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,927	| IOT037 |	I only have the nest
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,231	| IOT037 |	And a whole bunch of
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:58,559	| IOT037 |	Lights from different companies smart like I don't have any
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,351	| IOT037 |	Door locks or
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:04,447	| IOT037 |	Other connected appliances and and so on
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:06,751	| IOT037 |	Kevin will
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:08,543	| IOT037 |	I do.
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:12,383	| IOT037 |	Who put the batteries in and I got it you know locking and unlocking in my
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:20,063	| IOT037 |	But I did not replace it on my front door because we start using the front door that mounts or no
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:23,135	| IOT037 |	I can't believe it
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,415	| IOT037 |	Sorry
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:24,927	| IOT037 |	Sorry
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:31,583	| IOT037 |	Suicide I do think that may have something to do with you know some of the Hub issues you seen with link that I
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,351	| IOT037 |	Haven't seen
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,119	| IOT037 |	I don't know
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,423	| IOT037 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,703	| IOT037 |	I take the range of stuff
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:38,495	| IOT037 |	Lights are a premature lights
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,031	| IOT037 |	You got
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:44,383	| IOT037 |	Motion sensors in your house you've got the warlocks you've got
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,663	| IOT037 |	Garage door opener right now
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:49,247	| IOT037 |	You can you have a wider breadth of products
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:55,135	| IOT037 |	10 interesting theories so maybe like the more stuff you have on these things the more likely they are to break
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:56,671	| IOT037 |	Which is kind of bad news
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,719	| IOT037 |	It would be that would that would be
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,487	| IOT037 |	Bad news for the
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:15:59,999	| IOT037 |	Smart Home in dust
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,535	| IOT037 |	That was bad
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,047	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:03,583	| IOT037 |	I don't know what to say there
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,399	| IOT037 |	For the weak people
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:07,679	| IOT037 |	Good news
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,215	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:11,775	| IOT037 |	And if you're like me and you're running
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,543	| IOT037 |	Two hubs
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,823	| IOT037 |	Both wink and SmartThings
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:20,735	| IOT037 |	Because I do have a lot of the sensors that I've never enjoyed adding by traditional zigbee kind of sensors
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:23,551	| IOT037 |	Zigbee and Z-Wave sensors to the wink platform because I don't like
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:25,599	| IOT037 |	I haven't really enjoyed the
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:28,927	| IOT037 |	Weights supports the zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:32,511	| IOT037 |	Profiles for devices that it doesn't actually have in its files
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:35,327	| IOT037 |	Striving more generic type profiles I guess they use
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,095	| IOT037 |	And I don't
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:38,143	| IOT037 |	I didn't want to invest in the
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,191	| IOT037 |	Branded sensors
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:42,495	| IOT037 |	My thought is I could
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:48,895	| IOT037 |	Double up with the Amazon Echo is the controlling device for all of those things but I haven't seen the sensors under the
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:49,919	| IOT037 |	Geico yet
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,199	| IOT037 |	Skip
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,479	| IOT037 |	So maybe it will
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:55,295	| IOT037 |	I was trying to go to the whole podcast without meds
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:56,575	| IOT037 |	Oh
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:16:59,903	| IOT037 |	We were so close
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:04,767	| IOT037 |	That's okay. We have to talk about really briefly anyway because last week I had said I would heard of Fire TV
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:06,047	| IOT037 |	That's right so talk about your fired
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:09,631	| IOT037 |	Yes it won't take long cuz everything I said last week
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:13,215	| IOT037 |	Is pretty much spot-on what I thought it would do it does really really well
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:13,727	| IOT037 |	It's
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:17,823	| IOT037 |	I have a downstairs can I go to a TV obviously it's Fire TV
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,871	| IOT037 |	And I have the voice remote with it
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:23,711	| IOT037 |	My echo is actually in my
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:26,015	| IOT037 |	Second floor home office where I am now
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:32,415	| IOT037 |	But it's like having a another echo in the room downstairs maybe cuz you just hold the voice button do you sell your commands and
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,183	| IOT037 |	It's good to go
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:35,743	| IOT037 |	And as I had said on on the show last week
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:39,071	| IOT037 |	A lot of the informational bits that the echo will provide you
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:41,119	| IOT037 |	It reads them aloud
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:44,191	| IOT037 |	Also put some up on the display the screen I've been on
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:47,263	| IOT037 |	Make a 60-inch TV that got these ginormous cards
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:49,311	| IOT037 |	Information when I do a web search
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:52,127	| IOT037 |	Russia War get the weather or play
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:55,455	| IOT037 |	Amazon Prime music whatever it is it's all right there visually
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:59,551	| IOT037 |	It is a beautiful thing I did say something last week that I want to correct
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:02,111	| IOT037 |	I'd said to you Stacey that I'll bet you the
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:04,159	| IOT037 |	Amazon Echo remote
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:07,999	| IOT037 |	The Bluetooth remote is the same as the one that comes with the Fire TV it is not
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:12,095	| IOT037 |	And that's because there's some additional buttons on the Fire TV remote for playback of
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:14,143	| IOT037 |	Media which is really what the Fire TV is for
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:19,007	| IOT037 |	However did the integration between the Echo and the Fire TV is outstanding
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:19,775	| IOT037 |	Absolutely love it
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:23,871	| IOT037 |	Sitting in the room watching TV just press the button and tell
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:25,151	| IOT037 |	She Who Shall Not Be Named to
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:28,991	| IOT037 |	You know turn the lights down so I can watch TV and it doesn't it's a
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:29,759	| IOT037 |	Wonderful
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,551	| IOT037 |	That sounds awesome
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,575	| IOT037 |	I was
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:36,927	| IOT037 |	It was the same do you leave your TV on more now
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:39,487	| IOT037 |	No I mean there's a lot of
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:41,535	| IOT037 |	Similar devices like Google Chromecast
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:44,607	| IOT037 |	Can they have something called letting its whole backdrop where there is a
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:45,887	| IOT037 |	A screensaver
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:52,287	| IOT037 |	Android information like a local weather that will cycle through if you want to leave your TV on but I'm not big into wasting the energy you know I'm in
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:54,079	| IOT037 |	I really try and conserve cuz we're
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,103	| IOT037 |	Generating
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:56,895	| IOT037 |	Electricity with solar panels I don't want to
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,175	| IOT037 |	Now I'm just
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,199	| IOT037 |	You going to let me know
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:00,479	| IOT037 |	True
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:01,759	| IOT037 |	How's your solar panel
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:06,367	| IOT037 |	Wonderful we've been thinking a lot of energy this year it's
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:09,439	| IOT037 |	It's a year-to-year basis May through May is is
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,975	| IOT037 |	What my electric company
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:11,743	| IOT037 |	Measures
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:14,303	| IOT037 |	And I haven't any balance like an overproduced
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,583	| IOT037 |	I get a check from them in May
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:20,191	| IOT037 |	But basically I had almost a full month's worth of electricity
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:22,751	| IOT037 |	Cortical in the bank with them last month
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:25,311	| IOT037 |	Used about a third of it this month because it's been
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:26,591	| IOT037 |	Shorter Days Inn
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:28,895	| IOT037 |	Not so great weather and so on but
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:33,503	| IOT037 |	No I knew we haven't had an electric bill when I at least 10 months so it's it's a wonderful time
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:34,783	| IOT037 |	Sounds awesome
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:35,807	| IOT037 |	All right
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:37,343	| IOT037 |	Well let's see
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:40,159	| IOT037 |	I wanted to take us into a little bit more of
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,207	| IOT037 |	Part of the Industrial
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:45,023	| IOT037 |	It's not industrial that's not the word I'm looking for
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:47,071	| IOT037 |	The kind of corporate Enterprise
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:48,095	| IOT037 |	Best thing because
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:50,399	| IOT037 |	This is a topic that I've been thinking about because
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:55,519	| IOT037 |	As we kind of gear into the holiday season and into the Consumer Electronics Show
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:58,079	| IOT037 |	I've been thinking about how
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,615	| IOT037 |	Who is buying the Smart Home
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:01,151	| IOT037 |	Home and if they really should
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,711	| IOT037 |	Give in my feelings about
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:05,247	| IOT037 |	Hubs
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:08,063	| IOT037 |	My Nest recently
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:09,343	| IOT037 |	I've been kind of like down
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:15,231	| IOT037 |	Average consumers probably should not be buying a lot of things
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:18,559	| IOT037 |	They're kind of not worth it
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,839	| IOT037 |	I mean
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,375	| IOT037 |	You didn't you know how I've been kind of
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:23,935	| IOT037 |	I love I love this stuff
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:25,727	| IOT037 |	For most people it's
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:29,055	| IOT037 |	They're not going to get a lot of pleasure and they're probably going to be like
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,871	| IOT037 |	I was just going to say the bang for buck
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,407	| IOT037 |	Or value
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:35,199	| IOT037 |	Aspect of it is still
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,991	| IOT037 |	Not quite right I think for
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,015	| IOT037 |	Massive mainstream adopt
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:39,807	| IOT037 |	It's getting better but
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:40,319	| IOT037 |	It's not there yet
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:42,111	| IOT037 |	So I've been thinking
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,415	| IOT037 |	In the last couple of months like
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:47,999	| IOT037 |	If it's not the consumer who is going to buy this where is the market
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:50,047	| IOT037 |	Where's the money where's the money
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:51,583	| IOT037 |	I figured it out
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:53,119	| IOT037 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,887	| IOT037 |	Kiss why not
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,679	| IOT037 |	Why not make grandiose
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:57,727	| IOT037 |	Interrupting
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,007	| IOT037 |	This is actually what I do while I'm so
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:01,567	| IOT037 |	I think about
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,335	| IOT037 |	I dream about it
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:04,127	| IOT037 |	Insurance companies
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:07,967	| IOT037 |	And comedies like ATT so insurance and security
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,759	| IOT037 |	These are the people
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:12,575	| IOT037 |	And I Enterprises that are going to be buying the smart
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:13,599	| IOT037 |	For you
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:15,903	| IOT037 |	And I actually got some great data on
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:19,744	| IOT037 |	I'd love to kind of share with people just to bolster so you don't think I'm totally crazy
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:24,352	| IOT037 |	So here at this is from Accenture they're putting that they put this report out this week
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:26,656	| IOT037 |	And I actually got date on
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:28,192	| IOT037 |	Is so most insurance company
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:30,240	| IOT037 |	I have already started with some pilot project
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:31,520	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:33,056	| IOT037 |	American family has
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,336	| IOT037 |	Is a pilot project with
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,104	| IOT037 |	Ring
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:40,224	| IOT037 |	Connected doorbell company and they also have one where they subsidize a nest protect
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:41,248	| IOT037 |	Smoke detector
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:47,648	| IOT037 |	So nearly 4 and 10 ensures of piloted or launch the connected home or building offering
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:48,416	| IOT037 |	So far this year
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:50,208	| IOT037 |	Which is pretty freaking
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:52,256	| IOT037 |	Has more than tripled from
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:53,792	| IOT037 |	And
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:56,352	| IOT037 |	Last year only a minority had any iot
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:57,376	| IOT037 |	Plants related to Iowa
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:59,168	| IOT037 |	Or any iot
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:00,192	| IOT037 |	Plants related to the home
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:01,472	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:02,752	| IOT037 |	That's what
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:07,616	| IOT037 |	And then nearly half of insurers believe that connected devices will be a driver of Revenue growth in
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,128	| IOT037 |	In the next 3 years
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:11,456	| IOT037 |	So that's kind of a lot to think about but I'd love to unpack that
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:11,968	| IOT037 |	Because
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:14,272	| IOT037 |	I think this could be
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,552	| IOT037 |	Really scary
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:19,904	| IOT037 |	For consumers if you look at it like if we don't have like regulations or I could wait at 10
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:20,928	| IOT037 |	Think about this
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:25,280	| IOT037 |	But I also think it could be really awesome because it's a really good way to get this kind of
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:26,560	| IOT037 |	Stuff in people's homes
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,608	| IOT037 |	And probably a good way to get
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:30,912	| IOT037 |	The good stuff like the tested stuff in
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:32,448	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,752	| IOT037 |	On the positive side
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:37,568	| IOT037 |	The program that American family is doing with the nest protect is
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:40,384	| IOT037 |	All they want to do is I want to see
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:41,408	| IOT037 |	Hey
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:43,456	| IOT037 |	Are the batteries in your smoke.
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:45,248	| IOT037 |	Because if they are
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:47,296	| IOT037 |	You're way more likely to be notified if
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,320	| IOT037 |	There's a fire in your house and
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:50,624	| IOT037 |	Rachel true
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:51,392	| IOT037 |	That's awesome
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:52,160	| IOT037 |	Like everybody can agree
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,952	| IOT037 |	That right and that's how a lot of these are
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,768	| IOT037 |	With the connected doorbell camera
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:23:00,352	| IOT037 |	It's a little bit different but they're looking for
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:04,448	| IOT037 |	Burglaries cuz he seems have actually been shown to help prevent burglaries because you can
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,216	| IOT037 |	Pretend like you're home
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,776	| IOT037 |	Even if they realize you're not home
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,056	| IOT037 |	Do you actually get
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:10,592	| IOT037 |	Footage from
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:12,384	| IOT037 |	Who's robbing your house
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:12,896	| IOT037 |	Which Canadian
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:14,432	| IOT037 |	Catching the thief chair
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:15,456	| IOT037 |	Yay
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:18,272	| IOT037 |	Bad example in the dryer when you get these are both
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:21,600	| IOT037 |	But I called bigger bang for buck things people understand
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,624	| IOT037 |	The value that way
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:25,952	| IOT037 |	As opposed to seeing a bunch of products on a Shelf
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:27,488	| IOT037 |	Worden cap somewhere
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:29,280	| IOT037 |	Well this is cool though
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,816	| IOT037 |	What do I really get from it
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:34,144	| IOT037 |	You know any insurer in this cases are subsidizing
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,424	| IOT037 |	Sometimes fully sometimes
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,520	| IOT037 |	So a lot of people are like
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,288	| IOT037 |	Yay
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:42,848	| IOT037 |	Other insurers are like USAA testing
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:43,616	| IOT037 |	OBD port
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:45,408	| IOT037 |	Isis like automatic
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,688	| IOT037 |	And so
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:48,224	| IOT037 |	Let's talk about like
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:48,992	| IOT037 |	How do you feel about
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,296	| IOT037 |	Where does this become
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:51,808	| IOT037 |	Scary for you
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,856	| IOT037 |	Well you know what
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:24:00,256	| IOT037 |	Me personally I'm on more the do-it-yourself let me figure it out let me figure out what I want and what I want to do with it kind of person so
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:01,024	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:05,120	| IOT037 |	There's that side to it but as I look at the at the market as a whole
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:06,144	| IOT037 |	Your mainstream
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,168	| IOT037 |	Sumer
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:11,008	| IOT037 |	I'm not scared of anything about it I think it's a good way to
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:14,080	| IOT037 |	Expand and broaden people's awareness these products
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,384	| IOT037 |	Search the ones that will add the most value to them
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:18,688	| IOT037 |	As opposed to again like I said
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:20,224	| IOT037 |	Here's a catalog of things
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:22,272	| IOT037 |	I'll pick some in and make your home smart
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:23,040	| IOT037 |	Why
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:24,576	| IOT037 |	What am I doing this for you know
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:27,648	| IOT037 |	There's a tangible benefit to doing that unless you can figure it out yourself
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:34,560	| IOT037 |	So I don't have any major issues with it from of privacy standpoint again I'm okay with
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:36,096	| IOT037 |	My insurance company knows if I have
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,120	| IOT037 |	Batteries in my
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:38,144	| IOT037 |	Smoke detector
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:40,960	| IOT037 |	Especially if they're going to eat me and maybe give me a discount on my
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:42,240	| IOT037 |	Insurance because of it
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:46,080	| IOT037 |	Help me in and helps them it's that it's safer for everybody around so
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:48,128	| IOT037 |	I don't really have any issues there either
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:51,200	| IOT037 |	I'm trying to think of it I have any privacy concerns with these
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:54,272	| IOT037 |	What about if your insurance firm starts penalizing
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:55,552	| IOT037 |	Don't happen
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:58,368	| IOT037 |	Well yeah that's
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:00,416	| IOT037 |	Obviously that's the other side of the coin
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:03,744	| IOT037 |	I mean when I guess you could argue that by not by offering the
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:04,512	| IOT037 |	Discount
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:08,096	| IOT037 |	Yeah it says they are right there penalizing people switch
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:08,864	| IOT037 |	The thing is
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:14,496	| IOT037 |	Obviously not everybody can afford nor made me not want these things and they're not mandatory for safety
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:16,800	| IOT037 |	Smoke detectors in SIDS they are but
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:20,640	| IOT037 |	It has to be a specific kind of smart smoke detector not necessarily
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:22,944	| IOT037 |	Sorry we have a problem if they did actually
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:23,968	| IOT037 |	Penalize me
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:26,272	| IOT037 |	For not having yeah I know I'm just thinking about the
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,040	| IOT037 |	Discus
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:29,088	| IOT037 |	Like the other issue is
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:31,904	| IOT037 |	Once you start adding connectivity into homes
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:33,952	| IOT037 |	You're going to start changing the risk profile
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:35,744	| IOT037 |	Across-the-board
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:39,328	| IOT037 |	Write like the risk will go down significantly
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:41,120	| IOT037 |	In a home that has
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:43,936	| IOT037 |	Connected smoke detectors because
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:44,960	| IOT037 |	That's my assumption
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:46,240	| IOT037 |	Or like a
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:47,520	| IOT037 |	A moisture sensor
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:48,288	| IOT037 |	For example
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:51,872	| IOT037 |	That's the thinking I will say that I've had several leaks in my home
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:53,920	| IOT037 |	And none of them have actually occurred
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:56,480	| IOT037 |	Place where there is a moisture sensor there
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:03,136	| IOT037 |	Qdoba in the places where you know
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:05,952	| IOT037 |	Your refrigerator clothes on your hot water heater overflows
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:07,488	| IOT037 |	Switch I understand does happen
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:09,280	| IOT037 |	Puppy crate
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:15,936	| IOT037 |	So there's kind of like how much will that change service profile does that drive down the cost of insurance everywhere
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:19,264	| IOT037 |	How does those costs get spread around the
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:20,032	| IOT037 |	Industry
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:23,360	| IOT037 |	How are those savings get spread around the industry
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:25,408	| IOT037 |	Everyone's premiums go down I don't know
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:28,224	| IOT037 |	And I also think about Lake
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:29,760	| IOT037 |	When we start having
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:33,600	| IOT037 |	Can conversations about risk and privacy
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:36,672	| IOT037 |	Are regulatory bodies events
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:37,696	| IOT037 |	Ready to start
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,464	| IOT037 |	Having this
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:40,768	| IOT037 |	Conversations cuz right now I'm not sure if they are
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:47,168	| IOT037 |	I would say it's premature to have this conversation so I don't think so bad if there's so many other more pressing issues to be
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:47,936	| IOT037 |	Dealing with
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:49,216	| IOT037 |	Areas to regulate
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:52,288	| IOT037 |	What makes sense to regulate areas to not regulate
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:53,568	| IOT037 |	So I agree with you on that one
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:27:00,224	| IOT037 |	And then finally let's see how I should also mention State Farm is launching a program where they are
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:01,504	| IOT037 |	Giving out
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:02,016	| IOT037 |	Canaries
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:06,624	| IOT037 |	So Canary is an all-in-one security device they're giving it out to First Responders
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,416	| IOT037 |	And
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,696	| IOT037 |	I thought that was pretty cool
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:12,000	| IOT037 |	I was also thinking though
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:16,864	| IOT037 |	Canary has gotten in the news a couple times because people break in and they get camera footage of it
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,888	| IOT037 |	Youku
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:18,656	| IOT037 |	Satan call the police
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,472	| IOT037 |	Police are not
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:22,240	| IOT037 |	Always
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:23,520	| IOT037 |	Excited to be like
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:26,080	| IOT037 |	Oh here's the footage of this person breaking in
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:29,664	| IOT037 |	Especially if maybe in major cities were there like
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:32,992	| IOT037 |	But you know what we got like eight murders we've got to solve
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:39,392	| IOT037 |	And this is not becomes noise at a certain point I'm not trying to say something is more important than the other thing
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,928	| IOT037 |	Pet from Power Station Sandpoint for
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:43,488	| IOT037 |	Does resources it becomes noise
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,512	| IOT037 |	So I think
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,048	| IOT037 |	There's kind of an interesting
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:46,816	| IOT037 |	Sunset Lake
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:49,632	| IOT037 |	Hey now that we have these kind of
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:52,192	| IOT037 |	Resources available to us
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:54,496	| IOT037 |	How will that change things
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:55,776	| IOT037 |	Lion Force
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:59,360	| IOT037 |	I don't know big questions what's good question
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:00,128	| IOT037 |	If you have answers
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,408	| IOT037 |	You guys should tell
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:02,688	| IOT037 |	Because
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:04,224	| IOT037 |	I don't know I'm just
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:06,528	| IOT037 |	It's okay to be Minority Report Sunday don't worry
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:09,344	| IOT037 |	No no no no that's the worst
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:11,136	| IOT037 |	Let us all not turn into a
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:13,696	| IOT037 |	That would be
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:15,488	| IOT037 |	Or anything starring
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:21,120	| IOT037 |	She went there
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:25,984	| IOT037 |	Okay alright alright Maverick I'll let you go on that one
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:30,336	| IOT037 |	Okay so stay tuned because we have kind of a new feature
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:32,640	| IOT037 |	That I'm not sure we're going to keep it up but you know
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:34,944	| IOT037 |	I had my husband on
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:36,480	| IOT037 |	To review the haiku
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:40,832	| IOT037 |	I don't even know what to call this device it's so new but kind of cool it's the connected
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:43,136	| IOT037 |	Speaker magnet
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:44,416	| IOT037 |	Grocery list
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,696	| IOT037 |	Making thing
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:48,768	| IOT037 |	You'll just have to listen to discover what it does
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:54,656	| IOT037 |	It's basically you talk into it and it collects your grocery list it's connected you can scan stuff into it it's
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,424	| IOT037 |	It's pretty cool
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:57,984	| IOT037 |	Because I don't grocery shop I had him review it
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:59,520	| IOT037 |	Any idea is that
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,544	| IOT037 |	There's a lot of things
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:01,568	| IOT037 |	Kevin and I
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:03,104	| IOT037 |	Don't need or use
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:05,152	| IOT037 |	Sparetime sprinklers are one of them
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:05,664	| IOT037 |	Probably
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:09,248	| IOT037 |	Aging-in-place kind of devices are probably another thing
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:09,760	| IOT037 |	And
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:15,136	| IOT037 |	I'm kind of thinking we should probably talk to people who actually purchased these devices in her living with him
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:18,464	| IOT037 |	Kind of start conducting some reviews because
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:22,304	| IOT037 |	Nobody knows how connected devices going to do until you actually use it
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:28,704	| IOT037 |	So with that in mind stay tuned and you can learn more about the haiku
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:35,104	| IOT037 |	Hey everyone
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:37,408	| IOT037 |	We're back with the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:41,504	| IOT037 |	Instead of a guest this week we're going to do something a little bit new little bit different
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:43,040	| IOT037 |	And maybe something that if
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:45,088	| IOT037 |	If you guys like it will do in the future
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:45,856	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:47,392	| IOT037 |	I had a chance
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:50,464	| IOT037 |	To review a gadget called the Haiku but since
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:51,232	| IOT037 |	And it is a
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:53,792	| IOT037 |	It's a magnet we've had the CEO of the
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:55,072	| IOT037 |	Device on
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,864	| IOT037 |	The podcast before
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:59,424	| IOT037 |	It is a magnet that you attach to your fridge
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:00,704	| IOT037 |	And
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:03,008	| IOT037 |	You talk into it and you can
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:04,032	| IOT037 |	Get your grocery list
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:07,360	| IOT037 |	Do you tell your grocery list and if you're in the right area
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:09,664	| IOT037 |	You actually can send this grocery list to Walmart
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:12,224	| IOT037 |	Or to Peapod and
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:13,504	| IOT037 |	Neither
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:16,832	| IOT037 |	Delivery Peapod will deliver your groceries or Walmart
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:17,344	| IOT037 |	Well actually
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:20,416	| IOT037 |	Some of your groceries and you pick them up at curbside delivery
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:26,304	| IOT037 |	Since I don't grocery shop for my family I didn't really I make a very terrible reviewer for this
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:29,632	| IOT037 |	So I asked my husband who does do the grocery shopping for our family to review
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:31,424	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,960	| IOT037 |	Andrew hi Andrew
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,472	| IOT037 |	It's yellow
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:34,496	| IOT037 |	Yes
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:37,056	| IOT037 |	And what I'd like to say is if this
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:38,080	| IOT037 |	Is something you guys like
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,384	| IOT037 |	There a lot of gadgets that
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:44,480	| IOT037 |	I don't actually get a chance to review because I don't have like the facilities of perfect
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:45,504	| IOT037 |	Example is
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,528	| IOT037 |	Lawn sprinklers
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,296	| IOT037 |	Because I
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,320	| IOT037 |	Actually is there Escape
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:49,344	| IOT037 |	I don't need to water it
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:52,928	| IOT037 |	Are you guys really want to know about connected lawn sprinklers
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:54,464	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:56,256	| IOT037 |	Email me if you have
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:31:02,656	| IOT037 |	You know a rachio or droplet or I guess the Green Wave system and maybe we'll start doing more
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:04,448	| IOT037 |	Kind of user reviews because
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:05,984	| IOT037 |	Really the best way to
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:09,056	| IOT037 |	Know if you want one of these it's to live with it for a long time and porch
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:12,640	| IOT037 |	So info at iot podcast
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:13,408	| IOT037 |	Animals
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:13,920	| IOT037 |	This is something we want to
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:15,200	| IOT037 |	And now
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:16,480	| IOT037 |	Andrew
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:18,784	| IOT037 |	You have the haiku
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:20,576	| IOT037 |	Which is a 49
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,856	| IOT037 |	$99 device
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:23,648	| IOT037 |	What was your take on this
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:27,232	| IOT037 |	Yeah so you know you described it as a magnet it's really like
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:30,048	| IOT037 |	Got a tiny voice recognizer and
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:33,376	| IOT037 |	Barcode Scanner and one and it sticks to the side of your fridge
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:34,912	| IOT037 |	From a magnet
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:37,216	| IOT037 |	And I'll say that I came from this
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:38,496	| IOT037 |	I'm one of those people
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:40,032	| IOT037 |	I do the grocery shopping
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:41,056	| IOT037 |	For the family
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:44,128	| IOT037 |	And I usually write my list on in a
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:50,528	| IOT037 |	Paper and bring it to the store I'm not one of those people that keeps a list in the iPhone so I knew this was going to be a big
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:52,064	| IOT037 |	Adjustment going in
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:56,416	| IOT037 |	In my experience might be a little bit different from someone who always keeps our list
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,952	| IOT037 |	On your iPhone so
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:01,536	| IOT037 |	First of all the scanning feature of it where you can scan barcode is kind of a dick
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:02,816	| IOT037 |	To set it up
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:04,352	| IOT037 |	It took maybe a minute to set up
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,632	| IOT037 |	Basically just
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:09,984	| IOT037 |	Downloaded the app on the iPhone went through some setup instructions and was all set up
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:13,312	| IOT037 |	Should I was super simple in any kind of you start
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:14,592	| IOT037 |	Using the scanner on
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:17,920	| IOT037 |	NASA shoots out kind of a red typical kind of barcode scanner
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:21,760	| IOT037 |	And it's kind of fun right cuz you pick up products in
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:26,880	| IOT037 |	And you scan it and it's a little bit of Dick thing I know I'm kind of weird that way
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:32,768	| IOT037 |	But I really like that the scanning feature and then what it does when you scan it basically sends the product
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:33,536	| IOT037 |	Name
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:36,608	| IOT037 |	To your iPhone app to a list there so that was pretty neat
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:38,144	| IOT037 |	And I should know that Andrew is
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:39,168	| IOT037 |	Is a little weird
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:40,448	| IOT037 |	Which is why
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:42,752	| IOT037 |	But also this is something that
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:44,800	| IOT037 |	Work not just for the iPhone but this also works for
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:48,896	| IOT037 |	Yes yes it does work with Android as well
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:55,808	| IOT037 |	The basic idea here is you are trying to capture your grocery list right and in my case it was to bring it to the garage
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:57,344	| IOT037 |	Grocery store not to use
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:58,112	| IOT037 |	Peapod
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:32:59,904	| IOT037 |	Or at WalMart delivery
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:04,000	| IOT037 |	There two ways to get something onto list when is the scan the barcode
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,536	| IOT037 |	Any other is
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,048	| IOT037 |	Talking to it
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:09,120	| IOT037 |	And so from a skin perspective I'd say
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:11,680	| IOT037 |	80% of the things I scanned
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:13,216	| IOT037 |	Or in the database
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:15,520	| IOT037 |	The majority of ones weren't
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:20,128	| IOT037 |	That weren't restore brands from the dominant grocer here in Texas
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:20,896	| IOT037 |	HEB
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:23,712	| IOT037 |	So that was a little frustrating that
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:26,016	| IOT037 |	A lot of those store brands weren't in there
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:28,576	| IOT037 |	When you scan a barcode it gives you
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:31,648	| IOT037 |	Sound feedback saying whether or not it found the product or not
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:38,560	| IOT037 |	Sometimes National products a couple of them I couldn't get to work at all and sometimes just scanning the
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:39,072	| IOT037 |	Barcode
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:40,864	| IOT037 |	Had to try it a few times two
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:42,400	| IOT037 |	To get it just right but
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:44,192	| IOT037 |	Over always pretty happy with
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:45,472	| IOT037 |	With the scanning feature
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:48,032	| IOT037 |	The voice recognition
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:50,592	| IOT037 |	It left a little bit to be desired
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:55,712	| IOT037 |	And the issue here is not whether or not a recognized you it's whether it recognizes you correct
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:57,504	| IOT037 |	So I'd say
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:01,856	| IOT037 |	Again maybe 80% of the time I'd say something into it like
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:02,624	| IOT037 |	Pomegranate
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:05,440	| IOT037 |	Macaroni and cheese and it would get a perf
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:11,840	| IOT037 |	I do it add it to the list and it adds it to the section of the list you know dairy or produce
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:12,864	| IOT037 |	It made sense
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:16,960	| IOT037 |	Other times I would say something in it and recognize something else
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:18,752	| IOT037 |	And put it on the list in this
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:21,568	| IOT037 |	Came a little bit of a challenge
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:27,712	| IOT037 |	Because I had to double-check I almost had to open up the iPhone app after I would say something into
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:30,016	| IOT037 |	The Haiku just to make sure I got the right thing
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:33,856	| IOT037 |	Is otherwise I'll be scratching my head at the end of the week when I'm looking at my listing it
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:40,000	| IOT037 |	You know says to buy marshmallows why did I put marshmallows on the listing and really I meant something else
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:42,560	| IOT037 |	So from a convenience factor
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:44,608	| IOT037 |	Hey this is just on side of the fridge
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:46,656	| IOT037 |	And I can talk into it
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:52,544	| IOT037 |	And it'll added to my list that's great but at least in a couple weeks I tried it I wasn't a hundred percent comfortable that way
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:54,848	| IOT037 |	Capturing the right information
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:56,896	| IOT037 |	Okay so the question is
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:58,944	| IOT037 |	Would you buy this
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,736	| IOT037 |	450 bucks
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:01,760	| IOT037 |	Is it worth it
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:03,296	| IOT037 |	I would not
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:05,344	| IOT037 |	Because I'm not the type of person who
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:08,160	| IOT037 |	Keeps a list on my iPhone I think if I
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:11,744	| IOT037 |	Kept the grocery list on my phone my Android or iPhone
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:13,536	| IOT037 |	Then I think this would be worth
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:14,560	| IOT037 |	Working with
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:19,680	| IOT037 |	But for me it was kind of frustrating in the store having to unlock my phone several times to see
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:21,472	| IOT037 |	To see what was on the list
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:23,520	| IOT037 |	One cool thing I did like
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:25,824	| IOT037 |	Compared to the old paper
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:26,592	| IOT037 |	List
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:29,152	| IOT037 |	Is it you can swipe off items after
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:29,664	| IOT037 |	Do you get them
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:36,576	| IOT037 |	And so that way you don't have those two things on your list that you overlooked you get home and your wife is upset with you. That's
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:41,184	| IOT037 |	Never happened to me I like that that feature as well
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:41,952	| IOT037 |	Okay
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:42,464	| IOT037 |	And
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:44,256	| IOT037 |	Another thing if you
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:45,536	| IOT037 |	What do the pickup
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:47,584	| IOT037 |	Would that change like
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:49,120	| IOT037 |	They're rolling his pickup out
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:49,632	| IOT037 |	Lacrosse
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:50,912	| IOT037 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:51,424	| IOT037 |	The country
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:55,264	| IOT037 |	So we have a Walmart actually fire daughter
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:56,288	| IOT037 |	School so
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:35:57,824	| IOT037 |	Would that change
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:58,336	| IOT037 |	Equation
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:02,432	| IOT037 |	Give me what I buy groceries at Walmart or what I get to hike
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,712	| IOT037 |	Would you get the haiku
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:12,416	| IOT037 |	Note to the Walmart but so yeah I think that changes a lot right
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:17,792	| IOT037 |	For a couple reasons one you have to enter your order electronically anyway so this is a lot
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:20,864	| IOT037 |	Easier way to enter an electronic order
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:23,680	| IOT037 |	Then typing it in a searching for each product
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:29,312	| IOT037 |	Too I think the accuracy would be a lot better the product you're getting I mean when you
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:32,128	| IOT037 |	I scan a bottle of Heinz Ketchup
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:33,920	| IOT037 |	It doesn't just say ketchup
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:40,064	| IOT037 |	Anna haikyuu it says you know 18 hour times you know it's got the barcode so you're going to get that product
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:42,112	| IOT037 |	I mean it's delivered so
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:46,208	| IOT037 |	I think that makes it a lot more interesting you'd still want to review the list
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:47,232	| IOT037 |	Before you submit it
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:49,792	| IOT037 |	Or your delivery or pickup
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:50,816	| IOT037 |	Because
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:53,376	| IOT037 |	Especially if you use the voice prompts what you will
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:57,984	| IOT037 |	Then you're going to be an especially for produce and things without a barcode
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:37:02,592	| IOT037 |	You just want to make sure that it got the right thing so you don't get strange things in your order
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:06,432	| IOT037 |	While missing other important things I know you would love to get it
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:06,944	| IOT037 |	Extra bag of March
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:08,480	| IOT037 |	Just don't lie
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:10,272	| IOT037 |	I do so that's actually something I've
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:15,648	| IOT037 |	Telesto marshmallows what is good idea Haiku thank you
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:21,024	| IOT037 |	Like I said I got a little carried away with it let me scan notice it was all for testing purposes though
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:21,792	| IOT037 |	Offer testing
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:23,584	| IOT037 |	Excellent
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:25,376	| IOT037 |	Awesome well thank you so much
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:25,888	| IOT037 |	Andrew
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:28,192	| IOT037 |	I appreciate you
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:28,960	| IOT037 |	Sitting there
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:30,752	| IOT037 |	And doing other testing and
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:31,776	| IOT037 |	All the grocery shopping
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:33,312	| IOT037 |	I think that is spit is really awesome of you
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:34,592	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:35,360	| IOT037 |	Haiku
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:37,408	| IOT037 |	If you like making grocery list
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:39,200	| IOT037 |	In your iPhone
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:39,968	| IOT037 |	Or Android
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:42,784	| IOT037 |	This is good at the other feature I should actually
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:45,856	| IOT037 |	If we both actually stopped at the grocery store and regular basis
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:48,160	| IOT037 |	You can actually share your list across phones
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:50,976	| IOT037 |	Which makes this kind of a nice to be sure because
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:56,864	| IOT037 |	Somebody who's out can actually say oh hey we're out of milk according to the Haiku I'll just stop in and get it
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:38:00,704	| IOT037 |	Which if you're the kind of people who actually
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:04,288	| IOT037 |	Shirtless this could also be a good cutting gadget for y'all
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:06,592	| IOT037 |	We don't do that because I just
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:08,896	| IOT037 |	Leave the house because I work
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:09,664	| IOT037 |	Work from home
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:11,200	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:13,504	| IOT037 |	Like it's true guys
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:14,016	| IOT037 |	It is
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:16,064	| IOT037 |	All right
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:17,600	| IOT037 |	Well thank you so much
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:19,392	| IOT037 |	For doing the gadget review
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:20,672	| IOT037 |	Remember you guys at this
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:22,208	| IOT037 |	This is something you like let me know
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:28,096	| IOT037 |	And also you can start volunteering for things I am actively searching for people who have Kinect
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:28,864	| IOT037 |	Kid sprinklers
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:29,376	| IOT037 |	So
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:33,728	| IOT037 |	You do have to purchase it with your own money and have lived with it and I will that these things
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:37,824	| IOT037 |	So info at iot podcast. Com
