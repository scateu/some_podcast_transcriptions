EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,056	| IOT120 |	Let's kick it off with
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:51,360	| IOT120 |	Did you buy anything
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:54,432	| IOT120 |	I didn't attend this might be the
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:59,296	| IOT120 |	First time in ages that I didn't my son got a good deal on
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:03,904	| IOT120 |	Amazon Echo tap I can for $79
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:06,208	| IOT120 |	K-129 from mine
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:09,536	| IOT120 |	But other than that I don't
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:10,816	| IOT120 |	All right I bought
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:11,840	| IOT120 |	An Amazon
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:15,424	| IOT120 |	And the reason and we talked about this a little bit last week
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:21,312	| IOT120 |	Is the Echo Show that's downstairs in our kitchen living room area it doesn't seem to pick up my voice
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:27,456	| IOT120 |	As well as the original cylinder so my husband was like you know what I don't want that downstairs it's utility is not as great for
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:31,040	| IOT120 |	I had already given the
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:34,112	| IOT120 |	Amazon Echo cylinder to my daughter and I didn't want to steal it back
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,392	| IOT120 |	Apparently didn't want to put the show in
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,720	| IOT120 |	That's a No-No
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:39,744	| IOT120 |	So
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:42,560	| IOT120 |	I'm not moving to show to my office
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:44,864	| IOT120 |	So if anyone wants to drop in during off
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:45,376	| IOT120 |	Flowers
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:46,912	| IOT120 |	Actually that
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:48,704	| IOT120 |	Brings me to this idea
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,984	| IOT120 |	The show for drop in
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,776	| IOT120 |	Should have office hours
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:56,640	| IOT120 |	Chris Lake
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:58,688	| IOT120 |	When I'm sitting here at my desk working
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,992	| IOT120 |	I actually have no problem with a wide variety
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,320	| IOT120 |	Anyway
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:07,392	| IOT120 |	So back to that so we bought the original Echo
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,672	| IOT120 |	For $90
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:09,184	| IOT120 |	And
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:15,328	| IOT120 |	That's it that's a good deal I mean if you wanted a
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:19,168	| IOT120 |	If you wanted an Amazon device of any kind
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:21,984	| IOT120 |	Whether it's a tablet or an echo
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,776	| IOT120 |	The deals were fantastic
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:29,920	| IOT120 |	Yeah nothing else really jumped out of there was some smart home deals but none of them
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:32,224	| IOT120 |	Expedia
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:33,248	| IOT120 |	So I am going to let you know
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,064	| IOT120 |	Mother
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:40,672	| IOT120 |	I don't know how it taste like these tiny little sensors attached to it
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:45,280	| IOT120 |	It's a cute seahub it's it looks like an upside down light bulb with little :-) on it
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,304	| IOT120 |	French OK it's
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:50,912	| IOT120 |	Self expression
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,192	| IOT120 |	Necklaces that say
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,496	| IOT120 |	It's sophisticated it will ignore you
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:58,080	| IOT120 |	I will not turn on your light
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,616	| IOT120 |	Right now I'm busy
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:00,896	| IOT120 |	I have other things
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:04,224	| IOT120 |	That was my Russian
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:07,552	| IOT120 |	Mother is on sale for $99 for the
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,856	| IOT120 |	Hot it normally is 299
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,392	| IOT120 |	So this is actually
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:12,928	| IOT120 |	Good deal
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:15,232	| IOT120 |	And I think I'm going to buy one
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:17,791	| IOT120 |	I had played with this probably three or four years ago
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,839	| IOT120 |	It what I was a kid
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:22,143	| IOT120 |	And I wrote about it that I thought this was
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:24,191	| IOT120 |	A really great hub for
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:30,335	| IOT120 |	People who don't want to connect smart devices they just want to know where stuff is happening or where it is in the
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,639	| IOT120 |	Their house is very sensor Centric
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:33,919	| IOT120 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:38,015	| IOT120 |	And for 99 bucks plus you can get a package of four different kinds of sensors
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,295	| IOT120 |	Call peanuts
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,111	| IOT120 |	How cute is that
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:44,927	| IOT120 |	Horrible date they really are
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,975	| IOT120 |	Battery life
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:48,255	| IOT120 |	Applebee's
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,279	| IOT120 |	When I tried it out UK
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,559	| IOT120 |	Reach
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:51,327	| IOT120 |	Hard
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,143	| IOT120 |	I'm trying to remember how that worked
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,423	| IOT120 |	I do remember
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:55,935	| IOT120 |	They have
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:58,495	| IOT120 |	The sensors that are little bit more generic
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:00,031	| IOT120 |	And then they have
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:03,359	| IOT120 |	The peanuts and there's three kinds of peanuts there's a guard peanut
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,639	| IOT120 |	I'm thermopeanut
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,151	| IOT120 |	And a
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,735	| IOT120 |	And so
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:12,831	| IOT120 |	Those have special algorithms on them that track things like sleep
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:17,183	| IOT120 |	Or ambient temperature changes in car peanut tracks like when stuff moves basic
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:19,231	| IOT120 |	And then I have some more generic
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:20,255	| IOT120 |	Stead
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:22,303	| IOT120 |	Also track those
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,095	| IOT120 |	Specific
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,399	| IOT120 |	And basically
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,167	| IOT120 |	I really liked this
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:32,543	| IOT120 |	I noticed they had an activity tracking peanut at when I tested it out and that was not good
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:33,823	| IOT120 |	But it did not track that
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,335	| IOT120 |	Accurately
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:37,919	| IOT120 |	I tried to sleep peanut and that was okay
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,199	| IOT120 |	But I think
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:42,783	| IOT120 |	I would try it again measured against my Fitbit
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:45,343	| IOT120 |	Because sleep tracking has gotten a lot better than
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,879	| IOT120 |	The last time I tested this
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,927	| IOT120 |	And they had a prescription
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:54,303	| IOT120 |	Like a potion peanut that tracked motion and I put that on a pill bottle to make sure I was taking my medicine every day
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:56,095	| IOT120 |	That was actually really handy
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:58,655	| IOT120 |	Because it would send a notification
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,679	| IOT120 |	If I hadn't taken it
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,191	| IOT120 |	By a certain time
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:03,007	| IOT120 |	Red so
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:03,775	| IOT120 |	I don't know
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:08,895	| IOT120 |	I ate a good deal at 99 much better do obviously the 299 this is not a prime deal this is
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,407	| IOT120 |	Direct
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,199	| IOT120 |	Purchase steel from mother
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,247	| IOT120 |	From Central

EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,831	| IOT120 |	Dot-dot essay
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:18,111	| IOT120 |	Not to be confused with
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,135	| IOT120 |	Hello shenzhen
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:21,695	| IOT120 |	Businessman
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:22,719	| IOT120 |	Electricity
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:29,375	| IOT120 |	It actually saying going-out-of-business reminds me so why do you think this is discounted I hate to think you can go there
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:35,519	| IOT120 |	They're still active on their accounts
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:42,943	| IOT120 |	And one of the things I really like about them they don't sell the data
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:47,295	| IOT120 |	They specifically say your date is your day that you can delete it from our
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:50,367	| IOT120 |	Servers at a time if you're done with it
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:53,439	| IOT120 |	At least I thought I had an in terms of that from
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,719	| IOT120 |	Take us back from day one
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:57,023	| IOT120 |	Yes I think it's part of their
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:57,791	| IOT120 |	They are French
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,839	| IOT120 |	At my other favorite French Camp
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,143	| IOT120 |	Netatmo and they don't share
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:03,935	| IOT120 |	So
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,727	| IOT120 |	You know if you want to build a French Smart Home
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,007	| IOT120 |	This is not about
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:08,799	| IOT120 |	We do not share
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:16,735	| IOT120 |	Speaking of
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,295	| IOT120 |	I I I wanted to do the speaking of French
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:27,487	| IOT120 |	Segway that she tried
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:28,767	| IOT120 |	I just now you'll say people don't worry
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,071	| IOT120 |	For this moment
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,095	| IOT120 |	Going back to Amazon
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:40,799	| IOT120 |	Amazon has launched smart home consulting services in Chinese
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,335	| IOT120 |	Seattle Portland
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:43,615	| IOT120 |	Price of California
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,639	| IOT120 |	Not in Texas City

EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,199	| IOT120 |	But
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:49,247	| IOT120 |	What it is is you can hire this
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:54,623	| IOT120 |	Amazon expert
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:55,903	| IOT120 |	Set up
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:58,207	| IOT120 |	Madam a smart home
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,255	| IOT120 |	I don't know what do you think
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:07,423	| IOT120 |	I think Best Buy is not happy with the Geek Squad because they do the same thing and BestBuy stock took a hit
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:10,751	| IOT120 |	As soon as this news hit the waves so that's not good
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:15,103	| IOT120 |	I don't know any I get it it's an a potential
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,151	| IOT120 |	Revenue Edition
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:24,063	| IOT120 |	Stream for Amazon part of me says the products themselves are designed in a way that their prey
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:26,111	| IOT120 |	Pretty simple to set up and
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:31,743	| IOT120 |	I mean I almost want to say if you need the service Amazon fail at the design
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,767	| IOT120 |	I don't think they did
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,047	| IOT120 |	Well okay
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,863	| IOT120 |	So I think people listening to the show
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:37,887	| IOT120 |	Probably not
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| IOT120 |	The audience for this
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:41,983	| IOT120 |	I got a lot of people who
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,031	| IOT120 |	They're like
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,311	| IOT120 |	I don't want this it looks sneaky
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,359	| IOT120 |	I don't know where to go from
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:49,663	| IOT120 |	But I have an Amazon Echo
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,455	| IOT120 |	I want to set up smart
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,735	| IOT120 |	Light switch smart lights do I buy
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,039	| IOT120 |	So this is actually
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,855	| IOT120 |	This could help Amazon
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,135	| IOT120 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:08:59,903	| IOT120 |	Any more thing
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:00,927	| IOT120 |	In
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:04,767	| IOT120 |	I should say we should because they don't sell enough things today
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:08,351	| IOT120 |	This boost value
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:12,191	| IOT120 |	Cuz if you're just using Echo and I think
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:15,007	| IOT120 |	Was it most people use it still is a kitchen timer
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,311	| IOT120 |	If you just use it as that
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:23,199	| IOT120 |	We actually got data from
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:25,759	| IOT120 |	Talking about
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:28,319	| IOT120 |	Boy stuff and it's worth bringing in now because it's super
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:32,159	| IOT120 |	Let's talk about some of the things we establish
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:34,207	| IOT120 |	Don't you have a voice assistant
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:36,767	| IOT120 |	You actually
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:41,887	| IOT120 |	Which I was like
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:46,751	| IOT120 |	Yeah in a sense this data are going to talk about a second isn't
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:50,335	| IOT120 |	Shocking but it reinforces the idea that people are using
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,615	| IOT120 |	This voice assistant
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:54,431	| IOT120 |	Exactly what they were designed for as well as other
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,735	| IOT120 |	Pictures but mainly for
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:58,271	| IOT120 |	For that the key features
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:00,319	| IOT120 |	Yes it is sampled 1500 if
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,647	| IOT120 |	Pretty
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,415	| IOT120 |	Self-selecting
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:07,231	| IOT120 |	People Like Us
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,279	| IOT120 |	Does the smart home show
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:09,791	| IOT120 |	Sorry about that
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,863	| IOT120 |	All right
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:13,631	| IOT120 |	Us
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,399	| IOT120 |	Who have
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:16,447	| IOT120 |	All these devices so 62%
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,471	| IOT120 |	People
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:20,799	| IOT120 |	Who own an Amazon Echo or Google home
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,823	| IOT120 |	Home Smart lighting
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:27,199	| IOT120 |	42% also owns smart thermostats in 40%
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,735	| IOT120 |	I want to Smart Hub
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,039	| IOT120 |	So that's
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,063	| IOT120 |	Pretty high
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:34,111	| IOT120 |	Jeff
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:38,207	| IOT120 |	Yeah I mean that the hubsan assistance themselves are useful
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:41,791	| IOT120 |	But obviously they're far more useful as you add more things right
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,887	| IOT120 |	The reason people bought these things
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:46,911	| IOT120 |	78
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:49,215	| IOT120 |	I'm a 79% markup to stream music
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,775	| IOT120 |	70% control Smart lighting
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:55,359	| IOT120 |	And so what's crazy to me is there actually using it
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,127	| IOT120 |	For what they think
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:00,223	| IOT120 |	75%
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:00,991	| IOT120 |	Music
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:04,319	| IOT120 |	Well 60% control Smart lighting so there's a little Gap there
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,623	| IOT120 |	So maybe Amazon wants to
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,391	| IOT120 |	Clothes that capital
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,719	| IOT120 |	This is among the more sophisticated people
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:15,071	| IOT120 |	Right said what's interesting also is going along with the whole
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,119	| IOT120 |	Ecosystem aspect of it
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:23,007	| IOT120 |	91% of those surveyed say that their system has made them more likely to buy another connected device in the future
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:25,311	| IOT120 |	So that obviously I can't get to the
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,591	| IOT120 |	Add more items to it
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:29,663	| IOT120 |	And I thought this was kind of interesting because a lot of people
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:32,223	| IOT120 |	He's just having a conversation on Twitter with somebody about
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,271	| IOT120 |	Amazon's hardware for
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,551	| IOT120 |	It's Darius
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,319	| IOT120 |	Smart devices
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:43,231	| IOT120 |	98% of if users believe they'll still be in their voice assistance 5 years
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:48,095	| IOT120 |	I get a lot of questions about yesterday add that to the hardware like no
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:50,143	| IOT120 |	The hardware itself isn't
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:52,703	| IOT120 |	The thing that's going to evolve at this point
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,471	| IOT120 |	It's
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:54,495	| IOT120 |	The software is
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,799	| IOT120 |	The service is it's what they can connect to
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:57,823	| IOT120 |	So I totally
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,847	| IOT120 |	Agree with that
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,895	| IOT120 |	Vast majority if users that say that
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:05,503	| IOT120 |	You don't Amazon built this with relatively at the time
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,855	| IOT120 |	The latest and greatest
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:12,415	| IOT120 |	Hot diggity chips and this isn't a product that
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,951	| IOT120 |	Requires this and that
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:17,023	| IOT120 |	It's a really interesting way to think about building
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,327	| IOT120 |	For the whole because these devices
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:23,679	| IOT120 |	Especially not that connecting your devices to the Amazon is hard
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:27,519	| IOT120 |	If you think about adding more of it like replacing
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:29,311	| IOT120 |	Connected home devices
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,359	| IOT120 |	It's not something people want
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,663	| IOT120 |	Yeah and it's
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:35,199	| IOT120 |	It's actually anime B
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:37,247	| IOT120 |	Wrong here I'm picking up
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,015	| IOT120 |	Stop my head
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:41,087	| IOT120 |	I think it's one of the most widely adopted
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,879	| IOT120 |	Consumer Cloud devices
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:47,231	| IOT120 |	Because really that's what it's doing it's better I don't need the heavy-duty Hardware
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:49,279	| IOT120 |	Everything is taking place in the cloud
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:51,327	| IOT120 |	Rethink mainstream people how many
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:53,119	| IOT120 |	Millions of these devices are out there now
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:55,679	| IOT120 |	That's a real Testament to to clock
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:57,215	| IOT120 |	Computing on the consumer level
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,567	| IOT120 |	For everybody
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:02,847	| IOT120 |	Hello
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:08,991	| IOT120 |	Mother incense how important is integration with your voice assistant when choosing a connected device 60%
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,575	| IOT120 |	2% said somewhat
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:17,183	| IOT120 |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,975	| IOT120 |	Yeah that's interesting
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:24,095	| IOT120 |	Also related miles apart in here now I just got to study from Walker Sands community
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:25,119	| IOT120 |	Haitians
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:28,447	| IOT120 |	Saying that they did at a future of retail
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,215	| IOT120 |	Study
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:35,615	| IOT120 |	And they say that nearly one-in-five consumers has made a voice purchase through an echo or other voice control devices
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:39,455	| IOT120 |	And another 33%
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:40,735	| IOT120 |	Set a ties into the hole
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,271	| IOT120 |	The shopping aspect
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:42,783	| IOT120 |	Things to
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,599	| IOT120 |	Although I would say
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,879	| IOT120 |	I didn't realize this would happen
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:47,903	| IOT120 |	Cuz I'm a space cadet
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:49,183	| IOT120 |	Where's my Amazon
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,207	| IOT120 |	Comprende
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,743	| IOT120 |	Through
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,327	| IOT120 |	And I got a $10 credit
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,095	| IOT120 |	Yes
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,887	| IOT120 |	That was that was part of the deal
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,423	| IOT120 |	So I guess I paid $80
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:03,007	| IOT120 |	Now
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:08,127	| IOT120 |	Back to selling connected devices which is this Amazon thing is
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:09,407	| IOT120 |	Probably mostly about
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:09,919	| IOT120 |	Apple
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,199	| IOT120 |	Has created
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:13,759	| IOT120 |	A retail experience
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:14,527	| IOT120 |	The Smart Home
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:15,807	| IOT120 |	Antique stores
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:19,391	| IOT120 |	Obviously based on homekit
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:25,791	| IOT120 |	I saw this and I was like well of course it did
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,327	| IOT120 |	Cuz you need this
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:33,471	| IOT120 |	To sell the smart home and then I instantly thought of retail smart home efforts out there
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:36,543	| IOT120 |	We can pick it off with staples connect which was our first
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:41,919	| IOT120 |	Which is now
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:45,503	| IOT120 |	Ring
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:50,111	| IOT120 |	That company first came to my attention because they built this
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:53,695	| IOT120 |	Connected store experience for Staples
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,975	| IOT120 |	And that did not go well
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:15:01,119	| IOT120 |	The thing is it was a great way to Showcase surprise fantastic demo is gave you ideas of ways to use the
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:03,679	| IOT120 |	The Hub and connected devices
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:05,727	| IOT120 |	So I don't think it's failed because of the
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,263	| IOT120 |	In-store demo metal
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:08,543	| IOT120 |	I think people just didn't
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,311	| IOT120 |	By there
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,079	| IOT120 |	Products from
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:10,847	| IOT120 |	Staples
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,615	| IOT120 |	Hangout
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:16,223	| IOT120 |	Experiment
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:20,063	| IOT120 |	It down in San Francisco across the street from Moscone
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:22,111	| IOT120 |	I actually this year revamped it
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:29,023	| IOT120 |	It's more like a beta store concept where you actually play with things cuz the original concept was to show all these connected devices
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:29,791	| IOT120 |	This working together
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:32,351	| IOT120 |	And I had this like clear lucite
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,631	| IOT120 |	Furniture
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:37,215	| IOT120 |	Getting all these connected products and there was a really
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:39,519	| IOT120 |	Demo coneria but
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:42,079	| IOT120 |	Be kind of tweak that
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:43,103	| IOT120 |	Because
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:45,151	| IOT120 |	It's something I felt like a smart home is not
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:46,175	| IOT120 |	It's not coming together for
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:50,271	| IOT120 |	That's another retail
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:50,783	| IOT120 |	Concept
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:51,807	| IOT120 |	AOL
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,367	| IOT120 |	In the beta store
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:56,671	| IOT120 |	Is going well but they don't show it like
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,207	| IOT120 |	They don't show Smart Home Stuff working
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:15:59,743	| IOT120 |	Like the integration
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:00,511	| IOT120 |	Watsons store
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:03,583	| IOT120 |	So yeah so with the Apple I'm curious what you think of
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,095	| IOT120 |	What they're doing
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:08,447	| IOT120 |	I'm not sure if
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:12,799	| IOT120 |	I'm not sure either I think it's
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:14,335	| IOT120 |	28 stores around the
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,359	| IOT120 |	Country
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:21,759	| IOT120 |	Not including Union Square in San Francisco World Trade Center and Williamsburg
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:24,831	| IOT120 |	I guess and then 15 stores outside of the US
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:29,183	| IOT120 |	How much did you say a non-interactive homekit experience will be out at all of that
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:30,975	| IOT120 |	So
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:34,047	| IOT120 |	At least you'll get to see things to play with them
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:39,935	| IOT120 |	This is the kind of product you have to demo you have to show off you have to let people play in
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:44,799	| IOT120 |	Hit a button to make a light go on and say okay to get them thinking about how they can use it so
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:46,591	| IOT120 |	I think it's a brilliant play I just
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:52,223	| IOT120 |	I still feel that homekit does not have the momentum of other platforms for
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:53,503	| IOT120 |	Various reasons
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,551	| IOT120 |	And by having a special section
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:17:00,415	| IOT120 |	The store that's focused on homekit
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:06,559	| IOT120 |	We're finally ready and with the homepod launching in December it could be that they're like going to build this
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:07,839	| IOT120 |	In-store
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:10,399	| IOT120 |	Ecosystem like that
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,423	| IOT120 |	Amazon is trying
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,191	| IOT120 |	To do with
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:12,959	| IOT120 |	The echo
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:20,127	| IOT120 |	I could see that and I could also see them doing their one-on-one training and Group Training like I do
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:22,431	| IOT120 |	For all their other products that's a big thing that
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:25,503	| IOT120 |	San Amazon can't do because they don't have a physical presence
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:30,367	| IOT120 |	Bread
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:31,903	| IOT120 |	Haven't used homekit
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,439	| IOT120 |	It is
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,207	| IOT120 |	Freaking easy
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,743	| IOT120 |	The biggest
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:37,023	| IOT120 |	Catches in homekit
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:39,839	| IOT120 |	Things up is going to be actually how you names
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:42,143	| IOT120 |	Understand you
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:42,911	| IOT120 |	So
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:44,959	| IOT120 |	I can actually see a year from now
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:51,359	| IOT120 |	Is the products are super compelling and maybe they offer install for some of the more complicated things like light switch
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:57,247	| IOT120 |	I can see this actually being kind of a cool thing for apple and getting homekit more Wiley.
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:59,551	| IOT120 |	I'm not a huge fan but you know it could happen
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:06,719	| IOT120 |	It could I I don't see them ever actually getting into installation may be contracted out but they don't
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:08,255	| IOT120 |	Think so cuz they like that control everything
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:11,327	| IOT120 |	I think it's more about showing how to use it
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:13,119	| IOT120 |	Anything else
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:17,471	| IOT120 |	Because it works across their entire product line on the mobile side new iPads
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:18,751	| IOT120 |	IPhones Apple watch
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:21,311	| IOT120 |	So you throw all those in the next
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:25,151	| IOT120 |	Chances are a customer has one or multiple one or more of those things
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:29,247	| IOT120 |	To show how easy it works across other devices probably what they're going to highlight
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:31,807	| IOT120 |	That sounds
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,111	| IOT120 |	Appellee
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:37,439	| IOT120 |	Awesome

EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:53,311	| IOT120 |	Fancy maker of luggage and leather goods

EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:00,223	| IOT120 |	Oh Lewis
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:01,759	| IOT120 |	No no no
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,039	| IOT120 |	So
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,319	| IOT120 |	So
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,599	| IOT120 |	Let's talk about what it is
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,879	| IOT120 |	First they came out with
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:09,183	| IOT120 |	3 smart watches that are
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:11,999	| IOT120 |	Uniquely designed when you when you look at
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,535	| IOT120 |	Most smart watches today there
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,559	| IOT120 |	I know
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:17,375	| IOT120 |	I want a cookie cutter but they're very similar
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:21,983	| IOT120 |	So this is slightly different than maybe the other SmartWatches use singing and then that's fine
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:27,615	| IOT120 |	Button inside of course it's a Qualcomm chip and it's running Google Android Wear software so it's
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:31,455	| IOT120 |	Functionally and technically no different than
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:35,295	| IOT120 |	$99 or $200 Android Wear watch you can buy today
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:40,415	| IOT120 |	Of course being Louis Vuitton this is not $99 this is going to start at
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,975	| IOT120 |	2400
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,999	| IOT120 |	50
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,791	| IOT120 |	Dollars and steel and the
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:48,095	| IOT120 |	A black version of it is $2,900
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:49,887	| IOT120 |	So
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:51,167	| IOT120 |	A Japanese
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:51,679	| IOT120 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,983	| IOT120 |	Yeah for a year I mean
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:56,799	| IOT120 |	Yeah I get listen I get
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:59,103	| IOT120 |	Fashion luxury brands
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:02,687	| IOT120 |	In certain products I do I get it and I spent
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,711	| IOT120 |	Some good money in sky
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:09,599	| IOT120 |	Yeah and I spent some good money on a Tissot or some other while call low and
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:12,159	| IOT120 |	Not luxury watches you know but nice watches
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:17,535	| IOT120 |	When it comes to Tech I don't see the fashion brands
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:20,607	| IOT120 |	Working and then tag or has already tried this
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,375	| IOT120 |	With
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:22,143	| IOT120 |	2
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,423	| IOT120 |	Android watches
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:27,263	| IOT120 |	And in fact it was Emma's $1,500 I think for the first one that tag are sold
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:32,383	| IOT120 |	And they I think they knew that it was a stretch because they even gave you the option of getting
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,663	| IOT120 |	A mechanical
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:36,735	| IOT120 |	Insert that you would take the Smartwatch out and put the mechanical
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,015	| IOT120 |	Tag Heuer watch
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:41,343	| IOT120 |	Automatic movement into the
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,111	| IOT120 |	Band
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:44,671	| IOT120 |	And now they give you both of them for one price
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:48,255	| IOT120 |	I I just don't see a massive market for this
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:50,047	| IOT120 |	And I think that's okay
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:50,559	| IOT120 |	Their standards
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,119	| IOT120 |	What I'm saying
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:55,679	| IOT120 |	20th century
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:59,263	| IOT120 |	It didn't mean we were going to turn into Boeing or Airbus
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:04,639	| IOT120 |	But are they part of that conversation now
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,407	| IOT120 |	Swellinfo
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,711	| IOT120 |	And that's the question
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:12,319	| IOT120 |	Is fashion going to take over wearables or is
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:14,879	| IOT120 |	Tech going to take over
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:15,903	| IOT120 |	That side of
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,696	| IOT120 |	Red fashion
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,208	| IOT120 |	In route
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:21,280	| IOT120 |	I would be sad like I would love to see
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:25,120	| IOT120 |	A Qualcomm dresses reference designs for
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:27,168	| IOT120 |	Fashion companies in fossil did by
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:29,216	| IOT120 |	Misfit wearables
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:33,568	| IOT120 |	I'm in his integrating some of that technology into straight up Fossil Watches Witcher
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:37,152	| IOT120 |	Dino stretch of the imagination super high-end
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:38,944	| IOT120 |	I like ideas having
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:40,480	| IOT120 |	A wearable that Ida strap-on
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:42,528	| IOT120 |	To my wrist and just
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:46,624	| IOT120 |	Mashing it to my outfit I think the challenge has been
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,648	| IOT120 |	On the software side
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:52,000	| IOT120 |	If I don't wear the same watch everyday
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:54,560	| IOT120 |	Put something else on it I wanted to just talk to
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:55,840	| IOT120 |	One app
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,120	| IOT120 |	Right
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:58,912	| IOT120 |	In what is it
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,192	| IOT120 |	That actually
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:03,776	| IOT120 |	Outside of price or anything else I think is what's holding back
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,824	| IOT120 |	More
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,336	| IOT120 |	Fashion
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:07,872	| IOT120 |	Gerbils
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:15,808	| IOT120 |	I would agree with him and you can anything Jazz things up with bands watch bands and so on
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:18,368	| IOT120 |	A failed experiment hearing is not one of the companies that we
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:19,136	| IOT120 |	Just talked about
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:22,976	| IOT120 |	It was the original $10,000 Apple watch
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,024	| IOT120 |	They don't sell it anymore
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:26,816	| IOT120 |	Wow
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:28,352	| IOT120 |	I can't imagine why not
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:35,008	| IOT120 |	I mean that to me that was like we're going to try and do the the fashion luxury brand
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:36,288	| IOT120 |	Addition
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:38,336	| IOT120 |	And I'm sure they sold a couple of them
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:42,432	| IOT120 |	But they don't sell them anymore than the most expensive one now is
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:44,480	| IOT120 |	I don't know maybe $1,500
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:48,320	| IOT120 |	Wiltshire I mean and that's a lot you didn't get it it's ceramic
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:51,136	| IOT120 |	You know I got the stainless steel model
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:53,184	| IOT120 |	My Apple watch was 599 when the
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:56,000	| IOT120 |	399 aluminum one would have been just fine it
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,024	| IOT120 |	They're out of him and I
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,048	| IOT120 |	Didn't want to wait Bass
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:58,816	| IOT120 |	Whatever
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,632	| IOT120 |	I don't know why I don't see it at
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,912	| IOT120 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:03,936	| IOT120 |	There's a hole
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:06,496	| IOT120 |	I'll call it an underground market for
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:12,896	| IOT120 |	Developers who create and I know this is not legal but they create watch faces digital watch faces that mimic
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:17,504	| IOT120 |	That's fancy to the 5,000 or $10,000 luxury brand watches
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:22,624	| IOT120 |	So if you want to Rolex watch base you know what you can buy for $0.99 you know until
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:25,696	| IOT120 |	Shut it down and they just pop up somewhere else
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:29,280	| IOT120 |	So I just don't think it's worth it for these companies to
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,560	| IOT120 |	Do this and I think
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:33,888	| IOT120 |	Take me to find that out should just do a
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:34,400	| IOT120 |	Affordable
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,936	| IOT120 |	Custom watch face
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:37,472	| IOT120 |	$30
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:41,568	| IOT120 |	I mean you'd probably get more sales of that then
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:44,640	| IOT120 |	Then watch it $20 box
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:50,784	| IOT120 |	I'm really excited
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:52,576	| IOT120 |	Because I am a networking
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:55,392	| IOT120 |	Is Misha
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:57,184	| IOT120 |	I can't say his name I'm sorry Michelle
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:58,208	| IOT120 |	I am terrible
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:01,536	| IOT120 |	But she is a co-founder of a company called Open Garden
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:04,352	| IOT120 |	Which is a peer-to-peer messaging
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,656	| IOT120 |	For smartphones
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:08,704	| IOT120 |	He actually started a new company called no.
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:14,592	| IOT120 |	And this company is basically trying to create a location tracking Network for iot
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:18,944	| IOT120 |	You know you guys know that I'm super high on location tracking
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:25,088	| IOT120 |	And they're running software
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:31,744	| IOT120 |	So The Challenge location tracking and iot is it is really expensive if you use cellular and that uses batteries
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:35,584	| IOT120 |	Companies like tile and tracker
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,352	| IOT120 |	Things like
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:38,656	| IOT120 |	There is
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:43,008	| IOT120 |	You have to have a pretty phenomenal Network
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:45,312	| IOT120 |	Closer to real time
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:48,896	| IOT120 |	Applications if you're out in the middle of nowhere
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:51,200	| IOT120 |	Tile app installed in your phone
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:54,528	| IOT120 |	It's basically a crowd-sourced network essentially
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:55,808	| IOT120 |	So
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:58,112	| IOT120 |	Side deal with nodal is
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:25:01,184	| IOT120 |	That instead of just helping consumers by these devices
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:04,000	| IOT120 |	They're actually paying Developers
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:05,792	| IOT120 |	To put
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:08,096	| IOT120 |	Their software into
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,656	| IOT120 |	Popular apps that use Bluetooth
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:15,520	| IOT120 |	And then so the network gets bigger faster and us there's more utility
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:16,544	| IOT120 |	Location track
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:19,616	| IOT120 |	So this isn't a consumer-oriented
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:20,384	| IOT120 |	To think it's like
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:24,224	| IOT120 |	Getting developers and then they're going to sell access to this network
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:26,784	| IOT120 |	Which
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:28,320	| IOT120 |	Building networks is always hard
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:30,368	| IOT120 |	Never easy
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:32,416	| IOT120 |	But I am really fascinated
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:35,744	| IOT120 |	Buy this idea in because
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:36,768	| IOT120 |	I followed Open Garden
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:42,400	| IOT120 |	I love the way they're thinking and I think that we've had it on a couple of shows ago this idea of
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:45,472	| IOT120 |	Building a truly distributed Network
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:45,984	| IOT120 |	For iot
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:51,872	| IOT120 |	I don't know it's interesting approach
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:52,640	| IOT120 |	So yeah so
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:56,736	| IOT120 |	Guys go check out noodle I'm going to write about it more in this week
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:57,760	| IOT120 |	Because I love it
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:01,088	| IOT120 |	I think that's it
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:06,720	| IOT120 |	This section the new section of the show and that's why the message from our sponsor and then
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:08,000	| IOT120 |	Alex
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:10,560	| IOT120 |	Lighthouse talking about
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:20,800	| IOT120 |	For computer vision so stay tuned for all that we are taking a break from the
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:26,688	| IOT120 |	Internet of Things podcast from our sponsor this week sponsor is Allegiant
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,968	| IOT120 |	The maker of Schlage Locks
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:30,016	| IOT120 |	Rob Martin
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:33,344	| IOT120 |	Who is a futuristic
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:35,136	| IOT120 |	Guys Rob is actually friend
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,928	| IOT120 |	Very smart women
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:37,696	| IOT120 |	X to the smart
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:43,328	| IOT120 |	Different questions
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:45,888	| IOT120 |	Intro to him cuz he thinks about this
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:48,192	| IOT120 |	Not just as a consumer but also as a company that makes
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,544	| IOT120 |	I want to make my home smart
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:53,568	| IOT120 |	What should I buy
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:54,848	| IOT120 |	Bye
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:59,456	| IOT120 |	Devices based on what it is specifically designed to do not what you hope it can
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:02,528	| IOT120 |	There's a lot of interesting use cases out there
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:04,832	| IOT120 |	But if you go shopping and are kind of
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:05,600	| IOT120 |	Floating
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:11,232	| IOT120 |	Looking for something cool you're not necessarily going to get something that's practical for you day today
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,000	| IOT120 |	All right
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:12,768	| IOT120 |	So
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:15,584	| IOT120 |	There's a lot about security how should I be thinking about
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:16,096	| IOT120 |	Security
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:21,728	| IOT120 |	Well there are lots of things to consider with security and it's not just cyber
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,008	| IOT120 |	Obviously with all
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:25,824	| IOT120 |	Ransomware attacks and other things going on it's a
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:26,848	| IOT120 |	Big consideration
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:31,712	| IOT120 |	But you should also think about the physical security when it comes to a product like ours
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:33,760	| IOT120 |	Locks is that Hardware Graydon
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:36,832	| IOT120 |	In other words does it have a bhma rating
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:39,648	| IOT120 |	That allows you to have the best security
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:41,440	| IOT120 |	Durability and function
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:42,464	| IOT120 |	Personality in the product
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:44,512	| IOT120 |	Perspective
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:50,912	| IOT120 |	I always look for over the air update if your device is not able to take on new technology whether that be in the
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,960	| IOT120 |	Form of new firmware
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:57,824	| IOT120 |	New applications and other things not only are you probably missing out on some new functionality
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:28:02,432	| IOT120 |	But you're probably missing out on some of the most important security updates that you're going to need
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:03,968	| IOT120 |	Now you mentioned
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:05,504	| IOT120 |	To bhma
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:06,272	| IOT120 |	Grading
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:07,552	| IOT120 |	And I have no idea what that is
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:13,184	| IOT120 |	Bhma stands for builders hardware manufacturers
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:13,952	| IOT120 |	Association
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:17,792	| IOT120 |	And so what it is is a residential lock grading system
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:19,840	| IOT120 |	So it's broken into three
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:20,352	| IOT120 |	Components
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:21,888	| IOT120 |	Security
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:23,168	| IOT120 |	Durability in Finnish
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:26,240	| IOT120 |	So security is what it sounds like it's a measure of safety
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:30,848	| IOT120 |	But there's some cool components in there things like Sledgehammer attacks
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,384	| IOT120 |	Attempts to manually
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:34,432	| IOT120 |	Call the lock from the door or
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:38,016	| IOT120 |	Wait like a child hanging from a door lever or something like that
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:40,064	| IOT120 |	The second element is durability
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:42,880	| IOT120 |	So that's a measure of functionality
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:44,160	| IOT120 |	So for example
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:45,440	| IOT120 |	Working at Estes
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,208	| IOT120 |	2
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:48,256	| IOT120 |	The equivalent of 100 Year life
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:49,280	| IOT120 |	And making sure that the
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:50,816	| IOT120 |	The Mechanicals are still working
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:52,096	| IOT120 |	And then finish
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:55,168	| IOT120 |	So finishes the measure of resilience against
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:55,936	| IOT120 |	Elements
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:58,752	| IOT120 |	So you know scratching wear-and-tear salt
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:01,056	| IOT120 |	Humidity UV rays all that good stuff
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:04,896	| IOT120 |	Wow so do you have a sledgehammer test room or you guys beat your
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:08,992	| IOT120 |	We do so if you look at our sense product
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:15,392	| IOT120 |	Or our connect product both of our touchscreen deadbolt their aaa-rated bhma which means they get the
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:16,416	| IOT120 |	Top rating
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:20,256	| IOT120 |	Across those categories I just mentioned security durability and finish
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:21,792	| IOT120 |	Awesome
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:23,328	| IOT120 |	Where can I go to find out
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:26,656	| IOT120 |	Stay so you can find me on schlage.com
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:31,264	| IOT120 |	Slashdot leadership or on Twitter my handle is at Schleich futurist
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:40,480	| IOT120 |	Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:43,296	| IOT120 |	This is your host Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:43,808	| IOT120 |	Is Alex
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:48,416	| IOT120 |	Who is the CEO and co-founder of lighthouse
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:50,208	| IOT120 |	Hi Alex how are you doing
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:52,256	| IOT120 |	Good morning Stacy Angie
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:55,584	| IOT120 |	Thank you so much for coming on the show today
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:57,376	| IOT120 |	We are very excited to talk about
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:30:00,960	| IOT120 |	3D sensing let's get started with a real quick
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:03,264	| IOT120 |	3D sensing
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,032	| IOT120 |	So
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:05,056	| IOT120 |	Laid out for me
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:05,568	| IOT120 |	What is
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,616	| IOT120 |	3D sensing
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:09,664	| IOT120 |	Is a relatively new kind of sensor
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:10,944	| IOT120 |	So you can think of
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:13,504	| IOT120 |	I kind of like a camera
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:15,808	| IOT120 |	Rather than a camera that sees colors
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:18,112	| IOT120 |	In the worlds the way we're used to
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:20,160	| IOT120 |	We are used to perceiving the world
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:21,184	| IOT120 |	Discount received
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:28,352	| IOT120 |	Things like at every point it will say hey that's off lights and 3.72 meters away dark brown
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:29,888	| IOT120 |	And that's 2.85 me
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:30,656	| IOT120 |	Anchors Aweigh
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:32,192	| IOT120 |	And you get that for the whole field of vision
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:33,472	| IOT120 |	For this kind of
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:36,032	| IOT120 |	Kelly changes what you can do
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:37,056	| IOT120 |	With computer vision games
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:38,592	| IOT120 |	Like how
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:41,920	| IOT120 |	So the short version is that 3D sensing
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:42,944	| IOT120 |	Essentially
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:46,016	| IOT120 |	Makes many difficult some problems of computer vision
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:49,344	| IOT120 |	Substantially easier or relatively trivial to solve
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:51,392	| IOT120 |	Not also problems of computer vision
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:52,672	| IOT120 |	But many of them
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:56,768	| IOT120 |	Interesting topics to
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:58,304	| IOT120 |	To look at it to think about because
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:30:59,840	| IOT120 |	People are so good at division
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:05,472	| IOT120 |	Like our brains are so good at Vision that we never think about how hard it actually is
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:10,336	| IOT120 |	Using any extra technique you can to make that problem easier
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:11,616	| IOT120 |	Anthony something is just want to be
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:15,712	| IOT120 |	Okay so it does things like the ability to track distance
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:18,016	| IOT120 |	And not just color it just shape of
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:22,624	| IOT120 |	A computer to understand if I'm walking
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:24,160	| IOT120 |	Towards it or away from it
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:25,696	| IOT120 |	But it might also that it
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:26,464	| IOT120 |	Understand
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:30,304	| IOT120 |	Like how I'm walking into a relation of a room like these are kind of the things I'm
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:32,864	| IOT120 |	What is what these subproblems are
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:37,984	| IOT120 |	One good example here is that moving shadows and changing lighting conditions
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:39,264	| IOT120 |	Common
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:40,800	| IOT120 |	It starts at confusion
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:44,384	| IOT120 |	Four typical computer vision systems that use just regular color camera
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:48,736	| IOT120 |	And would you have a 3D sensor those moving shadows and changing lighting position
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:51,296	| IOT120 |	They're not changes in the 3D structure of the inventor
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:52,320	| IOT120 |	So they don't confuse
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,880	| IOT120 |	You can imagine the sensor
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:58,208	| IOT120 |	Essentially giving you a full 3D model of the environment
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:01,792	| IOT120 |	This is used widely in self-driving cars
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:03,584	| IOT120 |	Because
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:06,144	| IOT120 |	Having that direct access to a
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:08,960	| IOT120 |	Real-time stream of the 3D structure of the environment
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:15,616	| IOT120 |	Exactly what made it possible to finish the self-driving car races back in 2005 and 2007 in the dark
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,688	| IOT120 |	Lego
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,968	| IOT120 |	Okay so
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:20,992	| IOT120 |	You guys have
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:21,504	| IOT120 |	Taking the sense
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:28,928	| IOT120 |	And you have made it smaller and stuck it not in the car but in a camera for people's homes
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:29,696	| IOT120 |	And
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:30,976	| IOT120 |	Tell us a little bit more about
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:33,280	| IOT120 |	Lighthouse and why you started it
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:37,120	| IOT120 |	That's right the lighthouses I do kind of interactive assist
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:40,448	| IOT120 |	You can tell it what you care about
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:42,752	| IOT120 |	And it will tell you when those things happen
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:49,152	| IOT120 |	For example you can say let me know if you don't see the kids by 4 p.m.
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,688	| IOT120 |	And it understands what
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:51,456	| IOT120 |	Children look like
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:57,344	| IOT120 |	It makes use of this 3D sensing capabilities to to be able to understand what a child actually is
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:33:01,184	| IOT120 |	What time it is and if it doesn't see any children by 4 p.m.
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:03,488	| IOT120 |	And then you can go check in and make sure that everything
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:04,000	| IOT120 |	Okay
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,816	| IOT120 |	Because there's a lot of things happen
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:09,120	| IOT120 |	It sounds so easy
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:09,632	| IOT120 |	Are simple
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:15,264	| IOT120 |	So you got more accurate
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:16,544	| IOT120 |	Peter vision
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:17,568	| IOT120 |	Is that a decent way to say it
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:20,128	| IOT120 |	False positive
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:22,432	| IOT120 |	Dramatically increase
EDL	00:33:22,432	00:33:24,224	| IOT120 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:28,320	| IOT120 |	Camera with superpowers you've also got
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,600	| IOT120 |	Natural language processing
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:30,880	| IOT120 |	You've got
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:32,160	| IOT120 |	Some sort of
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:39,072	| IOT120 |	Programming in the back and see if I don't then I need to do this what else
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:39,840	| IOT120 |	Might be back there
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,888	| IOT120 |	Deep learning is the other really big
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:45,472	| IOT120 |	The way we think about the the really the really gnarly
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:47,520	| IOT120 |	Computer vision problems that were tackling
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:50,848	| IOT120 |	It's this combination of 3D sensing and deep learning
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:52,128	| IOT120 |	That really makes it go
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:54,944	| IOT120 |	And in particular gets its recurrent neural networks
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:57,248	| IOT120 |	That are analyzing time series data
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:58,272	| IOT120 |	Navigate from
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:02,368	| IOT120 |	Maybe worth mentioning 3D sensing one of those some problems that we talked about
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:03,136	| IOT120 |	Is
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:04,672	| IOT120 |	Fighting the segmentation about Jack
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:08,512	| IOT120 |	Right understanding that like hey this is where the subject begins and ends
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:09,024	| IOT120 |	And
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:17,216	| IOT120 |	Something it doesn't know what it is yet
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:23,616	| IOT120 |	And then the neural network will take a look at that
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:25,152	| IOT120 |	Running to the house this looks like a dog
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:27,968	| IOT120 |	Is there training associated with your camera
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:29,248	| IOT120 |	Like if I am a user
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:33,600	| IOT120 |	The short answer is no there's not almost everything works out of the box
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:36,928	| IOT120 |	The one thing that the user does have to set up
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:39,488	| IOT120 |	Because we don't know who is who
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:42,304	| IOT120 |	When like we arrived in your house for the first time
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:44,608	| IOT120 |	Right
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:49,984	| IOT120 |	So that one parts that user has to set up everything else works out of the box
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:51,520	| IOT120 |	Okay
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:55,104	| IOT120 |	So walk me through a day in the life with this camera so
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:57,920	| IOT120 |	People get a sense of How It's a little bit different
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,200	| IOT120 |	And some of the other things out on them
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:06,368	| IOT120 |	There's a very broad spectrum of things that that Lighthouse is capable of still one is the saying hey if you don't see the kids by 4 p.m. let me know
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:10,208	| IOT120 |	But you can do similar things for say the dog walker
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:13,536	| IOT120 |	He's working right now actually
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:17,632	| IOT120 |	But you say tell me if you don't see anyone with the dog at the front door on weekday after
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:24,288	| IOT120 |	It understands what you're asking for it understands what a dog looks like it and understands what a person looks like
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:26,592	| IOT120 |	And if it doesn't see those two things together
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:28,384	| IOT120 |	In Jessica's front door camera
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,664	| IOT120 |	Then it will let her know
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:31,712	| IOT120 |	When everything is happening normally in her home
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:36,576	| IOT120 |	But when something is out of the ordinary for some reason the dog walker hasn't shown up
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:38,624	| IOT120 |	Then
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:43,232	| IOT120 |	Is pretty exciting for a lot of different people with a lot of different
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:43,744	| IOT120 |	Specific problem
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:48,864	| IOT120 |	So we heard things like coffee shop owner doesn't especially want to get there at 5 a.m.
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:52,960	| IOT120 |	To like to open things up everyday and would really like to know that you know.
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:57,568	| IOT120 |	Let me know if you like don't see anyone there
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:36:03,968	| IOT120 |	By 5 a.m. and like it understands what people look like and it didn't understand the time constraints and it will it will actually
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:05,248	| IOT120 |	Do with us this coffee shop
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:09,088	| IOT120 |	And similarly for elderly care
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:13,696	| IOT120 |	His mother lived alone in Germany and
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:15,488	| IOT120 |	This kind of capability
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:17,024	| IOT120 |	Really useful to know
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:18,048	| IOT120 |	Hayden szeto
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:19,328	| IOT120 |	Eczema
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:23,936	| IOT120 |	And if not I should know about it so I can give her a ring and just make sure everything is okay
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:25,984	| IOT120 |	And she has this arrangement
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:27,008	| IOT120 |	Spell incredible
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,288	| IOT120 |	Security camera
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:30,848	| IOT120 |	Now the ability just said to check in on what's going on there
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:32,128	| IOT120 |	Let me go back to your
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:32,896	| IOT120 |	Coffee shop
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:34,176	| IOT120 |	Example because this
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:35,456	| IOT120 |	This is kind of interesting
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:36,224	| IOT120 |	Commercial applications
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:38,016	| IOT120 |	Or maybe even four
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:39,040	| IOT120 |	Me and my favorite
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:41,088	| IOT120 |	Coffee shop I would love to be able to say
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:43,648	| IOT120 |	If there are more than 30 people
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:45,696	| IOT120 |	At my coffee shop that is so tiny
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:46,720	| IOT120 |	And has
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:49,280	| IOT120 |	Let me know
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:52,096	| IOT120 |	Haha or some variation of that
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:54,656	| IOT120 |	And you know that would be really interesting from an
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:56,192	| IOT120 |	App perspective like
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:56,960	| IOT120 |	That would get me
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:36:57,728	| IOT120 |	I totally to download
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:36:59,264	| IOT120 |	Coffee shop
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:01,568	| IOT120 |	So is that something that you guys can
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:02,848	| IOT120 |	Can do or that
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:04,640	| IOT120 |	Maybe you're not doing today but might
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:05,152	| IOT120 |	Do some other time
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:07,712	| IOT120 |	Cuz I'm not something you do just yet
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:10,016	| IOT120 |	But that's absolutely in scope
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:11,296	| IOT120 |	The kinds of problems
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:12,576	| IOT120 |	We're interested in solid
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:15,392	| IOT120 |	Will basically be guided by what
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:17,440	| IOT120 |	What are customers asked for
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:21,536	| IOT120 |	And we'll stick with other opportunities for a minute
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:22,048	| IOT120 |	Come back to the home
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:24,096	| IOT120 |	There's also a really interesting
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:26,144	| IOT120 |	Location with things like
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:27,424	| IOT120 |	Oh tracking
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:29,472	| IOT120 |	Because it understands relationships
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:29,984	| IOT120 |	Space
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:34,592	| IOT120 |	Tracking packages or maybe offering better ways to load trucks and that's what
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:36,384	| IOT120 |	So are you Siri
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:41,248	| IOT120 |	You said commercial or small business interest but are you seeing interest or could this be applied
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:42,272	| IOT120 |	Really Broad
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:43,808	| IOT120 |	Or are there other
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:44,320	| IOT120 |	But he's doing it
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:51,744	| IOT120 |	This kind of interactive assistance were reduced you tell it what you care about that you make a request of it
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:55,072	| IOT120 |	Admit it take some action on your behalf or circuses some data for you
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:57,888	| IOT120 |	As far as we know nobody else is doing this
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:38:03,008	| IOT120 |	The closest comparable here is something like Alexa or one of the other Home assistants better
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:04,288	| IOT120 |	Speaker Bass
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:06,336	| IOT120 |	They're extraordinarily good for playing music
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:10,944	| IOT120 |	And a few other things like asking factual sorts of questions about the world you know what is the nest
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:18,368	| IOT120 |	Subway this kind of
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:19,648	| IOT120 |	Like interactive assistant
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:22,208	| IOT120 |	And let's go to your business model
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:25,536	| IOT120 |	Because it's it's a little bit interesting so the camera itself
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,560	| IOT120 |	That cost except
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:29,888	| IOT120 |	And then there's also a service fee associated
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:30,656	| IOT120 |	Set monthly
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:31,424	| IOT120 |	Yearly
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:34,240	| IOT120 |	We are about sanya mentally we are in AI
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:38,080	| IOT120 |	We have to build Hardware to get there that Hardware component is essential but
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:39,616	| IOT120 |	But really what we are providing
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:40,896	| IOT120 |	Is this this amazing
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:46,528	| IOT120 |	So that the hardware is $299 and then it's $10 a month or $100 a year
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:48,064	| IOT120 |	Fournier service
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:52,160	| IOT120 |	Okay and everything goes to the cloud which some people get a little freaked out about
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:53,440	| IOT120 |	So let's talk about your security
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:56,000	| IOT120 |	So we understand that
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:39:00,352	| IOT120 |	Nail trust is essential to this product

EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:06,752	| IOT120 |	Security across the board so for example every connection between the device
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:08,800	| IOT120 |	And your phone in the back end
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:10,080	| IOT120 |	Stop those are all encrypted
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:12,384	| IOT120 |	With industry-leading techniques

EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:22,368	| IOT120 |	Is awesome cryptographically secure
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:27,232	| IOT120 |	So like that software running on there has to be signed by our product key for a cat run
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:28,512	| IOT120 |	Angle do things like
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:30,304	| IOT120 |	Shutdown Bluetooth connection
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:31,840	| IOT120 |	When they're not needed
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:33,888	| IOT120 |	It's like that's what that's not leave that open
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:40,032	| IOT120 |	As a channel to be tested by people with malicious intent
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:43,872	| IOT120 |	That has been a recent
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:46,176	| IOT120 |	A recent hack two people have been exploding
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:48,736	| IOT120 |	Separate
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:50,528	| IOT120 |	How do you help users
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:54,880	| IOT120 |	Because some of this is things like password so I'm curious how you helped users
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:56,160	| IOT120 |	Perhaps
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:57,184	| IOT120 |	Be better
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:40:00,512	| IOT120 |	At security and force them to do things better a little bit
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:01,792	| IOT120 |	More rigorous didn't
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:04,096	| IOT120 |	The hell yes
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:07,168	| IOT120 |	I'm glad you asked that actually it is another explicit thing we do there
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:08,704	| IOT120 |	It's a technique of key stretching
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:10,496	| IOT120 |	Login time
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:16,896	| IOT120 |	We're not just sending your username and password over the the encrypted Channel where we're actually running York
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:17,664	| IOT120 |	Password
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:21,760	| IOT120 |	Through essentially inexpensive hash function that many many times
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:22,784	| IOT120 |	There's a lot of
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:25,344	| IOT120 |	Computer work that your phone has to do that login time
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:30,720	| IOT120 |	And so what does. It is not something you can circumvent you like you have to
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:33,536	| IOT120 |	Do that Taki station if you want to to login
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:37,120	| IOT120 |	So for a regular user login you don't really notice anything
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:43,008	| IOT120 |	That delay and that's just like this normally just ask Fades into the background of everything else
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:49,408	| IOT120 |	What's happening but if you if you were to try oh I want to run 10,000 random passwords in like see if I can get into your account
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:50,688	| IOT120 |	Especially Yours
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,968	| IOT120 |	Weak passwords
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:53,504	| IOT120 |	That are commonly used
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:57,088	| IOT120 |	That would be very hard. It would take a lot of computational effort
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:59,904	| IOT120 |	Essentially makes your password login
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:03,488	| IOT120 |	Significantly more secure
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:06,048	| IOT120 |	Pacific star that's pbkdf2
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:08,096	| IOT120 |	For people who are so inclined
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:11,424	| IOT120 |	Right on
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:13,728	| IOT120 |	Peanut butter jelly
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:14,752	| IOT120 |	3 +
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:16,032	| IOT120 |	K peanut butter and
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:20,128	| IOT120 |	Crafts
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:21,664	| IOT120 |	Okay
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:22,688	| IOT120 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:29,088	| IOT120 |	The fun stuff here so we're going to we're going to continue on our nerdy journey into
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:31,136	| IOT120 |	3D sensors because I love
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:31,904	| IOT120 |	I love new sensors
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:34,208	| IOT120 |	Genuinely
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:36,000	| IOT120 |	On the lookout for them because
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:39,584	| IOT120 |	Every time you add a new sensor you add a new capability
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:41,120	| IOT120 |	To basically the Internet of Things
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:43,168	| IOT120 |	And this is a monster
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:44,704	| IOT120 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:45,728	| IOT120 |	Computer vision
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:47,520	| IOT120 |	So let's talk about
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:49,056	| IOT120 |	The trade-offs here
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:53,663	| IOT120 |	You guys had your specifically designed the optical piece for the sensor
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:56,223	| IOT120 |	Where is design for you it's custom
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:58,783	| IOT120 |	So what is the sensor made of and what are sky
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:42:01,855	| IOT120 |	What is it actually measuring and how should I think about the pros and cons
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:03,135	| IOT120 |	Ascensor
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:05,951	| IOT120 |	It is custom objects in a custom objects module for us
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:09,791	| IOT120 |	And the general principle here is that it's a time of flight camera
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:12,095	| IOT120 |	That's one of several different types of 3D sensors
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:17,727	| IOT120 |	Roughly speaking at a high-level what's happening is we're sending out modulated lights
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:18,751	| IOT120 |	Is it the environment
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:21,311	| IOT120 |	So you can think of that as just like it's turning on and off
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:21,823	| IOT120 |	Very rapid
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:24,383	| IOT120 |	And then we look at
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:28,991	| IOT120 |	Basically how long it takes for that to come back and the fact that it modulated lets you measure that
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:31,039	| IOT120 |	In a fairly cost-effective way
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:34,111	| IOT120 |	Essentially looking for a spaceships between
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:35,135	| IOT120 |	The output signal
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:38,207	| IOT120 |	A reference signal and The Returned
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:45,119	| IOT120 |	Did you know when you sent the dogs and you can say alright in the analog circuitry here like figure out you know how much are these two signals
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:45,887	| IOT120 |	Overlapping
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:49,983	| IOT120 |	And then that tells you how long it actually took for it to go out and come back
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:51,263	| IOT120 |	And then you know how far away are
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:53,823	| IOT120 |	Hey does this reverie Point Indiana
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:56,639	| IOT120 |	So this is kind of like sonar
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:59,455	| IOT120 |	You can think of it a little bit like sonar
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:42:59,967	| IOT120 |	But with lights
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:03,039	| IOT120 |	But it's a particularly clever
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:05,087	| IOT120 |	Way of stuff measuring just
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:07,903	| IOT120 |	Soap with someone you're typically
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:11,743	| IOT120 |	Actually just measuring your like starting a stopwatch and then stopping the stopwatch
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:16,607	| IOT120 |	To to measure how long something goes out how long something takes for the signal to go out and come back
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:19,935	| IOT120 |	But with this it's not just like start the stopwatch and then stopped
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:20,447	| IOT120 |	The stopwatch
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:27,359	| IOT120 |	Because light goes so quickly would be on the order of ghetto nanoseconds that you have to measure and you can do that but
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:27,871	| IOT120 |	It's pretty expensive
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:32,735	| IOT120 |	Actually the kind of sensor that is used on self-driving cars
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:35,039	| IOT120 |	Is that Google actually just measure
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:38,623	| IOT120 |	Directly that amount of time with essentially the stopwatch method
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:40,671	| IOT120 |	And that's all
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:44,255	| IOT120 |	That's also based on
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:45,023	| IOT120 |	Collimated
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:46,303	| IOT120 |	Lazarbeam
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:47,583	| IOT120 |	Going out to the environment
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:49,119	| IOT120 |	We coming back where this is diffusely
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:52,447	| IOT120 |	Instead of the stopwatch method
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:53,215	| IOT120 |	It's more like
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:56,287	| IOT120 |	Look at how much these two different signals overlap
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:58,079	| IOT120 |	That if they overlap a lot
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:44:02,943	| IOT120 |	That it didn't take very much time for the signal to go out and come back and they overlap just a little bit
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:04,991	| IOT120 |	That must have taken a long time for
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:07,807	| IOT120 |	This is awesome so
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:09,855	| IOT120 |	Your camera is is somewhat expense
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:14,207	| IOT120 |	I mean it's not like break the bank expensive but it's definitely up there in the
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:15,231	| IOT120 |	The IP camera work
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:16,255	| IOT120 |	I know it's smarter
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:19,071	| IOT120 |	But how much of that like how expensive
EDL	00:44:19,071	00:44:19,839	| IOT120 |	Are the sensor
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:21,119	| IOT120 |	Can I stick this in
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:23,423	| IOT120 |	Just listen by how much they are
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:24,447	| IOT120 |	Because that's going to dictate
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:24,959	| IOT120 |	What I can use them
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:30,591	| IOT120 |	It's fair to say they are more expensive than a traditional camera there is more going on
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:36,991	| IOT120 |	But they're not prohibitively expensive like it is possible for us to sell things at 299
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:38,015	| IOT120 |	How do you say
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:38,783	| IOT120 |	A wonderful
EDL	00:44:39,551	00:44:41,087	| IOT120 |	But we had to work very hard
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:42,879	| IOT120 |	To get it to that price
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:43,647	| IOT120 |	There's no question
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:45,951	| IOT120 |	And what about power consumption
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:47,743	| IOT120 |	Is this a giant powerhawk
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:50,815	| IOT120 |	It's not a joint but it's not something
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:51,839	| IOT120 |	You would tell her with that
EDL	00:44:52,351	00:44:56,959	| IOT120 |	All right we talked about consumer use we talked about crazy ideas for business
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:44:59,263	| IOT120 |	And this is actually what you guys are filters
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:01,823	| IOT120 |	One part of an entire category
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:03,103	| IOT120 |	A 3D sensing
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:04,127	| IOT120 |	So
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:06,175	| IOT120 |	What else is there in the
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:08,479	| IOT120 |	So we got a timer
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:14,367	| IOT120 |	Cancer and two particular other options there for 3D sensing include structured lights and Laser Rangefinder
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:16,159	| IOT120 |	Into a structured light system
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:18,719	| IOT120 |	What that's doing is it sending out
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:20,511	| IOT120 |	A particular pattern
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:23,327	| IOT120 |	The flight into the environment and then there's a camera
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:24,863	| IOT120 |	That's looking at that pattern
EDL	00:45:24,863	00:45:27,679	| IOT120 |	Typically that turns an infrared so human eyes don't see it
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:30,495	| IOT120 |	But this camera infrared so it seems that pattern
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:32,031	| IOT120 |	Triangulate
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:34,847	| IOT120 |	And so that is actually just like using
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:40,991	| IOT120 |	Middle School trigonometry to say hey this piece of the pattern I see it at this pixel
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:45,343	| IOT120 |	And I know that I sent it out of this part of the projector
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:47,647	| IOT120 |	And so I can just like see where those two lines meet
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:50,975	| IOT120 |	And that's how far away that point is
EDL	00:45:51,487	00:45:55,327	| IOT120 |	And that's the technique that was used in the original Microsoft Kinect
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:57,119	| IOT120 |	That was from a company called primesense
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:45:58,399	| IOT120 |	Way back when
EDL	00:45:58,911	00:46:00,447	| IOT120 |	Connect cameras very good
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:02,239	| IOT120 |	I just sawed scanning dinosaur bones
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:05,567	| IOT120 |	Yep that was maybe the
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:09,151	| IOT120 |	What was one of the first Billy successful uses of Guthrie Center
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:15,295	| IOT120 |	And maybe the first year particularly notable example was in self-driving car aspect back in the DARPA challenge
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:17,343	| IOT120 |	So that's where the other
EDL	00:46:17,343	00:46:18,111	| IOT120 |	That last
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:21,183	| IOT120 |	3D sensing I mentioned really comes into the Laser Rangefinder
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:24,767	| IOT120 |	Where they're sending out individual collimated
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:25,535	| IOT120 |	Lazarbeam
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:27,071	| IOT120 |	Out into the environment
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:28,351	| IOT120 |	And indirectly measuring
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:30,399	| IOT120 |	How many nanoseconds have passed
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:31,935	| IOT120 |	Before that that beam of light
EDL	00:46:31,935	00:46:32,703	| IOT120 |	Comes back
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:38,079	| IOT120 |	Anatomically do that with approximately no 64 or 32 beams all at the same time
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:40,383	| IOT120 |	Laser rangefinders lidar systems
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:41,407	| IOT120 |	They have the longest range
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:42,943	| IOT120 |	By a wide margin
EDL	00:46:43,455	00:46:46,527	| IOT120 |	And they're really really good for outdoor use
EDL	00:46:46,527	00:46:49,087	| IOT120 |	Really really good for for self-driving cars
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:49,599	| IOT120 |	In particular
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:51,391	| IOT120 |	Ton of money
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:52,415	| IOT120 |	They are very expensive
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:54,207	| IOT120 |	AR
EDL	00:46:54,719	00:46:55,743	| IOT120 |	Stella moving parts
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:06,751	| IOT120 |	I didn't like those mechanical parts
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:08,287	| IOT120 |	Those are police
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:11,103	| IOT120 |	Is not very good
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:11,615	| IOT120 |	Fortnite
EDL	00:47:12,127	00:47:13,407	| IOT120 |	What exactly why we don't use it
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:14,943	| IOT120 |	Where's the time of flight camera
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:16,479	| IOT120 |	Is really great for night vision
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:18,015	| IOT120 |	That is very good on the cost
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:21,087	| IOT120 |	Cytosine substantially better than lidar systems
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:22,367	| IOT120 |	Is a little less good
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:23,903	| IOT120 |	For something like
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:25,439	| IOT120 |	Simultaneous localization and mapping
EDL	00:47:33,119	00:47:33,631	| IOT120 |	Backup
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:36,191	| IOT120 |	Simultaneous something something in math
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:37,471	| IOT120 |	Location of mapping
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:39,775	| IOT120 |	Is that just knowing where I am now showing up on a
EDL	00:47:41,055	00:47:42,335	| IOT120 |	That is building a map
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:44,383	| IOT120 |	And knowing where you are at the same time
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:45,919	| IOT120 |	I'm terrible at that as a person
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:47,455	| IOT120 |	Okay so
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:49,759	| IOT120 |	China flight centers are also bad at that
EDL	00:47:50,271	00:47:53,855	| IOT120 |	Good that's bad at it per say they're just a little bit less good
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:55,135	| IOT120 |	Because they tend to be
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:55,647	| IOT120 |	Slightly less
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:48:01,279	| IOT120 |	Metrically accurate the exact distances that they measure or a little bit less good
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:04,351	| IOT120 |	Then something like a structured light system or or laser range
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:08,191	| IOT120 |	For the kind of application Lighthouse uses it for its purpose
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:12,799	| IOT120 |	Because now it gives us great night vision gives us a really good cost performance
EDL	00:48:12,799	00:48:18,175	| IOT120 |	And we're not actually moving around in the environment trying to build up a map where sitting stationary
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:22,015	| IOT120 |	In the corner of your room trying to understand is that your kid is that your dog what it what is happening
EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:24,831	| IOT120 |	Got it so I won't put it on a Roomba
EDL	00:48:24,831	00:48:28,415	| IOT120 |	Exactly exciting possible
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:28,927	| IOT120 |	News
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:30,207	| IOT120 |	USA Auto
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:34,559	| IOT120 |	Caveat the heck out of this then the next generation iPhone
EDL	00:48:35,839	00:48:37,375	| IOT120 |	Have 3D
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:40,191	| IOT120 |	Sensing and it to recognize people's faces as part of their
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:40,959	| IOT120 |	Your password
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:43,007	| IOT120 |	So since you're an expert on
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:43,775	| IOT120 |	3D sensing
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:45,311	| IOT120 |	I figured I'd ask you about that
EDL	00:48:45,311	00:48:45,823	| IOT120 |	Like I said
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:47,871	| IOT120 |	Decent use case what
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:49,919	| IOT120 |	That's in a battery powered device
EDL	00:48:49,919	00:48:51,711	| IOT120 |	I feel like there's a lot of constraints
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:53,247	| IOT120 |	Possibilities here what do you think
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:48:55,551	| IOT120 |	Totally
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:57,599	| IOT120 |	Answer for my battery point of view
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:49:02,207	| IOT120 |	That's totally fine because they're only running it once in a rare while when you go to unlock
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:03,487	| IOT120 |	You're screening rightly
EDL	00:49:03,487	00:49:04,511	| IOT120 |	Now you're basically
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:10,399	| IOT120 |	Obviously had no like actual inside information about what's happening there in like I'm only speculating here but like if I were using it
EDL	00:49:10,399	00:49:11,679	| IOT120 |	I would only be like
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:14,495	| IOT120 |	Running at that Center once in a while
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:16,543	| IOT120 |	Battery usage point of view
EDL	00:49:16,543	00:49:17,311	| IOT120 |	Not that big a deal
EDL	00:49:19,103	00:49:23,967	| IOT120 |	Probably only run that when the accelerometer says Hey the phone is moving like somebody just pick me up
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:28,319	| IOT120 |	Okay run the three sensor once every seconds or something rather than 30 frames
EDL	00:49:29,087	00:49:30,623	| IOT120 |	So I can actually
EDL	00:49:30,623	00:49:31,903	| IOT120 |	Add some crazy knowledge to
EDL	00:49:32,671	00:49:33,695	| IOT120 |	Cuz I
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:35,743	| IOT120 |	Technology that Qualcomm is built
EDL	00:49:36,255	00:49:37,023	| IOT120 |	It is a
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:41,119	| IOT120 |	Tiny little sensor on a chip that's basically can Detective
EDL	00:49:41,631	00:49:42,143	| IOT120 |	Face
EDL	00:49:42,655	00:49:44,447	| IOT120 |	What's computer vision Auto module
EDL	00:49:45,215	00:49:47,263	| IOT120 |	Did Reds it sub to milliwatts
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:51,615	| IOT120 |	Power so. Is low power consumption in all it's going to do is
EDL	00:49:51,615	00:49:52,127	| IOT120 |	Hey
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:53,919	| IOT120 |	A person is looking directly at me
EDL	00:49:54,431	00:49:55,967	| IOT120 |	And then it's going to say
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:57,247	| IOT120 |	Wake up good sensor
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:49:58,527	| IOT120 |	Now measure the face
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:02,879	| IOT120 |	So perfect
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:03,391	| IOT120 |	The right thing to do
EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:08,767	| IOT120 |	If you were to hold a printed out
EDL	00:50:08,767	00:50:10,047	| IOT120 |	No paper like
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:14,143	| IOT120 |	Somebody's face you have a picture of it you held it in front of the camera like that one would say hey I see a face
EDL	00:50:14,655	00:50:16,191	| IOT120 |	Nf3 sensor turns on
EDL	00:50:16,191	00:50:19,007	| IOT120 |	Edit measures it and it says this looks awfully slaps
EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:20,287	| IOT120 |	I think I will not unlock this
EDL	00:50:21,055	00:50:21,567	| IOT120 |	Yes
EDL	00:50:22,335	00:50:23,615	| IOT120 |	Very cool
EDL	00:50:23,615	00:50:24,383	| IOT120 |	Okay
EDL	00:50:24,383	00:50:25,407	| IOT120 |	So in this case
EDL	00:50:26,175	00:50:27,711	| IOT120 |	It's not waking up very long so we
EDL	00:50:27,711	00:50:28,479	| IOT120 |	Worry less about battery
EDL	00:50:29,759	00:50:30,527	| IOT120 |	It is tracking
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:33,343	| IOT120 |	Presumably we all have different depths
EDL	00:50:34,623	00:50:35,647	| IOT120 |	From our nose and
EDL	00:50:35,647	00:50:36,927	| IOT120 |	Is that what
EDL	00:50:36,927	00:50:37,439	| IOT120 |	It's measuring
EDL	00:50:37,951	00:50:39,487	| IOT120 |	It would also be measuring that
EDL	00:50:39,487	00:50:42,815	| IOT120 |	Very likely and at that range you would probably get
EDL	00:50:42,815	00:50:46,911	| IOT120 |	Depending on the details of their sensor you would probably get pretty good structural information
EDL	00:50:46,911	00:50:47,935	| IOT120 |	About that person's face
EDL	00:50:48,447	00:50:54,847	| IOT120 |	And I know you could use like nice that wanted to work with my sunglasses are on and I kind of things they like you wouldn't be able to use ever
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:50:56,895	| IOT120 |	Everything about it you're different hairstyles
EDL	00:50:56,895	00:50:57,407	| IOT120 |	Could using their
EDL	00:50:57,919	00:50:59,967	| IOT120 |	But you could certainly look at like
EDL	00:50:59,967	00:51:04,575	| IOT120 |	Yeah what is the distance of like the tip of the nose to like the tip of the chin there's something like that
EDL	00:51:04,575	00:51:05,855	| IOT120 |	That kind of technique
EDL	00:51:05,855	00:51:10,975	| IOT120 |	An analog about technique has been used in pure computer vision likes color cameras only actually for sometime
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:11,999	| IOT120 |	Is very effective
EDL	00:51:11,999	00:51:15,327	| IOT120 |	And I would imagine that kind of thing in 3D sensing would also be very attacked
EDL	00:51:15,839	00:51:18,399	| IOT120 |	Oh my gosh this is so funny so what if I like
EDL	00:51:18,911	00:51:20,447	| IOT120 |	Because I v i broken my nose
EDL	00:51:20,959	00:51:23,519	| IOT120 |	So then I'm like I would have stopped working if I have a plaster on my nose
EDL	00:51:24,543	00:51:28,127	| IOT120 |	That you'll just have to try to find out
EDL	00:51:28,639	00:51:30,687	| IOT120 |	Or plastic surgery I would have to retrain it
EDL	00:51:33,247	00:51:34,783	| IOT120 |	Can you imagine lights
EDL	00:51:36,319	00:51:39,647	| IOT120 |	Alex you have taught me a lot I love I love
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:40,415	| IOT120 |	Loved
EDL	00:51:40,415	00:51:41,951	| IOT120 |	Having you on the show so thank you so much
EDL	00:51:43,231	00:51:45,023	| IOT120 |	Hey thanks for having me as has been released on
