EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:26,528	| IOT069 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:27,808	| IOT069 |	So
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:28,576	| IOT069 |	Thanks idly
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:30,624	| IOT069 |	Let's get started with
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:32,416	| IOT069 |	One more reminder turn off your Echo Bike
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:35,232	| IOT069 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:36,768	| IOT069 |	Big news of the week
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:37,536	| IOT069 |	Which is
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:40,864	| IOT069 |	I don't know there's not a lot of big news for this week but we'll talk about the thread
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:42,400	| IOT069 |	Because
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:45,216	| IOT069 |	Keeping up with the osc
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:49,312	| IOT069 |	And basically this is like standards alphabet standards
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:55,968	| IOT069 |	Red is the protocol it's a wireless protocol that kind of competes with Bluetooth or Wi-Fi that was
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:57,248	| IOT069 |	Secreted by nest
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,272	| IOT069 |	Silicon labs
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,040	| IOT069 |	Freescale
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:00,576	| IOT069 |	Big
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:01,344	| IOT069 |	Crossword
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:02,624	| IOT069 |	Fans
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,648	| IOT069 |	Couple other company
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:06,464	| IOT069 |	What it's done is it
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,488	| IOT069 |	Low power
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:09,280	| IOT069 |	Mesh networking standard
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:14,144	| IOT069 |	It is also IPv6 compatible which means your sensors can talk directly to the public internet
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:17,216	| IOT069 |	Is it 8:00 or 2:15
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:21,824	| IOT069 |	Yeah
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:23,104	| IOT069 |	That's the same
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:24,128	| IOT069 |	Radio
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:24,896	| IOT069 |	Zigbee
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:25,920	| IOT069 |	Protocol uses
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,968	| IOT069 |	Sew-ins
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:28,736	| IOT069 |	Together on backwards
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:32,832	| IOT069 |	That's
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,600	| IOT069 |	There
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:34,368	| IOT069 |	Indeed
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,136	| IOT069 |	Ocf
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,416	| IOT069 |	Brushes
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,720	| IOT069 |	Formerly the open connectivity Foundation
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:40,000	| IOT069 |	Which is formerly
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:42,304	| IOT069 |	Known as IO tivity
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:44,864	| IOT069 |	This was a standard group that Intel kind of pulled together
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:49,216	| IOT069 |	To act as a communication to Discovery platform so
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:51,776	| IOT069 |	But if something's in your house and talking to another thing
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:53,056	| IOT069 |	If you like high
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:55,872	| IOT069 |	This is what can talk to me and how it talks
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,408	| IOT069 |	And what it can do
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,968	| IOT069 |	I'm in somebody else would be like I refrigerator
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:02,272	| IOT069 |	I can accept the following commands to do the following things
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:04,064	| IOT069 |	And it's this was a really
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:06,368	| IOT069 |	Cool idea focused on kind of interoperability
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,672	| IOT069 |	And it
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:09,696	| IOT069 |	Peter with all join
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,744	| IOT069 |	Which was the Qualcomm standard
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:12,256	| IOT069 |	Same thing
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,584	| IOT069 |	Qualcomm people ended up going over to
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,096	| IOT069 |	Intel
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,632	| IOT069 |	And
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,400	| IOT069 |	Then
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,424	| IOT069 |	Eocf
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:20,704	| IOT069 |	Was created
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:21,728	| IOT069 |	Kind of
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,776	| IOT069 |	Pull all that in together
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,312	| IOT069 |	So
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:27,872	| IOT069 |	Qualcomm now back thread
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,640	| IOT069 |	If I'm not mistaken
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,688	| IOT069 |	Alcatraz facts
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:34,016	| IOT069 |	Grouping
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:36,320	| IOT069 |	A large hamper company
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:42,208	| IOT069 |	Is Communications protocols or like
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:43,488	| IOT069 |	This is the radio
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:44,768	| IOT069 |	Blair
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:45,536	| IOT069 |	Ocf
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,048	| IOT069 |	UC application
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:47,840	| IOT069 |	Is that make sense
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:52,192	| IOT069 |	So just like you said the application Level with
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:57,824	| IOT069 |	These are the things I can do my device will tell or expose what it can do what commands what functions
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:00,640	| IOT069 |	And the radio level is where all the communication habits that make sense
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:04,736	| IOT069 |	Now there is no timing on their service
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,504	| IOT069 |	Medication and
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,296	| IOT069 |	That's kind of
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,600	| IOT069 |	Frustrating
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:13,440	| IOT069 |	That if you have a device that will be thread certified at some point in the
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,208	| IOT069 |	Unknown feature
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,791	| IOT069 |	CF
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:18,815	| IOT069 |	Certified
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:20,351	| IOT069 |	Those two things
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,423	| IOT069 |	In the summertime
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:27,263	| IOT069 |	So that's the idea
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,031	| IOT069 |	That's the fun
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:29,311	| IOT069 |	That's the new
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:33,407	| IOT069 |	I don't know what else to
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:34,943	| IOT069 |	To say because right now until we actually see
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,991	| IOT069 |	This could be something
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,271	| IOT069 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:39,807	| IOT069 |	It's good for the
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:46,207	| IOT069 |	Industry as a whole because it does mean that all that standard soup we were talking about you know two years ago
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,999	| IOT069 |	Even last year even last week
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:50,559	| IOT069 |	Sorted out
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:58,239	| IOT069 |	That's the Hope every see these kinds of announcements all the time we seen them for years with wireless charging standard and then you saw consolidate
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,519	| IOT069 |	Weixin overtime between different
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:02,335	| IOT069 |	Groups different companies different Technologies and approaches
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:04,127	| IOT069 |	You're starting to see some
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:09,247	| IOT069 |	Of that in IRT and it's super important because you need interoperability otherwise you've got this
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:12,831	| IOT069 |	Fragmented mess of products and standards and radios and
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,599	| IOT069 |	Cubs that just
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:14,879	| IOT069 |	Add devices
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:18,719	| IOT069 |	Promise the world but they're little silos and we don't want that
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:27,423	| IOT069 |	For people who cuz I asked them about what happens with a joint
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,727	| IOT069 |	Because a lot of people actually implemented
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,543	| IOT069 |	I was told
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,591	| IOT069 |	Microsoft is going to be
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:37,663	| IOT069 |	Ensuring interoperability between
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:38,687	| IOT069 |	The ocf
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,455	| IOT069 |	In all joints
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,271	| IOT069 |	So they're in the process of doing that
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:45,087	| IOT069 |	For Windows and some other members are trying to
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,111	| IOT069 |	To do the same thing
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,391	| IOT069 |	For other platform
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,695	| IOT069 |	There's no timing on that
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:50,719	| IOT069 |	But
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,023	| IOT069 |	That's really good news
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:54,559	| IOT069 |	If you were like an alternate doctor
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:56,095	| IOT069 |	Because I'll join with super easy just
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,959	| IOT069 |	Could share what it did
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:05,567	| IOT069 |	Still emerging
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,359	| IOT069 |	And
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,383	| IOT069 |	Don't lose hope
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:12,223	| IOT069 |	Bet on that
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,503	| IOT069 |	But
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,015	| IOT069 |	Honey
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,295	| IOT069 |	Baby
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:15,807	| IOT069 |	Lose a little hope
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:18,623	| IOT069 |	Smart bulb vulnerability
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:24,767	| IOT069 |	We should we should have a night this caught my eye because I have three osram bulbs in my house
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:27,327	| IOT069 |	Houston with my wing coven
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:28,607	| IOT069 |	They work really well
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,655	| IOT069 |	However
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,959	| IOT069 |	It wasn't me make sure I get this right
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:34,495	| IOT069 |	Rapid7
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:38,335	| IOT069 |	Came out with a vulnerability report and found
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,383	| IOT069 |	9 different
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:43,711	| IOT069 |	Vulnerabilities with the osram Sylvania
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:45,247	| IOT069 |	Lightify bulbs now
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:45,759	| IOT069 |	Some of them
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:50,879	| IOT069 |	Four of them have to deal with the home platform which is what I use and five of them
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:55,231	| IOT069 |	Deal with the pro platform which actually did not know there was a profile for nothing
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,511	| IOT069 |	I'm going to use it
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,303	| IOT069 |	I just thought that was kind of interesting
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,327	| IOT069 |	Some of these
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,863	| IOT069 |	Items have been fixed
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:05,727	| IOT069 |	It's already some of them have not and there's no indication of if or when they will be
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:09,567	| IOT069 |	But one of the ones going to keep once that was fixed
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:11,359	| IOT069 |	Is that the
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:13,151	| IOT069 |	The osram python restoring your
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,943	| IOT069 |	Home network
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:18,015	| IOT069 |	SSID or network name as well as your
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:20,575	| IOT069 |	Passcode to get into the network
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:24,671	| IOT069 |	In plain clear text and that's yeah
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:25,183	| IOT069 |	Security 101
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:29,535	| IOT069 |	I know it's just it's just I'll say inexcusable
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:31,071	| IOT069 |	This point really is
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,351	| IOT069 |	Yasso
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:35,167	| IOT069 |	There's some other other issues
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:39,263	| IOT069 |	Persistent xss in the web Management console
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:43,871	| IOT069 |	Of the pro side and that's why I didn't see this myself cuz I don't login to control
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:48,735	| IOT069 |	My osram bulbs on a website but apparently with the pro platform you either can or you to
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:50,271	| IOT069 |	So there was some cross
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,295	| IOT069 |	Scripting
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:53,343	| IOT069 |	Issues there that could inject
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:55,391	| IOT069 |	Malicious JavaScript in
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:57,695	| IOT069 |	Best way take control of things through the browser
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:00,255	| IOT069 |	Since again I use an app
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:04,095	| IOT069 |	Don't have that concern but still it's that the problem that one was fixed as well so
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:10,751	| IOT069 |	We should put a link in the show notes of the vulnerability so if you can keep track of them cuz I know that there's not just home users of osram
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:14,335	| IOT069 |	Wake me up probably some Pro users as well so
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,175	| IOT069 |	I shall make it happen
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:24,575	| IOT069 |	All right. Speaking of security vulnerabilities there is a lovely story on motherboard by Bruce
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,671	| IOT069 |	Shania
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:30,975	| IOT069 |	Spire
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,279	| IOT069 |	There's no d
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,607	| IOT069 |	Gyros
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,167	| IOT069 |	Who wrote David and Goliath
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:41,727	| IOT069 |	Excellent book if you haven't read it
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,495	| IOT069 |	Aurigny
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,263	| IOT069 |	Care about security
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:49,919	| IOT069 |	His story he talked about basically the vulnerabilities that the internet of things is going to
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,455	| IOT069 |	Kind of Usher end
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:54,527	| IOT069 |	And it's not like we don't know a lot of this stuff
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:58,111	| IOT069 |	But he makes a huge prediction in the story which is the next
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:58,879	| IOT069 |	President
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:03,487	| IOT069 |	Will probably be forced to deal with a large-scale internet
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,815	| IOT069 |	And I was like
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,863	| IOT069 |	That's a pretty big prediction.
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:11,679	| IOT069 |	Some of the things that he's saying that are actually worth
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,447	| IOT069 |	Worthwhile
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:15,007	| IOT069 |	Are that the government needs to play a larger role in iot
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:16,799	| IOT069 |	She want some
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,567	| IOT069 |	Standards
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,359	| IOT069 |	This is kind of working on this
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,383	| IOT069 |	For other aspects
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:24,735	| IOT069 |	The internet so it doesn't it it makes sense that this would do this for the Internet of Things
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,295	| IOT069 |	Policing
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,063	| IOT069 |	Compliance switch
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,647	| IOT069 |	Could be
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:34,207	| IOT069 |	I don't know what other agency might get involved there I mean if it's
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:38,815	| IOT069 |	If it's infrastructure you can even see like the. Or any of the agencies
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:39,583	| IOT069 |	Responsible
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:45,727	| IOT069 |	I don't want to agree with him but I sort of 2in that his his prediction of Doom and Gloom
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,775	| IOT069 |	Is a likely scenario
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:51,615	| IOT069 |	I mean it's one thing when we are getting hacked for digital
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,663	| IOT069 |	Information photos
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,479	| IOT069 |	It's a totally different
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:58,015	| IOT069 |	Situation when
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,039	| IOT069 |	Physical thing
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,343	| IOT069 |	Better controls
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:01,855	| IOT069 |	Via
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,135	| IOT069 |	What you say
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:04,415	| IOT069 |	Iot or the internet
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:05,695	| IOT069 |	It could be
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:09,279	| IOT069 |	Taking over or causes death destruction and such a man
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:14,655	| IOT069 |	It's concerning and I think he I think he's right again I don't want to agree with him but I do
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,191	| IOT069 |	I don't want to see this app
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,983	| IOT069 |	It's true in a lot of
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:22,847	| IOT069 |	Companies are really like a lot of the big name companies are very focused on his but when we say things like
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,663	| IOT069 |	The awesome stuff you're like really guys
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,991	| IOT069 |	That's not acceptable so
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:31,295	| IOT069 |	Let's just light bulbs in a lightbulb
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,575	| IOT069 |	Probably isn't going to
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:34,623	| IOT069 |	I mean I guess you could
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:37,951	| IOT069 |	Make it go out possibly make something explode I don't really know
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,743	| IOT069 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:40,511	| IOT069 |	Chances are
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:44,607	| IOT069 |	The light bulb itself isn't going to hurt anything but as we seen through the
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,911	| IOT069 |	Security vulnerabilities we just talked about
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:50,239	| IOT069 |	Somebody could've been getting network access and then have access to
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:53,055	| IOT069 |	Other things that could cause destruction in your networks so
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:56,639	| IOT069 |	It's really to me that's just like I ate a front door
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:58,431	| IOT069 |	Into a bigger problem
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:58,943	| IOT069 |	Yes
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:03,039	| IOT069 |	And he does some lovely math here if 100 systems are all interact
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,599	| IOT069 |	Each other that's about 5000 interactions
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:06,367	| IOT069 |	5000
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,391	| IOT069 |	Potential vulnerabilities
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:08,415	| IOT069 |	Resulting for
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,951	| IOT069 |	Interactions
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:11,231	| IOT069 |	300 or interact
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:12,511	| IOT069 |	That's forty five
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:17,887	| IOT069 |	I mean it was exponentially because of all the connectivity
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:22,751	| IOT069 |	So he talks about interconnection being a big issue software-controlled being a big issue the software
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:25,311	| IOT069 |	Challenges something we talked about on the show before because
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:27,615	| IOT069 |	They're basically saying
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:31,199	| IOT069 |	Today we rely on patching
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:35,807	| IOT069 |	And kind of continuous support of our OS has to patch our smartphones
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,319	| IOT069 |	Computers
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:37,855	| IOT069 |	But with
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:44,255	| IOT069 |	Devices in the home that are going to be there for 15 or 10 years and have a business model that may not support patching
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:50,655	| IOT069 |	So it's funny that you mention it because as I was reading through hearing and I noticed that
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:56,543	| IOT069 |	I'd like to know what we've already set a very very bad president when it comes to security patches
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,311	| IOT069 |	With
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:59,103	| IOT069 |	What are the most successful devices
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:11:59,871	| IOT069 |	Ever on the planet
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,407	| IOT069 |	Smartphone
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:03,711	| IOT069 |	There are billions of them out there and yet
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:06,271	| IOT069 |	Security always seems to be
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:10,879	| IOT069 |	Talk about but more of an afterthought when it comes to a permutation and especially so
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,671	| IOT069 |	After the sale of the device
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:15,231	| IOT069 |	And that's because the device makers
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:15,743	| IOT069 |	Don't
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,279	| IOT069 |	You know that better
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:19,839	| IOT069 |	Expend resources to pass these things
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:22,143	| IOT069 |	But they're not getting any information revenue from that
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:26,239	| IOT069 |	So it worries me that we've got we've set up a very dangerous trend
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,543	| IOT069 |	With security patches on mobile devices
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:30,079	| IOT069 |	And it's even
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:32,639	| IOT069 |	It's magnified when it comes out of Qi devices I think
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,663	| IOT069 |	It is and
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:36,223	| IOT069 |	That's one of the reasons why I
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,503	| IOT069 |	I'm very interested in
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,271	| IOT069 |	NC nudist
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:40,319	| IOT069 |	Says bottles even though I hate the idea
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,087	| IOT069 |	Description
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,135	| IOT069 |	It may have to be the way to go
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:43,903	| IOT069 |	Go to support
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:49,535	| IOT069 |	Because it's the device makers are going to provide to do so
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:51,327	| IOT069 |	Then your I agree maybe there are
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:53,887	| IOT069 |	Opportunities for companies to do this and
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:56,447	| IOT069 |	Give people peace of mind you're willing to be a subscriber
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:57,727	| IOT069 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:58,495	| IOT069 |	This is why
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:01,055	| IOT069 |	Companies like Comcast see an opportune
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:02,335	| IOT069 |	Trinity and that was my
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:06,431	| IOT069 |	In the IRT is because they're going to be the ones
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:08,735	| IOT069 |	Patching and focusing on
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,295	| IOT069 |	Delivering devices in doing so as a service
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:13,343	| IOT069 |	No matter what we think of Comcast
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:16,159	| IOT069 |	Their Xfinity home business actually
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:20,255	| IOT069 |	They reported earnings this week and as part of that
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:24,607	| IOT069 |	Their revenue in the other category which includes Xfinity home
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:25,887	| IOT069 |	Increased
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:28,703	| IOT069 |	13.7% year-over-year
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:31,519	| IOT069 |	So just 644 million for the quarter
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,871	| IOT069 |	Year-to-date so far that's one point
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:36,895	| IOT069 |	3 billion
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,431	| IOT069 |	So
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:40,479	| IOT069 |	That's not insignificant now
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:44,063	| IOT069 |	The other Revenue also includes advertising
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:45,855	| IOT069 |	And
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:46,879	| IOT069 |	Is it regular
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,951	| IOT069 |	It's hard to say that how much of it
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:52,255	| IOT069 |	Applies to their Xfinity home
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,535	| IOT069 |	Bit but
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,071	| IOT069 |	But I imagine it
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:56,607	| IOT069 |	What you doing
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,119	| IOT069 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,679	| IOT069 |	We'll keep an eye on that
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,959	| IOT069 |	That's on that side
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:05,055	| IOT069 |	So maybe a Services model that has a big player checking security
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:07,615	| IOT069 |	Comcast get security right maybe that's good
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:09,151	| IOT069 |	For the industry overall
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,175	| IOT069 |	I don't know
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:12,991	| IOT069 |	I know people are not probably excited about give
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:18,623	| IOT069 |	No but you know going back to what we were talking about
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:23,999	| IOT069 |	Potential business opportunity for companies to build Security Solutions or patch solutions for IRT
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:25,279	| IOT069 |	I would hope that
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:27,839	| IOT069 |	My $30 a month for Xfinity home
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:31,423	| IOT069 |	I think it's their base price animal can't right now
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,959	| IOT069 |	That they will
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:37,567	| IOT069 |	Take on that role of patching and keeping things secure I'd love to see them actually
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:40,383	| IOT069 |	Run Security reports are scans on your
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,943	| IOT069 |	You're stopping to say hey we got to the secured
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,479	| IOT069 |	And I do that every 6 months
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,527	| IOT069 |	People at peace of mind and you're already paying it
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:47,551	| IOT069 |	A subscription so
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:49,599	| IOT069 |	Implicit to me and I don't know
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:51,135	| IOT069 |	Scriber other service
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:53,183	| IOT069 |	Is that these devices are secured and patched
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:57,279	| IOT069 |	Celeste
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:58,303	| IOT069 |	Artwork
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:14:59,839	| IOT069 |	Because
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,607	| IOT069 |	This was a
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,911	| IOT069 |	Lovely wait for devices that aren't work
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:04,191	| IOT069 |	This ties back
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:04,703	| IOT069 |	Pandora
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:05,727	| IOT069 |	Model 2
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:12,127	| IOT069 |	For a little bit for some customers remote access to the nest actually went out this week
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:13,919	| IOT069 |	I don't know what to say here
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:17,759	| IOT069 |	That's what happened
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,343	| IOT069 |	They went out
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,999	| IOT069 |	Usher
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:30,303	| IOT069 |	Possibly not fed during our outage
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:32,095	| IOT069 |	Lawson schedule
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:34,911	| IOT069 |	So
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:36,191	| IOT069 |	We always talk about having
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:39,519	| IOT069 |	Control a basic functionality on the device
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,799	| IOT069 |	Yes
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:44,639	| IOT069 |	If your nest thermostat in that case it was just remote access
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:46,431	| IOT069 |	Which man if you are away from home and wanted to change
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,479	| IOT069 |	So sorry for you
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:51,807	| IOT069 |	So
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:54,367	| IOT069 |	That's a little more worries
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:57,183	| IOT069 |	What if you're on vacation
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:01,279	| IOT069 |	What's my option for feeding my cat
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:04,095	| IOT069 |	Right right do you happen to know if
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:06,399	| IOT069 |	How long between the outage
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:11,007	| IOT069 |	We're winning out of started how long it took them to contact customers because
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:11,519	| IOT069 |	Do we have cats
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:13,055	| IOT069 |	I'm home all the time
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,871	| IOT069 |	H I know they can go if
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:16,639	| IOT069 |	Worst case
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,175	| IOT069 |	A day without food
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:19,711	| IOT069 |	Yeah I'm hoping that
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:21,503	| IOT069 |	This was a timely response
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:25,343	| IOT069 |	I'm looking to see if there was a time
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,111	| IOT069 |	Timely response
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:28,671	| IOT069 |	Just hoping it wasn't an after-the-fact thing or
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:30,207	| IOT069 |	4 days later by the way
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:33,791	| IOT069 |	By the way your cat may not have been fed this week at all
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,327	| IOT069 |	Hopefully you don't
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,607	| IOT069 |	I don't know what happened in Scituate
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:37,375	| IOT069 |	But
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:40,191	| IOT069 |	What's another word of caution for companies want to be in these spaces
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:42,751	| IOT069 |	They need to make sure they're communicating
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:44,543	| IOT069 |	Quickly with customers when they have issues
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,639	| IOT069 |	I'm not seeing any timing on there now
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:50,431	| IOT069 |	So
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,711	| IOT069 |	What a bummer
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:53,759	| IOT069 |	But this is like $150
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:55,039	| IOT069 |	Peter Katz
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:58,879	| IOT069 |	And I'm looking on their their Twitter account
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:05,535	| IOT069 |	RPI baby they sent out emails to people
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,047	| IOT069 |	Email
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:07,839	| IOT069 |	No idea
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:09,887	| IOT069 |	But
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,679	| IOT069 |	So the point here is
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:13,471	| IOT069 |	When do things go out
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,519	| IOT069 |	This kind of ties back
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,799	| IOT069 |	Continue talking about the f
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:17,311	| IOT069 |	TC
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:22,943	| IOT069 |	And there are questions that we talked about last week which was are you selling device are you selling a service
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:25,247	| IOT069 |	I think
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:27,807	| IOT069 |	Pastor that is when something goes out
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:30,111	| IOT069 |	How much functionality do you have left
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,903	| IOT069 |	Right so
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:32,927	| IOT069 |	And then
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:35,743	| IOT069 |	If you are selling a service
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,279	| IOT069 |	What kind of like
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,327	| IOT069 |	Refund should you be getting
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:41,631	| IOT069 |	Consumers like when your cable company
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:42,911	| IOT069 |	Has an outage
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:45,215	| IOT069 |	You can actually fight and ask them
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,239	| IOT069 |	For a refund
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:50,079	| IOT069 |	So if you got an old adage you better get a credit on your bill
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:51,615	| IOT069 |	Some people are that way sub
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:59,039	| IOT069 |	So I was thinking about this both because of this but also because last week I told you about the August door
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:17:59,807	| IOT069 |	Tell that I have
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:02,623	| IOT069 |	As frustrated because
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,647	| IOT069 |	I don't have
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,927	| IOT069 |	Access yet to
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:07,231	| IOT069 |	They are they haven't turned on the
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:08,767	| IOT069 |	Motion control
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,303	| IOT069 |	Or is he
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:14,655	| IOT069 |	And they said they would have it by the end of June
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:18,751	| IOT069 |	So I called them and they're said okay now it's going to be the end of
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:20,031	| IOT069 |	Sometime in
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,055	| IOT069 |	So
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:23,359	| IOT069 |	Sometime in
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:25,663	| IOT069 |	6 months without
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:30,527	| IOT069 |	What I consider basic functionality in a video doorbell
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:31,807	| IOT069 |	Two of these acts
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:36,159	| IOT069 |	For 6 months it hasn't even worked like it's supposed
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:37,183	| IOT069 |	When I feel
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:40,255	| IOT069 |	I feel like if I were
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:43,583	| IOT069 |	Any other customer I would be
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:44,607	| IOT069 |	Asking for a refund
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,143	| IOT069 |	Because
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:52,799	| IOT069 |	It's except so many frogs come out better and in the functionality is so you know 50 to 80% of the way there and
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:56,895	| IOT069 |	Features XYZ are coming soon stay tuned
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,687	| IOT069 |	And you still invest in it
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,991	| IOT069 |	Because you assume you're going to get
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:01,503	| IOT069 |	The product
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,039	| IOT069 |	Centos features
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,831	| IOT069 |	Hey what if they never show up
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,647	| IOT069 |	That's a possibility
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:10,975	| IOT069 |	Abby Weatherford away which is exactly what the case here and
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:12,767	| IOT069 |	Yeah it sucks
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:15,839	| IOT069 |	Agreed agreed
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:20,447	| IOT069 |	Are there any add-on costs that will come with a new features like for the cloud stuff for now
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,983	| IOT069 |	And there may be a
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,007	| IOT069 |	Subscription service
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:24,031	| IOT069 |	Some of the cloud will be
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:27,103	| IOT069 |	Okay one
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:27,871	| IOT069 |	Wait a minute
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,199	| IOT069 |	Well
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:34,527	| IOT069 |	You know say the first three months will be free because you were late you know
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:36,063	| IOT069 |	Going to waive the fee
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,599	| IOT069 |	Amazon support
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:39,135	| IOT069 |	The other thing is they didn't
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:39,903	| IOT069 |	Tell me I had to ask
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,975	| IOT069 |	They did not send me an e
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,743	| IOT069 |	Email
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,511	| IOT069 |	Saying
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:47,071	| IOT069 |	Hey I know in our press release launching
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:49,375	| IOT069 |	Medicine everybody reported that this was going to be out by the end of
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:50,911	| IOT069 |	But
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:55,007	| IOT069 |	I guess it comes down to it that people buy the product
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:58,335	| IOT069 |	Specifically for these functions that are coming cigarette some people may not care
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:02,943	| IOT069 |	Let me not and and that worries me even more because what if
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:04,735	| IOT069 |	A majority of the customers
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:05,503	| IOT069 |	Don't care
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:12,159	| IOT069 |	And the company has been in generic terms but obviously I'm applying it to August here what if they decide to know it
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:15,231	| IOT069 |	Are you the bases and clamoring for this
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:17,535	| IOT069 |	America was never great
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:21,375	| IOT069 |	I don't want to think about that
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:22,143	| IOT069 |	Cuz I really want
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:23,935	| IOT069 |	The cloud storage
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:24,959	| IOT069 |	Lesso
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:26,239	| IOT069 |	Although I like it having
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,823	| IOT069 |	Doorbell YouTube
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:32,895	| IOT069 |	Although it does take a picture of the last time
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,919	| IOT069 |	So I can see who was
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,967	| IOT069 |	Even without it
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:37,503	| IOT069 |	But
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,039	| IOT069 |	The motion detection is like
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:40,575	| IOT069 |	That's like a
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,343	| IOT069 |	Basic theme
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:45,439	| IOT069 |	Video doorbell if you're using it for security that is that is
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,975	| IOT069 |	It's important
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,279	| IOT069 |	So those are thoughts here
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:52,607	| IOT069 |	I'd like business models need to adjust
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:54,143	| IOT069 |	People need to understand if they're selling
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:54,655	| IOT069 |	Service
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:56,959	| IOT069 |	Probably should communicate better with customers when
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:58,495	| IOT069 |	Blade
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:04,639	| IOT069 |	And should we think about prorating the cost of devices based on their functionality or should
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,223	| IOT069 |	What do you expect
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:10,271	| IOT069 |	And you know that is true
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:11,807	| IOT069 |	But
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:13,343	| IOT069 |	I think if you
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:16,416	| IOT069 |	We're never going to get anywhere as an industry if everyone just shrugs
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,952	| IOT069 |	DES office early adopters
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,720	| IOT069 |	China products
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:19,744	| IOT069 |	Feel like really doctor Prada
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:22,304	| IOT069 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,840	| IOT069 |	News for us is
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:26,144	| IOT069 |	Racker

EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,736	| IOT069 |	People who
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:42,272	| IOT069 |	I want to know about trackers
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:46,368	| IOT069 |	These little Bluetooth things that you attach two items keys for Depo wallets
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:52,000	| IOT069 |	You can track them you can make them beep and someone sits at way to help you find lost things
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,024	| IOT069 |	If you don't want to lose
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:54,816	| IOT069 |	Tracker already had
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:55,328	| IOT069 |	Crowdsource
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:58,912	| IOT069 |	I'll call it GPS or tracking up devices so that way you could
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:01,728	| IOT069 |	Have the tire tracker audience
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:03,264	| IOT069 |	Help you find a lost item
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:05,056	| IOT069 |	Data tracker installed on it
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:11,456	| IOT069 |	Now that included family sharing so that way you can create a little private group of families friends neighbors roommate Etc
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:14,528	| IOT069 |	And we're together to find a lost item
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:16,832	| IOT069 |	If you have it tracker attached to it so
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:17,856	| IOT069 |	I can like that
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:19,136	| IOT069 |	Yeah that's
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:19,904	| IOT069 |	Very nice cuz
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:23,488	| IOT069 |	We had we had stuck a tracker on the dog for a little bit
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:28,864	| IOT069 |	And nobody else can find the dog Striker it doesn't really help get you much so this way
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:29,632	| IOT069 |	You can have
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:30,912	| IOT069 |	Ditto Olive
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,704	| IOT069 |	The Austin area looking for you
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:33,216	| IOT069 |	Yes
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:35,776	| IOT069 |	All right and then
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:38,848	| IOT069 |	This is more industrial news but it's worth it she is having there
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:40,384	| IOT069 |	Conference this week GE announced
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:41,920	| IOT069 |	Predict
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:43,200	| IOT069 |	Kit
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:44,992	| IOT069 |	So predicts is there iot
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:48,320	| IOT069 |	The cloud where you get developers can sign up for
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:50,624	| IOT069 |	Their own predicts accounts in track
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:53,696	| IOT069 |	Whatever industrial internet stuff at build
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,976	| IOT069 |	Applications InTouch for it
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:59,072	| IOT069 |	What day is now done is created a prediction
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,352	| IOT069 |	Kit
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,888	| IOT069 |	That's a hardware and software bundle
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,424	| IOT069 |	Connect
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:04,960	| IOT069 |	Manufacturing
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:06,240	| IOT069 |	So
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:08,032	| IOT069 |	You can use these kids
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:11,360	| IOT069 |	They're configured with the Raspberry Pi and Intel Edison and
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,640	| IOT069 |	GE sold hardened
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:14,432	| IOT069 |	Platform health field agent
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:19,040	| IOT069 |	And you can use this to like basically attach this to some device that you want to measure
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:24,416	| IOT069 |	And it will send that data so we see these things with
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,952	| IOT069 |	You know IBM has deals with
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,536	| IOT069 |	Barry silicon providers
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,072	| IOT069 |	2
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:31,584	| IOT069 |	Thai
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:38,240	| IOT069 |	Dev kits basically to their Cloud so it's just one less thing that you have to do in braids it a little closer
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:42,336	| IOT069 |	Two kind of web familiar developers to work with like
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,360	| IOT069 |	Harper data
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:43,872	| IOT069 |	If that makes sense
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,176	| IOT069 |	And yeah that's
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:48,224	| IOT069 |	That's it but it's it's worth knowing because
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:52,832	| IOT069 |	Biology is produced platform is probably the top
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:54,112	| IOT069 |	1 in the space
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:55,392	| IOT069 |	And
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:56,928	| IOT069 |	This was kind of a hole for the
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,464	| IOT069 |	All right
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,512	| IOT069 |	Guys you've been patiently waiting

EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:46,752	| IOT069 |	Learned I learned a bunch of space for a long time
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:47,776	| IOT069 |	It's fun to see
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,568	| IOT069 |	Other still tons to learn
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:52,384	| IOT069 |	Everybody we warned you it's getting in the show but
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:56,224	| IOT069 |	Please if you haven't muted your Echo
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:58,016	| IOT069 |	So it's not listening
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,552	| IOT069 |	Uso now
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:00,832	| IOT069 |	Because
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:01,344	| IOT069 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,392	| IOT069 |	We're going to say the name Alexa
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:03,904	| IOT069 |	A lot
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:06,720	| IOT069 |	All right
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:10,304	| IOT069 |	First off I have to start with the question
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,072	| IOT069 |	Everyone's going to ask
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:13,120	| IOT069 |	Pretty sure you're not going to answer it
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:14,400	| IOT069 |	But
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,168	| IOT069 |	How many
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:15,680	| IOT069 |	Echoes have been
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:18,496	| IOT069 |	We hear between 3 and 4 million
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,008	| IOT069 |	A lot
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,312	| IOT069 |	So we can make
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:22,592	| IOT069 |	Got it
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:27,456	| IOT069 |	Okay Siri is kind of a difficult
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:28,736	| IOT069 |	Keep in the market
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:34,880	| IOT069 |	Hungry I think it's a good problem to have I mean we we feel super blast it or in the situation
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:37,184	| IOT069 |	It may be that I'm a smart home nerd in
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:40,000	| IOT069 |	II III
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:40,768	| IOT069 |	Decemberists
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,280	| IOT069 |	20
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:43,072	| IOT069 |	Was it 2015 or 2014
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,120	| IOT069 |	Time flies
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:50,752	| IOT069 |	Yeah that was November 2014
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,800	| IOT069 |	So when I
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,312	| IOT069 |	Received it
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:55,872	| IOT069 |	I had all my colleagues were telling me
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:58,176	| IOT069 |	Stacy why don't you to spend $100
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:00,224	| IOT069 |	It seems kind of silly I like
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:02,016	| IOT069 |	No no there's all the smart home stuff
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:04,320	| IOT069 |	And that was actually
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:06,624	| IOT069 |	I'm curious
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:10,464	| IOT069 |	Is that the killer use case for a lot of people or
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,232	| IOT069 |	It is
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:15,328	| IOT069 |	You know it is I mean the product gets used across a lot of dimensions
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,096	| IOT069 |	Sendai
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:19,168	| IOT069 |	Are we have tons of Reese's Run music and
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:20,704	| IOT069 |	Free teen and
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,984	| IOT069 |	All the other two buildings
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:24,032	| IOT069 |	But when we first launched
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:25,056	| IOT069 |	The sperm capabilities
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:26,592	| IOT069 |	Summer year ago now
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:27,872	| IOT069 |	We were
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:29,920	| IOT069 |	We are really delighted with how
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:31,968	| IOT069 |	Cuz there's a single love it and it was
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:37,344	| IOT069 |	It was interesting cuz he had been working on smart home for a long time my career is but kind of got it revolved around it
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:38,880	| IOT069 |	Going way back
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,160	| IOT069 |	And
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:42,464	| IOT069 |	Pill
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:45,024	| IOT069 |	You know this vision of wanting to turn evil
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:50,400	| IOT069 |	People to interact in their homes in the natural way with all these devices and all the cool things you can do
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:53,216	| IOT069 |	And we discovered with voice
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:59,104	| IOT069 |	Alexa is that the really simple scenarios that are I use the term directed device control where you
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,408	| IOT069 |	You have a device in mind and you say
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:04,992	| IOT069 |	Sitting on my couch in the living room reading
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:08,320	| IOT069 |	And the sun goes down it gets a little dark
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,856	| IOT069 |	I'd like to have some light on
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:12,160	| IOT069 |	I could get up and walk across the room flips light switch
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:14,208	| IOT069 |	I'm going to get my smartphone out
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:19,584	| IOT069 |	Start with a rapid is I used to control my smart home you first find it after unlocking my phone
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:21,888	| IOT069 |	Navigate into that particular light
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:24,704	| IOT069 |	You press the button in light comes on or I can say
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:25,728	| IOT069 |	Alexa turn on the reading light
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:27,008	| IOT069 |	And
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:30,080	| IOT069 |	You don't get down. Sing it all the scenarios
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:34,944	| IOT069 |	We envisioned around smart home going back to 1974 when X10 was invented
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:37,760	| IOT069 |	That's a really simple scenario
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:39,296	| IOT069 |	It's like the most basic
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:41,088	| IOT069 |	And it turns out he's also the most
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:42,624	| IOT069 |	And customers just
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:44,928	| IOT069 |	Are demanding more and more and more
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:47,488	| IOT069 |	And so it was worth all that you know when we were
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:49,792	| IOT069 |	The first one more like yeah we're onto something here
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:52,096	| IOT069 |	My understanding is that was
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:55,168	| IOT069 |	The smart home control is actually a relatively late
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,448	| IOT069 |	The product
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:29:02,848	| IOT069 |	Well endowed achievement play after it launched after Alexa has been in beta for a while it was
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:05,408	| IOT069 |	Marches for April last year
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:07,712	| IOT069 |	When we when we first enable
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:08,736	| IOT069 |	Nicole lights
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:15,136	| IOT069 |	So Alexis always improving you know we we launched new capabilities every week across-the-board we have
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:18,464	| IOT069 |	Since the beginning or continuing to double down on that aspect of it
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:21,024	| IOT069 |	So it's kind of hard to say that was a really nice developer or not
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:27,168	| IOT069 |	This is a device that is totally like
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:28,192	| IOT069 |	You could pry it from
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:28,704	| IOT069 |	My cold dead
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:30,496	| IOT069 |	I can't imagine my house
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:31,264	| IOT069 |	Stop it now
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:33,312	| IOT069 |	What speakers
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,592	| IOT069 |	I will say that
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:36,128	| IOT069 |	I have a hard time now
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:38,944	| IOT069 |	Navigating some of the things I can do with
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:45,344	| IOT069 |	That's just simply a limitation of understanding the right commands to say
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:52,256	| IOT069 |	Bruce Lee understanding the right commands to say so if I'm trying to do a conversion I feel like I have to remember special syntax if I'm trying to
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:54,304	| IOT069 |	Syntax
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:57,376	| IOT069 |	What voice does well and what
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:57,888	| IOT069 |	Doesn't it do
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:05,312	| IOT069 |	Well it is always getting better and that's the beauty of beauty machine learning and in these deep learning techniques that we
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:08,896	| IOT069 |	That we really rallied around and done a bunch of invention on
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:10,432	| IOT069 |	And
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:11,712	| IOT069 |	Football today there's
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:14,784	| IOT069 |	There's no complicated things that she doesn't get right
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:16,832	| IOT069 |	And it does get right
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:20,416	| IOT069 |	It's just it's just a matter of time really in in the morgue
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:22,720	| IOT069 |	It's a shame more people use it the better it gets
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:26,304	| IOT069 |	There are some parts that are awkward to use a term called multi-turn
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:27,072	| IOT069 |	4
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:31,424	| IOT069 |	Whereyoueat talk to Lex and she talks back to ask you a clarifying question or whatever
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:34,752	| IOT069 |	And all the time those are those aren't really human like
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:37,824	| IOT069 |	And it's our goal to continue to invest in
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:40,128	| IOT069 |	Making it even more more natural
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:43,712	| IOT069 |	You guys had a remote shipping with the original beta
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:46,528	| IOT069 |	And then it kind of dropped off the product and now it's a separate
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:48,320	| IOT069 |	Was that
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:50,624	| IOT069 |	The result of anything you saw in
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:54,208	| IOT069 |	I'm kind of debating users like I didn't use my remote very much at all until I
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:56,768	| IOT069 |	Remembered I could bring it upstairs and then basically have two echos
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:31:03,936	| IOT069 |	Optional thing for customers and
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:07,008	| IOT069 |	We just as much cost as possible
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:11,104	| IOT069 |	Let's talk about the smart home API
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:14,688	| IOT069 |	Because right now you directly into a couple products
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:16,992	| IOT069 |	Like lights thermostat
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:20,576	| IOT069 |	They just they just work I don't have to have a skill for it it's just there
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:24,672	| IOT069 |	What is your vision for kind of expanding the smart home API
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:25,184	| IOT069 |	Program
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:32,352	| IOT069 |	Yeah it starts with imagining all of the types of devices that customers going to have in the physical world around
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:34,912	| IOT069 |	That they want to use an intelligent
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:36,192	| IOT069 |	Voice agent to interact with
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:37,472	| IOT069 |	And
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:40,800	| IOT069 |	Wait look out in the future of the things I've done in the past
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:44,384	| IOT069 |	And anything you can imagine we want to enable in a
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:46,176	| IOT069 |	Safeway
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:52,320	| IOT069 |	Very deep integration around and it really ends up being about The Primitives of those devices and so if you look at the lighting API
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:55,648	| IOT069 |	Smart Hub supports today at that lowest level
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:57,440	| IOT069 |	It really boils down to
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:59,232	| IOT069 |	On off brightness
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:03,328	| IOT069 |	The thermostat API it's really about temperature
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:06,656	| IOT069 |	And you leave a brightness and temperature there there a gradient right
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:09,728	| IOT069 |	And so as we build out the API we have to think about those with the
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:10,752	| IOT069 |	Primitives are
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:12,032	| IOT069 |	And then with the business logic
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:15,104	| IOT069 |	I'm required within the API test
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:15,872	| IOT069 |	Port mapping
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:21,760	| IOT069 |	And did the goal is to go after all the device types are out there and as we do that we develop more more
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:22,528	| IOT069 |	Primitives
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:24,576	| IOT069 |	They're useful for other types of devices
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:26,624	| IOT069 |	Example of customers today
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,904	| IOT069 |	Use the fact that
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:28,672	| IOT069 |	You can turn
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:30,464	| IOT069 |	Lights on and off
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:31,232	| IOT069 |	With a non-directive
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:34,560	| IOT069 |	And that same thing applies to anything that can be turned on and off
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:35,584	| IOT069 |	So in my house
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:39,168	| IOT069 |	A little embarrassed to say this but I have about 200 devices
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:40,192	| IOT069 |	It Alexa
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:41,216	| IOT069 |	Uncontrollable bile
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:44,288	| IOT069 |	The majority of the Ozarks
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:47,616	| IOT069 |	Majority those are lighting loads I have a house that has a
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:52,480	| IOT069 |	A Lutron lighting system in it and I built a custom skill adapter for that
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:56,064	| IOT069 |	That allows me to interact with this some kind of Legacy 2001
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:58,880	| IOT069 |	Generation Lutron lights lighting system
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:02,720	| IOT069 |	Something like a hundred and twenty of those loads are
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:04,000	| IOT069 |	Are lighting loads
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:08,096	| IOT069 |	The other ones are things like my television to my fireplace so I can say Alexa turn on the kitchen TV
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:10,144	| IOT069 |	And I can say
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:12,704	| IOT069 |	Alexa turn on the living room fireplace
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:14,240	| IOT069 |	Turn off living room
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:20,384	| IOT069 |	And so that's going back to town original question which is even how we View
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:26,272	| IOT069 |	A supporting multiple device types of her time is pretty much anything out there in the way we do that is by
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:30,624	| IOT069 |	By focusing on that have a deep vertical scenario like lighting or thermostat
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:34,976	| IOT069 |	Imma get that right and he's got the right Primitives and then enable is permitted to be used
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:37,024	| IOT069 |	For other devices well
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:42,912	| IOT069 |	Affordable Smart Home
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:48,800	| IOT069 |	You had people wanted to do things like door locks
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,080	| IOT069 |	Send
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:53,152	| IOT069 |	You guys now have a skill for the August door lock
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:54,432	| IOT069 |	But that is not yet
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:34:00,064	| IOT069 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:02,624	| IOT069 |	Verbally being able to control the security of someone's home
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:09,536	| IOT069 |	I think that what we want to do is enable customers have a control and do the scenarios they want to enable and we have to be
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:10,304	| IOT069 |	Someone
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:12,608	| IOT069 |	Patient and cautious about that
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:14,144	| IOT069 |	The August door lock
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:15,424	| IOT069 |	Skill for Alexa
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:16,448	| IOT069 |	Is really cool
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:21,312	| IOT069 |	It enables you to to know the stadium of whether or not doors locked or not so you can ask Alexa
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:23,616	| IOT069 |	Alexa ask August if the door is locked
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:25,408	| IOT069 |	And it's not locking
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:27,712	| IOT069 |	Aldo support unlock
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:32,320	| IOT069 |	And as we talked to all the locks Riders out there their they're also very reticent
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:34,368	| IOT069 |	Send text to support unlocked at all
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:38,208	| IOT069 |	I'm even within the mobile app for the reason cuz you really don't want people to be able to
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:39,488	| IOT069 |	Unlock your door
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:41,280	| IOT069 |	Without really having great
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:41,792	| IOT069 |	About that
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:46,400	| IOT069 |	And so it's our business we build this out to invest heavily in the
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:49,216	| IOT069 |	In the scenario is it and make sure that that those things are
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:51,264	| IOT069 |	A safe and secure for customers
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:53,568	| IOT069 |	Okay so like voice biometrics
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:56,896	| IOT069 |	There's all sorts of
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:35:01,504	| IOT069 |	Types of authentication mechanisms and so forth that were investing in overtime
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:03,296	| IOT069 |	So what are the things that people
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:05,088	| IOT069 |	Email me a lot about they ask
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:06,624	| IOT069 |	Should I buy the echo Dot
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:08,416	| IOT069 |	Because
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:09,440	| IOT069 |	It feels like
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:10,976	| IOT069 |	It's been out for a while
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:13,024	| IOT069 |	Amazon could release a new version of this
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:17,120	| IOT069 |	Dispersions powerful enough and all the improvements
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:18,656	| IOT069 |	Turn the clouds but
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:19,680	| IOT069 |	What would you tell those
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:20,192	| IOT069 |	People are like
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:28,384	| IOT069 |	I don't think they should be I think the devices that that we built today are
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,920	| IOT069 |	Super high-quality
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:31,712	| IOT069 |	They've been engineered
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:38,112	| IOT069 |	With long life cycle in mind and most of the intelligence of Alexa and most of the power is actually in the clouds
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:40,928	| IOT069 |	Device has very little and then I was a very intentional design
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:42,208	| IOT069 |	To make sure that
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:48,352	| IOT069 |	Customers investment in the hardware would last over a long. Of time and the product and always get get better
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:54,496	| IOT069 |	Coyote and not really sure what I have T names for what are the things that I do like about some of the definitions is
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:56,288	| IOT069 |	The idea that it
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,824	| IOT069 |	Music devices you buy
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:00,128	| IOT069 |	Are always getting better and they're not
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:01,664	| IOT069 |	I want it done type of thing
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:04,224	| IOT069 |	What is Amazon's Vision around
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:07,808	| IOT069 |	I still like smart home was a killer app for it
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:09,344	| IOT069 |	Now that you guys now that I can
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:10,880	| IOT069 |	Buy things on Prime
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:12,672	| IOT069 |	Super easily without having ordered it be
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:13,184	| IOT069 |	Before
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:16,000	| IOT069 |	It feels like shopping could be
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:17,536	| IOT069 |	Really interesting
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:20,352	| IOT069 |	It doesn't feel I guess to me it doesn't feel as exciting is
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:21,632	| IOT069 |	The smart home stuff but
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:22,144	| IOT069 |	Be curious like
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:23,424	| IOT069 |	Where you guys been
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:27,520	| IOT069 |	Tell Jeff Bezos said it multiple times
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:28,288	| IOT069 |	Reviews
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,824	| IOT069 |	The vision is near crate what
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:31,872	| IOT069 |	Reviews on Star Trek
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:34,688	| IOT069 |	Star Trek computer but for the home
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,968	| IOT069 |	The course of human history
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:38,528	| IOT069 |	Tens of thousands of years ago when
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:40,064	| IOT069 |	Human communication started
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,624	| IOT069 |	Eunos predominately
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:43,392	| IOT069 |	Voice
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:43,904	| IOT069 |	Sound
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:47,744	| IOT069 |	It seems he's all sorts of other cues that use the sense of sight
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:49,536	| IOT069 |	Caring
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:51,584	| IOT069 |	And smell to communicate
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:53,632	| IOT069 |	But speech and sound is
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:55,168	| IOT069 |	Is Central to human communication
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,448	| IOT069 |	And
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:57,728	| IOT069 |	Up until recently
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:37:00,032	| IOT069 |	Computers
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:00,800	| IOT069 |	Interactive computers
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:06,432	| IOT069 |	I think our vision is a voice has become the technology on voice invention that we've done around far field
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:11,296	| IOT069 |	Voice recognition speech recognition we do in the cloud always getting smarter
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:13,600	| IOT069 |	We're at the point where
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:15,136	| IOT069 |	You actually can interact
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:17,440	| IOT069 |	Computers using natural voice and it's
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:18,976	| IOT069 |	Shockingly good
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:23,072	| IOT069 |	Changes the Paradigm in so we think we're at a point where this
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:24,608	| IOT069 |	It's kind of similar step-function to
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:28,192	| IOT069 |	You know what you saw when we moved from character base
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:30,752	| IOT069 |	Basin racks on computers to GUI
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:32,032	| IOT069 |	Back in the 80s
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:34,336	| IOT069 |	And now we're at the end of Tipping Point
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:35,104	| IOT069 |	4
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:38,176	| IOT069 |	Natural user experiences centered around voice
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:39,968	| IOT069 |	It doesn't mean that
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:40,992	| IOT069 |	Voices the only way
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:43,552	| IOT069 |	Certainly just as humans
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:45,088	| IOT069 |	Like I said earlier use all sorts of
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:46,112	| IOT069 |	Other
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:47,392	| IOT069 |	Census
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:48,672	| IOT069 |	Inarticulate
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:50,976	| IOT069 |	Vocal cords is afford to communicate
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:51,744	| IOT069 |	Computer as well as well
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:54,816	| IOT069 |	And we've sent the vision of Alexa is
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:55,840	| IOT069 |	Tune able
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:57,120	| IOT069 |	Shuman Center Act
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:59,168	| IOT069 |	With their environment in the most natural way
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:00,704	| IOT069 |	What can't voice
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:01,728	| IOT069 |	We talked about
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:03,520	| IOT069 |	Unlocking your doors today
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:05,824	| IOT069 |	But I don't want to
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:08,896	| IOT069 |	Epicurious
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:12,224	| IOT069 |	What those scenarios are that you guys are like you know what that's just not good
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:16,832	| IOT069 |	I think we're going to we're going to let customers dictate that for the most part
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:20,416	| IOT069 |	Ice the same as
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:21,696	| IOT069 |	If you and I were in a room together
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:23,744	| IOT069 |	There's times when
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:25,536	| IOT069 |	Saucony appropriate for me to speak out loud
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:27,584	| IOT069 |	I'm going to kick you under the table
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:34,240	| IOT069 |	Or I'mma send you a message in the same room because it wouldn't be appropriate cuz we're in a library
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:36,288	| IOT069 |	So I think that there's
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:40,640	| IOT069 |	There's also social norms and environmental issues that will dictate that
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:42,688	| IOT069 |	Dim the day it's going to be up to customers
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:47,040	| IOT069 |	When they want to do it in the inside corner of adjectives
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:49,344	| IOT069 |	To build a system in anyway such as flexible enough
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:52,928	| IOT069 |	So that all those modes of communication interaction can be used
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:59,840	| IOT069 |	I actually talked to accompany the other day who is Brie whose customers were bringing the echo.
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:00,352	| IOT069 |	To business meeting
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:02,912	| IOT069 |	To answer questions about sales forecast
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:06,752	| IOT069 |	And I really thought this was interesting when you started talking about
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:07,520	| IOT069 |	Cultural norms
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:09,312	| IOT069 |	I tried it
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:11,872	| IOT069 |	Picture like the echo with an actual seat at the table
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:15,968	| IOT069 |	This could really create new cultural.
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:20,064	| IOT069 |	Set up curious if you guys are seeing those develop maybe you and your license
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:24,928	| IOT069 |	At such an extensive collection or maybe at Amazon
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:29,024	| IOT069 |	You probably see it in your own household I certainly see it in mine with
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:34,912	| IOT069 |	The social environment you have people over the house and they discover that there's nothing in the room that can talk to
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:36,960	| IOT069 |	And suddenly becomes the center of the party
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:39,520	| IOT069 |	Unless that's another example of that
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:43,872	| IOT069 |	But also I'm one of those
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:45,408	| IOT069 |	Your crazy smile is easiest
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:51,552	| IOT069 |	She mostly is but but she for a long time is called our house this
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:53,856	| IOT069 |	Oh my God would love her
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:56,160	| IOT069 |	And it's and it's really because
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:59,488	| IOT069 |	First of Technology tradition has been fairly fragile
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:01,280	| IOT069 |	Particular when it's homegrown
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:05,120	| IOT069 |	But really I didn't give her a lot of value for the things she wanted to do
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:07,424	| IOT069 |	She didn't understand the value of
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:09,728	| IOT069 |	The automatic routines and
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:14,336	| IOT069 |	And the fact you could double tap on this button and it would do something different in Boca scene
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:17,664	| IOT069 |	These things just didn't Delight her cuz
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:21,504	| IOT069 |	There's two kinds of products in the world is products are vitamins and its products are painkillers
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:25,344	| IOT069 |	And ideally you want to be building something that's a pain killer because
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:27,392	| IOT069 |	Yeah they're going to beat all demands for that
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:28,928	| IOT069 |	Because I have to push vitamins on
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:32,768	| IOT069 |	People really frankly the lot of this connected Home Smart home automation stuff for the last
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:34,048	| IOT069 |	Two or three decades
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:35,584	| IOT069 |	Has been
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:36,608	| IOT069 |	In that mode
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:39,680	| IOT069 |	But we found his voice and in my house it's
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:40,704	| IOT069 |	Absolutely the case
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:42,496	| IOT069 |	Juvenile
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:45,312	| IOT069 |	Interacts with the house using voice all the time
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:50,688	| IOT069 |	Never she recommends it to other people had a friend come out to me the other day I'm talking about his wife and he likes
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:53,248	| IOT069 |	Oh my gosh she's encouraging me to buy smart blinds
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:54,528	| IOT069 |	Give me a high five
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:56,576	| IOT069 |	Oh so this way you guys could be a gateway drug
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:01,696	| IOT069 |	The Nerds are that were Amazon
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:05,792	| IOT069 |	To the Smart Home
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:11,168	| IOT069 |	What we should do something about music
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:15,008	| IOT069 |	I had multiple conversations with people who have high-end
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:17,056	| IOT069 |	You know a whole home audio
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:18,080	| IOT069 |	Systems with
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:20,128	| IOT069 |	And then I'll just use the
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:21,920	| IOT069 |	Echoes giving up on the
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:24,736	| IOT069 |	The Puritan high-fidelity
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:26,272	| IOT069 |	The audio file
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:27,040	| IOT069 |	Respective
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:31,392	| IOT069 |	So because the convenience of interacting with voice to select the music you want to play
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:32,672	| IOT069 |	Is so much better
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:37,280	| IOT069 |	And I would also say this touches on something
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:39,328	| IOT069 |	The beauty is important which is
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:40,864	| IOT069 |	Right now
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:41,888	| IOT069 |	Smart home controls
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:42,400	| IOT069 |	Play through
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:43,424	| IOT069 |	Your
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:46,496	| IOT069 |	Which I have a 9 year old daughter
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:49,568	| IOT069 |	Set so she loves the echo because
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:52,128	| IOT069 |	It basically gives our access to a lot of the things in
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:52,640	| IOT069 |	In the home
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:54,431	| IOT069 |	So I look at this and I think
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:56,735	| IOT069 |	This is one of the first high-quality thing
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:58,015	| IOT069 |	Devices to
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:59,551	| IOT069 |	Work in a shared environment
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:02,111	| IOT069 |	I don't know if you guys really thought about that but
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:03,391	| IOT069 |	It feels like something else
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:11,327	| IOT069 |	And we use the term communal internally that resume product is a combination of a very personal
EDL	00:42:11,327	00:42:17,727	| IOT069 |	Experience with also something that works very well in those shared communal environment since and it said that the power in the magic
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:19,263	| IOT069 |	Far-field voice technology
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:23,871	| IOT069 |	Let's quickly go into the future skills before I get you for your favorite
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:24,895	| IOT069 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:25,407	| IOT069 |	Track Santa
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:27,199	| IOT069 |	You guys are making
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:31,039	| IOT069 |	Huge strides there so many skills now not even a guess how many there are at the time
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:33,343	| IOT069 |	I'm sure it's like baby off
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:36,415	| IOT069 |	But there's over 1500
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:42,303	| IOT069 |	Used to be a mess to find them you guys are now at allowing people enable it by voice which thank you
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:46,143	| IOT069 |	But how do you say skills playing in two kind of Amazon's
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:50,239	| IOT069 |	World is just like a new app store like people like to think of it
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:53,055	| IOT069 |	This is one of things where I think we're at day one we're just
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:55,359	| IOT069 |	Scratching the surface of what's possible
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:58,943	| IOT069 |	We are very explicitly enabling Alexa to be something that
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:04,575	| IOT069 |	That isn't entire ecosystem that all companies where the hardware company software company service companies
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:05,855	| IOT069 |	Can
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:07,391	| IOT069 |	Participate in
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:10,463	| IOT069 |	And get whatever value it is that they want on a vehicle
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:11,999	| IOT069 |	Their customers
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:13,023	| IOT069 |	And
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:17,887	| IOT069 |	Are the 1500 or so the skills that are currently enabled that includes the smart home skills
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:21,215	| IOT069 |	Or just us to the sampling it was possible
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:21,983	| IOT069 |	The
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:23,519	| IOT069 |	App stores in the world
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:26,591	| IOT069 |	She go back to 2007 when the iPhone first came out
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:29,151	| IOT069 |	And enabled the App Store 2008
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:31,199	| IOT069 |	The period after that was a
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:34,783	| IOT069 |	Yeah I just a fascinating gross. For the industry
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:37,343	| IOT069 |	And we kind of feel like there's an opportunity to
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:39,135	| IOT069 |	To drive that kind of value
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:42,719	| IOT069 |	For customers and flexibility and benefits by enabling
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:43,999	| IOT069 |	Anyone
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:45,023	| IOT069 |	2
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:46,303	| IOT069 |	Take advantage of this
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:49,631	| IOT069 |	Voice experience
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:51,423	| IOT069 |	How long until I
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:52,959	| IOT069 |	Do a custom name
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:54,239	| IOT069 |	For my echo
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:59,103	| IOT069 |	It was a custom wake word
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:43:59,871	| IOT069 |	Accustomed
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:07,039	| IOT069 |	Yeah you know we support Alexa Echo and Amazon today and we got lots of lots of
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:09,343	| IOT069 |	SUNY able
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:14,207	| IOT069 |	A Mother's Day out of his specific ones they want and indefinitely customers ask about having
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:20,607	| IOT069 |	It's a very very hard problem requires a lot of invention each time you do if you have to get it right you have to
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:21,631	| IOT069 |	You have to make sure you don't
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:23,935	| IOT069 |	Have what we call too many false

EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:56,703	| IOT069 |	What do you like to do with your neck
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:58,495	| IOT069 |	Or what would you tell other people
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:05,919	| IOT069 |	I've done is using Echo dot which has I'm audio out so you can connect to other speaker systems
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:07,967	| IOT069 |	I have several Echo dots around my house
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:12,063	| IOT069 |	Connected to my my multi-zone audio system in my house and so
EDL	00:45:12,063	00:45:16,159	| IOT069 |	I can say I can stand in the kitchen which is next to the dining room and I can say
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:18,975	| IOT069 |	Alexa turn on the
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:19,743	| IOT069 |	Living room speaker
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:23,327	| IOT069 |	And out of the dining room speakers I was there her say okay
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:25,887	| IOT069 |	And then I can say Alexa play
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:28,703	| IOT069 |	Dark Side of the Moon on Spotify
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:30,239	| IOT069 |	And
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:31,775	| IOT069 |	All that music will fill
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:33,311	| IOT069 |	Both dining room and living room
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:37,919	| IOT069 |	And it's really easy to set this up if you have a whole home audio
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:40,735	| IOT069 |	Just like this you can either use the analog audio out to that
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:44,831	| IOT069 |	Or you can use a Bluetooth audio receiver
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:49,439	| IOT069 |	I actually do that in my master bedroom and this morning I love Flash
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:54,047	| IOT069 |	Yeah I guess in the morning and I'm in the bathroom when I say
EDL	00:45:54,047	00:45:55,583	| IOT069 |	Alexa what's up
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:45:59,167	| IOT069 |	And she starts playing my flash briefing with tries customized for me
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:02,239	| IOT069 |	Play the new sources I care the most about
EDL	00:46:02,751	00:46:05,567	| IOT069 |	And that comes out of the speakers in the ceiling
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:08,895	| IOT069 |	Stop my master bedroom because when we built the house way back when
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:14,271	| IOT069 |	And the way that I wire that up is not a little Bluetooth audio receiver
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:19,647	| IOT069 |	Connected to the power amplifier for that in the Echo dot connect to that Bluetooth audio receiver
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:22,719	| IOT069 |	That's kind of a fun thing you can do
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:26,303	| IOT069 |	Obviously I use the smart home stuff a lot
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:27,583	| IOT069 |	For me it's just so nice to be
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:30,399	| IOT069 |	Going to bed and be able to say Alexa turn off
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:30,911	| IOT069 |	Kitchen TV
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:37,823	| IOT069 |	That's a really really mundane things
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:40,127	| IOT069 |	But it's to me and my family
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:42,687	| IOT069 |	Unbelievably delightful
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:44,479	| IOT069 |	It is fantastic
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:45,247	| IOT069 |	As I
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:49,087	| IOT069 |	Turn off the fish tank light
