EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:00,416	| IOT046 |	Are the Barbie Dreamhouse
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:02,720	| IOT046 |	What does it do Kevin
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:08,352	| IOT046 |	It's got a little party mode that flashes lights and plays music and
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:12,960	| IOT046 |	You can turn the staircase from the second floor of the first floor into a slide
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:17,824	| IOT046 |	Very cool there's an optional accessory that you can purchase also
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:20,896	| IOT046 |	The Starlight Adventure RC hoverboard
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:24,224	| IOT046 |	So Barbie can go around the house in her own little
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:26,016	| IOT046 |	Hoverboard which really doesn't help her butt
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:29,088	| IOT046 |	Wait we're not going to go there right now
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:31,392	| IOT046 |	Entirely it is a separate accessory
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:33,184	| IOT046 |	Oh okay awesome
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:33,952	| IOT046 |	That would be
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:37,280	| IOT046 |	Awesome if she could actually hop on the hoverboard and hover but
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:38,048	| IOT046 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:44,448	| IOT046 |	You can put the lights on in the house operate the elevator wait a second why does she have stairs a slide and an elevator
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,472	| IOT046 |	Barbie Dreamhouse
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:48,288	| IOT046 |	Normally Barbie dream house does not come with
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:48,800	| IOT046 |	Stairs
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:53,664	| IOT046 |	I had a Barbie Dreamhouse my daughter has grown out of her Barbie Dream House
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:55,200	| IOT046 |	I'm going to tell you guys
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:56,992	| IOT046 |	Peace
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:58,528	| IOT046 |	Crap
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:02,112	| IOT046 |	I'm just going to lay it out there
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:07,232	| IOT046 |	These things are made of the dinky has plastic you will ever encounter
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:08,512	| IOT046 |	I have broken
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:12,608	| IOT046 |	Like my daughter's Barbie Dreamhouse I broke putting it together at this was like
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:15,424	| IOT046 |	The quintessential made in China
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:15,936	| IOT046 |	Just don't
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:20,544	| IOT046 |	Just don't so I'm not sure if this is something you really want to invest in
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:24,128	| IOT046 |	Personally I would take some little bits or some other toy
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:27,456	| IOT046 |	I just make your own like connected adventure for Barbie
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:30,272	| IOT046 |	You know I like a doll house or something
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:33,600	| IOT046 |	Just buy the $99 I think it might be 150
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:37,184	| IOT046 |	I think Barbie's dreamhouse unconnected is like a hundred fifty bucks
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:38,208	| IOT046 |	It's not cheap
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:41,024	| IOT046 |	That's why it was so galling to know houses
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,072	| IOT046 |	Now that's a Smart House
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,608	| IOT046 |	So anyway
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:45,376	| IOT046 |	Barbie Dreamhouse
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:49,728	| IOT046 |	Also threw out there that Mattel showing at the Toy Fair this year
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:52,800	| IOT046 |	A $300 connected printer for kids witch
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,336	| IOT046 |	Personally $300
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:55,360	| IOT046 |	I would go with
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:58,432	| IOT046 |	Instead of the Dreamhouse
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:01,248	| IOT046 |	Kudos to Mattel I mean they're there
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:05,600	| IOT046 |	Changing with the times that got into to go with it the Internet connected Barbie Dream House

EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:11,744	| IOT046 |	Thingmaker which actually used to have back in the day with obviously wasn't a 3D printer
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,792	| IOT046 |	When you can like make your own toys
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:16,096	| IOT046 |	They're big into the
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:18,400	| IOT046 |	Virtual reality that got the View-Master

EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:26,592	| IOT046 |	They had a Barbie that they worked with
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:29,920	| IOT046 |	Company and that Barbie actually
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:30,432	| IOT046 |	Kind of
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:31,968	| IOT046 |	I had some security issues
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,248	| IOT046 |	Remember
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,016	| IOT046 |	Barbie
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:34,528	| IOT046 |	Expired Norco
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,088	| IOT046 |	Concern
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:37,600	| IOT046 |	And
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:40,160	| IOT046 |	You know so that that was hopefully
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,976	| IOT046 |	As they're bringing this stuff online they're going to
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,536	| IOT046 |	Turn a little bit about locking that stuff down so
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:49,888	| IOT046 |	We're going to talk about that in a minute this would be a brilliant Segway but I want to get some of the
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:50,656	| IOT046 |	Smaller news out of the way
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:55,776	| IOT046 |	Talking about Barbie dream house it is voice control just like our favorite
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:56,288	| IOT046 |	Suffice
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:58,080	| IOT046 |	BabyCenter favorite
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,616	| IOT046 |	It's up there
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,944	| IOT046 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:03,968	| IOT046 |	We got some news
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:05,504	| IOT046 |	Kevin wasn't here last week
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,784	| IOT046 |	So we didn't talk about
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,552	| IOT046 |	Amazon integrated
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:09,344	| IOT046 |	Spotify
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,624	| IOT046 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,392	| IOT046 |	I'm so excited
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:16,256	| IOT046 |	You're like the biggest Spotify fan I know like you couldn't wait for it to be on Sonos
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,791	| IOT046 |	You just that's awesome
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,095	| IOT046 |	And the best part about this is
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:22,143	| IOT046 |	So we tested in our house cuz again
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:25,471	| IOT046 |	We have Sonos we have Echo with Spotify you can
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,239	| IOT046 |	Play
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:28,031	| IOT046 |	When you're playing Spotify
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:32,383	| IOT046 |	On your Echo you can also play Sonos or Spotify on your Sonos
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,151	| IOT046 |	And it doesn't shut it down
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,199	| IOT046 |	Probably cuz it's on the same Wi-Fi
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:37,759	| IOT046 |	And you'll have a family
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,807	| IOT046 |	So that was pretty sweet
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:41,599	| IOT046 |	The other thing that I thought was awesome
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:42,879	| IOT046 |	Is
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:44,415	| IOT046 |	Android handset
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,463	| IOT046 |	You can actually Chromecast
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,487	| IOT046 |	Your
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:50,303	| IOT046 |	Okay if you're playing Spotify on your phone
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:52,351	| IOT046 |	When you come into your living room
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,887	| IOT046 |	Or it's whatever room your Echoes In
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,935	| IOT046 |	You can actually Chromecast
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,959	| IOT046 |	The Spotify
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,239	| IOT046 |	Music
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,519	| IOT046 |	Right onto your Chrome
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:01,567	| IOT046 |	Is your Echo so it is resist a Chromecast
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:08,735	| IOT046 |	Now that's really interesting I didn't know that because I don't have Spotify I don't live in Stacy's dream home I don't have all these things
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:10,271	| IOT046 |	It's getting there
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:14,367	| IOT046 |	You know you can you can Chromecast it to any available Chromecast device switch
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,159	| IOT046 |	The echo apparently is
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:18,463	| IOT046 |	Know that until I come
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:25,119	| IOT046 |	I don't think it has been never before that's what that's why I'm saying this is really interesting because
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:27,935	| IOT046 |	You know Google has the Chromecast audio in the car
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:29,983	| IOT046 |	Chromecast video devices in the old Chromecast
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:34,591	| IOT046 |	They've got the Chromecast extension so you can pretty much ahead
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,871	| IOT046 |	Computer to any
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,639	| IOT046 |	Chromecast setup
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,711	| IOT046 |	I did not know that they've
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,247	| IOT046 |	Use that
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:43,295	| IOT046 |	To integrate into the echo
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:45,599	| IOT046 |	Pictures of China
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:47,391	| IOT046 |	I like it
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:50,463	| IOT046 |	I believe you I had
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:53,535	| IOT046 |	I believe you now I'm wondering if I can
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:57,887	| IOT046 |	I got an Android phone I've got an echo I wonder if I can Chromecast other stuff
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:58,911	| IOT046 |	2D Echo
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,959	| IOT046 |	Now you have homework
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:03,007	| IOT046 |	Not so I can live with this homework
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,031	| IOT046 |	Just getting to
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:05,823	| IOT046 |	Let me ask you is your
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:10,687	| IOT046 |	Phone already connected to the echo via Bluetooth cuz that's how you would normally connect
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,199	| IOT046 |	It is
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:14,015	| IOT046 |	Connected I do randomly disconnected
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,063	| IOT046 |	It's so
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:19,135	| IOT046 |	It might be doing it that way although no cuz it gives you
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:22,207	| IOT046 |	It tells you that it's a Chromecast Apple device
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:25,535	| IOT046 |	Unless it's just because I've on a Nexus and it's just like
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:28,095	| IOT046 |	Bluetooth equals Chromecast but that would be weird right
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:34,239	| IOT046 |	It doesn't over Wi-Fi as well I'm it uses Bluetooth but also Wi-Fi so no it's not just the Bluetooth connection
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:36,031	| IOT046 |	So I'm
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,799	| IOT046 |	Connor
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:40,383	| IOT046 |	Stymied on this because I didn't realize that you could do that
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:42,943	| IOT046 |	And to be honest I'm real quick on in my apps
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,991	| IOT046 |	For the echo just to see if there's
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,271	| IOT046 |	Anything in the settings
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,575	| IOT046 |	That's new that I have might have missed
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,623	| IOT046 |	Well it going
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:52,159	| IOT046 |	Interesting
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:54,207	| IOT046 |	Well I'm going to have to
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:54,719	| IOT046 |	Ed Westwick
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,535	| IOT046 |	Yeah and turn off
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,351	| IOT046 |	Later not this not this show
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:01,887	| IOT046 |	But next show
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,935	| IOT046 |	Yes so the echo is one of my paired devices
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,727	| IOT046 |	So it could be
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,543	| IOT046 |	I don't know I'm just
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:10,335	| IOT046 |	Eucharist how this all works with the Chromecast
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,663	| IOT046 |	So that's what I am definitely look into that
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:16,479	| IOT046 |	Well here we go I turn I unpaired it
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,783	| IOT046 |	So now we're going to see
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,831	| IOT046 |	If devices available
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:24,415	| IOT046 |	Oh so it's still available and it's through Spotify connect
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:27,999	| IOT046 |	Now so is it available on the Chromecast
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:28,511	| IOT046 |	Through Spotify
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:35,679	| IOT046 |	Then you know what I'm guessing it is specific to Spotify and it would Spotify emblem
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,959	| IOT046 |	This way
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:37,727	| IOT046 |	Twitter app
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:41,055	| IOT046 |	If and if that's the case and I can't like
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,335	| IOT046 |	Say
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,127	| IOT046 |	Chromecast
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:45,919	| IOT046 |	Google Music to the echo
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,943	| IOT046 |	Like that you know
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:51,295	| IOT046 |	That's okay I'm still going to take a look around because it's very interesting
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:55,391	| IOT046 |	Development here it is it is through Spotify now
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:58,975	| IOT046 |	Beforehand it's it gave me the Chromecast option but now it's giving me
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:00,511	| IOT046 |	Spotify so what I turned off Bluetooth
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,303	| IOT046 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,071	| IOT046 |	Centrist
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,095	| IOT046 |	Mystery solved
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:04,863	| IOT046 |	All right
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:09,215	| IOT046 |	Did it there's more
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:10,239	| IOT046 |	Yo there's more
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,007	| IOT046 |	There is more
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,519	| IOT046 |	Alright Kevin
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:18,175	| IOT046 |	This will be kind of quick but very interesting for people who have an ecobee3 home thermostat
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:22,015	| IOT046 |	Because you now have native Amazon Echo integration
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:25,855	| IOT046 |	And that's very different than using say a skill
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:30,463	| IOT046 |	Or if this than that like we've done with the Echo and nest in the pass this is
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,487	| IOT046 |	Straight up integration
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:32,511	| IOT046 |	Full support
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:34,815	| IOT046 |	I do not have an ecobee3
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:37,119	| IOT046 |	Unfortunately I cannot test it
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:37,631	| IOT046 |	I do not have
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:40,959	| IOT046 |	I have been using with my ecobee SI
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:44,287	| IOT046 |	If this then that integration with my
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,079	| IOT046 |	Amazon Echo and it has been
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,615	| IOT046 |	A little weird
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:48,639	| IOT046 |	Because
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:51,967	| IOT046 |	It only gives you a certain number of degrees and not all of them
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:53,503	| IOT046 |	So when I say
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,807	| IOT046 |	You know so-and-so trigger ecobee warmer
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:59,135	| IOT046 |	I can only select you know what I trigger that I
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:08:59,647	| IOT046 |	Can trigger
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:00,927	| IOT046 |	It to do
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,975	| IOT046 |	6 degrees
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:04,767	| IOT046 |	69 degrees in 71 degrees
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:07,327	| IOT046 |	I can't trigger to do 72
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,351	| IOT046 |	So it's a little like
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:14,239	| IOT046 |	It's pre-specified as to the the temperature so if there's a temp that you want does not support of your kind out of
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,799	| IOT046 |	I just have to get as close as possible
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,567	| IOT046 |	So
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,103	| IOT046 |	That's really important to you
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:21,663	| IOT046 |	You got to have to open up your phone and turn on the air
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:25,759	| IOT046 |	There you go and then finally
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,039	| IOT046 |	Man
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:27,807	| IOT046 |	Amazon skills
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,111	| IOT046 |	You can call an Uber
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:32,671	| IOT046 |	You can order your pizza from Dominos
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:34,463	| IOT046 |	Which in all the reading
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:39,071	| IOT046 |	It looks like the best way to do that is to actually pick one kind of pizza that you really like and then
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,607	| IOT046 |	Order that one all the time
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:43,167	| IOT046 |	I'm so if you're the kind of person who like
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:46,495	| IOT046 |	Stop nose and likes the same kind of pizza that this is for you
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:51,359	| IOT046 |	For me
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:55,455	| IOT046 |	I was going to ask if you if you order frequently from Domino's and I'm guessing not
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:10:01,087	| IOT046 |	But that's okay that's okay we do order from the Amazon
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:01,599	| IOT046 |	Is it favor
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:04,159	| IOT046 |	Saber hits Amazon Now app
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,183	| IOT046 |	It has the restaurants
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:07,743	| IOT046 |	We actually have some regulars there so
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:10,559	| IOT046 |	I could get my
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:13,375	| IOT046 |	Austin had a restaurant called phonatic we did
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,423	| IOT046 |	Vietnamese ordered all the time from that so
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:16,703	| IOT046 |	Definitely
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,799	| IOT046 |	Okay there is three things
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,335	| IOT046 |	Three things
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,359	| IOT046 |	You can call your Echo
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:25,407	| IOT046 |	I didn't realize this I thought there were only two
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,687	| IOT046 |	Which was I'm going to say it
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,711	| IOT046 |	Everyone bikes down
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:29,247	| IOT046 |	Shield your ears
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,807	| IOT046 |	You can either call it the Alexa
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,087	| IOT046 |	Or the Amazon
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,879	| IOT046 |	But I just discovered this
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:36,415	| IOT046 |	You can actually call it three things
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,695	| IOT046 |	You can call it Alexa
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:39,231	| IOT046 |	Amazon or Echo
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:42,559	| IOT046 |	The world just went crazy with tights
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:45,375	| IOT046 |	I know I've liked I warned y'all
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,911	| IOT046 |	It was like the trigger warning
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,191	| IOT046 |	But if you do that
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:50,239	| IOT046 |	I'm going to warn you if you're not going to list or show
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:52,287	| IOT046 |	Because we're going to keep calling at the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:55,871	| IOT046 |	That's the news on that for
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:59,711	| IOT046 |	It is and just to add to it or close it up
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:03,807	| IOT046 |	It's interesting to me that over the past two weeks I've seen so many articles
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:07,391	| IOT046 |	Mainstream articles television spots
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:09,439	| IOT046 |	Where everything you do what
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:11,231	| IOT046 |	Amazon has a sleeper hit
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,279	| IOT046 |	Amazon's going to control Smart Home
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:16,351	| IOT046 |	I'm sitting here going where have you people been for the last 14 months
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:20,191	| IOT046 |	Come on tell all those people like everyone who's like
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,983	| IOT046 |	Oh my gosh have you heard of this device
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,519	| IOT046 |	Tell him about a podcast y'all
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:26,847	| IOT046 |	Okay moving right along
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,615	| IOT046 |	Philips Hue
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,527	| IOT046 |	You have an Android phone
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:36,063	| IOT046 |	If you don't have an Android phone you may want to
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:40,671	| IOT046 |	If you have an Android phone they just updated their app
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:41,695	| IOT046 |	2
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,975	| IOT046 |	Work with Android
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,743	| IOT046 |	Is it 6.1
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:46,559	| IOT046 |	A 6.0 Android marshmallow
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,095	| IOT046 |	So
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:50,655	| IOT046 |	They just updated it and boy people are up
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:53,471	| IOT046 |	Set because they updated it to allow
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,775	| IOT046 |	Permissions for geofencing
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:12:02,175	| IOT046 |	Location of where and then access to videos on videos and photos on the phone which they use to sew you
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,687	| IOT046 |	You can
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,223	| IOT046 |	Your Bachelor lights
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:06,015	| IOT046 |	Have a fun feature
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,039	| IOT046 |	People link
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,319	| IOT046 |	But
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:08,831	| IOT046 |	They did it wrong
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:15,743	| IOT046 |	That's what we're thinking what would Stacy night before the show actually tested out the most updated app and we're in
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:16,511	| IOT046 |	Some problems
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,279	| IOT046 |	And
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:20,863	| IOT046 |	I haven't read the reviews of the latest version of Stacey hasn't said that
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:27,007	| IOT046 |	Philips is getting hammered over this and I can now see why for people who don't know Android 6.0 bring
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:29,567	| IOT046 |	More granular permissions to apps
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:31,103	| IOT046 |	Runtime permission
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:34,175	| IOT046 |	And so that way either either when you install or when you use an app
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:41,087	| IOT046 |	If you need to Grant permission to the app you have the choice for summer to have IOS does it and there are three permission
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:47,487	| IOT046 |	Is that Stacy just mentioned that are in the the new app it's the location allow access to media and files and
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,279	| IOT046 |	Allow access to photos and such
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:52,351	| IOT046 |	And the thing is that's the way Android
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,887	| IOT046 |	6.0 apps are supposed to work
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:58,751	| IOT046 |	If you don't have Android 6.0 which most people don't you're not going to take full advantage of this yet so
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,543	| IOT046 |	Don't sweat it
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:02,847	| IOT046 |	Season 6 out
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:04,895	| IOT046 |	And when we actually denied
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:07,967	| IOT046 |	Access to the app to say look at our photos
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:11,551	| IOT046 |	The apps like okay and how about this permission how about that permission
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:12,575	| IOT046 |	Super geofencing in Media
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:14,367	| IOT046 |	And then the after shutdown
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:18,207	| IOT046 |	How about know what's supposed to happen is
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:24,351	| IOT046 |	The app is supposed to run just not have that feature where would access the photos turn on or whichever feature YouTube
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:27,167	| IOT046 |	It should not have access to
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,191	| IOT046 |	Unfortunately app
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,727	| IOT046 |	Just shuts down
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,007	| IOT046 |	We also found out that
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:33,311	| IOT046 |	If you go through the process of
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,847	| IOT046 |	Enabling permissions or deny permissions
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:39,967	| IOT046 |	And then you go back into the app it may ask you again in fact we denied all the permissions
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:41,247	| IOT046 |	Went back in the app
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:44,319	| IOT046 |	On the second time it's got a little check box it says never ask me again
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:48,415	| IOT046 |	So what do we do we check the check boxes never ask me again and deny permissions
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,695	| IOT046 |	At that point
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:52,767	| IOT046 |	You can't even go back and change those permissions
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:55,327	| IOT046 |	Because you've already said don't ask me again so
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:14:00,703	| IOT046 |	It's really kind of flaky right now does not seem like it's been implemented a hundred percent correct
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:06,847	| IOT046 |	If you do run into the problem station I ran into where we couldn't even change the permissions anymore because we said never ask again
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,895	| IOT046 |	You just need to uninstall the app and reinstall the app
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:11,711	| IOT046 |	Yes cuz what happens if you do not have permission
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:13,503	| IOT046 |	You can't open your
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,295	| IOT046 |	It's just going to shut down
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:19,647	| IOT046 |	Exactly you did was just there but it won't do a darn thing for it just shuts right now
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,695	| IOT046 |	So if you want to control your lights
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,487	| IOT046 |	So basically everyone's upset
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,767	| IOT046 |	Because they're like
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:27,327	| IOT046 |	I just want to give you all my permissions
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,119	| IOT046 |	My location
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:31,935	| IOT046 |	Cute you're in my house that's all I want to do
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:32,959	| IOT046 |	Turn my lights
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:33,727	| IOT046 |	I need to know where I am
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:34,751	| IOT046 |	He's like
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:41,151	| IOT046 |	Yeah it's not supposed to work that way and I suspect they're going to fix it
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:42,687	| IOT046 |	Pretty quickly I would hope
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,991	| IOT046 |	She has done a great job when everyone
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:47,295	| IOT046 |	It was like so hats off about you like
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,087	| IOT046 |	Messing up
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:50,111	| IOT046 |	The friends with Hughes.
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:53,951	| IOT046 |	Community we were like okay
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,743	| IOT046 |	We are not going to
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,791	| IOT046 |	You guys are on your own
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:01,119	| IOT046 |	With enough support on these things but we're not going
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:01,631	| IOT046 |	2
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:02,911	| IOT046 |	Turn off
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:04,703	| IOT046 |	And make things not work
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:05,215	| IOT046 |	With our app
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,775	| IOT046 |	They fix that pretty quick re-read
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:09,311	| IOT046 |	Yeah it was
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:13,663	| IOT046 |	Yes so I'm assuming I reached out to Hugh they haven't gotten back to me but I sent it
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:14,943	| IOT046 |	Pretty late last night
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:16,223	| IOT046 |	So
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:17,247	| IOT046 |	They haven't got back to me
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,039	| IOT046 |	And
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,599	| IOT046 |	They're usually pretty responsive so I would imagine
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:25,439	| IOT046 |	So that's the Philips Hue stuff in the meantime
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:27,231	| IOT046 |	Uninstall
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:27,999	| IOT046 |	Reinstall
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:29,791	| IOT046 |	Except permission
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,583	| IOT046 |	If you don't want to accept permissions
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:34,399	| IOT046 |	You gotta know if you update your app
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,191	| IOT046 |	So there you go
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:37,471	| IOT046 |	Wink
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:39,775	| IOT046 |	Has updated their firmware
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,543	| IOT046 |	And their software
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:50,783	| IOT046 |	Yeah yeah I am so happy because as anybody who's Will Smith show knows I'm not 100% sold on a cloud
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:52,063	| IOT046 |	Only type Smart Home
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:54,111	| IOT046 |	And now I've got
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,647	| IOT046 |	What is direct access
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,439	| IOT046 |	2 between the app
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:58,719	| IOT046 |	And my lights
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:01,023	| IOT046 |	Provided that on the same Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,559	| IOT046 |	Which they are so it's not a problem
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:07,167	| IOT046 |	And what that does is if the cloud goes down I don't have to worry about I can still control my lights
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:07,935	| IOT046 |	The Wink app
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:08,959	| IOT046 |	And even better
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:11,519	| IOT046 |	There's reduce latency because you cut out the hole
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:13,055	| IOT046 |	Send
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:13,823	| IOT046 |	Command from the app
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:17,151	| IOT046 |	After the Hub how did the cloud cloud back to the hub Hub to the light
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,199	| IOT046 |	It's just direct app
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:19,967	| IOT046 |	Two light
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:22,015	| IOT046 |	It's a beautiful thing I definitely noticed
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,039	| IOT046 |	Less latency
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:24,575	| IOT046 |	Lights turn on and turn off faster
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:26,111	| IOT046 |	I'm so so happy about this
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:31,231	| IOT046 |	So the other thing to know is
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:33,023	| IOT046 |	WeMo also at the W Front
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,839	| IOT046 |	Which you know has the
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:37,119	| IOT046 |	Who in alphabetically by the way
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:40,447	| IOT046 |	Amazon Philips twinkle wink and WeMo
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,007	| IOT046 |	Close enough
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,311	| IOT046 |	Football
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:48,127	| IOT046 |	Which is the Belkin smart
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,151	| IOT046 |	Stuff
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:52,735	| IOT046 |	Update your software finally
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,015	| IOT046 |	I know you guys I don't know actually
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:57,855	| IOT046 |	I don't know if you remember but they said way back in like
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:01,951	| IOT046 |	The fall of last year that by the end of January they were going to really like
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,487	| IOT046 |	Focus on their software
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:05,023	| IOT046 |	It was going to be up to date in
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:05,791	| IOT046 |	Lawless
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,303	| IOT046 |	Better
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,119	| IOT046 |	But better
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:09,887	| IOT046 |	Put better
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:16,287	| IOT046 |	Because it was really a mess I mean like I don't know how many of you guys there's 1.5 million people who get stalled WeMo
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,823	| IOT046 |	Stop out there so that's a lot
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,639	| IOT046 |	Some of that stuff was really just
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,711	| IOT046 |	The devices were always nice
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:25,759	| IOT046 |	This is just a software experience
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,551	| IOT046 |	You know sometimes it was just telling reliable
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,087	| IOT046 |	Ivor YouTube
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:29,855	| IOT046 |	Switch like
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:33,951	| IOT046 |	Daylight savings time this would happen and then suddenly nothing would work and you be like why
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,511	| IOT046 |	So it's better
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:42,911	| IOT046 |	Actually the beginning of February and its four star review
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:44,191	| IOT046 |	Storage they were happy to put out
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,495	| IOT046 |	On my end I've noticed
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:50,847	| IOT046 |	It talks actually a lot better to the
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:51,615	| IOT046 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:53,663	| IOT046 |	Which is nice
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:55,711	| IOT046 |	There's a lot less like
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:58,527	| IOT046 |	I don't know what you're talking to or that network devices available
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,343	| IOT046 |	I've also noticed
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,111	| IOT046 |	Stat
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:02,623	| IOT046 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,415	| IOT046 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:07,487	| IOT046 |	Things we could ask you like so if I turned it off in the app
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:12,863	| IOT046 |	Theater wouldn't recognize that it had already been turned off and so it'd be like yeah I can't
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:13,887	| IOT046 |	I can't mess with it right now
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,447	| IOT046 |	Seem to talk to
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:16,959	| IOT046 |	Each other just
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:22,847	| IOT046 |	So maybe better synchronization between WeMo and other items other hubs
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:23,615	| IOT046 |	Panda
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:30,527	| IOT046 |	Stability is important to me that mine's been pretty good I just have the Insight switch on a LED bulb in the bedroom
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,807	| IOT046 |	Shut it off every night before bed
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:34,367	| IOT046 |	Eight nine times out of 10
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:39,999	| IOT046 |	Pretty solid but every once in a while I got a hiccup when I'm hitting the button and nothing's happening. It says I can't connect can't see it
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,791	| IOT046 |	I'm on the same network in the same room
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:47,423	| IOT046 |	So hopefully I mean I just got the app update hopefully it's gets it to 10 out of 10 times
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:49,215	| IOT046 |	10 out of 10
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:50,751	| IOT046 |	Pretty girl
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:53,567	| IOT046 |	1990
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:02,527	| IOT046 |	Alright Fido
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:03,807	| IOT046 |	Final
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:06,367	| IOT046 |	Let's do it let's Dive Right In
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:08,927	| IOT046 |	Going to be good
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:10,975	| IOT046 |	So the big issue
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:15,583	| IOT046 |	Last week it really I'm going to say going forward for quite some time to come
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:18,655	| IOT046 |	The internet of things and using it to spy on
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:20,447	| IOT046 |	People how does that make you feel Kevin
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:22,495	| IOT046 |	Not good
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:25,823	| IOT046 |	Okay so James Clapper the US Director of National Intelligence
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:29,919	| IOT046 |	Came and spoke to the Senate armed services
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:32,223	| IOT046 |	And it's an annual review of like
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,783	| IOT046 |	Hey this is what's going on in intelligence
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:37,087	| IOT046 |	Surveillance intelligence
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:37,599	| IOT046 |	Threats
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,647	| IOT046 |	Does a threat report
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:41,439	| IOT046 |	So in it he said
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:46,559	| IOT046 |	In the future intelligence Services might use the internet of things for identification
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,071	| IOT046 |	Surveillance
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,375	| IOT046 |	Location tracking
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,399	| IOT046 |	And targeting for recruitment
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:53,727	| IOT046 |	Or to gain access to networks or user credentials
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:56,799	| IOT046 |	Everybody was like
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:59,871	| IOT046 |	Holy cow Internet of Things
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:01,407	| IOT046 |	Could be used to spy on people
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:03,199	| IOT046 |	And I'm kind of like yeah we
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:05,759	| IOT046 |	Do that right yeah we should have
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:09,343	| IOT046 |	We've had the thing about this Samsung TVs they can listen in
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:11,647	| IOT046 |	And people are rightly worried about you know
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:15,743	| IOT046 |	The Amazon Echo they're like oh you know what they're always listening and the answer is no
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:17,023	| IOT046 |	Is not always listening
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:19,839	| IOT046 |	It only listens for about half a second when you
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:23,935	| IOT046 |	Or it only recordes sorry it only record your statement
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:25,215	| IOT046 |	4
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:25,983	| IOT046 |	About half a second
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:28,031	| IOT046 |	But it is always listening
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:29,311	| IOT046 |	It's just
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:32,639	| IOT046 |	What adheres doesn't go anywhere until here's the trigger word
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:33,919	| IOT046 |	Bright
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:36,479	| IOT046 |	And for those of you who are actually really
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:37,247	| IOT046 |	Paranoid
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:39,807	| IOT046 |	There's a setting where you can actually turn on
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:41,343	| IOT046 |	A chime
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,367	| IOT046 |	Did people make
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:44,159	| IOT046 |	When it actually is
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:46,463	| IOT046 |	Sending your words to the cloud
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:48,255	| IOT046 |	So
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:48,767	| IOT046 |	You can actually
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:54,655	| IOT046 |	While you're looking for that this was also a big to-do when Microsoft decided to require
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:56,703	| IOT046 |	Originally the Xbox
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:58,751	| IOT046 |	Kinect with the Xbox One
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:02,335	| IOT046 |	If people say that's always listening it's always looking what are they doing
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:03,615	| IOT046 |	It's under
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:05,407	| IOT046 |	Your device O Mine
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:05,919	| IOT046 |	Stacy's
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,319	| IOT046 |	Thunder sounds
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:14,111	| IOT046 |	And then there's a
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:15,135	| IOT046 |	Wake up sound
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:19,232	| IOT046 |	So it says play a confirmation sound when you wake your Alexa device
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:21,280	| IOT046 |	And then an end of request sound
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:24,096	| IOT046 |	Play confirmation sound after you finish speaking
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:24,608	| IOT046 |	Alexa
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,400	| IOT046 |	There you go
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:28,192	| IOT046 |	And they're two different things so
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:30,496	| IOT046 |	If you want one but not the other you can do that
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:31,520	| IOT046 |	Yay
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:32,800	| IOT046 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:34,592	| IOT046 |	So that's the Amazon
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,128	| IOT046 |	And Amazon
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:37,152	| IOT046 |	Keeps all that information
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,432	| IOT046 |	Sew in
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:40,480	| IOT046 |	Kind of talking to companies
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:42,528	| IOT046 |	There's a couple things that they
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,040	| IOT046 |	Think about here
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:44,320	| IOT046 |	1
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:46,624	| IOT046 |	Is people should be aware
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,392	| IOT046 |	Of what their devices
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:50,720	| IOT046 |	Not just what they do but what they have the ability
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:57,376	| IOT046 |	Okay glad I was going to say this might be too but I would say companies need to
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,912	| IOT046 |	Clearly explained
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:02,496	| IOT046 |	How these things work so that people can make their informed decisions as well
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:03,520	| IOT046 |	Yes
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,640	| IOT046 |	3
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:11,200	| IOT046 |	Companies need to also
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:16,320	| IOT046 |	Well actually companies need to make a point of not becoming a pipeline of data to
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,600	| IOT046 |	The US government
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:19,136	| IOT046 |	Dirty joke
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:23,232	| IOT046 |	Needs to remember
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:24,256	| IOT046 |	4th of May
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:27,584	| IOT046 |	Which is the protection against unreasonable search and seizure
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:28,864	| IOT046 |	Just in case you guys are like
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,912	| IOT046 |	What's happening again
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:31,424	| IOT046 |	Because
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:38,592	| IOT046 |	We got the Constitution right in front of us all the time
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:39,872	| IOT046 |	How is Caribou Coffee
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:40,640	| IOT046 |	So
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:43,712	| IOT046 |	Let's break this down because there's a couple things here
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:45,760	| IOT046 |	A reasonable and that you can do today
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:48,576	| IOT046 |	You can say hey
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:52,416	| IOT046 |	But if you're listening to the show you probably have already
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:53,952	| IOT046 |	Not done yet
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:55,232	| IOT046 |	For considering doing that
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,280	| IOT046 |	So
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:23:00,352	| IOT046 |	There are things like we're actually about to talk to
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,120	| IOT046 |	Argos
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:02,912	| IOT046 |	The show is actually
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:05,728	| IOT046 |	Making a device that actually doesn't go online
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:10,336	| IOT046 |	It does go online but it has privacy safeguards and we'll talk about that
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:13,408	| IOT046 |	So there are devices that
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:14,688	| IOT046 |	Don't actually ever have to
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,456	| IOT046 |	Connect to the cloud
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:18,528	| IOT046 |	Where the connect to the cloud in a limited way it have
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:19,040	| IOT046 |	Encryption
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,576	| IOT046 |	The CEO of
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:22,112	| IOT046 |	Silk which makes
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:22,880	| IOT046 |	The sense
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:24,672	| IOT046 |	Smart home hub that way to talk about
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,184	| IOT046 |	Is
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:27,232	| IOT046 |	They do encryption and in
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:29,280	| IOT046 |	Encryption so your data is always
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,840	| IOT046 |	If it's in the cloud encrypted
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:32,864	| IOT046 |	Device encrypted
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:35,168	| IOT046 |	So even if he has to give over your
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,448	| IOT046 |	Your data
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:37,216	| IOT046 |	All he's
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:37,984	| IOT046 |	Able to give
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,544	| IOT046 |	That's the way it should be
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,360	| IOT046 |	This means that he can't you
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,152	| IOT046 |	Build a business
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:45,920	| IOT046 |	Steak
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:46,688	| IOT046 |	Selling your data
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:48,224	| IOT046 |	So
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:48,736	| IOT046 |	Think about that
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:51,296	| IOT046 |	So there's those kind of
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:53,344	| IOT046 |	And then there's also things like
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:55,392	| IOT046 |	If your company
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:24:00,512	| IOT046 |	And they're going to give you a privacy policy maybe they should give your privacy policy that isn't like
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:02,048	| IOT046 |	40 pages of legal aid
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,584	| IOT046 |	Maybe I should be a little bit
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,096	| IOT046 |	Better
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:06,912	| IOT046 |	And maybe you should ask them like
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,472	| IOT046 |	How do you participate with the government
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,496	| IOT046 |	Do you have things
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:11,264	| IOT046 |	Looks like
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,288	| IOT046 |	Do
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:15,616	| IOT046 |	Wait for subpoenas her if the government comes to you do you just like
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:16,128	| IOT046 |	Headed over
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:19,712	| IOT046 |	Yeah. You need to understand what that companies
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:21,760	| IOT046 |	Policy is in that situation
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,320	| IOT046 |	So there are those kind of things
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:26,368	| IOT046 |	I don't know
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:26,880	| IOT046 |	Kevin what do you think
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:29,440	| IOT046 |	I mean it's it's really
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:32,000	| IOT046 |	I said this before and I don't people
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:34,816	| IOT046 |	Some people have not liked it when I say it but with we almost
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:41,216	| IOT046 |	With crossed a barrier when it comes to privacy mean if you want certain Services you're going to have to give up data
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:47,360	| IOT046 |	Having said that I'm not saying company should have free rein to do what they want with that data that's that's a totally different aspect.
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:51,968	| IOT046 |	So like you said you just say offline by devices that don't connect anywhere but
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:52,736	| IOT046 |	You know
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:58,880	| IOT046 |	It's kind of tough to go back and I want you cross that line and and have access all this information on your own the information that you want
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:00,672	| IOT046 |	What services that provide value to
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:06,304	| IOT046 |	So now I think it does come to town to some of the tenants that you just said in that is understanding
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:09,632	| IOT046 |	What advice can and can't do with a company
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:11,936	| IOT046 |	Who creates a device that provides a service
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:15,776	| IOT046 |	What it is they do what what do they collect what do they use today to 4
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:19,104	| IOT046 |	How did they Safeguard it and what situations might be
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:21,408	| IOT046 |	Might be provided to a third party
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:24,736	| IOT046 |	Weather Sacramento or not and it was just a matter of understanding
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:29,600	| IOT046 |	Of course we're assuming there's Clarity and truthfulness and what two companies tell us obviously so
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,648	| IOT046 |	There's there's a lass back there too
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:34,464	| IOT046 |	We're also assuming that when the government comes
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:35,744	| IOT046 |	I was knocking to come knocking
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:36,768	| IOT046 |	Turn my front door is supposed
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:40,608	| IOT046 |	Frappuccino come siphoning off data
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,912	| IOT046 |	Without anyone at the company knowing
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:45,728	| IOT046 |	When is prism taught us anything it's that the cover
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:49,312	| IOT046 |	It's like you don't want to give us your data
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:50,848	| IOT046 |	Let's go hack into your
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:51,360	| IOT046 |	Fiber optic
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:56,224	| IOT046 |	So in case there's a lot you can do
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:57,248	| IOT046 |	Except
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,016	| IOT046 |	Not have the stuff
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:01,344	| IOT046 |	I'm so you know there's also this idea that
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:03,648	| IOT046 |	Encryption is really your
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:04,928	| IOT046 |	Choice
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:05,696	| IOT046 |	So
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:10,304	| IOT046 |	If that's that's kind of demoralize I can sad because there are very few devices out there that are
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:10,816	| IOT046 |	Being sold
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:17,216	| IOT046 |	It is that I think that's going to change over time but they're just going to be
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:20,800	| IOT046 |	Too much backlash over privacy in that people will not
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:23,872	| IOT046 |	Many people should say will not buy these devices
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:26,176	| IOT046 |	Unless they know their data is at least encrypted
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:30,528	| IOT046 |	So with that in mind as a consumer maybe start looking for things that are only in
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:33,600	| IOT046 |	As a journalist I'm going to start asking
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,904	| IOT046 |	A lot more questions about this
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,976	| IOT046 |	Keep that in mind as I
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:40,512	| IOT046 |	Going to interview
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:44,608	| IOT046 |	Andrea's call who is the CEO of silk which is a company that makes the sense hub
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:46,912	| IOT046 |	And I will also say
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:49,216	| IOT046 |	Just for those of you guys who are out there and
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,520	| IOT046 |	Oh man
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:52,800	| IOT046 |	The netatmo gear
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:54,848	| IOT046 |	Which is from
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:56,896	| IOT046 |	That I know haha
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:27:00,992	| IOT046 |	They make a presence camera
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:02,784	| IOT046 |	Their stuff
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:03,296	| IOT046 |	Is
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,088	| IOT046 |	It's all data
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:07,392	| IOT046 |	Stored on a physical device
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:09,440	| IOT046 |	Or that the presence camera is on
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:13,280	| IOT046 |	Is a camera where the data is stored on the device are on an SD card
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,304	| IOT046 |	Aldo store
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:15,840	| IOT046 |	The server
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:16,352	| IOT046 |	Have yours
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:21,216	| IOT046 |	So if your privacy-conscious this is a good device
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:21,984	| IOT046 |	Are you
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:22,496	| IOT046 |	Because
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:25,056	| IOT046 |	It stays in your home and in your network
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:27,104	| IOT046 |	I don't believe it's encrypted though
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:30,176	| IOT046 |	Well it's still a step
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:31,968	| IOT046 |	I had its that you're not relying on
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:39,136	| IOT046 |	The company is providing the service to actually store your data you can control your own server if you like whether it's encrypted or not
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:40,928	| IOT046 |	At least you know
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:44,768	| IOT046 |	You're managing it and that's another challenge to an obstacle but
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:47,840	| IOT046 |	Within your realm of
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:48,864	| IOT046 |	Patrol little bit more
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:50,400	| IOT046 |	Right and if you don't want to manage it UK
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:54,240	| IOT046 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,264	| IOT046 |	So now
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,032	| IOT046 |	We will
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:56,800	| IOT046 |	Closeout
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:28:02,432	| IOT046 |	A Chia Pet show so much fun and information and we will go interview on Driscoll who is made this
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:08,320	| IOT046 |	Smart home hub and he is the former CTO of Mozilla so privacy is important
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:14,720	| IOT046 |	We are going to learn all about using actually facial recognition
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:21,120	| IOT046 |	Send to build a better smarter
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:23,168	| IOT046 |	Hey everyone welcome back
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:27,008	| IOT046 |	Did The Internet of Things podcast I am your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:29,824	| IOT046 |	Is Andrea's Google who is the
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:32,128	| IOT046 |	Founder and CEO of silk
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:33,920	| IOT046 |	How are you
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:35,712	| IOT046 |	I got the great to be here
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:39,808	| IOT046 |	Thanks for coming so you guys are introducing
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:40,576	| IOT046 |	Kickstarter
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:43,136	| IOT046 |	A Brand New Concept in the connected home
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:44,928	| IOT046 |	That is quite frankly beautiful
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,464	| IOT046 |	You better tell us what it is
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:52,864	| IOT046 |	Actually what you're trying to make is a device that can act as the ears and eyes and importantly the brain of your house
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:58,240	| IOT046 |	Respond to you and help you with all the it device.
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:28:59,520	| IOT046 |	Okay
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:00,800	| IOT046 |	So
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:01,824	| IOT046 |	It is
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:03,616	| IOT046 |	Fruit for you guys who are like there
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:05,408	| IOT046 |	Okay that sounds kind of cool
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,688	| IOT046 |	It is a smart home hub
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:09,248	| IOT046 |	It has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:10,528	| IOT046 |	Has a camera
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:12,576	| IOT046 |	And it does image recognition
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:16,160	| IOT046 |	For me it when I saw it I was
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:20,000	| IOT046 |	So it's like the welcome camera combined
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:22,304	| IOT046 |	You know me software that like
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:23,584	| IOT046 |	Controls
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,352	| IOT046 |	All of your
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,120	| IOT046 |	Devices
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:25,888	| IOT046 |	Plus something else
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:27,936	| IOT046 |	And that something else is
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,216	| IOT046 |	Port of the IntelliJ
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:30,240	| IOT046 |	But
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:31,776	| IOT046 |	It's hot out so I haven't tried it
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:34,336	| IOT046 |	But
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:36,640	| IOT046 |	Your address is here to tell us kind of like
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:38,176	| IOT046 |	Why he built
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:38,944	| IOT046 |	So
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:39,968	| IOT046 |	Why are you guys doing this
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:44,832	| IOT046 |	Because
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:46,880	| IOT046 |	Excited about the potential
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:49,184	| IOT046 |	Listen to don't think such devices
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:51,488	| IOT046 |	But you're not really satisfied this is state
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:52,256	| IOT046 |	The art
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:53,792	| IOT046 |	As you can buy them in a store today
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:56,352	| IOT046 |	Something not intelligent and not responsive enough
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:57,376	| IOT046 |	You have to come home and
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:59,168	| IOT046 |	Use a smartphone to control your house
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:00,704	| IOT046 |	And said I want to come home and
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:01,984	| IOT046 |	I want my house to recognize me
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:05,824	| IOT046 |	That was the driving force behind making this device
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:08,128	| IOT046 |	It in the demos that I've seen it
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:11,712	| IOT046 |	Basically this thing when someone walks
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:17,600	| IOT046 |	I recognize this person's face and I know what they like and so I'm turning on their radio station
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:20,416	| IOT046 |	Nest thermostat to what they like and I'm playing their music
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:21,952	| IOT046 |	And
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:22,976	| IOT046 |	It's kind of cool
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,512	| IOT046 |	And
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:29,632	| IOT046 |	It kind of gets to this idea that I'm hearing a lot more from start-ups which is your smart home should be responsive
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:31,424	| IOT046 |	Not actually smart
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,704	| IOT046 |	Because smart is just like
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:33,984	| IOT046 |	It's not happening
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:35,264	| IOT046 |	Is that a fair assessment
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,944	| IOT046 |	Call from Santa
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:43,968	| IOT046 |	Smart
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:45,760	| IOT046 |	Wifi light bulb
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:49,856	| IOT046 |	W not smart at all they just remote controlled by a smartphone
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:52,416	| IOT046 |	Search for use of the word smart
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:56,512	| IOT046 |	Staying away from the term smarter than you use responsible for intelligent instead
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:58,816	| IOT046 |	Because the word smartass or overloaded
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:02,400	| IOT046 |	And used for devices that we don't leave receive a smart or intelligent
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:06,240	| IOT046 |	And you told me about your nest as an example of a first-generation
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:11,360	| IOT046 |	And if connected home product can you kind of talk to me a little bit about what a first gen
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:12,128	| IOT046 |	Product
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:12,896	| IOT046 |	Is an
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:13,920	| IOT046 |	Why that's a problem
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:18,784	| IOT046 |	Yeah so it was Nest devices
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:19,296	| IOT046 |	Until then
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,344	| IOT046 |	Some promised
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:24,672	| IOT046 |	This idea that the heating in your house will self-regulate
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:31,328	| IOT046 |	After that, said that's very much rooted is built on the Harborside
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:34,912	| IOT046 |	On the hardware side he was very simple sensors
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:36,192	| IOT046 |	Motion detector
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:38,752	| IOT046 |	How many people are in the room
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:41,056	| IOT046 |	And they cannot tell the people apart
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:42,592	| IOT046 |	O'mighty changing a second
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:43,104	| IOT046 |	On the nest
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:46,432	| IOT046 |	He doesn't bring enough
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:47,456	| IOT046 |	Different resources
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:54,368	| IOT046 |	Do they make Intelligent Decisions for you is be limited in this reflects often experience
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,136	| IOT046 |	Tell you that
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:56,672	| IOT046 |	The device canopy
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:32:00,256	| IOT046 |	Deborah heater a lot of people in the end and start using it
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:03,072	| IOT046 |	Beautiful Emmanuel and non smart thermostat
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:09,728	| IOT046 |	So you were telling me that you like your nest for example at 65 and your girlfriend likes it at 75
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,520	| IOT046 |	And so
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,288	| IOT046 |	From your disrespect
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:14,848	| IOT046 |	It just knows that there's this
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:16,128	| IOT046 |	Continuum Shift back and forth
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:17,408	| IOT046 |	Temperature
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,944	| IOT046 |	So for your device
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:21,248	| IOT046 |	It would know that
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:23,808	| IOT046 |	Not necessarily you but a person that looks like you
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:28,672	| IOT046 |	A person. Completely different person it would be changing the temperature because got the facial
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:29,440	| IOT046 |	Mission
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:32,768	| IOT046 |	I think that the first step to be able to solve
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:33,536	| IOT046 |	These problems
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,304	| IOT046 |	Offer
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:38,144	| IOT046 |	Experiences for these devices to understand their surroundings
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:43,520	| IOT046 |	It's not enough that the motion sensor that tells you there's something moving a room just one or multiple people or pets
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:45,056	| IOT046 |	You have to have something in it
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:46,848	| IOT046 |	What happens around
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:49,664	| IOT046 |	So this is why they're bringing a lot of computational power
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:50,432	| IOT046 |	Miss Tobias
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,968	| IOT046 |	Camera in your room
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:56,576	| IOT046 |	I can see the individual of people there you can read recognize familiar people
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,112	| IOT046 |	It's a flex strangers
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:33:02,208	| IOT046 |	Information to use to make my own decisions for you
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:04,256	| IOT046 |	So then
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:05,024	| IOT046 |	That's the problem
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,304	| IOT046 |	Now how do you actually
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:09,120	| IOT046 |	If you were telling me with your girlfriend
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:11,424	| IOT046 |	The solution is its just 75 in
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:16,288	| IOT046 |	People that individual preference
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:21,408	| IOT046 |	Probably is until you have sufficient information to understand what's going on
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:23,712	| IOT046 |	You cannot offer any meaningful solution to this
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:27,040	| IOT046 |	Schedule nest if there's two people in the house that like different temperatures
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:28,576	| IOT046 |	Onesti's going to see that
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:30,880	| IOT046 |	The temperature has been set back and forth
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,904	| IOT046 |	Palio's
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:35,488	| IOT046 |	And then not be able to understand that this is because
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:39,328	| IOT046 |	Sometimes you're cool and sometimes you warm because two people fighting over thermostat
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,120	| IOT046 |	Soproxi the first episode
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:45,216	| IOT046 |	Increased amount of information is available to understand what's going on
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:49,312	| IOT046 |	In our case we can do the receipt that two different people are selling used to be different temperatures
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:56,480	| IOT046 |	Which one would you prefer to apply
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:58,272	| IOT046 |	Are the same time
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:02,880	| IOT046 |	Go Solutions
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:03,904	| IOT046 |	The previously
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:05,440	| IOT046 |	Penis
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:08,512	| IOT046 |	It goes back between two temperatures when sitting in the middle
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:09,792	| IOT046 |	Atlantic bullion happy
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:11,072	| IOT046 |	Got it
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:12,096	| IOT046 |	It's obb
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:13,888	| IOT046 |	Temperature may not be a great
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:15,680	| IOT046 |	Like example for this because it's pretty
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,704	| IOT046 |	Fighter you're either hot or cold
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:19,776	| IOT046 |	In a lot of ways you know where you can make everyone unhappy
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:20,544	| IOT046 |	What's the temperature at 7
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:23,104	| IOT046 |	You're too boring your girlfriend
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:23,616	| IOT046 |	Cold
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:26,176	| IOT046 |	But for things like
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:28,736	| IOT046 |	Lighting it might be really interesting because you know
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:33,088	| IOT046 |	Don't you see the whole family's coming home or maybe a bunch of strangers are over in your house can be lies
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:36,416	| IOT046 |	Maybe they're having a dinner party or maybe this is happy
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:38,208	| IOT046 |	And then
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:39,232	| IOT046 |	Does become
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:40,768	| IOT046 |	Interesting
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:41,536	| IOT046 |	It can make
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:42,560	| IOT046 |	With greater
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:44,352	| IOT046 |	Pieces of information that can make
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:46,144	| IOT046 |	Decisions that could be useful
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:48,192	| IOT046 |	So I like this
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:49,728	| IOT046 |	Now
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:54,592	| IOT046 |	With the idea of bringing facial recognition into it and having a camera that's something that people get freaked out of
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:57,152	| IOT046 |	So how are you going to dress ideas
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,968	| IOT046 |	Oh my God there's a camera in my house and
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:03,552	| IOT046 |	There's a whole search engine right now
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:04,832	| IOT046 |	People can have
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:07,648	| IOT046 |	Hack into cameras and that's freaking them out
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:08,928	| IOT046 |	I don't know
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:09,696	| IOT046 |	What about that
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:10,464	| IOT046 |	People in
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:11,744	| IOT046 |	They don't want their naked butts on the way
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:13,024	| IOT046 |	That's how you can sum up camera
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:14,048	| IOT046 |	People's houses right now
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:18,656	| IOT046 |	I can very much later that I spent the last seven years or so of my life
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:19,424	| IOT046 |	Looking for Missoula
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:24,288	| IOT046 |	Most recent technology
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,824	| IOT046 |	Important to me and
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:28,640	| IOT046 |	I'm very much worried about these developments
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:30,432	| IOT046 |	What's wrong with you by don't answer example
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:34,016	| IOT046 |	It's almost as if Google is moving in as your roommate
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:35,296	| IOT046 |	It's always watching you
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:41,184	| IOT046 |	420 concert yard
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:45,536	| IOT046 |	Spy camera devices
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:50,144	| IOT046 |	So this is one of the reasons that you put a lot of computational power into the device itself
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:53,728	| IOT046 |	Instabox able to do computer vision tasks locally in the device
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:57,056	| IOT046 |	I can talk to the cloud
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:35:59,872	| IOT046 |	But it does not have to send out the actual video stream
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:06,528	| IOT046 |	All your personal data on all the imagery stays inside your house
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,576	| IOT046 |	And advise maybe sense off bedtime for me
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:13,184	| IOT046 |	Notified When a Stranger is in your house
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:14,720	| IOT046 |	It's not recognized by the device
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:18,048	| IOT046 |	Analysis of all the pictures
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:19,072	| IOT046 |	But not send it to the cloud
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:23,424	| IOT046 |	The only thing that would be sent to the cloud is one actually financially if someone recognized
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:27,520	| IOT046 |	And a picture with not knowing who the Clown
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:32,640	| IOT046 |	Okay that's awesome so it has to have some Cloud connectivity
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:37,504	| IOT046 |	Could it be set up so there is no connect Cloud connectivity through like my own after
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:38,784	| IOT046 |	To be server or anything like that
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:42,368	| IOT046 |	Absolutely does not rely on the cloud at all
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:44,160	| IOT046 |	The demo that before you earlier
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:46,976	| IOT046 |	Actually it is complete
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:49,280	| IOT046 |	Because I didn't want to rely on
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:51,584	| IOT046 |	Current connectivity
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:56,192	| IOT046 |	Do you use for car connectivity
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:56,960	| IOT046 |	You can do that
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:36:59,520	| IOT046 |	Is it preferred that is completed
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:01,056	| IOT046 |	It's a possibility as well
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:03,104	| IOT046 |	Baby trying to put all the data
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:05,152	| IOT046 |	In your house after you control
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,688	| IOT046 |	You decide what happens
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:08,480	| IOT046 |	And you know we're going somewhere doesn't
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:11,296	| IOT046 |	Okay that's really promising
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:12,576	| IOT046 |	Cuz I know I got a lot of
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:14,368	| IOT046 |	I got a lot of people ask
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:15,136	| IOT046 |	Give me about
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:16,160	| IOT046 |	Good devices if there
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,440	| IOT046 |	Worried about that sort of
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:21,280	| IOT046 |	Is there a slot for an SD card if I want to save anything
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:31,264	| IOT046 |	SD card for internal storage
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:38,176	| IOT046 |	Device if you do that because someone can come in and steal the device in the new SD card is gone
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:41,760	| IOT046 |	Seth Rollins
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:45,600	| IOT046 |	Information that might affect your privacy so
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:46,368	| IOT046 |	Weekend
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:49,184	| IOT046 |	Not notify you and not store videos
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:51,488	| IOT046 |	The stranger the house at longer someone
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:52,256	| IOT046 |	Hungrier in the house
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:59,424	| IOT046 |	Limited to Simply if there's nobody know the device in the house and a stranger pops up then you can send a video clip to you
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:00,448	| IOT046 |	In stored in the cloud
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:06,848	| IOT046 |	Giving you so much better degree of course
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:07,360	| IOT046 |	What's happening around it
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:08,896	| IOT046 |	And how because
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:13,504	| IOT046 |	One of the things is the smarter these things get the more difficult it is
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:14,016	| IOT046 |	Programming
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:15,552	| IOT046 |	Or rather maybe it's
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:17,856	| IOT046 |	The Dumber they are the more difficult it is
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:18,624	| IOT046 |	How to program them
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:19,904	| IOT046 |	Because you're sitting here going
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:22,720	| IOT046 |	If this then that
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:24,768	| IOT046 |	My experience
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:26,304	| IOT046 |	Playing with a lot of my
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:29,632	| IOT046 |	So how is it that I am supposed
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:30,400	| IOT046 |	The program
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:30,912	| IOT046 |	This particular
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:37,568	| IOT046 |	Yeah so there such things as I think it's make it accessible to much broader range of people
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:43,456	| IOT046 |	Am I mature I'm smart enough to program is this my parents cannot do that
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:45,504	| IOT046 |	Technology that makes
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:46,528	| IOT046 |	Feast of Isis
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:48,576	| IOT046 |	Smart intelligent than accessible to everyone
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:55,488	| IOT046 |	You can sweetie program you don't have to program or device
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:00,352	| IOT046 |	Behaviors
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:03,936	| IOT046 |	The device essentially interacts with you and tries to learn your behavior
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:05,472	| IOT046 |	It's okay have to program it
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:09,312	| IOT046 |	Ability for developers to get access to the device and they can
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:11,872	| IOT046 |	Programs they can publish them in the marketplace
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:14,688	| IOT046 |	Would like these experiences
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:15,968	| IOT046 |	Meet Developers
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:21,088	| IOT046 |	What are consumed by consumers will Marketplace that's easier than having to program the device directly
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:24,928	| IOT046 |	It's similar to the way that you go to that Apple Store
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:26,464	| IOT046 |	ITunes Store
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:29,536	| IOT046 |	Will the Android Google Play Store on the smartphones
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:33,376	| IOT046 |	Top 10 new behaviors and new capabilities for your device
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:34,144	| IOT046 |	How to program that yourself
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:36,960	| IOT046 |	So you guys are releasing an SDK along with
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:41,568	| IOT046 |	Switches awesome you also are trying to build this app store mod
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:42,336	| IOT046 |	Which
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:44,640	| IOT046 |	Because I've been doing this for a really long time
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:50,528	| IOT046 |	I have heard before so I would love to understand because historically this hasn't worked as well
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:52,064	| IOT046 |	Partially because
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:55,136	| IOT046 |	The audience hasn't been big is very hard to make a market for this order
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:39:57,184	| IOT046 |	And also because
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:40:00,512	| IOT046 |	Actually supposed to because there isn't a huge market for a lot of these apps
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:01,792	| IOT046 |	Developers haven't slept
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:02,816	| IOT046 |	Because there is no mark
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:03,584	| IOT046 |	So
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:04,864	| IOT046 |	How are you guys going
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:06,912	| IOT046 |	Kind of seed this and how are you guys doing
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:11,264	| IOT046 |	Yeah so it's actually really right now there's more learning
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:15,616	| IOT046 |	Rotation this message right to really unlock what these experiences feel like
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:17,920	| IOT046 |	And the way you want to interact this is ontology
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:21,504	| IOT046 |	Cisco's device of Jamaica right now
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:23,040	| IOT046 |	It's not going to get the mouse Market
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:26,624	| IOT046 |	Is aiming in early adopters and developers who would like to learn the sauce
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:31,488	| IOT046 |	What are the right behaviors and what is intelligent behavior that they won't have home devices
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:32,768	| IOT046 |	Does Marketplace is not
EDL	00:40:32,768	00:40:35,840	| IOT046 |	Meant as a place right now to make money for us for fathers
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:38,144	| IOT046 |	Amen to the place where
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:39,680	| IOT046 |	Experience
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:41,472	| IOT046 |	Early adopters
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:45,312	| IOT046 |	The first McDonald in Estacada and learn how to program this device
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:50,432	| IOT046 |	Would like to
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:52,480	| IOT046 |	In the future when I come home and stop this happens for me
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:56,832	| IOT046 |	But for soda coupons
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:41:01,696	| IOT046 |	We can bring into existence today
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:02,976	| IOT046 |	This is like a dream this Kickstarter
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:05,792	| IOT046 |	Okay well I want to live in that world
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:06,560	| IOT046 |	So
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:11,680	| IOT046 |	If I want to live in that world today I would give you guys $249 I believe
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:12,960	| IOT046 |	On Kickstarter
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:16,032	| IOT046 |	And then I would get this when do you think it'll ship
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:21,920	| IOT046 |	Century in Ventura
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:23,712	| IOT046 |	And we have
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:26,784	| IOT046 |	Designs that we will have a short video off on pages
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:30,624	| IOT046 |	Tektronix and deductible design for this
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:34,720	| IOT046 |	And they also fail far along the soffit pieces in the air show in a couple demo stuff that here and there
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:37,024	| IOT046 |	Visol dated this year
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:39,072	| IOT046 |	Okay I can't wait
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:41,120	| IOT046 |	I definitely will
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:43,424	| IOT046 |	I don't have a $250 for a hug
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:45,984	| IOT046 |	Okay let me think about it
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:46,752	| IOT046 |	I will think about it
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:59,295	| IOT046 |	Especially the ones that you can buy today like
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:00,831	| IOT046 |	It's a little thing at the hot in the closet
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:02,623	| IOT046 |	End up
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:05,695	| IOT046 |	It's necessary so some other device function
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:10,303	| IOT046 |	Experience.
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:13,375	| IOT046 |	I strongly believe in five or ten years all of us will experience today
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:29,247	| IOT046 |	Given the nature of what it does I feel like I would have to have this piece of the future like in a couple rooms of my house
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:30,783	| IOT046 |	Hold me back a little
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:33,087	| IOT046 |	In the future you will
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:34,623	| IOT046 |	Stop device like this
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:37,439	| IOT046 |	He's got that ability some devices all around your house
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:40,255	| IOT046 |	And Austin is not being dedicated devices
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:44,607	| IOT046 |	4K TV these days too often with a camera built in
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:46,911	| IOT046 |	Spy camera
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:50,751	| IOT046 |	I sent you this is this is this technology
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:55,615	| IOT046 |	We would like to help the industry
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:59,711	| IOT046 |	Cameras and other sensors in there and also to visit in a better privacy
EDL	00:42:59,711	00:43:00,223	| IOT046 |	Preserving faith
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:05,343	| IOT046 |	Today at countryview are using
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:08,671	| IOT046 |	Even if you only have one device that you have purchased
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:09,439	| IOT046 |	Kickstarter
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:11,743	| IOT046 |	He might be able to see you only one room
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:16,095	| IOT046 |	Signature if you're carrying a funeral miss you
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:17,887	| IOT046 |	Let me know when you are home
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:20,191	| IOT046 |	What can you use the house for another door because you Lucas
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:23,007	| IOT046 |	So it is not
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:27,103	| IOT046 |	Exactly the rolled in 5 or 10 years where there's a camera on a device I can every room
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:33,759	| IOT046 |	And you to put this device in a prominent position in the living room
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:37,087	| IOT046 |	Design it was a very nice appealing
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:39,647	| IOT046 |	Physical design that fits into your life in your living room
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:42,975	| IOT046 |	Is there a charge to put in a place where it can see you
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:48,095	| IOT046 |	Got it yes I think I would rather trust you over you know baby Samsung
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:52,447	| IOT046 |	Or any of the other big device manufacturers with a camera in my living room
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:55,007	| IOT046 |	I mean we have a lot back on doing this
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:56,799	| IOT046 |	I have done personally
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:58,847	| IOT046 |	Missoula last 7 years
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:01,919	| IOT046 |	Working on improving the state of privacy on the internet
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:03,711	| IOT046 |	But you're not
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:05,503	| IOT046 |	Because
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:08,063	| IOT046 |	You seem to be more trustworthy than some others
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:11,647	| IOT046 |	Fundamental design devices
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:14,975	| IOT046 |	Technology that makes it impossible to get this wrong
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:18,047	| IOT046 |	What are some things to do for the video streaming software example
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:20,607	| IOT046 |	Is the device is a smartphone
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:22,399	| IOT046 |	Using short distance
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:24,959	| IOT046 |	Is Bluetooth called acacian to exchange cryptographic keys
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:29,055	| IOT046 |	And then she can only be exchanged if you're very close physical proximity
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:30,079	| IOT046 |	The device
EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:33,663	| IOT046 |	Only did that key on your smartphone can you ever watch
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:35,199	| IOT046 |	A stream of the device
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:41,087	| IOT046 |	Give me a shout when you're traveling
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:44,671	| IOT046 |	Smartphones for direct physical proximity
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:46,463	| IOT046 |	Wait to see that stream
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:47,999	| IOT046 |	So it might seem
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:53,887	| IOT046 |	Scary articles on my search engines for little things baking like watching other people's cameras by either
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:55,935	| IOT046 |	Defective camera
EDL	00:44:55,935	00:44:59,007	| IOT046 |	Or I'm flexible losing a password or someone guessing their password
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:03,359	| IOT046 |	Search engine
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:06,687	| IOT046 |	Because obviously Miss end-to-end encrypted between you and a smartphone
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:07,967	| IOT046 |	Add devices in your house
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:10,015	| IOT046 |	Okay that's a bold statement
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:11,039	| IOT046 |	Maybe I will do
EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:12,319	| IOT046 |	Okay
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:14,623	| IOT046 |	Well thank you so much Andreas for coming on the show.
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:16,671	| IOT046 |	Thanks very much
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:18,975	| IOT046 |	That doesn't fit this week's episode
