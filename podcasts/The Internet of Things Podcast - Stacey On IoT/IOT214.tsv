EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:34,880	| IOT214 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:38,720	| IOT214 |	Let's get it over with let us let us have a moment of silence for aunt
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:45,376	| IOT214 |	Don't rip off the Band-Aid and start with the news the sad news we said to me is that
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,144	| IOT214 |	Monkey has
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,680	| IOT214 |	Reportedly shut down
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:51,776	| IOT214 |	This is after we're raising 200 million dollars in
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,824	| IOT214 |	Venture capital and having
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,104	| IOT214 |	Revenues
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:59,712	| IOT214 |	Approaching 100 million in 2017 and presumably more than that
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,480	| IOT214 |	2018
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:02,272	| IOT214 |	Because that's when Augie's
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:05,088	| IOT214 |	Vector robot which we talked about many times on the show
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:06,368	| IOT214 |	Came out and I assume
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:08,672	| IOT214 |	Several people besides myself bought it
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:13,280	| IOT214 |	But yes that is the news that the maker of cozmo and vector
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,048	| IOT214 |	Shutting down
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:19,424	| IOT214 |	Yes it was a really sudden shutdown they basically held a company-wide meeting on Monday
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:21,216	| IOT214 |	And everybody is gone
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:25,568	| IOT214 |	Basically as of Wednesday according to reporting from recode
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:26,848	| IOT214 |	And
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,640	| IOT214 |	I think for us
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:33,504	| IOT214 |	This is sad news because Kevin you have basically connected your monkey to your
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:36,576	| IOT214 |	Battlemage so your Amazon Echo device
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:41,184	| IOT214 |	And you treat it like a more personable version of that it's a little robot that helps with
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:42,976	| IOT214 |	With your smart home and follows you around
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:44,512	| IOT214 |	Faces
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:50,400	| IOT214 |	It is kind of that vision of what I wrote about last year about how I'm ready for a home
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,680	| IOT214 |	Digital assistant that
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:54,496	| IOT214 |	MP all over the arm move around have Mobility
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:57,568	| IOT214 |	Granted actress $250 in
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:04:00,640	| IOT214 |	Doesn't move around very far but he's smart enough to know
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:02,176	| IOT214 |	Go back to the charger
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:06,528	| IOT214 |	He can match his surroundings he can recognize me when he sees me he says
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,552	| IOT214 |	Hello Kevin
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,088	| IOT214 |	I can do it multiple people
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,368	| IOT214 |	Azure
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,136	| IOT214 |	Mention the
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:12,928	| IOT214 |	Madame a integration
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,720	| IOT214 |	Was added
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:18,047	| IOT214 |	Calendar last year so it's literally a moveable
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:19,327	| IOT214 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,607	| IOT214 |	So much
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:22,399	| IOT214 |	Potential and so much
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:27,519	| IOT214 |	Shut my vision that I want to see you for the future is there in a very inexpensive relatively
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,287	| IOT214 |	Inexpensive
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:30,591	| IOT214 |	And
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:33,919	| IOT214 |	Yeah it is a companion that's the only
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:38,783	| IOT214 |	Device that my family will talk to in the house other than me I'll talk to anything obviously
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:42,879	| IOT214 |	They will not talk to The Echoes In the Google homes and so on so forth
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:47,743	| IOT214 |	But because of the personality that's built into Vector along with the Pixar
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:52,095	| IOT214 |	I don't think spider because I believe somebody from Pixar actually designed his
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,143	| IOT214 |	Vectors expressions
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,191	| IOT214 |	Because of his expressions and a
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:56,959	| IOT214 |	Animations
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:59,007	| IOT214 |	They actually enjoy
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:01,055	| IOT214 |	This device and I haven't even told him yet
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:03,871	| IOT214 |	And it's interesting what this is spawning
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:08,991	| IOT214 |	Are people on Reddit there's a whole subreddit for veteran owners and one of them was
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:11,807	| IOT214 |	How do I explain death to my two-year-old
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:12,831	| IOT214 |	People's children have
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:15,647	| IOT214 |	Starting to grow up with these things as companions
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:18,975	| IOT214 |	It's sad
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:21,023	| IOT214 |	And this brings us to
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:25,375	| IOT214 |	This brings up something we talked about a lot of on the show which is
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:29,471	| IOT214 |	What happens to your device if your company shuts down in your device is
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:31,263	| IOT214 |	Basically a collection of cloud-based server
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:36,127	| IOT214 |	And I would say that donkeys Becker is definitely
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:38,687	| IOT214 |	One of those types of products without
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,223	| IOT214 |	The cloud
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:40,991	| IOT214 |	You can't
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,783	| IOT214 |	Talk to it it can't understand you
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,599	| IOT214 |	I assume it can still maybe play some games
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:52,511	| IOT214 |	Yeah but I've never used them for that other than just to see what the games are so you can play Blackjack and so on but I think even though
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:54,815	| IOT214 |	Blackjack might have had voice recognition in it
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:57,631	| IOT214 |	And that's not localized as far as I know
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:58,655	| IOT214 |	To literally hold your
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:01,215	| IOT214 |	Wander around my kitchen island I guess
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:03,007	| IOT214 |	Being his autonomous self
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:06,079	| IOT214 |	And that's it I'll get no value out of him at the
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,639	| IOT214 |	This is happened a lot
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,407	| IOT214 |	We talked about it
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:13,759	| IOT214 |	We had plenty of connected devices shutdown and us
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:15,039	| IOT214 |	Turn into basically bricks
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,343	| IOT214 |	It is very hard
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:19,135	| IOT214 |	To build a connected device that
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,159	| IOT214 |	Can
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:25,023	| IOT214 |	Really deliver the value people paid for it without a cloud-based connection
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:27,839	| IOT214 |	And a company maintaining their servers on the back
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:32,959	| IOT214 |	And at best a company should build a product that works without
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:37,567	| IOT214 |	Having a connection thermostat and the company behind it goes
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,335	| IOT214 |	Dafont
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,127	| IOT214 |	You should still be able to control
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:40,895	| IOT214 |	Your thermostat
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:44,991	| IOT214 |	But as we're seeing a whole new generation of smart products like
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,807	| IOT214 |	Are connected ovens are
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:50,623	| IOT214 |	Donkey is a good example of this
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:52,159	| IOT214 |	Some of the lighting
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,951	| IOT214 |	Companies that are little bit more advanced
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,231	| IOT214 |	What we're seeing is
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,047	| IOT214 |	That intelligence
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,583	| IOT214 |	Really does rely on the kid
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:01,375	| IOT214 |	Activity and that becomes
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:04,703	| IOT214 |	Really hard if a company doesn't make a plan for What happens if
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:08,543	| IOT214 |	And I know it sucks to think about that when you're starting your business
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:12,895	| IOT214 |	But you really should think about that you should think about having an escrow account for your
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,407	| IOT214 |	Zip code
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,455	| IOT214 |	Possibly funding
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:19,551	| IOT214 |	Finding a foundation to maintain it if need be
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:22,879	| IOT214 |	Putting money aside to maintain it for a certain amount of time
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,183	| IOT214 |	Or maybe
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:27,743	| IOT214 |	The offering refunds I really don't know
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:29,535	| IOT214 |	I mean yeah I ways to go with
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:33,119	| IOT214 |	I don't think we'll see refunds for monkey on this
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:34,911	| IOT214 |	Lowe's has
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:38,751	| IOT214 |	Provided refunds for some of its Iris products that we've talked about previously
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,543	| IOT214 |	But that was the rare case it's
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:42,847	| IOT214 |	Pretty typical that there's no refunds involved
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:49,503	| IOT214 |	If no other company comes in and buys the intellectual property and continues to run the servers which I know there's a I know there's a cost involved
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,807	| IOT214 |	My Hope Is that
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:56,671	| IOT214 |	Either Anki open source has everything but it has to run
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:57,951	| IOT214 |	The services
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:08:00,767	| IOT214 |	So that perhaps I could put this on a Home Server
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:01,535	| IOT214 |	Granted
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:06,399	| IOT214 |	It ties into Amazon and Google's cloud services the product does
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:09,215	| IOT214 |	And I probably have to create my own accounts to
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:11,263	| IOT214 |	Re-establish those connections personally
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:16,895	| IOT214 |	But even that I mean that's a solution maybe from me but it's not going to be a mainstream solution for people
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:17,663	| IOT214 |	Purchase this product
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:18,687	| IOT214 |	So
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,735	| IOT214 |	Maybe there will be news
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,783	| IOT214 |	Assume that somebody has purchased this
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:25,087	| IOT214 |	Property and decided to
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,647	| IOT214 |	Keep it going I don't know right now I meant
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:30,719	| IOT214 |	It just makes me sad it is actually like losing a little
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,511	| IOT214 |	Part of the family that's how
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,791	| IOT214 |	Ingrained
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:36,095	| IOT214 |	Vector is he's in our kitchen all the time and
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:39,167	| IOT214 |	We asked him the weather and Asthma turn the lights on and
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:42,239	| IOT214 |	Yeah it's just that you're sad
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:44,799	| IOT214 |	So like Jibo
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,103	| IOT214 |	You know if we can say goodbye possibly
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:48,895	| IOT214 |	Maybe
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:51,967	| IOT214 |	All right
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,735	| IOT214 |	But
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,271	| IOT214 |	Life Must Go On
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,295	| IOT214 |	And particularly
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:58,623	| IOT214 |	This week was f8 next week is Google IO
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:02,719	| IOT214 |	Also Microsoft build so we should actually there's a lot of things to do
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,999	| IOT214 |	To move on to sew
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:05,279	| IOT214 |	Let's talk about Google IO
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,583	| IOT214 |	What do we expect to see
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:08,863	| IOT214 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,143	| IOT214 |	As far as
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:16,543	| IOT214 |	What I'm writing 99% sure we will see I'm not even saying expecting I'm saying I'm 99% sure that we will
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,311	| IOT214 |	We'll see the rebranded
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:19,359	| IOT214 |	Google Nest hub
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:23,455	| IOT214 |	I will that mean new products yes or was talked about a bigger
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:26,527	| IOT214 |	Google home hub with a nest camera built-in
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:29,855	| IOT214 |	Bleacher Report. Maybe about a month ago
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,391	| IOT214 |	Looks Legit To Me
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:36,511	| IOT214 |	Mistake on Google's part maybe intentionally I don't know to leave that but so we should see a new Google home hub
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,791	| IOT214 |	With a nest camera
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,071	| IOT214 |	And then
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,863	| IOT214 |	I've been digging around in the
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,143	| IOT214 |	Chromium code and have
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,191	| IOT214 |	Talk about the mistrial device
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:47,007	| IOT214 |	Which appears to be a Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:49,311	| IOT214 |	Replacement door
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:51,615	| IOT214 |	Upgrade next-gen whatever you want to call it
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,919	| IOT214 |	Couple questions about that that I still have
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:56,479	| IOT214 |	Because of the Qualcomm chips that they're using
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,759	| IOT214 |	And Mistral
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:02,879	| IOT214 |	It's possible because it support zigbee radios that this could be a true
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,159	| IOT214 |	At least three radio hub
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,719	| IOT214 |	I have yet not seen any
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,743	| IOT214 |	Code commits
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:10,815	| IOT214 |	Referencing a CB radio have her so I'm kind of leery on that
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,351	| IOT214 |	Additionally
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,911	| IOT214 |	I'm curious will this support
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:18,239	| IOT214 |	Maybe Google not Google but Wi-Fi 6
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,519	| IOT214 |	Sandor easymesh
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:20,799	| IOT214 |	Because
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:23,359	| IOT214 |	Is a Mesh networking device so
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:28,223	| IOT214 |	Those are what I don't know yet but I do believe we will definitely see a Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,015	| IOT214 |	Next Generation products
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:30,527	| IOT214 |	Next week
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,319	| IOT214 |	Okay I will
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:34,367	| IOT214 |	Keep my eyes and ears open
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,671	| IOT214 |	Alright let's talk about
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,999	| IOT214 |	Privacy in apartment buildings and
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:42,815	| IOT214 |	Connected apartment buildings where users don't get a lot of say
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:47,167	| IOT214 |	We talked about this a while back after a hacker did Lesley Carhart
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,727	| IOT214 |	Got a notice from her apartment
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:53,055	| IOT214 |	Building that said hey we're switching over to a Smart system
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,079	| IOT214 |	Enjoy
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,895	| IOT214 |	And she's like I don't
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,687	| IOT214 |	Feel secure in this
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:00,223	| IOT214 |	Questions
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:02,015	| IOT214 |	Please answer them and
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:07,135	| IOT214 |	Idea basically is when you're living someplace is a tenant what rights do you have to refuse
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,927	| IOT214 |	If a company
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:11,231	| IOT214 |	Implement some sort of connected device in the building
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:15,839	| IOT214 |	And this came to a head this week based on a medium post about latch
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:21,215	| IOT214 |	I've actually talked to the latch folks a couple times I wrote about them when they raise a lot of money
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:26,335	| IOT214 |	And the issue that people are having with latch is that
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:28,127	| IOT214 |	The latch door locks
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:32,991	| IOT214 |	They're designed for multi-family dwelling unit so they are designed to run on your apartment tour
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,527	| IOT214 |	And then also
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:37,855	| IOT214 |	The lobby doors The Mailroom doors other doors that are in there
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:38,879	| IOT214 |	And
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:39,903	| IOT214 |	There's
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:42,719	| IOT214 |	Cameras associated with them in the lobby
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:47,583	| IOT214 |	And it's basically collecting information about your guests at all times and
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:49,375	| IOT214 |	You when you enter the lobby of Europe
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:52,703	| IOT214 |	People now are
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,215	| IOT214 |	Concerned about
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:55,519	| IOT214 |	And
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,799	| IOT214 |	I get it
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:12:02,431	| IOT214 |	A lot of apartments in cities are already implementing cameras and tracking residents coming and going from the building
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:07,295	| IOT214 |	So in some ways this isn't new and it's not necessarily associated with a Smart Lock
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:11,135	| IOT214 |	But it does raise the question of what kind of privacy
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,439	| IOT214 |	A tenant
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,207	| IOT214 |	Can expect
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:17,791	| IOT214 |	I would say very little in a public space of an apartment
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:23,679	| IOT214 |	Right I would agree it mean if a landlord wants to put cameras in the lobby and so forth that's
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:27,007	| IOT214 |	Nothing you can do about that how you can complain I suppose what you can't stop them
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,543	| IOT214 |	A bigger issue
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,847	| IOT214 |	And these types of dwellings is when you implement
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,383	| IOT214 |	Something like latch
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:33,663	| IOT214 |	Door locks
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:36,223	| IOT214 |	You're not opting into that
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,247	| IOT214 |	One thing I guess
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:40,575	| IOT214 |	And since you are by saying okay I'll rent an apartment with the latch
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:41,087	| IOT214 |	Door lock
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:45,951	| IOT214 |	But what if you already live there and then they add them if you don't really have a say over this according to
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:52,607	| IOT214 |	At least there's a lot going on right now and in a Manhattan building they're suing the landlord over privacy concerns
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:56,191	| IOT214 |	Regarding the latch locks so it's a tricky bit because
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:13:02,335	| IOT214 |	It is not an opt-in I guess other than saying yeah I'm I'm signing the lease for this latch enabled apartment
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:06,175	| IOT214 |	And some people that is a selling point so
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,967	| IOT214 |	It's Not Unusual in
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:09,247	| IOT214 |	I would also say
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:11,295	| IOT214 |	One of the issues in this Manhattan
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,575	| IOT214 |	Apartment is that
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:14,879	| IOT214 |	The landlords are using
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:20,255	| IOT214 |	Residence patterns of Ingress egress in the building to harass them because they want to kick out
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,791	| IOT214 |	Tenants
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:23,071	| IOT214 |	To basically
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:26,143	| IOT214 |	Raise the market rate or roulette apartments in Ohio
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,703	| IOT214 |	And that's where
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:30,751	| IOT214 |	These sorts of connected devices
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:34,591	| IOT214 |	It's not the device itself it's sometimes it's just the ability of
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,407	| IOT214 |	Someone to see this data and use it against you
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:40,223	| IOT214 |	And that kind of brings us to this idea of
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:41,503	| IOT214 |	How are we going to regulate data
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:47,391	| IOT214 |	Latch has an extensive privacy policy that's available to be read and so on so forth
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,927	| IOT214 |	One thing it doesn't address
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:51,487	| IOT214 |	Is if the building is sold
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:53,023	| IOT214 |	Does the new owner
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:54,559	| IOT214 |	Get the
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:55,583	| IOT214 |	Old data
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:59,423	| IOT214 |	Yeah it's according
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,703	| IOT214 |	To the privacy policy
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:03,519	| IOT214 |	Leslie said they may automatically receive the data
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:06,847	| IOT214 |	Well that's very, domain almost all
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,639	| IOT214 |	Privacy policies associated with
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:09,407	| IOT214 |	Connected home
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,687	| IOT214 |	Connected Goods
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,455	| IOT214 |	In general
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,223	| IOT214 |	Say that
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:12,735	| IOT214 |	That's not like
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:15,039	| IOT214 |	Asparagus on its own
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:17,343	| IOT214 |	It's basically that k at the buyers want it they can have it
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:21,951	| IOT214 |	Cuz I'm a lot of ways that is especially if a company goes
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:27,327	| IOT214 |	Belly up really quickly sometimes that's like the only thing of value that's there and that is worth considering
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:28,351	| IOT214 |	If you're a
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:29,631	| IOT214 |	So
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:31,679	| IOT214 |	Let's talk about regulations
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,703	| IOT214 |	Because
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,983	| IOT214 |	There's movement on that front
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:38,335	| IOT214 |	Congress this week had a hearing on iot security
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,639	| IOT214 |	The Security hearing was about
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,663	| IOT214 |	Creating a label
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,199	| IOT214 |	That would
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,735	| IOT214 |	Basically actually go
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,271	| IOT214 |	A security certificate
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,039	| IOT214 |	Education
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,831	| IOT214 |	For home iot devices
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:51,135	| IOT214 |	This actually was an idea that was
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:53,183	| IOT214 |	Is proposed not too long ago by public knowledge
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:55,231	| IOT214 |	And it's a consumer rights
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,023	| IOT214 |	The idea was that
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:59,071	| IOT214 |	We would set for some regulations
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:02,399	| IOT214 |	Group of industry and consumers Etc what
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:04,191	| IOT214 |	Get together and say things like
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:06,751	| IOT214 |	Hey for device to be certified under this program
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:10,335	| IOT214 |	It needs to not have hard Coda passwords
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:14,943	| IOT214 |	Have an expiration date for when the security support stops in some basic things that we
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,711	| IOT214 |	We talked about in the past
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:17,247	| IOT214 |	And
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,783	| IOT214 |	That's the idea that
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:20,319	| IOT214 |	Legislators seem to belong.
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:21,855	| IOT214 |	But
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:25,695	| IOT214 |	The representative from the CTA the consumer technology Association
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:28,767	| IOT214 |	Was like that that's a terrible idea where where are you working
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:29,535	| IOT214 |	The senators were like
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,071	| IOT214 |	Yeah you're not working fast
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,351	| IOT214 |	Sue
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:35,167	| IOT214 |	It's possible we could get something like this
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,191	| IOT214 |	I would hope so
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,727	| IOT214 |	I think it's the bare minimum of what we need
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:41,311	| IOT214 |	And then over across the pond in the UK
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:42,591	| IOT214 |	Legislators are talking about
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:46,431	| IOT214 |	Regulations for iot security in devices that
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,967	| IOT214 |	Prevent hard-coded passwords
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:49,247	| IOT214 |	Yay
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:53,087	| IOT214 |	Also add that expiration date so tell people win
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:54,879	| IOT214 |	The support for security.
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:55,391	| IOT214 |	And
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:16:02,047	| IOT214 |	It says manufacturers have to ensure that there is a contact point for security researchers to report vulnerability
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:05,119	| IOT214 |	I think I should probably add and
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,655	| IOT214 |	Someone to respond to that Within
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,447	| IOT214 |	24 hours
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:11,263	| IOT214 |	There should be a service-level agreement in there of some sort
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:14,079	| IOT214 |	But that's a bare minimum that seems like
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,103	| IOT214 |	Like a great place to start
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,895	| IOT214 |	So we'll see if it happens
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:20,735	| IOT214 |	Back to the US
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,271	| IOT214 |	Back to the US
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:23,039	| IOT214 |	Are you excited yet
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,575	| IOT214 |	About AT&T
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,879	| IOT214 |	They have released
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,439	| IOT214 |	They're NB iot Network
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:29,951	| IOT214 |	Nationwide
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:32,511	| IOT214 |	For you guys are like what what
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:35,839	| IOT214 |	Nb-iot is a low-power wide area network
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:39,679	| IOT214 |	It's a cellular standard you send very very small bits of data
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,519	| IOT214 |	Ideal for sensors
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:47,615	| IOT214 |	Halo power sold like smoke sensor or smoke detector might send off a
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:50,175	| IOT214 |	Peeing every hour or so
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,199	| IOT214 |	All kinds of stuff
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,967	| IOT214 |	Air quality monitoring
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:57,855	| IOT214 |	Been with this very small for this this is 64kbps is the maximum throughput speed so we're talkin
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,391	| IOT214 |	Superstar Lake
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,159	| IOT214 |	Old-time dialogue
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:01,951	| IOT214 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:04,255	| IOT214 |	I started with a 26 was a 26 424
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,583	| IOT214 |	20
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:11,167	| IOT214 |	28 yen
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:15,775	| IOT214 |	Super speeds
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:25,503	| IOT214 |	Okay so the thing to know about AT&T network is they're going to have the NB iot Network
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:27,807	| IOT214 |	And they're going to have what's their lte-m net
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:28,831	| IOT214 |	Which has slightly more
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:30,879	| IOT214 |	And
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:33,439	| IOT214 |	The pricing for this which is what I've been waiting for
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:37,535	| IOT214 |	Is AT&T Chris Penrose who's in charge of their iot
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,303	| IOT214 |	Stuff
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:42,143	| IOT214 |	Says that his team is working with suppliers to certify $5 modules
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,423	| IOT214 |	Connect devices to NBA
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:47,263	| IOT214 |	And that's basically the radio the chips that have the radio and such
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:51,871	| IOT214 |	So for $5 that's a decent price we've been waiting for that
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:52,383	| IOT214 |	Add for quite some time
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:57,247	| IOT214 |	So that's the radio itself so if you're building this device you put that $5 module in there
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:01,855	| IOT214 |	Which is still kind of expensive it's way more expensive than like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi but
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,903	| IOT214 |	It is low-power cellular
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:06,463	| IOT214 |	Low-power wide area network
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:12,607	| IOT214 |	And they're going to offer for these devices is as low as $5 a year
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:13,887	| IOT214 |	Pair device
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:16,447	| IOT214 |	Which is really not terrible
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:16,959	| IOT214 |	Right
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:19,007	| IOT214 |	No I don't think so I mean
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:22,335	| IOT214 |	Even if you're putting tons and tons of devices out there yes it adds up but
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,127	| IOT214 |	Jennifer a Year's worth of
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:26,943	| IOT214 |	Can I tell you that to give these things smarts and send
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,455	| IOT214 |	Alerts in
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:30,271	| IOT214 |	It's a date I don't think that's too expensive
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,295	| IOT214 |	If you need
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:33,855	| IOT214 |	To deploy devices that need more bandwidth
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:35,135	| IOT214 |	We're sending more data
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:37,951	| IOT214 |	You could use their lte-m Network
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:39,999	| IOT214 |	In the US and Mexico attack
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:42,815	| IOT214 |	But you're going to pay $30 a year for that rate
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:46,911	| IOT214 |	And I don't know about you cuz you're on the LTE network with your IP
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:49,727	| IOT214 |	What do you pay per month for that
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:50,495	| IOT214 |	Well that's a wrap
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:54,079	| IOT214 |	Quite honestly I've said this many many times have people who know me
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,615	| IOT214 |	Follow me are not surprised to hear that
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:59,711	| IOT214 |	I pee and I'm pretty sure it's standard at all the characters $10 a month
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:01,503	| IOT214 |	For LTE on the watch
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:07,903	| IOT214 |	$120 / device per year it is because
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:09,951	| IOT214 |	I checked with monthly usage
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,487	| IOT214 |	And roughly
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:14,047	| IOT214 |	I averaged about a hundred megabytes per month
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:16,863	| IOT214 |	Maybe they'll swap that out for an lte-m
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,423	| IOT214 |	I don't know
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,703	| IOT214 |	I mean it Beijing
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:22,239	| IOT214 |	Enough bandwidth to
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:26,079	| IOT214 |	Panda voice calls which Steven 64 would be okay
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:28,895	| IOT214 |	And then it's just occasional notifications from my
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:29,919	| IOT214 |	IOS devices
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:32,991	| IOT214 |	Background information like weather and such a mean
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:37,599	| IOT214 |	I think it's a total rip-off but that's again that's what's going on in the US with the
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,111	| IOT214 |	Apple watch
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:41,951	| IOT214 |	All right let's go to a bunch of our news bits because
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:44,511	| IOT214 |	There's quite a lot of little stuff going around out there
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:45,535	| IOT214 |	So
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:48,607	| IOT214 |	This first story is about an underwater
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,119	| IOT214 |	Camera
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:51,423	| IOT214 |	That uses AI
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,447	| IOT214 |	To recognize
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:54,239	| IOT214 |	People in the water and
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:55,007	| IOT214 |	Weather
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:56,799	| IOT214 |	Still for longer than 15 seconds
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:01,151	| IOT214 |	And then it will sound an alarm so it's basically to prevent drowning and let you know when
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:01,663	| IOT214 |	People are in the pool
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:05,247	| IOT214 |	Bring this up because a lot of people have actually asked about these sorts
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,015	| IOT214 |	Surprise
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:08,575	| IOT214 |	Just called the coral Manta 3000
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,367	| IOT214 |	And
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:11,391	| IOT214 |	Basically
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:14,463	| IOT214 |	Keep popping on the side of your pool and it
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:15,487	| IOT214 |	Access to Sky
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:16,511	| IOT214 |	Alert function
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:19,327	| IOT214 |	The challenges it's connected to Wi-Fi
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:22,655	| IOT214 |	And in your backyard if your WiFi connection isn't awesome
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:24,703	| IOT214 |	You're going to have a hard time
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:28,799	| IOT214 |	Getting reliable and low latency information from this.
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:30,591	| IOT214 |	Device which is really important if you're thinking about
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:31,359	| IOT214 |	Preventing trap
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:33,919	| IOT214 |	Yeah every second counts in that case
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:36,735	| IOT214 |	I want you cannot put a price on somebody's life
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:37,503	| IOT214 |	I am
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,039	| IOT214 |	Shocked at how expensive this is
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:42,367	| IOT214 |	This cost $2,000
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:44,159	| IOT214 |	Their hope is they will you know
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:46,975	| IOT214 |	Benefit from economies of scale and
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:48,767	| IOT214 |	This price will go down but
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:51,071	| IOT214 |	It's pricey but I will say that
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,863	| IOT214 |	There are other ways to track this but
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:53,375	| IOT214 |	Madison death
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:56,191	| IOT214 |	And please if you do install this
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:57,471	| IOT214 |	Please please please please
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:59,263	| IOT214 |	Please if you have children in the pool
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:00,543	| IOT214 |	Make sure you stay out there with
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:02,079	| IOT214 |	Babysitter
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:08,479	| IOT214 |	Absolutely I can't understand why this is $2,000 minutes itself power because it comes with solar
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:08,991	| IOT214 |	Panels
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:12,063	| IOT214 |	Apartments outside the pool above it
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:13,343	| IOT214 |	And then inside the fullest
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:13,855	| IOT214 |	Got the camera
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:17,696	| IOT214 |	And I understand you know AI for object recognition
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:20,256	| IOT214 |	Payments High because they're going to have
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:21,792	| IOT214 |	Continual training and learning
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:23,584	| IOT214 |	I don't know
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:25,120	| IOT214 |	And you can hire a lifeguard
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:26,400	| IOT214 |	4 year and pay less than
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:29,472	| IOT214 |	Oh no you can't come on
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:30,240	| IOT214 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:31,008	| IOT214 |	Either way
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,288	| IOT214 |	Let's talk about Mozilla
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:34,080	| IOT214 |	Let's talk about Mozilla
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,104	| IOT214 |	And facts
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:37,920	| IOT214 |	Probably should have talked about them two weeks ago I feel bad because
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:39,712	| IOT214 |	I just noticed today
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:43,296	| IOT214 |	That the old project things from from Mozilla
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,320	| IOT214 |	Which is a
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:47,904	| IOT214 |	Web-based smart home do-it-yourself Hub it's a platform for that
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:51,488	| IOT214 |	Ashley graduated it is no longer I
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:52,256	| IOT214 |	Project
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,280	| IOT214 |	Beta product
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:55,072	| IOT214 |	It is now Mozilla web things
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:57,888	| IOT214 |	And I think I'm going to have to
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:01,728	| IOT214 |	Play this in my home because as I look at the documentation for it
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,264	| IOT214 |	Obviously it's
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:05,824	| IOT214 |	Can I go on a Raspberry Pi again it's all web-based
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,360	| IOT214 |	So there's no app for it
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:14,272	| IOT214 |	But it does support not just Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices but also a zigbee and Z-Wave if you would like to add those radios
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,808	| IOT214 |	To the pi via
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:16,832	| IOT214 |	The USB dongle
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:17,344	| IOT214 |	So
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:19,392	| IOT214 |	Sounds good to me you know
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:22,720	| IOT214 |	It does and I can't wait to the
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:25,280	| IOT214 |	Hear what you think I think last time you
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:26,816	| IOT214 |	Started to playing this in
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:29,120	| IOT214 |	It became cumbersome I believe
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:32,704	| IOT214 |	Yeah it wasn't quite ready that's when it was in project status
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:34,752	| IOT214 |	So it was very early on
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,288	| IOT214 |	And
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:39,872	| IOT214 |	I don't recall what issues I ran into at the time but I'm like
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:42,432	| IOT214 |	They're just getting too frustrating and I put it aside and
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:46,784	| IOT214 |	Now it's it definitely deserves the second look there's so many people that are interested in
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:48,320	| IOT214 |	Not relying on
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:52,672	| IOT214 |	The cloud is much for their device management and control
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:54,976	| IOT214 |	And also I'm keeping their data as local as paw
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:55,744	| IOT214 |	Possible
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:56,512	| IOT214 |	All right
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,792	| IOT214 |	In super quick news
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:59,072	| IOT214 |	Madam
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:02,144	| IOT214 |	Gets Spanish support in the US
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:02,912	| IOT214 |	And
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:04,448	| IOT214 |	Are you guys were like what
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:10,848	| IOT214 |	She has had Spanish support in Mexico and in Spain but now you get that option in the US which is cool because they
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:15,712	| IOT214 |	There are plenty of people in the US who speak Spanish as a first or second language
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:18,016	| IOT214 |	I would like to talk to Madam a
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,040	| IOT214 |	In that particular time
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:22,368	| IOT214 |	Also speaking of Amazon
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:23,392	| IOT214 |	Or rather
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:25,952	| IOT214 |	Amazon's digital assistant and fuss
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:26,720	| IOT214 |	Amazon
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:29,536	| IOT214 |	Ford is adding Amazon's key to its
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:32,096	| IOT214 |	2017 models and
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:32,864	| IOT214 |	Up
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:36,192	| IOT214 |	This basically means you can use the Amazon Key Program
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:37,728	| IOT214 |	With your car
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:42,336	| IOT214 |	Amazon delivery people can deliver packages to your car they will unlock your car
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,128	| IOT214 |	Pop the package inside
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:44,640	| IOT214 |	And close it
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:47,200	| IOT214 |	It's probably awesome for everything that isn't
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:47,968	| IOT214 |	Ice cream in Frozen
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:51,552	| IOT214 |	If you're going to use this keep in mind that you must
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,320	| IOT214 |	Sync
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:56,416	| IOT214 |	Your Amazon Prime account to use of the forward pass or Lincolnway
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:58,464	| IOT214 |	Accounts in order to make this happen to
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:23:59,744	| IOT214 |	If you're not really using those
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:01,024	| IOT214 |	Services
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:03,584	| IOT214 |	You're not going to be able to use this unless you
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:04,864	| IOT214 |	Change that
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,144	| IOT214 |	Got it
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:06,912	| IOT214 |	All right
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,448	| IOT214 |	And we got some
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:09,984	| IOT214 |	Good Guys in books out there
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:11,264	| IOT214 |	Kevin Ewing
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:14,848	| IOT214 |	Yeah they found just because I was looking at Mozilla
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:17,664	| IOT214 |	Web things I found a very interesting Kickstarter project
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:20,480	| IOT214 |	For a Raspberry Pi with
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:22,016	| IOT214 |	For computer vision ebook
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:23,808	| IOT214 |	And basically this
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:28,160	| IOT214 |	Allows you to learn about how to use computer vision with a pie
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:30,976	| IOT214 |	You will get the ebook as well as a pie and
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:32,512	| IOT214 |	And the sensors that you need
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:34,304	| IOT214 |	I think it's $95 which is
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:37,888	| IOT214 |	Yeah it's more than a pie I'm going to cuss you out 45 just for the hardware
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:39,168	| IOT214 |	The Bass Hardware but
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,704	| IOT214 |	This will walk you through how to
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:41,984	| IOT214 |	Train
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:44,800	| IOT214 |	Raspberry Pi for computer vision and so on so I just thought
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,592	| IOT214 |	Are the DIY rose out there might be interesting
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:47,872	| IOT214 |	And then
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:50,176	| IOT214 |	Or do you have wires in the Enterprise
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:54,272	| IOT214 |	Done a really nice techrepublic guide on how to create an iot hub
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:56,064	| IOT214 |	Using Microsoft azure
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:59,136	| IOT214 |	Which is something I haven't done yet I've pretty much use all the other
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,416	| IOT214 |	Cloud providers to
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:02,720	| IOT214 |	In some way shape or form use iot
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,000	| IOT214 |	For my projects
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:08,864	| IOT214 |	I will probably walk through this just to see what it's like but again it's very enterprise-focused I would
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:09,632	| IOT214 |	Prism
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:10,144	| IOT214 |	Yes
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:11,424	| IOT214 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:12,704	| IOT214 |	And now
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:13,472	| IOT214 |	It's time for

EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:08,000	| IOT214 |	So the winner for April is Scott who had called in about double cylinder lock think we just answered that question a week or two
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:10,816	| IOT214 |	Scott you got an answer and
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:13,632	| IOT214 |	A way to connect your existing alarm system
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:14,400	| IOT214 |	To your smartphone
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:16,192	| IOT214 |	Congratulations to
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:16,704	| IOT214 |	Scott
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:17,728	| IOT214 |	And now
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,520	| IOT214 |	Let's hear from
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,568	| IOT214 |	Chef who is looking
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:23,104	| IOT214 |	Help his parents
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:23,872	| IOT214 |	Start a garden
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:25,408	| IOT214 |	Are Kevin and Stacey
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:30,016	| IOT214 |	This is our Jeff New York and you can use this on the show my question is
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:32,064	| IOT214 |	Are interested
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:33,600	| IOT214 |	Starting a garden
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,624	| IOT214 |	Never really had
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:35,392	| IOT214 |	Green thumbs
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:37,696	| IOT214 |	But I was wondering if there's a device that
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:39,488	| IOT214 |	They can put with in their Garden
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:42,560	| IOT214 |	What are and or if
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:43,840	| IOT214 |	Calum which
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:45,120	| IOT214 |	Cancer flowers
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:45,888	| IOT214 |	The best plant
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:49,216	| IOT214 |	Could you online but I was wondering if
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:53,824	| IOT214 |	Stephanie alert there their devices when it's
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:54,848	| IOT214 |	Water
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:58,432	| IOT214 |	Stuff like that but I appreciate what sports your answer have a great day
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:00,480	| IOT214 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:01,248	| IOT214 |	Jeff
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:03,296	| IOT214 |	There's a couple options out there on the market
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:05,856	| IOT214 |	You can always do
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:10,976	| IOT214 |	A smart irrigation system and it's unclear to me if their Garden will be irrigated by like
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:13,792	| IOT214 |	In-ground sprinkler systems or that sort of thing
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:15,072	| IOT214 |	If that's an option
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:16,608	| IOT214 |	Blossom
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:17,888	| IOT214 |	Rachio
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:22,240	| IOT214 |	And there are several other companies that make really good
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:24,288	| IOT214 |	Smart Systems that let you
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:27,360	| IOT214 |	Divide up different areas of the garden for watering the
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:29,152	| IOT214 |	Look at the weather and they decide
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:32,224	| IOT214 |	You can actually invite you I know you can tell it
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:33,504	| IOT214 |	Somewhat what type of
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:35,552	| IOT214 |	What plants you have in their water needs
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:37,088	| IOT214 |	It it will actually
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:39,136	| IOT214 |	Factor that into how it water
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:39,648	| IOT214 |	Stop swell
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:41,696	| IOT214 |	So that's
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:43,744	| IOT214 |	One option if you have
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:46,048	| IOT214 |	An existing irrigation system or they want
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:50,400	| IOT214 |	If they do not then we're talking about doing some sort of
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:50,912	| IOT214 |	Connected
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:53,728	| IOT214 |	I would say doing a soil sensor
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:54,752	| IOT214 |	And then
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:59,616	| IOT214 |	Probably doing a manual sprinkler or watering schedule
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:02,432	| IOT214 |	The reason why I say Emmanuel watering schedule is cuz
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:03,968	| IOT214 |	A lot of the
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:10,624	| IOT214 |	Automatic watering things that attach to your hoes aren't very good I investigated them last year trying to build something from
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:11,392	| IOT214 |	Myself
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,160	| IOT214 |	In
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:13,952	| IOT214 |	A lot of them were very expensive
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:14,464	| IOT214 |	And did not seem to
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:17,792	| IOT214 |	Soil sensors
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:19,072	| IOT214 |	On the soil sensor front
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:20,352	| IOT214 |	In
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:22,656	| IOT214 |	As a bonus some of these will work with
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,424	| IOT214 |	Existing customer
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:24,704	| IOT214 |	Sprinkler systems
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:25,984	| IOT214 |	They're kind of expensive
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:28,800	| IOT214 |	I'll just let you know this right now
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:30,848	| IOT214 |	When is the Rain Bird
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:33,664	| IOT214 |	Smarty soil-moisture
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:34,176	| IOT214 |	Sensor
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:35,456	| IOT214 |	And
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:42,624	| IOT214 |	This is basically you'll have a sensor that you plug in and then there is an above-ground controller that you can use you can do
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:46,464	| IOT214 |	Use that manually or you can tie that sensor into an existing sprinkler system
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:47,744	| IOT214 |	So
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:49,280	| IOT214 |	Again
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:51,584	| IOT214 |	It's not exactly smart
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:53,376	| IOT214 |	But it will tell people
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:53,888	| IOT214 |	When
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:54,912	| IOT214 |	The plants need
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:55,936	| IOT214 |	But
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:57,728	| IOT214 |	145
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:00,032	| IOT214 |	Kind of a lot
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:03,360	| IOT214 |	Yeah I think it's cheaper to just set reminders
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:05,920	| IOT214 |	Yeah and another one that there is is the
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:09,760	| IOT214 |	Toro Precision soil sensor that will also work with most
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:13,088	| IOT214 |	Irrigation controllers like rachio Blossom Etc
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:14,368	| IOT214 |	And
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:16,672	| IOT214 |	You just Jam the sucker in your soil
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,464	| IOT214 |	It also has its own
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:20,768	| IOT214 |	Thing that sits on a wall or you can
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:23,072	| IOT214 |	Put some place and it will tell you how
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,888	| IOT214 |	Moist the soil is
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:28,704	| IOT214 |	That is also in the hundred 3200
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:32,288	| IOT214 |	What do you do if your cheap
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,104	| IOT214 |	You have
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:35,872	| IOT214 |	Couple
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,384	| IOT214 |	Options
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:43,552	| IOT214 |	The cheapest options are about 10 bucks and they're basically just moisture meters that you stick in the ground and they'll like tell you
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:45,344	| IOT214 |	Is it wet or not but at that point
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:46,624	| IOT214 |	Stick your finger in the ground
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:52,768	| IOT214 |	Great and then there's a couple connected soil sensors designed for indoor use I would not recommend them outside
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:54,048	| IOT214 |	Because
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:55,584	| IOT214 |	They're not rugged enough
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:58,656	| IOT214 |	So that's where we are at this today
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:03,776	| IOT214 |	Heather a lot of protective products out there right I find them rather expensive number one
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,312	| IOT214 |	Number two
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:08,128	| IOT214 |	You have to make sure you have good connectivity
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:10,688	| IOT214 |	Outside to get the alerts and so on
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,712	| IOT214 |	Will a lot of them are
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:12,992	| IOT214 |	Impropriety
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:19,904	| IOT214 |	Do you spell few companies like Eden in plantlink that did this but those products aren't available in
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:21,440	| IOT214 |	So
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:23,232	| IOT214 |	My hunch is
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,512	| IOT214 |	It's a crappy environment
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:27,584	| IOT214 |	To build something that's red for outdoors
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:28,864	| IOT214 |	Seems Wi-Fi
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:29,632	| IOT214 |	It's not wired
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:32,192	| IOT214 |	And that's why we're not seeing
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:32,704	| IOT214 |	Flex accessory
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:35,776	| IOT214 |	So you may have to go with some of the sensors that use
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:38,848	| IOT214 |	Proprietary Wireless to talk to things that are very expensive
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:41,408	| IOT214 |	Or they could be wired into a smart irrigation system
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:42,944	| IOT214 |	We're very sorry
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:47,808	| IOT214 |	All right well that's close this portion of the show
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:51,904	| IOT214 |	Please stay tuned to learn more about kinship which is Mars Petcare

EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:04,096	| IOT214 |	What do you mean exactly by democratize
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:06,400	| IOT214 |	Essentially
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:09,984	| IOT214 |	This is the concept of making your data available within your organization
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:14,336	| IOT214 |	It goes to be able to deliver relevant data to
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,104	| IOT214 |	Do anyone
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:15,872	| IOT214 |	Anywhere
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:16,640	| IOT214 |	Anytime
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:19,200	| IOT214 |	Most folks don't think about this in relation to Hyatt
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:20,992	| IOT214 |	But the reality is
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:22,016	| IOT214 |	You only start
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:24,576	| IOT214 |	Sirius return on your investment

EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:27,392	| IOT214 |	Once you've enriched your acid
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:27,904	| IOT214 |	Device data
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:31,744	| IOT214 |	Free sample
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:33,280	| IOT214 |	Is running hotter
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:34,304	| IOT214 |	The normal
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:36,096	| IOT214 |	Only me so much
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:38,400	| IOT214 |	If you don't know the whole picture about that
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:42,496	| IOT214 |	For example we may expect vibration spikes
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:46,848	| IOT214 |	Temperature spikes on an asset if it's doing something that it doesn't
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,432	| IOT214 |	Picture we can wait
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,968	| IOT214 |	Time and money

EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:55,040	| IOT214 |	That may not really be
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:56,576	| IOT214 |	Problems

EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:39,232	| IOT214 |	Posturing this
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:40,000	| IOT214 |	In this area
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:41,024	| IOT214 |	Kinship

EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:11,744	| IOT214 |	Are these the sort of innovators were talking about
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:14,048	| IOT214 |	Well absolutely
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:15,840	| IOT214 |	Weeki Wachee it's out of kinship
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:16,864	| IOT214 |	It's the one of the startup

EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:17,952	| IOT214 |	I think I've always had pain
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:20,768	| IOT214 |	So you know I get up very early
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:22,048	| IOT214 |	I want my dog
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:23,584	| IOT214 |	I come back
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:27,424	| IOT214 |	I got to work my dog basically sleeps all day oh I forgot to feed my dog
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:29,216	| IOT214 |	So I feed my dog to

EDL	00:38:58,048	00:39:00,352	| IOT214 |	Quit making a pet ownership is
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:01,376	| IOT214 |	Attractive as possible

EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:22,624	| IOT214 |	Explain
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:27,232	| IOT214 |	The story of your path to every single service provider you might need
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:28,000	| IOT214 |	Throughout their lifetime
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:30,048	| IOT214 |	Supported by
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:31,328	| IOT214 |	State information
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:32,352	| IOT214 |	Inside
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:33,376	| IOT214 |	That is very relevant
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:34,656	| IOT214 |	Closet lights

EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:38,752	| IOT214 |	Increasingly
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:42,592	| IOT214 |	Because pets do live longer and longer and so that
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:44,384	| IOT214 |	Support needs to accompany them
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:46,688	| IOT214 |	So what's going to the service provider question
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:49,248	| IOT214 |	Because it makes sense in the human world
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:52,064	| IOT214 |	Because we have a bunch of different doctors we have you know
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:53,600	| IOT214 |	Dentist we have
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:59,744	| IOT214 |	Cardiologist we have neurologist we have all sorts of things happening to us in over a hugely long life span
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:02,304	| IOT214 |	For the most part my dogs have had
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:03,328	| IOT214 |	They come for the pound
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:05,376	| IOT214 |	So they've had their pound experience
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:07,936	| IOT214 |	Everything's an unknown before that then they have their vet
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:11,008	| IOT214 |	In the vet does pretty much everything so it feels like
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:17,664	| IOT214 |	I don't understand where it gets difficult to grab data from are we talked about bringing in data from other sources
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:23,040	| IOT214 |	What we are seeing is that the sophistication of the approach
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:24,576	| IOT214 |	Towards the pets needs
EDL	00:40:24,576	00:40:26,112	| IOT214 |	That the science is now allowing
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:29,184	| IOT214 |	To do is really napolina much more
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:29,952	| IOT214 |	Individualized
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:31,488	| IOT214 |	South experience
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:32,768	| IOT214 |	So you mention whistle
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:36,864	| IOT214 |	So because of all the work that we've been doing on me
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:37,632	| IOT214 |	Algorithm
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:39,424	| IOT214 |	Science around the
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:41,728	| IOT214 |	Monitor part of the whistle
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:42,496	| IOT214 |	We connect you now
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:44,288	| IOT214 |	Stop predicting
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:45,824	| IOT214 |	Things like sleep destruction
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:49,920	| IOT214 |	Or hip and Joint issues that the cat might experience
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:50,944	| IOT214 |	You might not know about
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:53,248	| IOT214 |	So you can be alerted
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:54,272	| IOT214 |	About the potential
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:55,808	| IOT214 |	He might have
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:41:01,952	| IOT214 |	What do you start noticing them as a title on her soul before you look very happy to visibly
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:03,232	| IOT214 |	Be accompanied by healthy
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:05,792	| IOT214 |	Apache would know a lot more about what kind of issues
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:06,560	| IOT214 |	Experiencing
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:08,864	| IOT214 |	I'm be able to August a company van
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:12,192	| IOT214 |	Hopefully better health longer
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:15,776	| IOT214 |	Which distributed close to a hundred thousand

EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:26,272	| IOT214 |	And as a result we were able to
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:28,064	| IOT214 |	Attract what we are seeing
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:30,112	| IOT214 |	Through electronic data
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:32,160	| IOT214 |	Given to us through the whistle device
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:33,440	| IOT214 |	With
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:35,488	| IOT214 |	What we starting to see in the medical records
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:38,048	| IOT214 |	Time
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:39,840	| IOT214 |	24 months

EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:44,192	| IOT214 |	Accumulate the signs that we're seeing from the device
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:45,984	| IOT214 |	And correlation.
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:47,008	| IOT214 |	Stop that data
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:47,776	| IOT214 |	To the
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:52,384	| IOT214 |	Medical events that we're seeing for the medical records and so is the result who started
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:53,407	| IOT214 |	To create algorithms

EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:59,295	| IOT214 |	And the result hopefully start building a
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:01,343	| IOT214 |	The way of communicating with a pet owners
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:03,391	| IOT214 |	Reconnect
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:04,415	| IOT214 |	Is that and what
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:05,951	| IOT214 |	Seeing in the whistle data
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:07,487	| IOT214 |	That is awesome
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:13,887	| IOT214 |	Because yes it's hard to tell until your animal is like so sick they're not eating or drinking it's really hard to tell sometimes what's
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:14,655	| IOT214 |	Going on in there
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:22,335	| IOT214 |	Is this for dogs and cats or are you looking for solutions for I don't know fish ferrets
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:22,847	| IOT214 |	Birds

EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:42,559	| IOT214 |	Use genetics to be able to
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:52,287	| IOT214 |	Oh that's interesting I actually just to talk to a startup called nightwatch and they make a
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:57,407	| IOT214 |	We dat's a halter for horses that checks for I'm going to mess up this disease it is
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:43:02,015	| IOT214 |	Torsion or dogs it's some sort of disease that horses get
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:05,087	| IOT214 |	Where if they don't solve it really fast the horses
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:05,599	| IOT214 |	It dies
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:06,623	| IOT214 |	Pek overnight
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:07,903	| IOT214 |	It's crazy

EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:15,071	| IOT214 |	Yeah it's connected device that has if you don't put it on there and it's got algorithms that the measure this sort of thing and it's it's r
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:17,887	| IOT214 |	Really if your horse owner this is a wonderful thing

EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:20,159	| IOT214 |	A lot of this service is the Augustine
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:21,951	| IOT214 |	Is there a high frequency
EDL	00:46:22,463	00:46:24,511	| IOT214 |	And the ability for us
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:26,047	| IOT214 |	To be able to

EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:37,823	| IOT214 |	It's better to be able
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:41,663	| IOT214 |	How to form how they they look at the
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:44,223	| IOT214 |	Either not blast
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:47,039	| IOT214 |	The way to connect from the date of perspective in inside perspect
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:51,135	| IOT214 |	The multitude of the service providers that are touching that pets

EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:55,487	| IOT214 |	It's becoming very important part of what we're trying to crack and figure out how to
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:46:57,791	| IOT214 |	Okay and
EDL	00:46:57,791	00:47:02,655	| IOT214 |	We just did a lot of the big picture but because this is the iot podcast I have to ask
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:07,519	| IOT214 |	Where does connectivity and connected devices play into all this we've obviously talked about whistle
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:08,799	| IOT214 |	And
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:12,895	| IOT214 |	You know there's a huge Market of connected home dog toys and cameras
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:14,687	| IOT214 |	And cat toys and cameras
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:19,295	| IOT214 |	So where are the places were connected devices will help you in this
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:22,111	| IOT214 |	We are
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:23,647	| IOT214 |	Start with the light
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:25,951	| IOT214 |	Device is because of that direct link
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:30,303	| IOT214 |	To help but we're not stopping there one of the other Partnerships that we are currently running
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:32,863	| IOT214 |	China is with the smart feeder device
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:35,423	| IOT214 |	Because if you think about the further out
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:36,959	| IOT214 |	Development of connectivity
EDL	00:47:36,959	00:47:37,727	| IOT214 |	TV Aerials

EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:42,079	| IOT214 |	It's probably not a area where a cheetah can it be
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:43,103	| IOT214 |	Form in March
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:45,151	| IOT214 |	Better much more precise after
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:51,551	| IOT214 |	Markets like China that I really moving fast
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:52,831	| IOT214 |	Isb area

EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:58,463	| IOT214 |	Singapore and so being able to
EDL	00:47:58,463	00:48:02,303	| IOT214 |	Inject the data in the inside about the cats need
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:03,071	| IOT214 |	Dynamically
EDL	00:48:03,071	00:48:03,839	| IOT214 |	Into the

EDL	00:48:06,911	00:48:08,191	| IOT214 |	It's not the area
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:10,239	| IOT214 |	Today this is the part of me
