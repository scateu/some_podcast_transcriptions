EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,296	| IOT100 |	It's something kind of music
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:06,112	| IOT100 |	It's not really on her show notes
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,392	| IOT100 |	But I have to say that
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:10,208	| IOT100 |	Celebration of our hundred episode
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,232	| IOT100 |	I bought my wife a gift
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,792	| IOT100 |	Actions for Valentine's Day but it works either way
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,608	| IOT100 |	And it arrives
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,888	| IOT100 |	Just yesterday actually
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:21,728	| IOT100 |	And she said it up this morning while I was still asleep
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,520	| IOT100 |	And
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,544	| IOT100 |	Something kind of
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:28,128	| IOT100 |	So I went downstairs this morning for the show before the show
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:30,944	| IOT100 |	I put two Toaster Strudels in there
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:33,248	| IOT100 |	Oh so bad but oh so good at the same time
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:36,832	| IOT100 |	And of course the June oven recognize their Toaster Strudels and
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,880	| IOT100 |	Coping with your professor
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,416	| IOT100 |	Better than a toaster does because
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:43,488	| IOT100 |	Custard never gets the Frozen middle part without burning outside
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:44,768	| IOT100 |	Anyway
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:45,280	| IOT100 |	Point has
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:46,816	| IOT100 |	I just
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:49,632	| IOT100 |	Took them out of the oven and I get a message for my wife
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,680	| IOT100 |	Just like your food is done
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:54,496	| IOT100 |	Menchie's
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:56,800	| IOT100 |	She's at work right now and this message
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:04:00,896	| IOT100 |	Came out of the blue I completely forgot that it's connected to her phone she set the whole thing up
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:06,272	| IOT100 |	But it freaked me out of my is she going to know every time I like cook stuff that I should be eating
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:06,784	| IOT100 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:10,112	| IOT100 |	Oh no where's the privacy
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,768	| IOT100 |	If I should mention that June has sponsored the show
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,280	| IOT100 |	In the past
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:19,839	| IOT100 |	What I purchased
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,935	| IOT100 |	I think you could probably turn some of that off
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,983	| IOT100 |	Vacations
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:28,031	| IOT100 |	But yes Whoever has the app on their phone
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,407	| IOT100 |	Made it so you can actually
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:33,919	| IOT100 |	Pair to differ
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,479	| IOT100 |	To the Jew
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,831	| IOT100 |	We just happen to have a couple of songs in
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,671	| IOT100 |	12
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:49,023	| IOT100 |	Yes Amber Alerts must be
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:54,399	| IOT100 |	But anyway I just thought it was hysterical.
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,447	| IOT100 |	Using it for the very first time
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:59,775	| IOT100 |	Amazon I got a message from my wife right before I take the very first bite
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:02,335	| IOT100 |	Am I substitute oh my west side
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,615	| IOT100 |	Basically I know what you're doing
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:06,175	| IOT100 |	Eating the forbidden fruit
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:11,551	| IOT100 |	Yea High
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,599	| IOT100 |	I asked my husband
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,623	| IOT100 |	Hey
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,159	| IOT100 |	How's a baked potato
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:19,231	| IOT100 |	Kinkos how did he
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:26,399	| IOT100 |	Ice cream so we'll be playing with that obviously for the next
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,167	| IOT100 |	Couple weeks
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:28,447	| IOT100 |	I think we're going to keep it
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,263	| IOT100 |	Alright so I have
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:33,567	| IOT100 |	Moving from the smartphone to the
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,591	| IOT100 |	Industrial internet
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:35,871	| IOT100 |	I have
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:38,431	| IOT100 |	An excellent survey that came out
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,455	| IOT100 |	Actually Tuesday
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:42,015	| IOT100 |	It's from The Economist and arm
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:48,159	| IOT100 |	And it's basically an index tracking how businesses are adopting
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,231	| IOT100 |	As
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,279	| IOT100 |	Little worried about indexes they can
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,583	| IOT100 |	Compare a time frame now to time frame
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:57,119	| IOT100 |	At some point in the past
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:00,191	| IOT100 |	You're measuring not based on like percentage gains but you're
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:00,959	| IOT100 |	Measuring based on
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:02,751	| IOT100 |	Games in the App
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:03,519	| IOT100 |	Dex from
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:05,823	| IOT100 |	The time before previous run the Baseline
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:07,615	| IOT100 |	Yes for the base that's the word
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,383	| IOT100 |	That's the word
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,431	| IOT100 |	And
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:12,223	| IOT100 |	What they found is
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,759	| IOT100 |	Companies adopting
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:16,319	| IOT100 |	The industrial internet-of-things are actually adopted
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,087	| IOT100 |	Fairly slowly
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:19,135	| IOT100 |	I'm slower than
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:20,671	| IOT100 |	So
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,207	| IOT100 |	Monastic orders
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:26,559	| IOT100 |	Surveyed said they strongly agree that their progress has not happened as quickly as expected
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:29,887	| IOT100 |	And another 33% said they some Whitaker
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:33,727	| IOT100 |	So only 10% said they disagreed
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:34,751	| IOT100 |	That their progress has been
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,543	| IOT100 |	As quickly as expect
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,079	| IOT100 |	So
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:40,127	| IOT100 |	That's one kind of sense
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:45,503	| IOT100 |	And the survey and it's 825 senior Business Leaders including
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,295	| IOT100 |	About 400 c-level executives are for
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:50,111	| IOT100 |	And there around the country
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:51,647	| IOT100 |	30% Europe 30%
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,671	| IOT100 |	America
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,951	| IOT100 |	30% nature pack
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,719	| IOT100 |	And the rest
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:57,791	| IOT100 |	Everywhere else
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:01,375	| IOT100 |	It's kind of like a smart home to me
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:03,167	| IOT100 |	It's going to take time for
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:07,007	| IOT100 |	All these different possible iot solutions
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:09,823	| IOT100 |	Spore Enterprises businesses small businesses Etc
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:11,103	| IOT100 |	Chevrolet China
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,127	| IOT100 |	Consolidate
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:12,639	| IOT100 |	A little bit
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:16,223	| IOT100 |	Has to figure out the business cases
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:21,087	| IOT100 |	What kind of struck me is they talked about where people were in the process like
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:25,183	| IOT100 |	Nonexistent in research and planning early implementation
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:27,743	| IOT100 |	No it was an extensive
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,279	| IOT100 |	Fermentation occur
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:31,839	| IOT100 |	Around the world
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,167	| IOT100 |	Companies went
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,447	| IOT100 |	From being in research to being
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:37,471	| IOT100 |	Planning
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,799	| IOT100 |	But in North America that actually went
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:42,079	| IOT100 |	Down
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:46,431	| IOT100 |	And that was kind of an odd mix and it could be that people have gone from
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:50,527	| IOT100 |	There was a lot of companies doing research and then some of them abandoned it
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:54,111	| IOT100 |	I did think that was an interesting finding
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:56,671	| IOT100 |	So
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:00,767	| IOT100 |	Yeah there's one other aspect all this said that
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:01,535	| IOT100 |	I don't think this
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,839	| IOT100 |	Survey really talks about and that is
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:08,191	| IOT100 |	Instrument things you Bring iot into your business
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:12,031	| IOT100 |	Are gathering data so that way you can make data-driven Solutions
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:14,079	| IOT100 |	Rap that's a lot of data
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:17,407	| IOT100 |	And I wonder if a lot of these companies are prepared for that that's
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:20,479	| IOT100 |	An integral part of the research in the planning
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,783	| IOT100 |	What are they going to make a slice and dice
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,319	| IOT100 |	You know there's so much
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:27,647	| IOT100 |	Beyond the actual physical iot stuff
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,183	| IOT100 |	All the data
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:32,511	| IOT100 |	That what are they doing with that and I think that's a big chunk of their
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,279	| IOT100 |	Time investment
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:34,815	| IOT100 |	Why Kevin
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,583	| IOT100 |	You are right
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,351	| IOT100 |	Because in
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:39,679	| IOT100 |	Questioning about which parts of their business have seen the greatest positive change
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,191	| IOT100 |	The iot
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:43,519	| IOT100 |	Where is percent said their data
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:44,543	| IOT100 |	Analysis
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:51,967	| IOT100 |	Pikachu
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:56,063	| IOT100 |	The other thing to note is the chief obstacles currently
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:58,111	| IOT100 |	Preventing an organization from using the
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:01,695	| IOT100 |	30% said it was the high cost of
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,207	| IOT100 |	Investment in
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,231	| IOT100 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,279	| IOT100 |	The next largest
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:09,375	| IOT100 |	Group was concerned about security and privacy 26%
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,143	| IOT100 |	Of the respondents
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,423	| IOT100 |	Wer
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:12,447	| IOT100 |	Worried about
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,799	| IOT100 |	The next was the lack of Senior Management
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,567	| IOT100 |	Acknowledging
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:21,151	| IOT100 |	Which shows that this really in in this is true we said this before
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:21,919	| IOT100 |	It really does need to
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,735	| IOT100 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:27,551	| IOT100 |	So this is also a little bit industrial but still very cool
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:30,879	| IOT100 |	The Internet of Things is getting LTE coverage thanks to
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:32,159	| IOT100 |	Google and Qualcomm
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,439	| IOT100 |	And then also
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,975	| IOT100 |	New chips from Intel
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:38,815	| IOT100 |	So what happened this week is Intel lodged
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,863	| IOT100 |	It's called its liquid
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,655	| IOT100 |	Or it's but it's liqd
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,191	| IOT100 |	Because we're out
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,215	| IOT100 |	We're running out of owls
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,775	| IOT100 |	In The Internet of Things
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:53,407	| IOT100 |	And what they done is the cat carrier proof boards which means that you no longer have to if you
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,943	| IOT100 |	Use one of their boards
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:57,503	| IOT100 |	You don't have to go to get certification through
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,551	| IOT100 |	Carrier which is a login
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,671	| IOT100 |	It is probably less for startups
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,207	| IOT100 |	You could use it but
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,231	| IOT100 |	It's
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,279	| IOT100 |	It's any company that really just doesn't want to
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,839	| IOT100 |	Get that expertise or learn to deal with all that
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,119	| IOT100 |	Is it it's a
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:13,631	| IOT100 |	Process
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,679	| IOT100 |	The other cool piece of news
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,727	| IOT100 |	And we should say that
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,263	| IOT100 |	Kevin works for Google right now
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:25,407	| IOT100 |	Right this very second but I do not work on anything I would she related or smart home or anything like that
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,991	| IOT100 |	Specifically Android phones
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:31,039	| IOT100 |	Qualcomm Snapdragon
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:33,855	| IOT100 |	210 chip will add support for Android things
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:36,159	| IOT100 |	Later this year which brings it along with the raspberry
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:39,999	| IOT100 |	Tnxp Pico and the Intel Edison board
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:45,119	| IOT100 |	This is cool because this is a board that has LTE on it
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,423	| IOT100 |	Yay
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,727	| IOT100 |	So Android things now has LTE
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:59,455	| IOT100 |	Yeah I'm curious to see what happens with Android thinks it's a relatively new Initiative for Google Pinkalicious
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,479	| IOT100 |	A few months ago there was
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:03,039	| IOT100 |	Rebranded renamed relaunched
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:07,135	| IOT100 |	But yeah you're right it wants to compete against the Raspberry Pi and other
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,927	| IOT100 |	IRT type boards and all that but
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:12,255	| IOT100 |	Is Android things
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:13,279	| IOT100 |	Is actually an
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,583	| IOT100 |	Olestra
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,911	| IOT100 |	Metastatic
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,215	| IOT100 |	Gosh what does it mean
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:26,847	| IOT100 |	These are boards but they also have
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:31,711	| IOT100 |	Basically
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,223	| IOT100 |	Actually would be a
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,575	| IOT100 |	But but anyways
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,343	| IOT100 |	I digress
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:41,439	| IOT100 |	Leadership support for LTE and really help you
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:43,231	| IOT100 |	Connectivity challenges witch
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:45,535	| IOT100 |	Obviously is key for iot so
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:48,607	| IOT100 |	I'm very interested to see what people do with
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:53,471	| IOT100 |	This chip and his platform later on this year when they can do something with it
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,007	| IOT100 |	Obviously
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:55,775	| IOT100 |	Probably
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:58,591	| IOT100 |	Ideal for things that are not in the home or in
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,127	| IOT100 |	Things are on the Move Realty
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:00,639	| IOT100 |	Having a
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:01,919	| IOT100 |	Connection anywhere
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,455	| IOT100 |	Expensive things
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,479	| IOT100 |	Cameras that's a good one
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:07,295	| IOT100 |	I don't think you'll see it in cars
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:13,183	| IOT100 |	There for that but
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:17,535	| IOT100 |	Bring some little like smartconnect and scooters and such
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,047	| IOT100 |	Dutch oven
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:22,143	| IOT100 |	Sweater Segways
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:23,935	| IOT100 |	Well what would be really interesting
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,215	| IOT100 |	Actually is
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:26,495	| IOT100 |	Not LTE
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:27,519	| IOT100 |	Which gay
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:30,847	| IOT100 |	But getting something like LTE cat 1M
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:31,615	| IOT100 |	Or
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:33,151	| IOT100 |	Nb-iot Witcher
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:35,967	| IOT100 |	Versions of cellular radio
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:37,503	| IOT100 |	Cellular standards
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,527	| IOT100 |	Design for small data
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:42,367	| IOT100 |	Those chips are just now coming out where to see a bunch of
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,415	| IOT100 |	Congress
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,207	| IOT100 |	When that happen
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,511	| IOT100 |	A mad rush to
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,583	| IOT100 |	Cellular it all kinds of
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:55,423	| IOT100 |	World Congress
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:57,727	| IOT100 |	We got some cool news actually
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:58,751	| IOT100 |	Next week
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,287	| IOT100 |	Is Mobile World Congress
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,567	| IOT100 |	Congress Kevin is not going
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,615	| IOT100 |	I am not doing
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:04,639	| IOT100 |	So so
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:10,015	| IOT100 |	I found a couple things to look for we've already talked about some of the new network
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:11,807	| IOT100 |	The new Chips
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:12,319	| IOT100 |	But
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:16,671	| IOT100 |	There is a blockchain platform
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,463	| IOT100 |	I'm actually talk to these guys
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,023	| IOT100 |	A long time ago
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,815	| IOT100 |	But it's called iota
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:24,607	| IOT100 |	And basically
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,911	| IOT100 |	It is a
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:29,471	| IOT100 |	It's not a cryptocurrency but it's it's a distributed Ledger
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:32,543	| IOT100 |	Is going to allow you to
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:34,847	| IOT100 |	Track stuff that happens at a low
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:36,383	| IOT100 |	Low power low data rate
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:42,527	| IOT100 |	Kind of slow as soon as a result stand in terms of processing how many transactions per second
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,319	| IOT100 |	It's interesting that they
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:48,415	| IOT100 |	Do 7 / 2nd where they say Visa does mm
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:53,023	| IOT100 |	Some scalability that's got any work out there if it's going to
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,559	| IOT100 |	Really take off I think but
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,327	| IOT100 |	It's interesting
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:57,887	| IOT100 |	Yeah so this is things like if I were at mobile world
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:13:59,935	| IOT100 |	Check this out
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:00,959	| IOT100 |	And they also the developer
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:02,239	| IOT100 |	With nautical
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:07,103	| IOT100 |	Is canonical has iot core
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,919	| IOT100 |	OS kind of platform
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,943	| IOT100 |	So maybe
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:15,295	| IOT100 |	This is for microvilli
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:18,879	| IOT100 |	Doing kind of automated contractor charging for things
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:20,927	| IOT100 |	Crazy small scale
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,439	| IOT100 |	Tails so
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:25,023	| IOT100 |	Yeah maybe you're by your washing machine can buy
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:25,535	| IOT100 |	Detergent
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:27,583	| IOT100 |	Those kind of things
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:31,679	| IOT100 |	Amazing
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,727	| IOT100 |	That would be nice
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:39,615	| IOT100 |	Will find a use desperately
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:44,479	| IOT100 |	And we also saw coming out at
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:45,503	| IOT100 |	Mobile World Congress
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,527	| IOT100 |	A new
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:48,831	| IOT100 |	Everything
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:56,767	| IOT100 |	But I guess I can understand why they need a new hub for this because this is something called
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:57,535	| IOT100 |	Tabs
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:15:03,679	| IOT100 |	That's kind of like a play on keeping tabs on people it's a solution for busy families
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:08,031	| IOT100 |	And they're using that's the real Laura and that
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:12,639	| IOT100 |	Wi-Fi and Laura and therefore I can understand why in this instance
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,151	| IOT100 |	Stay With Me
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:18,015	| IOT100 |	So they're washing are they
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:18,527	| IOT100 |	Off
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:19,551	| IOT100 |	Bubble Rock on
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:23,135	| IOT100 |	Okay okay
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,927	| IOT100 |	And they're doing
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:27,231	| IOT100 |	And for those of you guys who
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:28,767	| IOT100 |	Do not regularly follow the show
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:31,327	| IOT100 |	Laura is a low-power
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:33,631	| IOT100 |	Wide area network so you can send
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,911	| IOT100 |	Small amounts of data
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:37,471	| IOT100 |	Fairly cheaply over really long distances
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:37,983	| IOT100 |	And it's
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:40,543	| IOT100 |	Predator 2 things like nb-iot
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:41,823	| IOT100 |	And
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,103	| IOT100 |	LTE Cat 1
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,175	| IOT100 |	That's that
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:47,455	| IOT100 |	So look for a new house in your life
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:54,623	| IOT100 |	It's not just a hug cuz they have a bunch of devices that you can actually wear for kids could wear that

EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,871	| IOT100 |	I have a dog that runs away
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:21,247	| IOT100 |	Keep tabs on the dog
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:25,087	| IOT100 |	Can I get the name I do
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:30,463	| IOT100 |	I just need for The Hobbit
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:34,815	| IOT100 |	All right now it's time for a
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:35,327	| IOT100 |	Debate
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:38,143	| IOT100 |	Joanna Stern at the Wall Street Journal
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,423	| IOT100 |	Read an article
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,471	| IOT100 |	Explaining that she has a problem
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:43,007	| IOT100 |	With all female personal assistants
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:46,591	| IOT100 |	She thinks going forward we should be maybe a little bit less
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:50,175	| IOT100 |	Research shows that
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:50,943	| IOT100 |	Prefer
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:54,015	| IOT100 |	I guess dictating & Hearing responses from a female
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:56,063	| IOT100 |	Voice so I'm curious Kevin
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:57,343	| IOT100 |	Do you think I Robot should be both
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:16:59,903	| IOT100 |	I think
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:01,439	| IOT100 |	Choices good in all things
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:06,303	| IOT100 |	I realize I don't have I don't see your customized
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:10,911	| IOT100 |	The Voice the way you would like to know you can already do that with different accents or language packs and such
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,959	| IOT100 |	So why can't you pick male or female you
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:17,823	| IOT100 |	That's a good question like why isn't there a Sean Connery skills
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:18,847	| IOT100 |	I'm guessing because it
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:20,895	| IOT100 |	Mutation that just
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:23,711	| IOT100 |	There are some like voice
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:27,807	| IOT100 |	You can get voices of specific people for certain apps and things I have seen that
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,087	| IOT100 |	The password can have you know
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:31,135	| IOT100 |	Batman read you your to-do list whatever
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:36,255	| IOT100 |	Personal Computing is it's personal and this is all part of personal Computing so
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,535	| IOT100 |	I should have that choice
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,071	| IOT100 |	You're dodging the sex
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:40,607	| IOT100 |	Question
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,143	| IOT100 |	Thank you
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:47,263	| IOT100 |	What what's your thought I really thought about this a lot
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:47,775	| IOT100 |	Because
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:51,359	| IOT100 |	I'm a woman who has strong feelings about this
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:53,407	| IOT100 |	Strong feelings about you know feminism
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:54,687	| IOT100 |	ViaSat
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:55,455	| IOT100 |	In our culture
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:56,991	| IOT100 |	This doesn't bother me
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:18:00,063	| IOT100 |	As much and I really was trying to let it bother me
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:04,927	| IOT100 |	It didn't bother me well you know I really gave it a lot of thought
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:06,207	| IOT100 |	Yeah it is kind of
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,999	| IOT100 |	I feel kind of
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:11,327	| IOT100 |	Ordering a female voice to do something
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,911	| IOT100 |	This is not a battle I feel like
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:15,423	| IOT100 |	Really strong
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:22,079	| IOT100 |	Yeah I don't I don't see it look at a phone or a
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:25,919	| IOT100 |	Echo or NC gender I just don't know and I guess that's why I don't really
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:26,943	| IOT100 |	It does not bother
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:28,223	| IOT100 |	I want the choice
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,527	| IOT100 |	It doesn't bother me
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:34,111	| IOT100 |	So many rescued baby towards female voices at beginning
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,695	| IOT100 |	So there we are we are
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:41,279	| IOT100 |	For now I'd love to hear from you
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:41,791	| IOT100 |	If you're like
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:45,887	| IOT100 |	Speaking
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:48,191	| IOT100 |	Personal assistants
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:48,703	| IOT100 |	Google

EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,031	| IOT100 |	But it feels pretty Limited
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,055	| IOT100 |	I would say
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,663	| IOT100 |	Rite Aid
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,431	| IOT100 |	Which is why
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,991	| IOT100 |	What you can buy stuff online
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:08,159	| IOT100 |	Allows users to order stuff through Google Express and more than 50 retail
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:08,927	| IOT100 |	Partners
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:11,743	| IOT100 |	Doubt I have never use Google
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:12,767	| IOT100 |	Express I don't know if I even
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,047	| IOT100 |	Access to it
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:17,631	| IOT100 |	I have not used it I would imagine that you do I mean
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:20,703	| IOT100 |	You asked that's was going to say
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,727	| IOT100 |	How is the bulk of

EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:26,335	| IOT100 |	I'm sure that you could use it but
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:30,687	| IOT100 |	I don't use it I don't use any of the Amazon fresh or any other those types of
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:33,759	| IOT100 |	Express-Times shopping services so I couldn't speak to it
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,063	| IOT100 |	We use the CPU something
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,855	| IOT100 |	What do we use
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:39,647	| IOT100 |	We use Amazon pantry
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:42,207	| IOT100 |	But not express have used Amazon now
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:43,487	| IOT100 |	Buy stuff

EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:22,911	| IOT100 |	It would be fun you know it is only through Google home I guess that's your Google Assistant because I could do this on my pixel
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,935	| IOT100 |	I don't have a Google home
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:24,703	| IOT100 |	I'll try it on
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:28,799	| IOT100 |	Okay I was going to say try it soon because I'm on the
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:32,383	| IOT100 |	Google Express web page it says through April 30th
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:34,687	| IOT100 |	This year when you shop via Google home
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:36,735	| IOT100 |	You don't have to worry about additional fees like ship
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:38,271	| IOT100 |	Woo
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,063	| IOT100 |	So now is a good time to try it
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:42,879	| IOT100 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:44,415	| IOT100 |	If you follow me on Twitter
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:47,487	| IOT100 |	You probably have heard about my trauma with the Logitech
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:48,255	| IOT100 |	Harmony Home
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:50,559	| IOT100 |	I'm going to talk about that next week
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:51,583	| IOT100 |	Because
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:54,399	| IOT100 |	I think some of my drama maybe like
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,423	| IOT100 |	User error
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:58,239	| IOT100 |	So I have to spend some time with Logitech 2
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,263	| IOT100 |	Work that out so
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:02,079	| IOT100 |	We're going to talk about it
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:03,615	| IOT100 |	Anytime
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:11,039	| IOT100 |	Oh and I don't have any connection blinds but I can talk about them and I'll tell you why
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:11,807	| IOT100 |	Because
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:15,135	| IOT100 |	One of the folks I work with that Google actually I report to him
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,416	| IOT100 |	He's been getting into the smartphone
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:20,768	| IOT100 |	Has been asking me for suggestions how to smarten up his home
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:23,584	| IOT100 |	Heaven
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:24,096	| IOT100 |	On call
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,912	| IOT100 |	I mean really that bad
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:27,424	| IOT100 |	That's just great
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:31,520	| IOT100 |	Yeah I could be like the kind like a Geek Squad, come to your house
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:33,568	| IOT100 |	What do you want to do all right let's make it happen
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:45,344	| IOT100 |	Let's go to eBay you can rent me
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:47,392	| IOT100 |	So anyway he
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:50,464	| IOT100 |	He's got a hug now and they did not listen and do not
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:51,744	| IOT100 |	Github recommended
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:56,864	| IOT100 |	Instead he got something else
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:59,168	| IOT100 |	He's got some light switches going to be like you know
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:03,264	| IOT100 |	I just got her how to do my blinds I got these the song FeFe radio
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:06,336	| IOT100 |	Frequency controller on my God will probably not her megahertz
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:10,432	| IOT100 |	Hey did you know that sound P makes
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:14,528	| IOT100 |	Interface Walmart that basically takes the
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:17,856	| IOT100 |	Radio frequencies and converts them to Z-Wave
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:18,624	| IOT100 |	Just kind of
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:20,672	| IOT100 |	It's an interface except I guess you call it a bridge
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:23,744	| IOT100 |	Yeah it handle 16 channels and
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:28,608	| IOT100 |	Since I do not have some people lines that you do Stacy you educated me before the show
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:30,144	| IOT100 |	Explain how the channels work
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:34,240	| IOT100 |	My kind of phone is like what one channel promoter but not necessarily to most like
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:36,032	| IOT100 |	You could do scenes of
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,080	| IOT100 |	3 blinds
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:41,664	| IOT100 |	Let's do a quick breakdown of motorized shade
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:44,224	| IOT100 |	Because some of this is generic
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:45,504	| IOT100 |	If you're using like the automated Hunter
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:47,552	| IOT100 |	Neutron star
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,320	| IOT100 |	Arena
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,600	| IOT100 |	Motors and Shay
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:50,624	| IOT100 |	So
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:53,952	| IOT100 |	What you'll do is every individual
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:55,232	| IOT100 |	Has
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:56,768	| IOT100 |	A motor that's going to go up
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:58,560	| IOT100 |	Down in it you know it depends on the size of your
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:01,376	| IOT100 |	Windows and all that somewhat like I have really large windows
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,144	| IOT100 |	So I have
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:03,680	| IOT100 |	Boaters kin
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:06,496	| IOT100 |	So it's not necessarily,
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:08,800	| IOT100 |	And you might
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:11,616	| IOT100 |	Want something where oh I'll my windows
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:13,664	| IOT100 |	Go up all at the same time
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:14,688	| IOT100 |	As opposed to Lake
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,456	| IOT100 |	Having two commands
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:16,224	| IOT100 |	And each individual one
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:17,504	| IOT100 |	So
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,296	| IOT100 |	Every time
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,064	| IOT100 |	You're going to group
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:22,112	| IOT100 |	Downloader
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:26,976	| IOT100 |	So depending on how many windows you have that's how many channels you should
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:28,768	| IOT100 |	So that's generic
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:30,560	| IOT100 |	With the salty stuff
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:32,864	| IOT100 |	I mentioned to Kevin
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:34,144	| IOT100 |	I have the sea wave
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:34,912	| IOT100 |	Module
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:37,472	| IOT100 |	Have an older version of it that has a literal click wheel on it
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:39,776	| IOT100 |	It's kind of a pain to setup
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,056	| IOT100 |	So
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:45,664	| IOT100 |	If you're working with any sort of Z-Wave thing that's going to control multiple
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:47,712	| IOT100 |	Channels are multiple devices
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:49,504	| IOT100 |	You're going to have to set up
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:51,296	| IOT100 |	With your hug you're going to set it up as a
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:51,808	| IOT100 |	Brain
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:54,368	| IOT100 |	So you put it on your Winker you're smart
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,184	| IOT100 |	As like
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:57,952	| IOT100 |	I am a brain
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:23:58,976	| IOT100 |	And then
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:01,792	| IOT100 |	You have to use the other channels for
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:02,816	| IOT100 |	You know all the individual
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,096	| IOT100 |	So it's
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,632	| IOT100 |	It's not into it
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:10,240	| IOT100 |	But the pros
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,056	| IOT100 |	Right
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,336	| IOT100 |	That's handy
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,360	| IOT100 |	Yes that's what my husband
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:17,664	| IOT100 |	But he's fast
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:18,688	| IOT100 |	For Christmas
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:25,856	| IOT100 |	Will you you got this module a couple years back the one that you can get the older one
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:28,416	| IOT100 |	And it was a couple hundred bucks
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:29,184	| IOT100 |	At the time
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:32,512	| IOT100 |	Dealer beeg
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:33,536	| IOT100 |	Because they didn't sell it on the in
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:38,144	| IOT100 |	Right right but now they sell the stuff on the internet
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:40,704	| IOT100 |	So I'm looking at Amazon right now and
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:44,288	| IOT100 |	For 289 the newer song 16 channel
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,336	| IOT100 |	Walmart juul is
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,360	| IOT100 |	Sounds like a pretty good deal
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:49,408	| IOT100 |	I'm going to recommend it to
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:52,992	| IOT100 |	The person that I'm talking to and trying to help out so
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:58,368	| IOT100 |	I don't know how many blinds he hasn't haven't even details at Sitel know if he'll need more than one of these
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:00,928	| IOT100 |	Because 16 channels may go quickly if he's got a lot of motor
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:03,488	| IOT100 |	Yes now I would say
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,512	| IOT100 |	If you don't have a lot of
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:07,584	| IOT100 |	There is an easier solution
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,120	| IOT100 |	Which is something now makes
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:10,400	| IOT100 |	It's out it's a
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:15,520	| IOT100 |	I think is Wi-Fi it's a salty radio protocol which is like art
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:16,288	| IOT100 |	Yes
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,056	| IOT100 |	Is what they call it
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:17,824	| IOT100 |	To WiFi
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:19,616	| IOT100 |	And they call that the Milan
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:26,272	| IOT100 |	This is expensive this is like $175 on Amazon
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,064	| IOT100 |	Instead of buying
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:29,344	| IOT100 |	I have like a remote
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:33,184	| IOT100 |	Blinds instead of doing that
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:33,952	| IOT100 |	My closet
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:35,232	| IOT100 |	But it was me
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:37,792	| IOT100 |	It actually integrates with Echo I believe
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,840	| IOT100 |	It also talks to iPhones
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:40,608	| IOT100 |	And Android phones
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:44,448	| IOT100 |	And is kind of actually if I had seen this
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:45,728	| IOT100 |	I probably
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:47,264	| IOT100 |	Cuz I would need two of them
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:48,800	| IOT100 |	I probably would have done that
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:51,360	| IOT100 |	Honest
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:52,384	| IOT100 |	If you have
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,224	| IOT100 |	It starts adding up at that
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:57,248	| IOT100 |	EXO
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:26:00,832	| IOT100 |	Because you did three of those replace all the channels this one
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:01,856	| IOT100 |	Unit cell
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:03,648	| IOT100 |	Well I'll give him both options and see what he does
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:08,000	| IOT100 |	Okay now it's time to talk about Wi-Fi routers
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:10,816	| IOT100 |	We love
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:13,888	| IOT100 |	So I have been trying the orbi router from that
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:18,752	| IOT100 |	This is in contrast to my house router which is the Eero mesh
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,056	| IOT100 |	Your some pots
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:23,104	| IOT100 |	The orbit
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:23,872	| IOT100 |	Is
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:24,640	| IOT100 |	Not a mesh Network
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:26,432	| IOT100 |	Is traditional
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,456	| IOT100 |	Traditional bassinet
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:28,480	| IOT100 |	It is
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:31,552	| IOT100 |	Network extender that just happens to have the same name
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:39,744	| IOT100 |	I basically put the main orbi router
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:43,072	| IOT100 |	In the middle of my house and I put the extender
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:46,656	| IOT100 |	Light socket to satellite in my office
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:47,424	| IOT100 |	At this end of the house
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:49,984	| IOT100 |	And I tried it in a couple places
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:52,288	| IOT100 |	My results were not
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:54,848	| IOT100 |	Is this is actually really great WiFi
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:56,128	| IOT100 |	It is a very powerful
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:58,432	| IOT100 |	But I think I would need another
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:01,504	| IOT100 |	Down at the other end
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:03,040	| IOT100 |	My house is my house in Spanish
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,064	| IOT100 |	Skinny
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:07,648	| IOT100 |	I can't stress this enough when you are picking a Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:09,184	| IOT100 |	Router basically
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:11,488	| IOT100 |	You are going to
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:13,280	| IOT100 |	Your house is going your mileage will vary
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:18,144	| IOT100 |	Without a doubt because the materials because of the the design
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:24,544	| IOT100 |	There's a lot of factors there's there's no way
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:28,384	| IOT100 |	Exactly so the orbi routers they cost
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:31,456	| IOT100 |	$400 my Eros cost 500
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:33,760	| IOT100 |	And so
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:34,528	| IOT100 |	You know
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:36,576	| IOT100 |	Is that for one base station on satellite
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:39,904	| IOT100 |	Churros cost
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:43,744	| IOT100 |	In my bedroom for example at the other end
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:45,024	| IOT100 |	My office
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:48,352	| IOT100 |	The network would slow it was slower at that Inn
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:53,216	| IOT100 |	It wasn't I still have 150 megabit per second connection so it wasn't me
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:53,984	| IOT100 |	Killing me
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:54,496	| IOT100 |	But I could definitely
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,312	| IOT100 |	Now
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:28:00,896	| IOT100 |	This did push out an amazing signal to my outdoor Wi-Fi
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,408	| IOT100 |	Camera
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:02,688	| IOT100 |	Which I have
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,712	| IOT100 |	The canary Flex running
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:04,992	| IOT100 |	Which
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:06,784	| IOT100 |	Hey doesn't actually play nicely with
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:08,320	| IOT100 |	Mesh networks right
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,856	| IOT100 |	Even though they're working on
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:12,160	| IOT100 |	So the orbi definitely made that cake
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:13,184	| IOT100 |	A lot better
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:17,024	| IOT100 |	When the satellite was in the middle of my house it did not work as well
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,304	| IOT100 |	Pretend camera
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:20,608	| IOT100 |	So that's why I kind of pushed it closer to the edge
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:23,680	| IOT100 |	And the other things to know about the
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,472	| IOT100 |	B router are
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:26,752	| IOT100 |	There is no app
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:28,288	| IOT100 |	You're going to have to go to the web
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:30,080	| IOT100 |	Login
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:32,128	| IOT100 |	And some people feel that this is a security
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:34,432	| IOT100 |	Issue is actually something that the FCC is got
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:36,480	| IOT100 |	Madelene
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:37,248	| IOT100 |	Jesus
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:39,296	| IOT100 |	How many spark is there
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:42,112	| IOT100 |	Hey you shouldn't have that open
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:43,392	| IOT100 |	Web-based login
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:45,696	| IOT100 |	Not secure
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:47,488	| IOT100 |	Did you make you change your password
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:49,024	| IOT100 |	So that's nice
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:52,352	| IOT100 |	And the features are okay but again you have to go
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:53,120	| IOT100 |	Login
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,656	| IOT100 |	Log into the router
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,168	| IOT100 |	Where to change
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:56,960	| IOT100 |	Switch
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:01,056	| IOT100 |	But you do ever you can do a guest Network I presume
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:05,152	| IOT100 |	Crucial
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:05,664	| IOT100 |	And
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:09,248	| IOT100 |	What supports lots of ports on it which I like in my
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:12,064	| IOT100 |	I have the Google onhub that I bought
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:13,856	| IOT100 |	And I also Google Wi-Fi unit
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:15,904	| IOT100 |	Check on a mission together
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:16,672	| IOT100 |	And
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:19,744	| IOT100 |	Kind of skimpy on the porch I think you have four on these guys
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:20,256	| IOT100 |	Baidu
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:22,304	| IOT100 |	Brothers Subs
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:24,608	| IOT100 |	Are all my husband
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:26,144	| IOT100 |	I know I know
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:28,960	| IOT100 |	And he has good ratings
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:29,984	| IOT100 |	Cena and
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:35,616	| IOT100 |	Actually it's the favorite of The Wirecutter it's the favorite quote-unquote mesh Network for them
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:37,152	| IOT100 |	Even that's not technically
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:40,992	| IOT100 |	I've seen it give it 4 stars PC
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:42,016	| IOT100 |	It does have
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:43,040	| IOT100 |	Three ethernet ports
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:44,832	| IOT100 |	Kevin was saying so that is a
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:46,112	| IOT100 |	And that's
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:48,160	| IOT100 |	Router and on the Hub itself
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:50,720	| IOT100 |	It's super easy to set up even though
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:51,488	| IOT100 |	Do you have to use the weather
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:53,024	| IOT100 |	But you know
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:53,536	| IOT100 |	I think
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:55,328	| IOT100 |	For my house set up
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:55,840	| IOT100 |	Eros going to
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:57,120	| IOT100 |	A little bit better
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,704	| IOT100 |	Literal end-to-end
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:01,728	| IOT100 |	Bridgeprep went into my house
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:06,336	| IOT100 |	Right if you added a third unit
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,616	| IOT100 |	Second satellite in your case
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:11,456	| IOT100 |	Match what you have with the Eros is your three year old
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:17,344	| IOT100 |	Then maybe
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:20,160	| IOT100 |	Actually I think they just shoot me
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:21,696	| IOT100 |	More patlak more consistent
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:23,232	| IOT100 |	Signal strength
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,256	| IOT100 |	Throughout the whole house

EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:25,184	| IOT100 |	Videon
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:29,280	| IOT100 |	To talk about how we're going to build an even more distributed internet
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:35,680	| IOT100 |	Hey everyone we're taking a break for the podcast for a few moments
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:40,800	| IOT100 |	To bring you a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is spending
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:42,080	| IOT100 |	And we have Brian
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:44,640	| IOT100 |	Toll from spin dance
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:46,688	| IOT100 |	Good how are you Stacy
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:47,712	| IOT100 |	I am great
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:48,992	| IOT100 |	So okay let's
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:50,272	| IOT100 |	Reminder audience
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:52,320	| IOT100 |	Who is Ben dance and what are you guys do
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:56,160	| IOT100 |	Sundance is a consultancy that helps organizations design
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:57,440	| IOT100 |	Develop and manage
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:32:00,768	| IOT100 |	The software for their iot products we work with Fortune 500 company
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:01,536	| IOT100 |	He's like whirlpool
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:05,632	| IOT100 |	Ford Motor Company along with smaller manufacturers and startups
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:09,216	| IOT100 |	Within that space we help with it strategy and we also
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:11,520	| IOT100 |	Do embedded cloud and mobile programming
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,800	| IOT100 |	Increasingly were asked
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:15,104	| IOT100 |	To develop voice application
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:16,128	| IOT100 |	Inspire customers to
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:18,176	| IOT100 |	Voice is indeed hot
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,968	| IOT100 |	So what are you guys see
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:22,784	| IOT100 |	Spin dance has actually been developing voice
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,832	| IOT100 |	Integration for the automobile industry
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:25,600	| IOT100 |	4 years
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:27,648	| IOT100 |	Amazon Echo and Google home
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:32,000	| IOT100 |	Are making that sort of Technology much more accessible for a typical iot product
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:33,280	| IOT100 |	Yes I've heard that
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:36,096	| IOT100 |	You can't even develop a consumer product now without some sort of voice
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:37,888	| IOT100 |	By our company's interests
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:46,080	| IOT100 |	Yes they are we're seeing more and more industrial and consumer customers looking at voice to improve the experience in places like
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:47,616	| IOT100 |	What kitchens are warehouses
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:48,640	| IOT100 |	Or even the fact
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:51,456	| IOT100 |	Before what should I be thinking about when
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:51,968	| IOT100 |	When I'm designing
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:59,136	| IOT100 |	First of all don't be afraid of it it's much easier to prototype a voice application that it is a mobile app
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:32:59,904	| IOT100 |	For example
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:01,952	| IOT100 |	Instead of a GUI with a G
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:03,744	| IOT100 |	You're really developing in Bowie
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:05,792	| IOT100 |	With a V and it's much easier to get in
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:08,352	| IOT100 |	You can build a prototype in just a day or two
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:10,912	| IOT100 |	It's also easier to do user research for voice
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:14,752	| IOT100 |	The flipside though is that testing and fine-tuning the voice app
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:16,544	| IOT100 |	Can be much more time consuming
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:22,944	| IOT100 |	Bennett mobile application so you definitely want to leave time for that at the end and in our experience the gooey part of
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:24,224	| IOT100 |	The application
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:26,528	| IOT100 |	Is the easy part. To your back and
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:28,320	| IOT100 |	Can be very difficult
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:33,696	| IOT100 |	It's not designed for voice integration
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:35,744	| IOT100 |	What should I be thinking about as I building
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:38,304	| IOT100 |	There's two things you want to keep in mind
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,328	| IOT100 |	What is
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:42,912	| IOT100 |	What is your back and look like and is it prepared to integrate with
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:43,936	| IOT100 |	A voice interface
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:50,848	| IOT100 |	Secondly if you're serious about it you're better off engaging Amazon and Google in developing the Africa
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:52,128	| IOT100 |	Patient getting their feedback
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:53,920	| IOT100 |	Sooner rather than later
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:56,224	| IOT100 |	And you worked with a couple customers already
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:58,272	| IOT100 |	What if they giving you is their feet
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:00,832	| IOT100 |	I think most people are aware of the skills
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:02,368	| IOT100 |	But you can write
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:03,136	| IOT100 |	For voice
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:04,416	| IOT100 |	Integration systems
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:06,720	| IOT100 |	And skills are similar to apps free
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:08,000	| IOT100 |	For mobile phones
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:12,864	| IOT100 |	But what they aren't aware of as you can actually embed the Alexa service directly into
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:13,888	| IOT100 |	Your own Hardware
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:17,984	| IOT100 |	Which is pretty cool people learn more about spin dance
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:19,264	| IOT100 |	Including voice
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:26,176	| IOT100 |	People can visit spin dance.com IRT to download a free whitepaper I'm building end-to-end iot products
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:31,296	| IOT100 |	And if they're interested in boys they can drop us an email at hello at spin dance.com
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:37,696	| IOT100 |	Let me be more than happy to talk to them about integrating voice into their iot products
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:44,096	| IOT100 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:45,376	| IOT100 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,656	| IOT100 |	And today's guest is
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:47,936	| IOT100 |	Jumperoo
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:50,240	| IOT100 |	Who is the founder and CEO of
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:53,568	| IOT100 |	Evenium who says he is building the internet of moving thing
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:56,640	| IOT100 |	Well basically you know we look at
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:35:03,040	| IOT100 |	Cars trucks and buses you know not just as machines that carry people and goods from one point to the other but as
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:05,344	| IOT100 |	Active nodes of the internet
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:09,696	| IOT100 |	And also as critical elements for smart cities
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:15,840	| IOT100 |	So once you look at these machines or no as mobile Wi-Fi hotspot says access points and network routers on Wii
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:21,216	| IOT100 |	I've been a lot of changes and that's basically what the name is doing is delivering a platform
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:25,824	| IOT100 |	Is he able to deliver this internet of moving things
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:26,592	| IOT100 |	Because all I can think of
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:28,384	| IOT100 |	How does this actually work
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,920	| IOT100 |	Is there going to be a software on my
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:33,248	| IOT100 |	Car for the users it's completely transparent
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:34,528	| IOT100 |	So you will use this
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:36,064	| IOT100 |	As any Wi-Fi hotspot
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:41,184	| IOT100 |	At home in in the office or in the cafe but essentially you know the network
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:47,584	| IOT100 |	Manages itself let me give you an example veniam the company I found it in the end manager
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:48,608	| IOT100 |	Actually
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:50,144	| IOT100 |	I deployed the largest
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:51,936	| IOT100 |	Vehicle mesh Network in the world
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:54,496	| IOT100 |	So we did this in Porto Portugal where we have
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:58,336	| IOT100 |	All the buses and some taxis garbage collection trucks
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:03,200	| IOT100 |	Serving as Wi-Fi hotspots and connecting to each other information to the internet
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:07,552	| IOT100 |	And today we actually serve free Wi-Fi to about 400 thousand users
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:13,952	| IOT100 |	Alberta hind the scenes are veiny arms Hardware software and call Solutions art you know making sure
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:20,352	| IOT100 |	That all of these devices are connected to each other and basically are not only providing free Wi-Fi but actually
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:23,680	| IOT100 |	Gathering all sorts of data for different types of applications
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:27,264	| IOT100 |	So how does this work from a technical perspective what is actually
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:35,200	| IOT100 |	The Venom is actually a full-stack company in that we owned the hardware the software in the cloud components that make
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:37,760	| IOT100 |	Networks of moving things possible and also
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:40,832	| IOT100 |	But allow us to offer no managed services
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:47,232	| IOT100 |	And so typically our customers are companies that own and operate large fleets and they come to us and say for exam
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:50,816	| IOT100 |	You know I have 400 bus has 200,000 passengers a year
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:57,216	| IOT100 |	I want them to have an excellent internet experience I want branding and advertising but I don't want to worry about
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:59,520	| IOT100 |	Hardware software SIM card cell data plans
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:01,568	| IOT100 |	How much does it cost me per month for a vehicle
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:07,456	| IOT100 |	To be able to offer a service like that to my customers and so we take care of
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:10,528	| IOT100 |	All of that in that hassle-free way
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:14,112	| IOT100 |	And then we are able to add other things like
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:17,952	| IOT100 |	Footage from surveillance cameras on board diagnostics Aldi's
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:24,096	| IOT100 |	High-bandwidth applications and ultimately you know the big advantages that are able to move
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:28,704	| IOT100 |	Massive amounts of data between the vehicles in the cloud at a very affordable cost
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:29,216	| IOT100 |	What is your back
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:33,056	| IOT100 |	For something like this cuz I can see the Wi-Fi on the buses I can see the
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:34,592	| IOT100 |	The management challenge
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:35,360	| IOT100 |	How is it actually can
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:42,784	| IOT100 |	It's a multi Network approach very much in the spirit of 5G in that we have youngboy devices
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:47,648	| IOT100 |	Is with wireless interfaces ranging from Wi-Fi to 4G LTE
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:54,048	| IOT100 |	Dsrc which is the standard for vehicle to vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication which actually use this
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:56,352	| IOT100 |	A frequency band The 5.9 gigahertz
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:38:03,008	| IOT100 |	That's in the US than in Europe has been reserved for intelligent transportation systems and it's so far underutilize
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:06,080	| IOT100 |	Until we're actually able to grab 75 megahertz
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:09,920	| IOT100 |	Spectrum that nobody else is using
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:15,808	| IOT100 |	Experience and so basically the device is choosing between these different networks and is also doing all the handovers
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:17,856	| IOT100 |	Between all these different Networks
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:24,256	| IOT100 |	So that you can jump on any bus start a Skype call or a YouTube video and even though the bus is switching but
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:29,888	| IOT100 |	Now I connect to this guy a call now I connect to this access point now I go back to Cellular
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:32,192	| IOT100 |	Your Skype call and YouTube video never break down
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:35,520	| IOT100 |	So we could actually be doing this interview in a moving bus
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:38,848	| IOT100 |	In Puerto or in Singapore or in a shuttle in downtown New York
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:40,896	| IOT100 |	I would like I live in Austin
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:42,688	| IOT100 |	I have no clue
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:46,528	| IOT100 |	This is really hard when
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:48,064	| IOT100 |	When Comcast in
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:51,648	| IOT100 |	It used to be Time Warner Cable within Cox they created this
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:52,928	| IOT100 |	Wi-Fi network for
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:56,768	| IOT100 |	The Northeast Corridor for trains and that sort of thing that took a lot of
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:39:00,096	| IOT100 |	Technical brain power to do handoffs over Wi-Fi
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:02,400	| IOT100 |	The cellular guys have done this for
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:03,168	| IOT100 |	A while
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:06,240	| IOT100 |	So is your kind of magic software the ability to
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:07,520	| IOT100 |	To manage all of this
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:08,544	| IOT100 |	Precisely
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:11,104	| IOT100 |	So the salad carriers I have done this for
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:15,456	| IOT100 |	Long time but this is in from South Station to seven
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:16,992	| IOT100 |	Shell station in the network.
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:19,296	| IOT100 |	Decentralised in which they control entirely
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:24,416	| IOT100 |	We're able to do that across different networks using different Technologies managed by different people
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:25,952	| IOT100 |	It is actually
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:28,768	| IOT100 |	Sadly most people will just be like
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:30,560	| IOT100 |	Dang it my Wi-Fi on my buses
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:37,728	| IOT100 |	But you know that that's because they don't have to build a network themselves
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:41,056	| IOT100 |	Let's break down the idea of now I've got Wi-Fi
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:42,848	| IOT100 |	On city buses
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:46,176	| IOT100 |	What does that enable and you know maybe I've got Wi-Fi enough
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:47,456	| IOT100 |	Let's just stick with the city stuff
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:49,760	| IOT100 |	Also.
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:51,552	| IOT100 |	On my city Vehicles MyCiTi bus
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:52,064	| IOT100 |	What can I do
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:55,904	| IOT100 |	Well most of all yours now transformed these vehicles
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:57,952	| IOT100 |	Into active nodes in the network
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:04,608	| IOT100 |	That is constantly moving and constantly evolving and so now everything else that you can do is actually software
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:11,264	| IOT100 |	Beyond providing fully-managed mobile Wi-Fi you can get tons of data from the vehicle to the cloud
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:18,176	| IOT100 |	At what do we want this for well for one we want to be able to know exactly how the vehicle is doing predict
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:20,480	| IOT100 |	If it's going to break down before it breaks down
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:26,112	| IOT100 |	Know the fuel consumption driver behaviour safety profile you want to get footage
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:28,416	| IOT100 |	Security cameras
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:34,304	| IOT100 |	Are high-bandwidth applications that are only possible you know where the network that is able to scale to provide that
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:40,704	| IOT100 |	And in the future you know with autonomous vehicles coming much much faster than anyone imagined and where mobile
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:47,104	| IOT100 |	Melody services are going to be provided you know on demand in the in a network like this you are going to have to move you
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:50,688	| IOT100 |	Many more terabytes of data between the vehicles in the clouds
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:55,552	| IOT100 |	And so ultimately you know the Wi-Fi applications just the first one that justifies
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:57,856	| IOT100 |	Placing an on-board unit in a vehicle
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:41:04,768	| IOT100 |	But once you do that you have a new network infrastructure that can allow you to do a lot more
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:05,792	| IOT100 |	Things on top of that
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:07,840	| IOT100 |	So you're providing basically
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:09,632	| IOT100 |	Cool mesh pipe
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:10,400	| IOT100 |	Cobble together
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:12,448	| IOT100 |	Is it
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:16,032	| IOT100 |	Are you guys also going to provide things like the data
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:20,384	| IOT100 |	Analysis for vehicular maintenance or does that actually go to some other
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:27,296	| IOT100 |	Once you have this Wireless interfit infrastructure Vehicles do you still need to bridge the gap to the cloud and make sure
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:33,696	| IOT100 |	Sure that you have very low latency mechanisms that allow you to actually capture the day to process the data locally decide what do I say
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:39,584	| IOT100 |	Immediately what do I send later so that then applications can actually do something about that those data streams
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:42,656	| IOT100 |	And so what we provide is that these data API
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:44,704	| IOT100 |	Some of the applications we do ourselves
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:51,104	| IOT100 |	Like mobile Wi-Fi doesn't mention but also mobile advertising so the ability to place contents in digital
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:52,640	| IOT100 |	Walgreens inside of buses
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:59,039	| IOT100 |	But then other applications like sleep management or telematics and be built on top of our platform by
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:03,135	| IOT100 |	Other players who have done this already for for fleets worldwide
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:03,903	| IOT100 |	Awesome so
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:05,951	| IOT100 |	What kind of
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:09,535	| IOT100 |	City services can you provide once you have this network
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:15,935	| IOT100 |	So let's kind of dig into the idea of you know being able to provide bandwidth for cameras surveillance cameras
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:16,703	| IOT100 |	Sore
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:19,519	| IOT100 |	Maybe I'm trying to think if there's better wi-fi at bus stop
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:20,799	| IOT100 |	I don't know
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:22,079	| IOT100 |	So beyond having
EDL	00:42:22,079	00:42:28,479	| IOT100 |	Better connectivity and internet access for lots and lots of people in and also as a means to
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:30,783	| IOT100 |	Bridge the digital divide in in our cities
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:37,183	| IOT100 |	We can actually leverage all of the data that the vehicles are picking up not just to maintain the Via
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:39,231	| IOT100 |	Michaels or manage The Fleets more efficiently
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:45,631	| IOT100 |	But also to learn about the infrastructure about the city climate and and the
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:51,263	| IOT100 |	Any other things that are relevant to make our cities smarter safer and and nicer to live
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:57,151	| IOT100 |	At one example is that Porto already gets a date Avaya Venom's data's API
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:43:03,551	| IOT100 |	Two-time the traffic lights to
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:04,319	| IOT100 |	Smarter way
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:10,463	| IOT100 |	And that's just a few of the examples of how a city can become much better provider
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:12,511	| IOT100 |	Quality of life
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:14,047	| IOT100 |	If its uses
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:16,863	| IOT100 |	All these vehicles and we're talking essentially about
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:18,143	| IOT100 |	Fleet vehicles
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:19,679	| IOT100 |	As mobile sensors
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:21,983	| IOT100 |	Capturing Urban data at large scale
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:23,263	| IOT100 |	So where else
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:24,799	| IOT100 |	Provided the
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:33,503	| IOT100 |	So we have it at commercial level already in Puerto Singapore and New York
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:39,391	| IOT100 |	And we have a number of other cities right now that will be rolling out throughout this year
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:42,207	| IOT100 |	We like to partner with Telecom operators big
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:44,511	| IOT100 |	For three main reasons one is
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:50,399	| IOT100 |	The fiber in the cellular network we enable them to do more with their infrastructure and we obviously need the back hall
EDL	00:43:50,399	00:43:56,799	| IOT100 |	The second aspect is that they have access to a large number of customers that own and operate large fleets
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:59,359	| IOT100 |	Send so they can also help us distribute the solution
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:02,687	| IOT100 |	A number three Telecom operators are themselves
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:04,735	| IOT100 |	Owners of very large fleas
EDL	00:44:04,735	00:44:10,879	| IOT100 |	That we can use again for as as mobile but also as mobile sensors for urban data
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:17,023	| IOT100 |	So right now our strategy is to partner with with Telecom operators and and leverage these three
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:19,583	| IOT100 |	She makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:23,167	| IOT100 |	I'm it also gives you great Network effects cuz if you were going after individuals
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:24,447	| IOT100 |	I'm like
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:26,239	| IOT100 |	I think it was cool
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:27,775	| IOT100 |	Having my one car roaming around
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:29,055	| IOT100 |	Does nothing
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:29,823	| IOT100 |	Are very low
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:36,223	| IOT100 |	If you think about it there are 1.2 billion vehicles in the world and only 5% of them are connected to the internet
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:42,623	| IOT100 |	Initially we did think about a consumer approach and adding it to private vehicles but then we realized that
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:47,743	| IOT100 |	No private Vehicles go to work in the morning and they come back in the evening so they're limited network effects there
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:52,351	| IOT100 |	And on the other hand fleet vehicles are 26% of vehicles worldwide
EDL	00:44:52,351	00:44:58,751	| IOT100 |	And that percentage is growing every single day they traveled more than 50% of the deal
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:44:59,775	| IOT100 |	Miles
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:04,895	| IOT100 |	And so as you think of Norman's disruption in which the transportation sector is right now with
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:09,247	| IOT100 |	People taking Uber and Lyft and leaving their cars at home
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:15,647	| IOT100 |	Then you're saying that the percentage of fleet vehicles is only increasing and once the autonomous vehicles come in
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:18,719	| IOT100 |	Which most people predict to be around 2020
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:22,815	| IOT100 |	Then we are actually going to see that most of the vehicles are going to be pleased
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:24,095	| IOT100 |	And so looking at that
EDL	00:45:24,863	00:45:25,887	| IOT100 |	These fleets
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:28,191	| IOT100 |	Mobility as a service providers
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:32,799	| IOT100 |	As part of the infrastructure I believe this the right way to think about
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:35,103	| IOT100 |	The future and how cities can become
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:39,455	| IOT100 |	You know more efficient wave iron mentally sustainable and provide an even better quality of life
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:41,759	| IOT100 |	Right because actually these people
EDL	00:45:41,759	00:45:48,159	| IOT100 |	Living in dense urban areas where this makes the most sense are the ones most likely to give up their car
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:51,231	| IOT100 |	Switch to an Uber and automated system
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:52,767	| IOT100 |	Bringing in something like
EDL	00:45:52,767	00:45:59,167	| IOT100 |	Drones in I just thinking crazy thoughts here because I love drones and I think it's kind of fun so I'm trying to imagine you know
EDL	00:45:59,167	00:46:00,959	| IOT100 |	Could you much like
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:04,287	| IOT100 |	Google and Facebook are trying to create connectivity with like
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:06,335	| IOT100 |	Everything from balloons tula
EDL	00:46:06,335	00:46:08,383	| IOT100 |	Find airplane solar powered airplanes
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:10,175	| IOT100 |	What about bringing something like
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:17,855	| IOT100 |	So Google is looking at balloons Facebook is looking at drones so venom has its feet a little bit closer to the ground
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:22,207	| IOT100 |	So please locate vehicle and we started with vehicles because they're everywhere
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:23,487	| IOT100 |	They have batteries
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:26,303	| IOT100 |	That keep recharging so we don't have to worry about energy
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:32,447	| IOT100 |	And they even have their own Vehicles can use but it's just the beginning
EDL	00:46:32,959	00:46:35,519	| IOT100 |	What we call the internet of moving things
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:38,335	| IOT100 |	We have a market segment
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:40,895	| IOT100 |	That shows us points as to what
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:44,991	| IOT100 |	The future of cities going to look like which are industrial environments like
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:50,623	| IOT100 |	Ports and airports in construction sites where actually the internet of things in my view is progressing the fastest
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:54,719	| IOT100 |	Type of rhino industry 4.0 approach
EDL	00:46:54,719	00:47:00,863	| IOT100 |	Actually connecting everything in the controlled space like that makes a lot of sense in and our first customer was actually a container term
EDL	00:47:01,375	00:47:04,959	| IOT100 |	Why we have not only trucks but also cranes and boats
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:06,495	| IOT100 |	And other
EDL	00:47:06,495	00:47:07,519	| IOT100 |	Mobile assets
EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:13,919	| IOT100 |	That are providing connectivity but also Gathering real-time data to make the operations more efficient sober
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:19,295	| IOT100 |	Bring ships faster in an asteroid loading and unloading them with with greater safety
EDL	00:47:19,295	00:47:22,879	| IOT100 |	And so I think that there we can see that you know in the future
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:24,159	| IOT100 |	You're going to have
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:26,719	| IOT100 |	Yes not just beer in Connected vehicles that
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:29,023	| IOT100 |	That build internet of moving things but also
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:34,655	| IOT100 |	Robots drones all of these things need to be connected and that's where you know we have to
EDL	00:47:35,167	00:47:39,263	| IOT100 |	Be real and accept the fact that the current Internet is actually
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:40,287	| IOT100 |	Not ready
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:42,335	| IOT100 |	For the massive
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:48,735	| IOT100 |	Mobility and the type of machine-to-machine connectivity requirements that all of these mobile
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:51,807	| IOT100 |	Acids are removing things are going to to need
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:54,111	| IOT100 |	And so to be able to scale we need the network
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:58,719	| IOT100 |	Effects of mesh technology we need the ability than to process all these data streams
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:01,535	| IOT100 |	That they arrived at the cloud in a way that
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:03,839	| IOT100 |	Ensure is the best operation mime on all of these
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:05,631	| IOT100 |	Moving things
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:06,655	| IOT100 |	That's why I do things
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:09,215	| IOT100 |	Drones are a part of the equation but think robots
EDL	00:48:09,215	00:48:15,103	| IOT100 |	The future of autonomous vehicle which is not going to look at all like the vehicle we have today
EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:20,735	| IOT100 |	What are some of the big challenges of building basically an autonomous Network that's going to be made up of
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:22,527	| IOT100 |	Hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of thing
EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:29,439	| IOT100 |	Well the key is to move towards Distributing also the intelligence and decision and not
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:29,951	| IOT100 |	Just the device
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:32,767	| IOT100 |	In the sense that you know if you expect
EDL	00:48:32,767	00:48:38,143	| IOT100 |	All of these devices to have the connection to one Central brain that is basically orchestrating the whole thing
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:44,543	| IOT100 |	Then you run into problems of latency security single point of failure
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:47,615	| IOT100 |	All sorts of obstacles to actually making
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:51,967	| IOT100 |	Leveraging the network effects that you get from having more and more devices
EDL	00:48:51,967	00:48:56,063	| IOT100 |	Essentially the technical challenges to the find the local rules
EDL	00:48:56,063	00:49:02,463	| IOT100 |	I buy which these devices interact with each other and engage with each other that ultimately generate the kind of emergency
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:03,231	| IOT100 |	Behavior for the network
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:07,327	| IOT100 |	That is desirable in ensure is that it doesn't break down
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:13,727	| IOT100 |	And so defining this local rules that's a lot of the work that we do as many again vehicles
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:20,127	| IOT100 |	Good way to start special leaf lease because automatically the vehicles that the buses trust each other they belong to the same Fleet and survive
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:23,711	| IOT100 |	All of them competing for the wireless access they can actually
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:26,271	| IOT100 |	Coordinators wireless access among each other
EDL	00:49:26,271	00:49:28,319	| IOT100 |	And share those network resources in the
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:30,111	| IOT100 |	Smarter better way
EDL	00:49:30,111	00:49:32,415	| IOT100 |	Until we work a lot on this notion that
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:34,975	| IOT100 |	We have local clusters of nodes that
EDL	00:49:34,975	00:49:36,511	| IOT100 |	Help each other
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:42,911	| IOT100 |	I make the best use of the available network resources
EDL	00:49:42,911	00:49:43,935	| IOT100 |	Private are for
EDL	00:49:43,935	00:49:50,335	| IOT100 |	Running around at the same city do they share their connectivity yes only occur
EDL	00:49:50,335	00:49:52,639	| IOT100 |	When you actually have those interactions
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:59,039	| IOT100 |	And so you have to insure end-to-end security so there's no privacy breaches but at the same time at the network level
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:50:02,623	| IOT100 |	These are nodes in the network that's basically cooperate with each other
EDL	00:50:02,623	00:50:08,767	| IOT100 |	And also the access points are multi-tenancy in that you have the same infrastructure but they are used by
EDL	00:50:08,767	00:50:13,631	| IOT100 |	Different operators in different Tennyson so that's also part of the platform
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:20,031	| IOT100 |	What is the Temple of this is exactly how many key Global players are thinking today about 5G
EDL	00:50:20,031	00:50:23,871	| IOT100 |	With 5G I'm seeing a completely different attitude it's more about
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:28,223	| IOT100 |	Ensuring that you know all these different networks are able to work together
EDL	00:50:28,223	00:50:34,623	| IOT100 |	To ensure that everyone has the connectivity there Nita and I welcome this approach because I do think that
EDL	00:50:34,623	00:50:41,023	| IOT100 |	The future is going to be
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:42,559	| IOT100 |	Using in different ways
EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:48,959	| IOT100 |	A big hurdle to overcome actually has nothing to do with technology that has to do with finding the right business models that also
EDL	00:50:48,959	00:50:50,239	| IOT100 |	Autoscale
EDL	00:50:50,239	00:50:51,519	| IOT100 |	How much is this going to
EDL	00:50:51,519	00:50:56,127	| IOT100 |	Cost because right now Cellular's expensive Wi-Fi quote-unquote free so
EDL	00:50:56,127	00:51:00,479	| IOT100 |	How do you think about building a business model around all of these Technologies in
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:02,271	| IOT100 |	For an ecosystem
EDL	00:51:02,271	00:51:07,135	| IOT100 |	So today the revenue for mobile Wi-Fi comes from to Maine
EDL	00:51:07,135	00:51:13,535	| IOT100 |	Sides one is the preservation companies themselves who want to increase ridership provide a better quality of experience and so
EDL	00:51:13,535	00:51:19,935	| IOT100 |	So they are willing to pay for the the extra connectivity they're giving for free to people
EDL	00:51:19,935	00:51:22,239	| IOT100 |	The second is through advertising
EDL	00:51:22,239	00:51:28,639	| IOT100 |	So you have a captive audience that is ready to receive the content and not just on the splash screens but actually on
EDL	00:51:28,639	00:51:32,223	| IOT100 |	Digital screen put inside and outside so that's one model
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:37,087	| IOT100 |	But then there's also the monetization of the urban data picked up by the vehicles
EDL	00:51:37,087	00:51:43,487	| IOT100 |	Which is interesting nachos for cities and municipalities is also interesting again for all sorts of
EDL	00:51:43,487	00:51:48,095	| IOT100 |	Players in the private sector can pick up a lot of local data
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:54,495	| IOT100 |	Set the saddle as I'm not able to pick up for example you know the pictures of the the windows of certain shops
EDL	00:51:54,495	00:52:00,895	| IOT100 |	Start counting the people in different parts of the city all of this is anonymized so that you don't break the user privacy but you're actually able
EDL	00:52:00,895	00:52:03,455	| IOT100 |	Call them tomorrow. Very valuable data
EDL	00:52:03,455	00:52:09,855	| IOT100 |	That many players say for example foot traffic in different parts of the city in different parts of the days valuable
EDL	00:52:09,855	00:52:16,255	| IOT100 |	For the huge number of Industries high and so that's the kind of thing that will enable us to fund the connected
EDL	00:52:16,255	00:52:22,399	| IOT100 |	Give it to you later on once we get to critical mass of connected vehicles and and the critical mass of users
EDL	00:52:23,167	00:52:23,935	| IOT100 |	Okay
EDL	00:52:23,935	00:52:25,215	| IOT100 |	I can't wait to see this everywhere
EDL	00:52:25,215	00:52:25,727	| IOT100 |	So hopefully
EDL	00:52:27,007	00:52:28,287	| IOT100 |	Feel like I can't wait either
EDL	00:52:28,287	00:52:31,871	| IOT100 |	I think it's a necessity for future life
EDL	00:52:31,871	00:52:36,479	| IOT100 |	All right I shall enjoy thinking about what can happen when my car is both a sensor and a hotspot
EDL	00:52:36,991	00:52:37,759	| IOT100 |	So thank you Joe
EDL	00:52:38,527	00:52:44,927	| IOT100 |	Perfect thank you so much space it's been a pleasure
