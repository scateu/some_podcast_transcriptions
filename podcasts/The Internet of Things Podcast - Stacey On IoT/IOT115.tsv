EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,136	| IOT115 |	A is for apple
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:10,304	| IOT115 |	Let's do that in Sister Talking Letters we can throw in WWDC because the worldwide developer conference is going on this
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:13,120	| IOT115 |	With apple and Michelle Obama
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:15,168	| IOT115 |	Yes yeah
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:16,448	| IOT115 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,264	| IOT115 |	The most
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:21,824	| IOT115 |	Obviously there lots of
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:26,432	| IOT115 |	Software news for developers which is good cuz it's a developer event
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:28,224	| IOT115 |	They were Hardware refreshes on the
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:29,504	| IOT115 |	Competing side
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:33,344	| IOT115 |	And then there was a new product and I think a lot of people
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:34,880	| IOT115 |	Don't quite get it
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,416	| IOT115 |	But that's just me
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:41,024	| IOT115 |	What is a name
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,304	| IOT115 |	So it is a
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:44,864	| IOT115 |	Smart connected wi-fi speaker called
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,656	| IOT115 |	Homepod
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,680	| IOT115 |	What do you think of homepod
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:49,984	| IOT115 |	Anthony
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,544	| IOT115 |	Show me the name
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:53,824	| IOT115 |	Don't love it
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,384	| IOT115 |	What were they going to do I Spy
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,248	| IOT115 |	Speaker kit
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:04,064	| IOT115 |	Is it those are kind of software kits so
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,600	| IOT115 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,368	| IOT115 |	Just
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,928	| IOT115 |	They didn't call it the Siri
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,208	| IOT115 |	And I think
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,232	| IOT115 |	We might get into wide
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,304	| IOT115 |	Why it's not called
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,072	| IOT115 |	So
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:15,840	| IOT115 |	So what do you think
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:16,352	| IOT115 |	Beyond the name
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:19,424	| IOT115 |	So beyond the name just
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:22,240	| IOT115 |	Quick high-level this is a $349
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,520	| IOT115 |	7 in tall
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:25,056	| IOT115 |	Cylinder speaker
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,104	| IOT115 |	With us I think 7
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:31,968	| IOT115 |	Wattpad readers and so on speaker since I don't recall the exact numbers
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,736	| IOT115 |	Speakers
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:36,576	| IOT115 |	But it's interesting from a speaker standpoint because
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,344	| IOT115 |	It has
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:42,464	| IOT115 |	Beamforming so it can adjust the sound based on type of music
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,512	| IOT115 |	Placement of the speaker and so on and so forth
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:46,048	| IOT115 |	It's got wifi in it
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:49,376	| IOT115 |	From that standpoint
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:53,728	| IOT115 |	If the Apple application of currently existing speaker technology to me
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:56,288	| IOT115 |	And everybody says it sounds good I'll be over there listen to it
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:59,104	| IOT115 |	Set a timer better than the echo
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:02,176	| IOT115 |	And I would expect that
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:08,576	| IOT115 |	Couple reasons why because they're selling the $349 speakers sound better than $180
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,344	| IOT115 |	Ecco Aurora
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:14,720	| IOT115 |	$120 Google home it's much heavier than those devices about 2 and 1/2 pound so
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:20,607	| IOT115 |	Speakers and power have a lot to do with the weight in the magnets and so on so forth so I would expect that
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:23,935	| IOT115 |	Everybody kind of shied away from the fact
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:26,751	| IOT115 |	That it has or will work with Siri
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:30,847	| IOT115 |	And I think that's because of Apple marketing and the reason I say that is
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:32,127	| IOT115 |	Siri is not
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:32,895	| IOT115 |	Still
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,663	| IOT115 |	Great
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,943	| IOT115 |	By comparison in my opinion
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:38,015	| IOT115 |	They're working on it and they talked about that on stage of
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:40,063	| IOT115 |	What technologies are using to improve Siri
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,087	| IOT115 |	But it's not ready yet
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,879	| IOT115 |	In fact the demo speakers
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:45,183	| IOT115 |	Siri wasn't even working at Aulani
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:49,791	| IOT115 |	Everybody is focusing on the speaker the music and so on
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:51,583	| IOT115 |	But here's the thing
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,375	| IOT115 |	Don't neglect that this has
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:55,935	| IOT115 |	Apple A8 chip inside of it
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:58,495	| IOT115 |	This will also act as a
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:00,543	| IOT115 |	Gateway for your homekit devices
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:04,127	| IOT115 |	That lets you remotely access them away from home
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,919	| IOT115 |	So to me
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,431	| IOT115 |	Apple
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:09,759	| IOT115 |	Get the big win here from marketing standpoint
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:12,319	| IOT115 |	Great sounding train $50 speaker
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:14,879	| IOT115 |	Come September October iPhone event
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:18,975	| IOT115 |	And they tell you now in my opinion that Siri is much better here's how
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:19,999	| IOT115 |	Now of a sudden
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:24,351	| IOT115 |	Everybody's like it's coming in December that speaker for 349 sounds so great
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:27,167	| IOT115 |	It's got Siri smart and works really well as an acid
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,727	| IOT115 |	That's what I think the play is here
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:32,799	| IOT115 |	People talking about that sound
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:38,943	| IOT115 |	Yes I think you're right and I think there's a lot that Apple does need to do on the series
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:42,527	| IOT115 |	And we'll talk about this with our guests because there's also
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:46,111	| IOT115 |	A really interesting element they talk about with homekit
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,671	| IOT115 |	I'll just ease that there for you too
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,975	| IOT115 |	Means that maybe we'll see more homekit
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:52,255	| IOT115 |	Get devices in the future
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:54,303	| IOT115 |	Certification
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,863	| IOT115 |	And
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,167	| IOT115 |	They also emphasize the
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:05:59,679	| IOT115 |	Privacy
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,727	| IOT115 |	That's worth talking
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,007	| IOT115 |	Because
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:05,311	| IOT115 |	Nobody else talks about it this way
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:07,615	| IOT115 |	Apple is basically saying that
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:10,687	| IOT115 |	They were not going to send anything
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,199	| IOT115 |	To their server
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,503	| IOT115 |	Until
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:16,319	| IOT115 |	So all that's on device processing
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:18,367	| IOT115 |	Send it
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,903	| IOT115 |	They're going to send it out
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:20,927	| IOT115 |	Encrypted
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:23,231	| IOT115 |	And they're going to anonymizer
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:23,999	| IOT115 |	Cancerverse
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,535	| IOT115 |	Rich right now
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:31,167	| IOT115 |	That's their differentiation Point that's how they're trying to stand out for these other devices and services
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:33,471	| IOT115 |	Saying hey even we don't know
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:40,127	| IOT115 |	Yesterday that is on our server but it's a non- we can tie back to you and we're not selling that data or
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:43,711	| IOT115 |	Or matching up with advertisers so you got total privacy
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:46,271	| IOT115 |	So what I think is interesting is will have apple selling
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:47,807	| IOT115 |	Privacy
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,319	| IOT115 |	Shell
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:49,855	| IOT115 |	It sounds like
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:52,415	| IOT115 |	Google home be selling
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:57,791	| IOT115 |	Actual smart responses to things
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,303	| IOT115 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,583	| IOT115 |	We got
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,655	| IOT115 |	Amazon selling its developer ecosystems
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,703	| IOT115 |	You can control just about it
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,471	| IOT115 |	Skills
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,263	| IOT115 |	I don't know what Microsoft
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:10,079	| IOT115 |	We'll see
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,359	| IOT115 |	I'm sure they can do something
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,151	| IOT115 |	Alright so
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,943	| IOT115 |	What are they saying from the news
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:17,503	| IOT115 |	I thought that Apple adding support for speakers
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,271	| IOT115 |	Did you notice that
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,831	| IOT115 |	As what are they
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,135	| IOT115 |	Yeah they are
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:30,815	| IOT115 |	I thought that was really cool though I didn't see Sonos in there
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:35,679	| IOT115 |	And so I don't know what Sonos is like all in on cuz Soto said Apple used to be Thai
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,215	| IOT115 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:38,495	| IOT115 |	Now
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:43,103	| IOT115 |	Actually as I was watching the
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:43,871	| IOT115 |	Keynote
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:45,407	| IOT115 |	Streaming from work
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:50,015	| IOT115 |	A couple times in my quilt this company's not going to happen I hope that covers I can be happy now
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:51,551	| IOT115 |	Synonyms for because
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:54,623	| IOT115 |	AirPlay 2 and the homepod
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,927	| IOT115 |	It's all supporting multi-room audio and

EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:20,735	| IOT115 |	Just for a little bit
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,271	| IOT115 |	Because
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,039	| IOT115 |	Smarter people tend
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,087	| IOT115 |	I'm not ashamed
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,695	| IOT115 |	All right so right along
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:31,487	| IOT115 |	Two more smart home

EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:37,119	| IOT115 |	Lync is adding
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:39,935	| IOT115 |	Some services to its platform
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,983	| IOT115 |	And these are free so if you have
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,543	| IOT115 |	You're going to get to New services
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:48,127	| IOT115 |	Debility it'll it'll
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:49,663	| IOT115 |	When you're not home
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,967	| IOT115 |	So I thought that was pretty sweet
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:54,783	| IOT115 |	Because yeah
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,831	| IOT115 |	Recycled in any other one
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,135	| IOT115 |	Moonlight
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:05,023	| IOT115 |	Relate so basically it's funny because I have robots that do this now I don't need to have those robots
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:05,791	| IOT115 |	Moonlight
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:08,351	| IOT115 |	Turns your lights on or off at predetermine
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:09,631	| IOT115 |	Time such as
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:12,703	| IOT115 |	Sunrise sunset that's the default actually and then you can
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:15,775	| IOT115 |	Also adjust Moonlight have the lights go on or off
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,055	| IOT115 |	Different times as well but
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,335	| IOT115 |	Yeah so there's my
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:20,639	| IOT115 |	My robots that turn lights off at night
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:24,223	| IOT115 |	Mandana. Asking someone when little
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,271	| IOT115 |	Yes it is just
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,551	| IOT115 |	A recipe
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,575	| IOT115 |	Annapolis
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:32,671	| IOT115 |	The scheduling thing
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:34,975	| IOT115 |	I I don't care for that
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,303	| IOT115 |	It is what it is so on
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:41,375	| IOT115 |	In Exile so introduce a new
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,655	| IOT115 |	Kids call wink bright
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,679	| IOT115 |	Rick lights actually
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:45,471	| IOT115 |	Yes that's okay
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:48,799	| IOT115 |	So for a hundred I think it's $119 you can get yourself a wink
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,591	| IOT115 |	Hub 2
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:55,199	| IOT115 |	Included with the packages to Sylvania smart a19 dimmable bulbs
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:59,039	| IOT115 |	It's kind of an inexpensive easy way to get you started and of course
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:01,855	| IOT115 |	When you start adding lights it's like a gateway drug and
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:05,695	| IOT115 |	You have a Gateway cuz you have a hug so you can just keep adding lights on other things
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:11,583	| IOT115 |	This is pretty like I think this is noteworthy for the Nerds
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:14,143	| IOT115 |	It's going to
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:17,727	| IOT115 |	And seeing a lot of action so
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:20,543	| IOT115 |	There's a couple of efforts on the standards front to
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,591	| IOT115 |	Make sure that things can be prepared
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,615	| IOT115 |	You're not prepared
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:27,199	| IOT115 |	Pair to the hub
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:27,711	| IOT115 |	Yes
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:31,551	| IOT115 |	So there's a lot happening there because provisioning in
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:33,599	| IOT115 |	Pairing
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:34,111	| IOT115 |	Difficult
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:38,719	| IOT115 |	We have so much technology yet
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,743	| IOT115 |	This is still hard
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:42,047	| IOT115 |	And wait till you have to
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:42,815	| IOT115 |	How to reset Alexa
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:47,167	| IOT115 |	Ctrl-alt-delete
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:51,263	| IOT115 |	So you're counting to five in the process
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:55,615	| IOT115 |	Discovering your devices if you have a neck reallocating yourself
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:00,991	| IOT115 |	But it's all so simple
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:02,783	| IOT115 |	So I asked the wink folks
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:06,623	| IOT115 |	Because I saw this and I was like this is great this will be at these are nice
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:09,695	| IOT115 |	You know ways to make yourself smarter very easily
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:12,767	| IOT115 |	And I also asked are you going to offer premium services
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:15,071	| IOT115 |	And they told me
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,863	| IOT115 |	Patrick Mahoney a spokesperson
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:19,167	| IOT115 |	Send me the email that said it is in the pipeline
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:22,239	| IOT115 |	But in the near-term they're rolling out free services
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,031	| IOT115 |	That tie back to home safety
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:27,871	| IOT115 |	And that's because home safety is number one reason people buy into
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,151	| IOT115 |	Automation
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:29,663	| IOT115 |	So
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:36,831	| IOT115 |	44% of Americans who have purchased a connected product did so to keep their home safe according to wink smart Olympics
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,159	| IOT115 |	I talk to I control about
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:41,695	| IOT115 |	Distance like roughly 33%
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:42,975	| IOT115 |	We'll see
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:48,863	| IOT115 |	Boom shakalaka
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:50,911	| IOT115 |	All right
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,495	| IOT115 |	We'll see more of that from
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,799	| IOT115 |	I'm going to say everybody who has a
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:59,359	| IOT115 |	Product on the market and is trying to maintain
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,663	| IOT115 |	Basically stick around
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,431	| IOT115 |	Because
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:08,831	| IOT115 |	What we're going to see next year or so is a lot of companies that have Smart products realize that holy cow
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:10,111	| IOT115 |	Afford to maintain
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,391	| IOT115 |	Their customer base
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:14,719	| IOT115 |	With the server cost with the security cost all of that adding
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,279	| IOT115 |	Putting out
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:17,791	| IOT115 |	Additional service
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:20,863	| IOT115 |	Yay
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:22,655	| IOT115 |	Kevin
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:26,495	| IOT115 |	Another phone or back to assistance
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:33,919	| IOT115 |	Yeah back to assistant-san and I don't want to give too much on the phone cuz I know we don't do that but I'll mention that the newest HTC phone
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:35,199	| IOT115 |	Mbu 11
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:35,967	| IOT115 |	Which
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:39,551	| IOT115 |	Has been available for pre-order for $650
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,343	| IOT115 |	It's a flagship phone
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:42,367	| IOT115 |	It comes with
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:45,439	| IOT115 |	Google Assistant because it runs Android of course
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,463	| IOT115 |	But like
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,231	| IOT115 |	One of the
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:50,303	| IOT115 |	Recent Huawei phones this also has
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,583	| IOT115 |	Native built in
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,911	| IOT115 |	Hace Amazon Echo but you know I'm talking about
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,191	| IOT115 |	She who shall not be named
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:59,263	| IOT115 |	She can be your assistant right on this phone as well now
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:02,847	| IOT115 |	I say native it's coming in an update after the phone launches through Google
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:06,175	| IOT115 |	The Google Play store within 30 days of launch
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:06,943	| IOT115 |	IPhone launch
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:09,759	| IOT115 |	But you'll be able to use assistant you'll be able to use
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,551	| IOT115 |	Matinee
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:16,671	| IOT115 |	And of course they also include HTC Sense companion which is
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:21,791	| IOT115 |	Intelligent type of software the HTC is developed which really reminds me of Google now because it
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:27,167	| IOT115 |	Services contextual information so at least two if not three
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,959	| IOT115 |	Really looks like a big push
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,239	| IOT115 |	For Amazon yet
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,263	| IOT115 |	Echo
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:34,335	| IOT115 |	Integration into phones in a big way this year
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,895	| IOT115 |	Which kind of surprises me because
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:39,967	| IOT115 |	Just don't see it on a phone when you already have
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:41,247	| IOT115 |	Google Assistant but that's just me
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:45,599	| IOT115 |	Hey because we mentioned
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:48,927	| IOT115 |	I work for Google
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:51,231	| IOT115 |	Full-time consultant not on IRT things
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,767	| IOT115 |	Any opinion is that
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,047	| IOT115 |	Isaiah
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:56,607	| IOT115 |	I always up
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:14:00,447	| IOT115 |	But last week we had a huge huge shift
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:01,983	| IOT115 |	In the force
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:05,823	| IOT115 |	The caverns are show which is Kevin weekend
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:06,335	| IOT115 |	How do you feel
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:07,871	| IOT115 |	I do like it
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:13,503	| IOT115 |	I mean again a lot of the functionality are already had with Google Assistant that's not like I added new functionality
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:16,063	| IOT115 |	And as I said before one of the things that I
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:17,343	| IOT115 |	Kept me from buying it
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:19,647	| IOT115 |	Cuz my music services that I listen to Arms
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:20,159	| IOT115 |	Supporters on it
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,439	| IOT115 |	But
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:24,767	| IOT115 |	It's actually really easy to cast audio
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,791	| IOT115 |	Or video
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:26,815	| IOT115 |	Watch it from your phone
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:28,863	| IOT115 |	To any
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:33,727	| IOT115 |	Cast enabled device which Google home is so I just listened to my Beatles channel on SiriusXM in the app
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:36,031	| IOT115 |	Cast it to the Google home speaker so
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:38,079	| IOT115 |	Yeah it's it's working well it's
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:42,431	| IOT115 |	Turn lights on
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:42,943	| IOT115 |	But that's
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:46,015	| IOT115 |	Google home specific as Google Assistant
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:47,039	| IOT115 |	Specific
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:47,551	| IOT115 |	We're getting there
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:50,367	| IOT115 |	Yes it still doesn't work with locks in
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:56,255	| IOT115 |	Actually going forward I'm kind of curious about the fate of
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:15:00,863	| IOT115 |	Has as a gem or Stephen to assistant anyone with an Android phone is probably like
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,655	| IOT115 |	I could actually do this with the Android phone
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:04,191	| IOT115 |	So
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:07,775	| IOT115 |	Alright by the way hello
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,567	| IOT115 |	And you actually carrier
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,711	| IOT115 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,479	| IOT115 |	So
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:18,015	| IOT115 |	Moving right along
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:20,575	| IOT115 |	We have a big meeting
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,343	| IOT115 |	Port to talk
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:24,159	| IOT115 |	I title this at our show notes
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:29,279	| IOT115 |	Because that's kind of what it felt like
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:31,071	| IOT115 |	So what happened is Pew Research Center
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,887	| IOT115 |	Report all about iot
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,935	| IOT115 |	And basically
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:41,055	| IOT115 |	You can tell from the title they're like The Internet of Things connectivity binge what are the implications
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:44,127	| IOT115 |	The implications are
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:46,431	| IOT115 |	That you will never not be connected
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,479	| IOT115 |	That's my summation of this
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:49,503	| IOT115 |	Entire report witch
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,807	| IOT115 |	Everyone should read because it is
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:54,367	| IOT115 |	Excellent and covers a lot of things that we talked about
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,135	| IOT115 |	On the show
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,159	| IOT115 |	A lot
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,463	| IOT115 |	So if you are connected
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,487	| IOT115 |	You can expect
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:02,047	| IOT115 |	Exploits and attacks is basically what I cut out of
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:04,351	| IOT115 |	So
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:08,959	| IOT115 |	You're going to be connected because your life is going to increasingly demanding
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:13,823	| IOT115 |	And we're almost there today like you have to be to get a job
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:16,639	| IOT115 |	Right that's that's just that's why internet connectivity
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:18,687	| IOT115 |	An argument is
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:21,503	| IOT115 |	Uber time your devices are going to have to be
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:24,319	| IOT115 |	Connected in your home because otherwise you're not going to be able to
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:26,367	| IOT115 |	Function or do things with
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,439	| IOT115 |	Feels a little crazy but
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:30,463	| IOT115 |	I could see it happening
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:33,535	| IOT115 |	I could I tell you I just
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:35,839	| IOT115 |	I feel so sad reading this report I mean
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:37,119	| IOT115 |	I'm just going to read one sentence
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:39,167	| IOT115 |	This reminds me of Terminator
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:43,007	| IOT115 |	What used to be attacks against data and information have become attackers against
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:45,567	| IOT115 |	Flesh steel and concrete
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:48,383	| IOT115 |	Which is true I get it, infrastructure and
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:50,687	| IOT115 |	And even wearable devices
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:53,503	| IOT115 |	I get it but wow you don't have to say it
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,295	| IOT115 |	Well so I actually did a
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:57,087	| IOT115 |	In my newsletter last
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:58,879	| IOT115 |	Play the Shameless plug for my newsletter
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:00,159	| IOT115 |	I actually did a
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:02,463	| IOT115 |	EU report that was amazing
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,743	| IOT115 |	On
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:08,351	| IOT115 |	Data security so they were talking about iot security not as a privacy issue
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,399	| IOT115 |	What is a safety issue
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:16,799	| IOT115 |	And they compared it to you once you start and it didn't notice what you start connecting infrastructure
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:19,615	| IOT115 |	Attacks bear have real impacts on
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,639	| IOT115 |	People's lives
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,919	| IOT115 |	Actually
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,199	| IOT115 |	I just
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,711	| IOT115 |	My data was stolen
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:32,671	| IOT115 |	Report
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,719	| IOT115 |	It's like 7 minutes long
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:35,743	| IOT115 |	Summarizes
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,511	| IOT115 |	Points
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:39,327	| IOT115 |	They're not wrong we're putting all the stuff out it's
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,095	| IOT115 |	Highly insecure
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,143	| IOT115 |	I will reach you
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:42,911	| IOT115 |	My favorites
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:44,959	| IOT115 |	Because
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:46,751	| IOT115 |	Also something really well
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:48,799	| IOT115 |	Resistance is futile
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:52,127	| IOT115 |	Penalize those who disconnect
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,151	| IOT115 |	Social processes
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:54,175	| IOT115 |	Reward those who
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:55,455	| IOT115 |	Fully withdrawing
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:57,759	| IOT115 |	Maybe
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:02,111	| IOT115 |	You will plug into the Matrix is what they're saying
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,183	| IOT115 |	Is there again
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:09,279	| IOT115 |	Not wrong it's going to be harder like especially in things like
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:12,095	| IOT115 |	Appliances it's going to be harder and harder to not
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,887	| IOT115 |	Buy things that are connected
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,679	| IOT115 |	Not just for your benefit
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,703	| IOT115 |	But for
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,727	| IOT115 |	The appliance maker
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:20,287	| IOT115 |	So to get warranty service on something
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,567	| IOT115 |	You're probably going to have to connect
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,871	| IOT115 |	Because then they can see how things are were
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:25,407	| IOT115 |	Right
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:28,223	| IOT115 |	Until once you start doing that
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:29,247	| IOT115 |	Then they're like
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,015	| IOT115 |	Hey
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:32,063	| IOT115 |	Here's a service we can offer you why don't you
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:34,367	| IOT115 |	You're connected washer why don't we offer you
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,415	| IOT115 |	Euro results
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,951	| IOT115 |	Amazon dash button service
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,999	| IOT115 |	And so then you're like
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,535	| IOT115 |	Oh that sounds great
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,047	| IOT115 |	Except
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,351	| IOT115 |	Then you're locked into
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,911	| IOT115 |	Buying a certain kind of laundry
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,007	| IOT115 |	And get we talked about this the guardian
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,287	| IOT115 |	Did a
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:58,687	| IOT115 |	An article on this that they took the report as its theme so it's like you will connect and then really dug in
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,199	| IOT115 |	2
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:01,503	| IOT115 |	How we're kind of unquestioningly
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:06,111	| IOT115 |	Allocating more and more of our buying decisions to these products
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:10,207	| IOT115 |	And how the number of choices presented to us
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:11,487	| IOT115 |	Are becoming more limited
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:13,791	| IOT115 |	Think of it is the idea of network neutrality
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,095	| IOT115 |	In search results on you
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:16,863	| IOT115 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:17,375	| IOT115 |	Rate
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,167	| IOT115 |	So
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,959	| IOT115 |	Companies pay for shelf space in
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:21,471	| IOT115 |	In the grocery store
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:24,287	| IOT115 |	Eventually they might start paying
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:25,055	| IOT115 |	4
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:26,591	| IOT115 |	You don't first listing in
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:27,871	| IOT115 |	Your Amazon Echo
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:33,503	| IOT115 |	In the question here is Will consumers be aware of
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,575	| IOT115 |	Will it recognize that that's happened
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:37,343	| IOT115 |	And that's
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:37,855	| IOT115 |	Probably a no
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:40,927	| IOT115 |	Yeah I miss animal not not unless
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,207	| IOT115 |	Their major
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:44,767	| IOT115 |	Media stories about it explain how this works
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,911	| IOT115 |	You listening to the show
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,191	| IOT115 |	Paired
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:52,703	| IOT115 |	Soho
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:55,775	| IOT115 |	I think that the good outweighs the
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:56,287	| IOT115 |	The bad
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,079	| IOT115 |	Thanks
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,103	| IOT115 |	Baidu
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:01,919	| IOT115 |	Debbie lack of transparency here
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:02,943	| IOT115 |	Is going to
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:06,271	| IOT115 |	Both cause a loss of trust that makes people
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:07,807	| IOT115 |	Not buying
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:09,599	| IOT115 |	To this which is fine but
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,879	| IOT115 |	Sad because
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:12,671	| IOT115 |	More data
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,463	| IOT115 |	Market insights
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:15,743	| IOT115 |	For everyone
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:18,303	| IOT115 |	And I also think that companies need to be
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:21,631	| IOT115 |	Aware of the influence they pedal
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:24,447	| IOT115 |	And help build trust with consumers that they're not
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:25,215	| IOT115 |	Abusing that
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:29,567	| IOT115 |	So that's beyond transparency that might be things like letting you set your
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:31,359	| IOT115 |	You don't make it very easy to
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:32,383	| IOT115 |	Cast something to her
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,919	| IOT115 |	Send something to a screen so you can
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:34,431	| IOT115 |	You can choose you
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,735	| IOT115 |	What you're buying
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,783	| IOT115 |	If the price changes there
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,063	| IOT115 |	Very obvious like
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:41,343	| IOT115 |	Hey by the way
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:44,159	| IOT115 |	Usually that cost 699 but today for some reason
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:47,487	| IOT115 |	There's a storm in Malaysia it's up to 788
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:48,511	| IOT115 |	These kind of things should
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:49,535	| IOT115 |	Be a pair
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:51,839	| IOT115 |	The grid
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,119	| IOT115 |	None of this is controversy
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:21:00,287	| IOT115 |	And I don't know should you be able to buy this is going to be interesting should you be able to
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:01,567	| IOT115 |	Disconnect
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:07,967	| IOT115 |	The products and I asked is because you know there's things like predictive maintenance but there's also things like really interesting Energy savings
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:09,247	| IOT115 |	Benefit societies
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:13,599	| IOT115 |	Yeah I mean I prefer connected products over non-cancer products
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:15,391	| IOT115 |	When it makes sense
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:20,000	| IOT115 |	But I don't think it should be either or binary choice I think people should have it
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:21,536	| IOT115 |	And we're not there
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,328	| IOT115 |	This report for
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,864	| IOT115 |	Computer really makes it sound like
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,400	| IOT115 |	It's inevitable
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:28,448	| IOT115 |	Resistance is futile
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:31,264	| IOT115 |	But I actually think you can
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:32,032	| IOT115 |	What's your dollars
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:33,824	| IOT115 |	And that could
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:39,200	| IOT115 |	Is
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:44,576	| IOT115 |	How people react to things like the homepod Apple is reselling privacy
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,136	| IOT115 |	Keep that in mind
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,208	| IOT115 |	Go read the report
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:52,000	| IOT115 |	It was scared
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:55,840	| IOT115 |	Ed
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,376	| IOT115 |	You mentioned homepod wood
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:22:00,448	| IOT115 |	Which has to do with music and I think you just bought something
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:00,960	| IOT115 |	Music
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:09,664	| IOT115 |	And it just says no reply
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:10,944	| IOT115 |	Apart
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:14,784	| IOT115 |	Alright Jack
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:16,064	| IOT115 |	I did I bought
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:19,136	| IOT115 |	Okay longtime listeners of the show will be
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:22,976	| IOT115 |	Be rewarded with a shot of dopamine cuz you're going to remember that I talked about this
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,512	| IOT115 |	80 months ago
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:26,048	| IOT115 |	This is the mighty
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:27,840	| IOT115 |	MP
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,656	| IOT115 |	Somebody MP3 player

EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:41,664	| IOT115 |	Oh and iPod Nano
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,200	| IOT115 |	Sorry to shuffle
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:49,088	| IOT115 |	It hasn't been updated in years but it's
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:49,856	| IOT115 |	Hey
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,160	| IOT115 |	Cuz it doesn't work with Spotify
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:56,256	| IOT115 |	Does even work with apple music so you have to put your own MP3
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:23:00,864	| IOT115 |	Alright nevermind
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:01,632	| IOT115 |	2012
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:05,472	| IOT115 |	Alright so what we have is the mighty
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,264	| IOT115 |	This is a
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:08,544	| IOT115 |	Tiny little
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:10,080	| IOT115 |	Device
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:11,872	| IOT115 |	BICYCLE stores your Spotify stuff
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:13,664	| IOT115 |	Offline
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:14,944	| IOT115 |	So I can take this
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:19,040	| IOT115 |	When I walk the dog or go running at stores a thousand songs
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:19,552	| IOT115 |	What's 5 hours
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:23,136	| IOT115 |	35 hours
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:25,696	| IOT115 |	And
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:28,000	| IOT115 |	I saw this on Kickstarter
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:28,768	| IOT115 |	Again
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,280	| IOT115 |	Like
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:32,096	| IOT115 |	18 months ago and I was
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:33,632	| IOT115 |	Super excited
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:37,728	| IOT115 |	I didn't buy it cuz I was like
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,520	| IOT115 |	I still burnout on my
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:40,544	| IOT115 |	Kickstarter's
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:42,592	| IOT115 |	In the pebble
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,360	| IOT115 |	Announced
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,432	| IOT115 |	Was that what it was
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:47,968	| IOT115 |	Pebble
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:51,296	| IOT115 |	Announced a very similar product in since I had a pebble
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:52,576	| IOT115 |	Can I trust a pebble
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:55,904	| IOT115 |	I was like I'll get my money down for that
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:56,928	| IOT115 |	And then
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,720	| IOT115 |	Fitbit
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:23:59,232	| IOT115 |	What pedal
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:02,560	| IOT115 |	And I was very bad
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:03,840	| IOT115 |	No court for you
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,120	| IOT115 |	No car for me
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:10,240	| IOT115 |	So I went back to my baby and I was like are they going to make it and just
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:12,288	| IOT115 |	Or last week
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:14,336	| IOT115 |	They announced that they were Spotify certified
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:15,872	| IOT115 |	And
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:17,408	| IOT115 |	Product will ship June
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:17,920	| IOT115 |	XXX
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:19,712	| IOT115 |	So I
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,224	| IOT115 |	I put down
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:22,528	| IOT115 |	$85
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,808	| IOT115 |	It turns out with shipping
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,088	| IOT115 |	$95 or
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:25,856	| IOT115 |	$94
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,648	| IOT115 |	In about an orange mighty
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:29,696	| IOT115 |	Tennessee
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:31,488	| IOT115 |	In July you guys
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:33,024	| IOT115 |	The test is puppy out
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:34,560	| IOT115 |	It will see if it answers
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:35,584	| IOT115 |	All of my prayer
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:38,656	| IOT115 |	Or at least the ones I had about listening
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:42,752	| IOT115 |	Can we just talk about the Spotify certified thing
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:43,264	| IOT115 |	Yes
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:47,360	| IOT115 |	So also regular listeners will remember I said
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:52,736	| IOT115 |	That music services are now becoming a part of the lock-in for wearable devices
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:54,016	| IOT115 |	Because you want
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:56,576	| IOT115 |	Add Apple watch to exercise which I sometimes do
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:59,136	| IOT115 |	I can only get music from
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:00,672	| IOT115 |	My Apple music
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,208	| IOT115 |	Service
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:02,720	| IOT115 |	Onto that
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,280	| IOT115 |	I want to
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:09,120	| IOT115 |	Using Android play
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,144	| IOT115 |	I got all that but you know
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:12,704	| IOT115 |	These things are tied to services
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:15,264	| IOT115 |	So this is the first that I know of
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,800	| IOT115 |	First device that allows
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:18,592	| IOT115 |	Spotify offline playback
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:21,152	| IOT115 |	My Samsung wearable has
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:22,944	| IOT115 |	Spotify Spotify app
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:24,480	| IOT115 |	But all it is is a controller
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:25,760	| IOT115 |	For Spotify my phone so
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:27,296	| IOT115 |	Doesn't store the Spotify
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:27,808	| IOT115 |	Music
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:31,904	| IOT115 |	Spotify certification is interesting to me makes me wonder if other
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,696	| IOT115 |	Wearable
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:35,232	| IOT115 |	Device makers will be
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:38,048	| IOT115 |	Getting Spotify certified in the future
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:40,096	| IOT115 |	We should clarify this is be first
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:41,120	| IOT115 |	Wearable
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:41,888	| IOT115 |	Device
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:43,424	| IOT115 |	But you have Spotify
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:44,448	| IOT115 |	His
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:48,288	| IOT115 |	Sure sure sure absolutely yeah
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:50,336	| IOT115 |	Correct
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:53,152	| IOT115 |	It's too early to say I'm curious to see
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:55,968	| IOT115 |	If any other devices get certified for Spotify now
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:26:00,064	| IOT115 |	Or not again I'm just concerned but I want more choices
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:01,344	| IOT115 |	I'm a music selection
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:03,392	| IOT115 |	For my whereabouts when I go running listen music
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:06,208	| IOT115 |	Can I listen to music that's tied to the
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:07,232	| IOT115 |	Device itself
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:10,816	| IOT115 |	And that's one of the nice things that both Amazon and
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:12,864	| IOT115 |	Have done and
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:13,632	| IOT115 |	I'm curious if
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:15,680	| IOT115 |	Which is
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:17,472	| IOT115 |	A pic from
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,008	| IOT115 |	Music service
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,056	| IOT115 |	And you can eat them
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,640	| IOT115 |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:28,736	| IOT115 |	Doesn't really give you that many choices I'm missing it
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:29,504	| IOT115 |	I didn't give you that money
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:32,064	| IOT115 |	But they do get on Google choices
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:33,600	| IOT115 |	Noah Spotify is set as my
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:36,928	| IOT115 |	Really
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:37,696	| IOT115 |	Really
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:40,256	| IOT115 |	Maybe because I know the Spotify app
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,536	| IOT115 |	It's not picking up on that
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:44,864	| IOT115 |	To say there's a link that you can add their
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:49,472	| IOT115 |	Certified this you go into your device settings
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:52,032	| IOT115 |	In the Google Assistant settings there's a section called music
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,312	| IOT115 |	Music
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:55,360	| IOT115 |	Your choices are Google Play Music
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:56,640	| IOT115 |	YouTube music
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:02,272	| IOT115 |	New default provider which is account
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:02,784	| IOT115 |	Preferences on share
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,344	| IOT115 |	Pandora
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,416	| IOT115 |	So they recently they have
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,440	| IOT115 |	Fanatics but that's good
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:11,488	| IOT115 |	That's getting your vehicle has
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:14,304	| IOT115 |	Had many many services for quite some time
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:15,328	| IOT115 |	That's good
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:17,632	| IOT115 |	That actually raises the question as you said
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:18,912	| IOT115 |	Will Apple allow
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:20,960	| IOT115 |	Non Apple Music Services on
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:21,728	| IOT115 |	Don Potter
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:23,776	| IOT115 |	And there was no mention of that
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:24,800	| IOT115 |	At WWDC
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:26,336	| IOT115 |	My money says no
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:29,408	| IOT115 |	But after a word from our sponsor
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:29,920	| IOT115 |	Can expect
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:33,248	| IOT115 |	Text you this week's guess we've got Scott Harkins of Honeywell
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:38,880	| IOT115 |	Connectsense and O'Connor for the center for democracy and Technology
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:43,232	| IOT115 |	Stay tuned for much more
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:49,632	| IOT115 |	Everyone it's time for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is TE Connectivity
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:52,448	| IOT115 |	I have Nick Langston from TE Connectivity here
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:54,496	| IOT115 |	To talk to us about what the company does
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:57,568	| IOT115 |	What I want the audience to understand is that
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:59,104	| IOT115 |	And you look at all of these
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:02,176	| IOT115 |	Interesting pieces of Hardware that are appearing
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:04,224	| IOT115 |	In our kitchens and in our home
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:04,992	| IOT115 |	Every one of these
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:07,040	| IOT115 |	Full of different
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:08,576	| IOT115 |	Pieces of Hardware that allows
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:12,416	| IOT115 |	Sensing or data or power
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:14,208	| IOT115 |	Moving around
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:15,232	| IOT115 |	Between these devices
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:17,280	| IOT115 |	Does little connectors that allow that to happen
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:21,376	| IOT115 |	TV connectivity is in the business of Designing the sensors and connectors
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,424	| IOT115 |	Possible
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:25,216	| IOT115 |	Can you give us some examples of
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,240	| IOT115 |	What you're talkin
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:29,568	| IOT115 |	For the example that most of us
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:32,128	| IOT115 |	It is something like a USB connector
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:33,408	| IOT115 |	Those
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:34,176	| IOT115 |	Plugs
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:36,736	| IOT115 |	Are the types of connectors
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:37,504	| IOT115 |	That allow the tree
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:41,088	| IOT115 |	Data and power to and from certain devices
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:43,904	| IOT115 |	There's a huge variety
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:44,672	| IOT115 |	Of connector
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:46,720	| IOT115 |	Inside your average laptop
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:48,256	| IOT115 |	Let alone
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:49,792	| IOT115 |	Your average refrigerator
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:51,072	| IOT115 |	Dishwasher
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:52,096	| IOT115 |	Car washing
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:54,912	| IOT115 |	And then you also introduce sensing
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:57,728	| IOT115 |	What temperatures are we going to have to measure
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:59,776	| IOT115 |	Do we need to measure vibration
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:02,848	| IOT115 |	Need to measure humidity how do we combine
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:03,872	| IOT115 |	Dos War
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:08,224	| IOT115 |	Works of features and capabilities in the smallest possible package
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:09,248	| IOT115 |	That's what we're in the biz
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:15,392	| IOT115 |	What are some of the Innovative things that we can expect coming forward especially when it comes to things like the smart
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:18,208	| IOT115 |	Smart kitchen is an exciting place
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:19,488	| IOT115 |	It really does
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:23,328	| IOT115 |	Seem to be the focal point of the connected home
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:25,120	| IOT115 |	We all know how much time we spend in
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:25,888	| IOT115 |	Kitchen now
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:30,496	| IOT115 |	And what we're seeing is a trend where people are adding precision
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:32,544	| IOT115 |	To all of the devices
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:37,408	| IOT115 |	If you see products like smart ovens
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:39,712	| IOT115 |	Read a new types of device
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:41,504	| IOT115 |	Like sous vide circulator
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:44,064	| IOT115 |	All of these are using increased
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:47,904	| IOT115 |	In measuring data whether it's
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:50,208	| IOT115 |	Temperature or humidity or
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:53,792	| IOT115 |	Weight of food or evaporation of material from
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:55,584	| IOT115 |	It's
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:58,656	| IOT115 |	Really about increasing Precision so that we can make
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:29:59,936	| IOT115 |	Fooda prepare things
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:01,472	| IOT115 |	What consists of
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:03,264	| IOT115 |	That seems to be what
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,800	| IOT115 |	Ace Hardware Aspen
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:06,592	| IOT115 |	Check that the Internet of Things is really a neighbor
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:08,896	| IOT115 |	Is that
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:10,176	| IOT115 |	Everyone can become an ex
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:15,552	| IOT115 |	Through the use of high-resolution sensors and to some extent artificial intelligence
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:16,320	| IOT115 |	Well
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:17,344	| IOT115 |	Precision is important
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,904	| IOT115 |	Reliability is also
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:20,928	| IOT115 |	A big challenge
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,208	| IOT115 |	How do you guys think
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:25,536	| IOT115 |	We're in the business of making sure
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:28,352	| IOT115 |	The sensors are ready to survive
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:29,888	| IOT115 |	Extremely high temperature
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:32,192	| IOT115 |	Or the wet environment
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:34,752	| IOT115 |	The inside of a dishwasher or washing
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:37,824	| IOT115 |	Or that you'll be able to control the efficiency
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:39,360	| IOT115 |	Nothing like your refrigerator
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:43,712	| IOT115 |	Which consumes a huge percentage of the electricity in the average household
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:45,248	| IOT115 |	Nick that sounds awesome
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:47,296	| IOT115 |	Where can people go to find out more
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:51,392	| IOT115 |	We invite you to visit our website you can CSS

EDL	00:30:56,000	00:31:02,400	| IOT115 |	Alright the big news this week
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:04,960	| IOT115 |	Was the Apple homepod
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:08,800	| IOT115 |	Which actually isn't coming out this week it will be out in December
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:10,592	| IOT115 |	We can't just let this
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:12,128	| IOT115 |	Slibuy
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:14,176	| IOT115 |	We're going to have a couple experts this week
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:14,944	| IOT115 |	To talk to us
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:17,248	| IOT115 |	What's a homepod
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:19,296	| IOT115 |	For the smart
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:22,880	| IOT115 |	First up we have Scott Harkins who is AVP
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:24,416	| IOT115 |	Connected home
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:26,208	| IOT115 |	Hi Scott how are you doing
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:28,256	| IOT115 |	Doing great baby how are you
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:29,280	| IOT115 |	Loving life
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:30,560	| IOT115 |	So
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:32,864	| IOT115 |	I don't know if you saw it yesterday but
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:34,400	| IOT115 |	Apple introduced
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:34,912	| IOT115 |	The home
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:36,960	| IOT115 |	And since you guys
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:40,800	| IOT115 |	With apple producing a homekit certified thermostat
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:44,640	| IOT115 |	I thought you'd be a good person to talk to you about what this might mean
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:45,920	| IOT115 |	I did
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:52,320	| IOT115 |	See I watched it live like I do every WWDC I was pretty excited
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:54,112	| IOT115 |	About it I think
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:55,392	| IOT115 |	It looks like a great
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:59,488	| IOT115 |	Product great looking product that the reviews I've read seem to make it sound like it
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:02,048	| IOT115 |	Some great sound quality to it
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:03,584	| IOT115 |	And
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:05,376	| IOT115 |	The fact that a polite
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:07,168	| IOT115 |	Think with a piece of Hardware efficiency
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:08,448	| IOT115 |	Turn yourself into space is a
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:11,520	| IOT115 |	Is a really big deal and you and I have talked
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,288	| IOT115 |	The four about
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:14,592	| IOT115 |	Like the impact of just voice control
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:16,128	| IOT115 |	Of the home and so
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:19,456	| IOT115 |	Let's tell other people like what voice control the home has meant
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,736	| IOT115 |	For you guys what have you seen
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:22,784	| IOT115 |	Produces these products
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:28,160	| IOT115 |	Stacy we introduced a voice-controlled Connect
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:34,560	| IOT115 |	Is thermostat a few years ago to pretty rave reviews we immediately saw and recognized it that boys like havoc
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:36,096	| IOT115 |	Play in the consumer Market
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:39,168	| IOT115 |	You know that the Amazon Echo came along with its voice
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:39,936	| IOT115 |	System
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:42,496	| IOT115 |	And I think really revolutionized
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,264	| IOT115 |	The space
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:45,568	| IOT115 |	What ID for Honeywell
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:47,872	| IOT115 |	Specifically or at least for some of our perspectives
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:48,384	| IOT115 |	In the market
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:51,456	| IOT115 |	It proved to things that prove that
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:52,736	| IOT115 |	Consumers actually
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:56,576	| IOT115 |	You can get it and understand voice and can understand different things and
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:59,392	| IOT115 |	Semantics that they have to say to make something work
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:02,208	| IOT115 |	But more importantly in the connected home world
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:05,792	| IOT115 |	It proved one of our key perspectives which was
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:08,608	| IOT115 |	Consumers actually want one kind of user
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:09,120	| IOT115 |	Experiencing
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:13,728	| IOT115 |	Much of the industry for many years was talking about Halo on one app
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:17,312	| IOT115 |	Emby amazon echo
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:20,640	| IOT115 |	Stepped in and probably by Design. I guess we're not sure
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:23,712	| IOT115 |	Did it with voice we're going to beat the Spire products
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:24,992	| IOT115 |	Please different protocols
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:26,016	| IOT115 |	Communication techniques
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:28,832	| IOT115 |	Can I be controlled by talking to
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:30,112	| IOT115 |	Speaker
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:31,648	| IOT115 |	And I think that's a
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:34,720	| IOT115 |	Really big deal as an example of
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:39,840	| IOT115 |	How Amazon Echo has really become one of the key drivers in the market
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:40,608	| IOT115 |	Place
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:43,168	| IOT115 |	We can look at 1 24-hour.
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:45,216	| IOT115 |	Midnight from Christmas Eve
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:47,264	| IOT115 |	Could midnight Christmas Day
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:50,080	| IOT115 |	More than 10000 consumers connect
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:51,616	| IOT115 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:54,176	| IOT115 |	Two-way Honeywell thermostat
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:55,968	| IOT115 |	In one 24-hour period
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:57,248	| IOT115 |	So
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:59,552	| IOT115 |	Since this isn't actually due until December
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:00,832	| IOT115 |	Which many months away
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:02,880	| IOT115 |	Looking at what you know now
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:05,696	| IOT115 |	And the experience that you guys have had
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:06,976	| IOT115 |	What would you suggest
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,792	| IOT115 |	They could do to make your life
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:10,816	| IOT115 |	Consumers
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:13,376	| IOT115 |	I'm not so bold as to
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:15,424	| IOT115 |	She just asked what they ought to do but
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:20,544	| IOT115 |	I do think some promotion in the meantime it's get word out there about Apple and Hope
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:23,616	| IOT115 |	Getting this product would be beneficial when it comes to the market
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:26,944	| IOT115 |	Selfishly speaking in the greater connected-home world
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:30,272	| IOT115 |	The more they all do to promote this face in their product in the
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:31,552	| IOT115 |	Connected home aspects to it
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:32,832	| IOT115 |	The batter off
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:35,648	| IOT115 |	Awesome
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:38,208	| IOT115 |	What is your take on homekit today
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:39,744	| IOT115 |	Like our consumers
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:41,024	| IOT115 |	Really interested in home
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:44,096	| IOT115 |	Another really good question Stacey I think that most
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:46,400	| IOT115 |	Consumers probably dozen
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:48,448	| IOT115 |	Really know what home kit is yet
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:49,472	| IOT115 |	Unless
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:51,008	| IOT115 |	They're setting up
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:52,032	| IOT115 |	Pay Home Depot
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:56,384	| IOT115 |	So if you were setting up one Honeywell
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:57,920	| IOT115 |	T5 thermostat
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,712	| IOT115 |	And you had an iOS device
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:03,552	| IOT115 |	Missing you were setting up it would recognize iOS and it was prompt you to set it up
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:07,392	| IOT115 |	That in some cases might be their first real
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:08,160	| IOT115 |	Exposure
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:12,256	| IOT115 |	Right and at that point you know we actually see the fair amount of customer say yes
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:14,304	| IOT115 |	50% but
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:17,376	| IOT115 |	I offer my customers that have iOS devices
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:19,680	| IOT115 |	To say yes and then go down the route setting
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:21,216	| IOT115 |	Clean up as a homekit enabled
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:23,520	| IOT115 |	I'm not
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,288	| IOT115 |	Senior as a kid
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:26,592	| IOT115 |	Nazi
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:28,128	| IOT115 |	Investment in advertising
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:31,712	| IOT115 |	Into the General market riding not seen anything about
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:34,016	| IOT115 |	Unless it's driven by
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:35,040	| IOT115 |	The device comes
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:40,160	| IOT115 |	But it isn't
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:44,000	| IOT115 |	With your Apple user iOS user every
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:46,304	| IOT115 |	Device that you set up in that setup
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:49,632	| IOT115 |	Process it will recognize whether you're on an Apple device or not
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:51,168	| IOT115 |	Impromptu you enroll it in home
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:54,240	| IOT115 |	Which is a really interesting way to get
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:55,520	| IOT115 |	Connectivity in the marketplace
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:58,592	| IOT115 |	And I think also makes that home
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:01,920	| IOT115 |	Pod when it gets dropped in right it's going to drop into an existing
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,968	| IOT115 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:04,736	| IOT115 |	Devices in the home
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:06,528	| IOT115 |	I'm excited
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:08,320	| IOT115 |	The homepod actually works like
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:10,112	| IOT115 |	The other Apple experience
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:12,672	| IOT115 |	I can imagine just bringing that into your house
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:15,488	| IOT115 |	Having it recognize everything and you don't even have to do this
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:16,768	| IOT115 |	Space discovery
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:17,280	| IOT115 |	Weird
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:19,328	| IOT115 |	Tying things together that happens in
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:20,352	| IOT115 |	That could be
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:22,656	| IOT115 |	Because people will be like
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:25,728	| IOT115 |	Holy cow all the sudden I can control my thermostat with my voice
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:26,496	| IOT115 |	Wow
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:29,312	| IOT115 |	Yeah
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:31,872	| IOT115 |	The privacy pop
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:34,176	| IOT115 |	I swear it's not listening until you wake it up
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:36,480	| IOT115 |	Which is very different than how both Amazon
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:38,272	| IOT115 |	And Google went to Market and
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:40,064	| IOT115 |	And goes to
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:41,344	| IOT115 |	Kind of their commitment to private
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:43,648	| IOT115 |	Part of their rights
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:44,672	| IOT115 |	Key Market
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,440	| IOT115 |	Strategy
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:47,232	| IOT115 |	Tell the quality sound I can't wait
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:48,512	| IOT115 |	Hear it I have
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:50,048	| IOT115 |	Sonos in my home and I love it
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:53,120	| IOT115 |	I would hope that it's at least not good
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:54,144	| IOT115 |	If not better
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:56,704	| IOT115 |	And in the fact that it unlocks that were
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:37:01,824	| IOT115 |	Remote connectivity really for the first time in a way that doesn't require right Apple
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:04,128	| IOT115 |	TV's not that there's anything wrong with that
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:05,408	| IOT115 |	But it's
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:07,968	| IOT115 |	I think the speaker approaches to
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:08,736	| IOT115 |	Just eat better
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:11,040	| IOT115 |	Go easier price for the consumer to get their head around
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:13,600	| IOT115 |	I'm with you all right big Scott
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:21,024	| IOT115 |	Next guest is Adam Justice who is the founder of the connectsense brand which is a lie
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:26,144	| IOT115 |	Sensors connected outlets and other good stuff that ties into
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:27,936	| IOT115 |	Homekit and other ecosystem
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:28,960	| IOT115 |	Guess Adam
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:35,616	| IOT115 |	Yeah some of the other ecosystems stuff is still still coming but yeah we were very early player in the homekit space
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:40,224	| IOT115 |	So what did you think about the Apple homepod
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:42,272	| IOT115 |	Just basically some of the Apple news
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,040	| IOT115 |	Yesterday
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:46,368	| IOT115 |	Always good to see homekit mention on stage and
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:52,512	| IOT115 |	Looks like some new device profiles and things like that coming to homekit so
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:53,024	| IOT115 |	That was
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:54,304	| IOT115 |	Interesting
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:55,328	| IOT115 |	And then home pod
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:56,608	| IOT115 |	Definitely
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:59,680	| IOT115 |	Apple's entry into the smart
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:03,776	| IOT115 |	Home assistant Market to compete with Amazon Echo
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:07,104	| IOT115 |	And the Google home and I felt like
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:09,920	| IOT115 |	Before the show if they were going to do something here
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:11,712	| IOT115 |	I hope they would differentiate it
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:12,736	| IOT115 |	In some ways and
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:14,528	| IOT115 |	Differentiation
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:17,600	| IOT115 |	It's the really lean in on a music and sound quality
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:21,184	| IOT115 |	So to me and almost felt like there more going after Sonos then
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:22,208	| IOT115 |	Then really some of that
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:26,560	| IOT115 |	Smart speaker alternative sent and really playing up the music I think that's
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:32,448	| IOT115 |	Time Warner places where they felt they were strongest and so they were going to lean in on that they also think there's a lot
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:34,496	| IOT115 |	We don't know about these devices
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:38,592	| IOT115 |	So far so I had a chance to see it in the Hands-On area yesterday
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:39,616	| IOT115 |	It looks nice
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:41,920	| IOT115 |	I wasn't functional we couldn't hear it
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,712	| IOT115 |	You can touch it but
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:45,504	| IOT115 |	It looks nice
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:47,296	| IOT115 |	Doesn't have a screen on it
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:51,648	| IOT115 |	I have a similar white aesthetic to like what's going on with the Google home
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:56,768	| IOT115 |	And yes Mother good things it's got Hub capabilities for homekit so it runs on the same
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:57,792	| IOT115 |	AA chip
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:39:04,704	| IOT115 |	That's what's in the current Apple TV generation was probably why they use that so it'll be another Hub in the house and further
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:05,472	| IOT115 |	Extending
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:06,752	| IOT115 |	Homekit devices
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:07,776	| IOT115 |	Which I think is a good thing
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:09,824	| IOT115 |	What would you like to see
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:15,968	| IOT115 |	Between now and December what would you hope to hear from Apple as a company that builds home Kik
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:18,784	| IOT115 |	Yeah I think that's a big
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:23,136	| IOT115 |	Point to its we got seven months to go before this thing ships
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:23,904	| IOT115 |	So
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:26,720	| IOT115 |	I felt like they were maybe two reasons why they
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:27,232	| IOT115 |	They showed
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:29,024	| IOT115 |	What they have
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:30,304	| IOT115 |	Today
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:34,144	| IOT115 |	And what they showed yesterday and one maybe that maybe they have some
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:36,192	| IOT115 |	Really cool features on this
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:38,240	| IOT115 |	And they just didn't want to tip their hats
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:43,104	| IOT115 |	To the competition and show off something and give them 7 months to catch up
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:44,896	| IOT115 |	The other one was
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:50,016	| IOT115 |	They got seven months of software development still to do on this until
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:54,624	| IOT115 |	You know that's a lot of time and I'm sure they are putting their best and brightest on this
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:55,392	| IOT115 |	And so
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:58,720	| IOT115 |	You know what we see in December definitely is going to be greater than
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:40:00,000	| IOT115 |	What they talked about on the
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:03,584	| IOT115 |	Stage hear about yet
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:05,888	| IOT115 |	I would say my biggest one is
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:08,448	| IOT115 |	A way to handle multi users
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:11,520	| IOT115 |	I think Google home does this a little bit
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:17,920	| IOT115 |	And kind of the basics beginnings of that but in the Apple ecosystem individual user accounts
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:20,224	| IOT115 |	It's so important for everything you're going to do
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:23,296	| IOT115 |	And the fact that it had messaging capabilities listed
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:26,368	| IOT115 |	Made me feel like maybe this is a thing that they're going to have
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:31,488	| IOT115 |	I think for this to be a really great communal device it needs to be a have a way to differentiate
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:34,560	| IOT115 |	I'm with you on that
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:35,072	| IOT115 |	Okay
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:36,608	| IOT115 |	Anything else
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:40,960	| IOT115 |	The other one that I'm not quite sure on yet is
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:44,288	| IOT115 |	The other thing they talked about in the homekit slide yesterday was
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:45,568	| IOT115 |	The
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:46,592	| IOT115 |	Homekit profile
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:48,896	| IOT115 |	And so
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:50,432	| IOT115 |	That feels like there
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:53,248	| IOT115 |	Could be some cool things we could do with speakers
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:57,088	| IOT115 |	We have a water sensor for example that'll be on the market later this year
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:58,368	| IOT115 |	And it would be great if
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:02,976	| IOT115 |	The result of a water sensor could be something coming through a speaker of
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:04,256	| IOT115 |	Hey there's water in your basement
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:06,048	| IOT115 |	You should go do something about that
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:09,376	| IOT115 |	It does in the Press materials after the
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:11,424	| IOT115 |	Big WWDC Keynote
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:12,704	| IOT115 |	Apple Help
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:13,472	| IOT115 |	Put in
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:14,240	| IOT115 |	A little
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:16,800	| IOT115 |	Felt like a throwaway line that talked about
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:20,384	| IOT115 |	Making it easier for developers and makers of smart home devices
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:22,944	| IOT115 |	To connect into the ecosystem using software
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:24,736	| IOT115 |	And that
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:26,528	| IOT115 |	Struck me as import
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:27,296	| IOT115 |	What about you
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:34,464	| IOT115 |	I was surprised this wasn't mentioned earlier and I think we'll find out more later this week but that's certainly interesting
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:36,256	| IOT115 |	Change of tune a little bit
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:37,536	| IOT115 |	It said you know
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:40,608	| IOT115 |	New ways to authenticate devices using software
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:45,984	| IOT115 |	And then even in the session description there was something about some support for hobbyists and Things 2
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:47,264	| IOT115 |	To be able to play so
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:49,312	| IOT115 |	CI as of today
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:55,711	| IOT115 |	You know you need to have a apple authentication chips as part of your design and so that's been challenging
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:58,015	| IOT115 |	For some companies who have devices already out
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:42:00,831	| IOT115 |	Maybe why some people have not adopted Home Care
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:02,623	| IOT115 |	You know I think
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:05,951	| IOT115 |	Certainly interesting and we'll see you when we learn a little bit more but
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:07,487	| IOT115 |	You know could certainly changed
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:08,511	| IOT115 |	Gay men
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:09,279	| IOT115 |	Certainly
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:10,559	| IOT115 |	To me feels like
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:17,215	| IOT115 |	This ecosystem is important to them and they want to remove some barriers to help as many manufacturers adopted
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:20,031	| IOT115 |	All right I am excited
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:20,543	| IOT115 |	Thanks
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:26,431	| IOT115 |	Connect to talk about privacy and the implications of having an always-on
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,967	| IOT115 |	Listening device in your home
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:29,503	| IOT115 |	You're still O'Connor
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:32,319	| IOT115 |	From the center for democracy and Technology
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:34,367	| IOT115 |	So I'm curious
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:36,671	| IOT115 |	About Canada privacy application
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:38,207	| IOT115 |	In general for these types of the
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:41,023	| IOT115 |	Well I'm glad for saw that
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:41,791	| IOT115 |	Apple is
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:45,119	| IOT115 |	Concerned about and is continuing their strong history of
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:47,167	| IOT115 |	Thinking about data collection of
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:53,055	| IOT115 |	All of its devices and I think I reapplied them for a the strong stance they took obviously in
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:55,359	| IOT115 |	Protecting data encryption on the iPhone
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:56,127	| IOT115 |	I think
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:59,455	| IOT115 |	I've looked a little bit of the echo I've looked less at the Google products
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:04,575	| IOT115 |	All of the companies are thinking about in are aware of the fact that you are entering into someone's
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:05,343	| IOT115 |	Home
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:11,743	| IOT115 |	And I think the boundaries in the protections for privacy should be even higher than they are obviously on the street
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:12,511	| IOT115 |	Sayonara
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:16,095	| IOT115 |	Kitchen laws United States there's a Public Square in a private Zone
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:22,495	| IOT115 |	These devices blur the line between what is truly private and what becomes somewhat Republic
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:27,103	| IOT115 |	Carlie shared with private sector companies so suddenly all of our most kind of intimate
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:28,895	| IOT115 |	Details of our daily lives
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:30,687	| IOT115 |	Are mediated or shared
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:31,455	| IOT115 |	Through
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:37,343	| IOT115 |	Companies on their way to the recipient of the phone call or of the email or the text excetera excetera
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:43,743	| IOT115 |	And because of that I think we're really calling a company sit to take a stronger and stronger stance as they are further info
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:46,559	| IOT115 |	Further inside the cartilage inside the boundary of the home
EDL	00:43:46,559	00:43:50,655	| IOT115 |	And I think you know what I'm glad to see companies competing on privacy at the value
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:54,239	| IOT115 |	From a person who cares about privacy and things pretty deeply about it
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:55,519	| IOT115 |	What we know so far about
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:56,031	| IOT115 |	The homepod
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:57,567	| IOT115 |	Is that
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:43:59,615	| IOT115 |	Until you say the phrase hey Siri
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:01,663	| IOT115 |	Nothing is being sent
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:03,199	| IOT115 |	Apple and then when it sent
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:05,503	| IOT115 |	They're doing an optimization
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:06,527	| IOT115 |	An encryption app
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:07,807	| IOT115 |	The data so
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:10,879	| IOT115 |	The company actually isn't able to view your data on its server
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:11,391	| IOT115 |	First title
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:16,255	| IOT115 |	And that feels pretty different from how both Google and Amazon see the tree
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:18,303	| IOT115 |	Is that something we should expect
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:25,983	| IOT115 |	I think those are all terrific projections and I think they really nailed it on the issue of what is
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:26,751	| IOT115 |	Collected and when
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:31,359	| IOT115 |	And then how long it's stored and in what way again I am not
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:32,383	| IOT115 |	Strong confident
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:35,455	| IOT115 |	The comment on the differences of the variations between the three
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:39,295	| IOT115 |	7 major Home Products right now but those are all really compelling
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:42,623	| IOT115 |	Things to think about it's look for as a consumer
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:46,463	| IOT115 |	What information is being collected when does it say device
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:47,487	| IOT115 |	Start collecting it
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:49,279	| IOT115 |	How long has it been
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:51,071	| IOT115 |	Stored and in what way
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:57,471	| IOT115 |	Encrypting it and Kennedy identifying it as if our things that we here at CDT have long pushed
EDL	00:44:57,471	00:44:58,751	| IOT115 |	For in Fallout 4
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:04,127	| IOT115 |	And those are the kinds of protections the fact that the company simply can't see it or can't read it or can't interpret
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:06,687	| IOT115 |	What it is you're saying and doing online
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:13,087	| IOT115 |	That's some of the highest level projections again that's why we need a we was really think Apple's the very strong and other companies as well on encryption
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:16,927	| IOT115 |	And that's really what's going to be necessary to protect
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:21,279	| IOT115 |	But only some kind of law enforcement requests in National Security requests but
EDL	00:45:21,279	00:45:23,071	| IOT115 |	But from hackers in from Attack
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:27,423	| IOT115 |	As we become more and more reliant on these devices and our daily lives
EDL	00:45:27,935	00:45:29,215	| IOT115 |	What seems like
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:31,007	| IOT115 |	Credit mundane data
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:37,407	| IOT115 |	Can be actually created you don't put together in a way that can create a very both nefarious or very innocent picture of
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:38,175	| IOT115 |	Your daily life
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:39,455	| IOT115 |	The same fact
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:44,831	| IOT115 |	Different ways you could be used for against you in a court of law or Court of public opinion excetera
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:51,231	| IOT115 |	Example I use there was a case in the midwest involving a whole bunch of Home Products even something as mundane as a smart water
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:52,255	| IOT115 |	Water meter
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:56,351	| IOT115 |	And there was a murder in the home some of you may have heard of the story of nothing with an arc
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:45:57,631	| IOT115 |	And
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:45:59,679	| IOT115 |	That's a huge amount of water with
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:01,471	| IOT115 |	Used in that home on.
EDL	00:46:01,471	00:46:07,615	| IOT115 |	Night in question what are some visitors to the home ended up dead at the end of the night I'm very tragic circumstances
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:12,479	| IOT115 |	But the same detail the fact that a huge amount of water was suddenly use could
EDL	00:46:12,479	00:46:13,247	| IOT115 |	Interpreted as
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:20,159	| IOT115 |	They were stealing the hot tub because they were having a party or they were washing away the blood right and you can see lawyers in Atlanta
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:20,671	| IOT115 |	Court of law
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:22,719	| IOT115 |	Arguing both of those
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:29,375	| IOT115 |	And so not having the state available not having it online not having it in a human readable format
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:31,423	| IOT115 |	Is very very strong protection
EDL	00:46:31,935	00:46:33,215	| IOT115 |	Awesome so then
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:39,615	| IOT115 |	How do we educate consumers about this like the fact that Apple seems to be talking more about encryption I
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:44,479	| IOT115 |	Pink is awesome except I don't know how many consumers really understand the technology
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:46,271	| IOT115 |	How do we help them
EDL	00:46:47,039	00:46:50,623	| IOT115 |	That is such a great point and I'm constantly saying to that the folks I work with
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:54,463	| IOT115 |	When we are talking about are very nerdy kind of wonky
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:56,511	| IOT115 |	Concerned about VPN
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:46:57,279	| IOT115 |	Door
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:59,327	| IOT115 |	How encryption works or what kind of
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:02,399	| IOT115 |	Cyber security protections exist around your devices
EDL	00:47:02,911	00:47:09,311	| IOT115 |	We need to make this understandable to people who shouldn't be forced to understand the inner workings of every device they own in order to you
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:13,407	| IOT115 |	I think was Walt Mossberg and into his last call and recently said
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:17,759	| IOT115 |	If we don't expect people to understand the combustion engine in order to drive a car
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:23,391	| IOT115 |	They shouldn't be forced to understand me to take you have a PhD in computer science in order to own a phone or a laptop
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:25,695	| IOT115 |	And I think and I said
EDL	00:47:25,695	00:47:28,767	| IOT115 |	Ben Franklin out for decades to come because I've worked for and Weston
EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:29,791	| IOT115 |	Against
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:35,935	| IOT115 |	The onus is on the company developing and introducing new technologies to be an educator
EDL	00:47:35,935	00:47:37,471	| IOT115 |	To be an explainer
EDL	00:47:37,471	00:47:43,871	| IOT115 |	And I did not an a scan of spend more than not only 1/8 we think our product is great but she obviously expects but this is
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:45,919	| IOT115 |	How the product works and impractical
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:52,831	| IOT115 |	Simple terms for every user every consumer to understand and to make educated choices I think we've probably
EDL	00:47:52,831	00:47:59,231	| IOT115 |	I need to get to the point where the same words mean the same things and consumers can make educated decisions
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:47:59,999	| IOT115 |	Clean different devices
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:02,047	| IOT115 |	Based on real
EDL	00:48:02,047	00:48:04,351	| IOT115 |	Understandable differences and I think
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:09,471	| IOT115 |	Some of that is explaining privacy policies that some of it is actually in how the devices work I know
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:12,543	| IOT115 |	I must have been out for several more years
EDL	00:48:12,543	00:48:15,359	| IOT115 |	And it lights up when you talk to it it circles one way when it
EDL	00:48:15,359	00:48:18,431	| IOT115 |	It's doing one thing at Circle to the light circle another way when it does another thing
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:19,455	| IOT115 |	These are kind of
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:21,759	| IOT115 |	Inherent or kind of in the environment
EDL	00:48:22,271	00:48:28,671	| IOT115 |	Disclosures with I would be a big fan of not making someone go to the privacy policy on the website to understand
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:30,463	| IOT115 |	A device that is sitting on their kitchen counter
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:31,743	| IOT115 |	They also saying
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:36,095	| IOT115 |	More information should be available to the users who want to dive deeper
EDL	00:48:36,095	00:48:42,495	| IOT115 |	Into the inner workings of the device so it's contracts on layered notice where there's a short notice after device whether it's
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:44,799	| IOT115 |	Lighting up or it's flashing or sexy
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:48,639	| IOT115 |	Speaking to you which would make sense for the device that speaks that you speak to
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:50,175	| IOT115 |	It should speak back and say
EDL	00:48:50,175	00:48:54,527	| IOT115 |	This is with who I am and this is what I'm doing in this is kind of what this happening with your data
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:48:59,647	| IOT115 |	But then you can go to the website there or elsewhere and find more information and again in it and easy
EDL	00:49:00,159	00:49:01,183	| IOT115 |	Digestible format
EDL	00:49:01,695	00:49:04,255	| IOT115 |	Okay so my next feature request is going to be
EDL	00:49:04,255	00:49:06,303	| IOT115 |	You know having the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:08,607	| IOT115 |	Just tell me it's privacy and security practice
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:09,631	| IOT115 |	This is when I ask it
EDL	00:49:09,631	00:49:10,911	| IOT115 |	That's okay
EDL	00:49:11,423	00:49:14,239	| IOT115 |	No thank you so much for coming on the show
EDL	00:49:15,007	00:49:16,543	| IOT115 |	Thank you so much for having a satellite
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:23,711	| IOT115 |	That's it for this week's show thank you so much for listening and if you want more
