EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:36,672	| IOT216 |	To this way
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,208	| IOT216 |	Freak Show Kevin
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:40,768	| IOT216 |	I feel like we've got to do a little bit of recap
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,304	| IOT216 |	So
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:44,608	| IOT216 |	We spent a long time talking
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:48,192	| IOT216 |	About Google because last week Google announced it
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:50,752	| IOT216 |	It did really announcer put up a blood
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:53,312	| IOT216 |	It said it was going to kill its works with nest
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:56,896	| IOT216 |	So we don't last week with a lot of the Rama
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,408	| IOT216 |	Vacations
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,968	| IOT216 |	In the biggest ramification
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:02,784	| IOT216 |	To sum it up is if you have a nest device
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:04,064	| IOT216 |	Nest devices used to talk
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:07,136	| IOT216 |	On their own out other devices
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:09,184	| IOT216 |	Nest devices will talk to the
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:09,952	| IOT216 |	Google home hub
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,488	| IOT216 |	And Google home
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,024	| IOT216 |	And
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,304	| IOT216 |	Which has been rebranded
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,328	| IOT216 |	Tattoo yes
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:17,632	| IOT216 |	Which has a new name
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,168	| IOT216 |	Turn up Nest homes
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:23,776	| IOT216 |	There's the nest home hub there's the old Google how there's the Google
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:24,288	| IOT216 |	Mini
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:27,872	| IOT216 |	That's the weird thing summer rebranded summer not but regardless yes
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,432	| IOT216 |	Rabbit aggression is going away
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:35,552	| IOT216 |	Yes and so basically you're messed up when I talk to Google home devices
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,832	| IOT216 |	And then all of your other devices will
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:38,112	| IOT216 |	Google home
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:40,416	| IOT216 |	So basically there's a middle man in the middle
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:43,232	| IOT216 |	Which is where those metal bands like to hang out
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,768	| IOT216 |	People were really upset
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:48,096	| IOT216 |	It breaks a lot of functionality of all of your existing
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:48,864	| IOT216 |	Google
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:49,888	| IOT216 |	Integrations in route
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:50,912	| IOT216 |	Teen service
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,960	| IOT216 |	WeChat
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,496	| IOT216 |	Third-party services such as
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:56,800	| IOT216 |	Yonomi stringify
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:59,104	| IOT216 |	Those if you have routines for your nest
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,128	| IOT216 |	Those will not work
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,664	| IOT216 |	Wendy
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:04,736	| IOT216 |	Integration shuts down which I believe is planned for August 3rd
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,504	| IOT216 |	First
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,528	| IOT216 |	Yes the end of August
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:11,392	| IOT216 |	And starting the middle of June Google's going to let you know that you can migrate Your Nest account
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:11,904	| IOT216 |	To the Google home
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,952	| IOT216 |	You should not do that
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:14,464	| IOT216 |	Until
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:17,024	| IOT216 |	You know that your other Integrations arson
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:18,303	| IOT216 |	That's why
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:22,143	| IOT216 |	Okay or other advice is we've gotten a lot of questions
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:25,727	| IOT216 |	People are like this is terrible I'm so mad what other devices
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:32,639	| IOT216 |	So we wanted to run down we mentioned the Honeywell thermostats the T5 is an excellent thermostat Honeywell actually just put
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,663	| IOT216 |	39 + 2
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,431	| IOT216 |	T10 thermostat
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,223	| IOT216 |	Those play with gift
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:37,247	| IOT216 |	With Google
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:40,063	| IOT216 |	With homekit in many cases and
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,087	| IOT216 |	Also with
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,111	| IOT216 |	Amazon
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:43,647	| IOT216 |	Ecobee
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:45,951	| IOT216 |	Is another thermostat brand that works with
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:47,231	| IOT216 |	A lot of other things
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:51,583	| IOT216 |	And I would be a little cautious there because Amazon did from them out of the
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:53,887	| IOT216 |	But
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,911	| IOT216 |	They are an independent
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:55,679	| IOT216 |	Canadian Cup
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,959	| IOT216 |	So and we loved
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,751	| IOT216 |	Are the doorbell front
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:04:59,775	| IOT216 |	August
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:03,103	| IOT216 |	I hated their first doorbell their second doorbell I haven't tried yet because I
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:04,383	| IOT216 |	In the middle of moving
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:07,455	| IOT216 |	But they do have a doorbell out it works with
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,991	| IOT216 |	Other ecosystem
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:13,855	| IOT216 |	Arlo is announcing a doorbell that actually looks just like the nest hello so I don't know if
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,415	| IOT216 |	Bee Hardware inside will be as good
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,951	| IOT216 |	And then let's see
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,463	| IOT216 |	Cameras
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:20,511	| IOT216 |	Are Lumix cameras if you can
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,535	| IOT216 |	You could go all in on Arlo
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,071	| IOT216 |	Given this news
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:25,375	| IOT216 |	And Arlo does actually have
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,911	| IOT216 |	Gud madhumeh integration
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,679	| IOT216 |	And that shows you
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,983	| IOT216 |	Your Arlo cameras on
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:32,031	| IOT216 |	Madam a device with a display
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:35,615	| IOT216 |	Let's see what other things would we want to know about
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:36,127	| IOT216 |	Smoke detector
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:39,455	| IOT216 |	I can't really in good conscience recommend the First Alert
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:41,503	| IOT216 |	Is it so expensive but it is a connected smoke
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,015	| IOT216 |	Detector
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:44,831	| IOT216 |	I will say that if you are
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:47,647	| IOT216 |	Maybe doing the Google Amazon route
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:49,951	| IOT216 |	Amazon did just this week and I'm scarred
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:55,327	| IOT216 |	Which is an interesting way to start getting remote notifications from your smoke detector
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:56,863	| IOT216 |	Because guard
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:58,399	| IOT216 |	When you leave your house
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:01,727	| IOT216 |	You basically turn this functionality on your Amazon
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:04,287	| IOT216 |	Echo it will listen for both glass breaking
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:06,591	| IOT216 |	Amazon of a smoke alarm or a
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,359	| IOT216 |	Carbon monoxide
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:10,943	| IOT216 |	And that will just send a notification to
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:14,015	| IOT216 |	The account owner's phone
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:16,319	| IOT216 |	Just some people are aware
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:19,391	| IOT216 |	You're going to get a text message we need an in-app notification
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:21,695	| IOT216 |	It doesn't go to the whole family
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,231	| IOT216 |	Just that one individual
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:25,279	| IOT216 |	It will however send an alert
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,047	| IOT216 |	2
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:26,815	| IOT216 |	You
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:32,191	| IOT216 |	Thruway monitored security service or will send an alert to your monitored security service if you're using the ring
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:34,751	| IOT216 |	Security service or ADT Security services
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:37,567	| IOT216 |	So you can actually elect
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:42,431	| IOT216 |	To turn on guard and have it send those notifications to your Professional Security firm
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,199	| IOT216 |	If you have
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,479	| IOT216 |	If not
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,271	| IOT216 |	Send it to you via in-app notification
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:49,599	| IOT216 |	At least notifying notification option theory is
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:53,439	| IOT216 |	But it's a free service that you did just because you happen to buy an echo
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:53,951	| IOT216 |	So you know
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,511	| IOT216 |	Always options
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:59,071	| IOT216 |	Those are for people who are not happy with the situation
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,143	| IOT216 |	And want to move away from Google ecosystem I presume
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:03,679	| IOT216 |	Yes
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:07,775	| IOT216 |	And I will say I don't I mean our audience cues very heavily towards
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:09,311	| IOT216 |	DIY I will say most
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:10,847	| IOT216 |	People I bet there's actually
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:13,663	| IOT216 |	Very large contingent of people who are going to get emails from Google
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:15,455	| IOT216 |	Rather nasty stuff in there to be like
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:16,991	| IOT216 |	What Google owns what
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:17,503	| IOT216 |	Best
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:20,063	| IOT216 |	What do I do I think there's going to be a lot of
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:23,903	| IOT216 |	Because most people are not that wired
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:26,463	| IOT216 |	Write my point was
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:29,535	| IOT216 |	You want you could choose to just completely
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:31,327	| IOT216 |	Change your whole smart speaker to ecosystem
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:35,423	| IOT216 |	Keep in mind that while Google has shut down works with nest
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:36,959	| IOT216 |	When will be shutting down
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,263	| IOT216 |	They will be working with
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:42,079	| IOT216 |	A limited number of integration partners
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,615	| IOT216 |	Going forward
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:46,431	| IOT216 |	An Amazon is a perfect example.
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:48,223	| IOT216 |	Working with Amazon to keep
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:49,503	| IOT216 |	Ness
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:51,039	| IOT216 |	Working with the
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,087	| IOT216 |	Amazon Echo products
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:54,111	| IOT216 |	So
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:57,695	| IOT216 |	It may turn out that over the next couple months as that
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,487	| IOT216 |	Horse of that program wines down
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:03,839	| IOT216 |	The third-party services you use may come on board with the new
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,375	| IOT216 |	System service
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:06,655	| IOT216 |	My point is
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:09,471	| IOT216 |	Don't trash all your smart speakers today if your on Google
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,007	| IOT216 |	You may want to wait and see what have
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:13,823	| IOT216 |	Indeed or all your smart devices
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,103	| IOT216 |	Better made by
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,895	| IOT216 |	So those are some
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,431	| IOT216 |	Lovely options out there
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,455	| IOT216 |	For you on the nest
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:21,247	| IOT216 |	Front let's talk about
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,783	| IOT216 |	Temperature
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,575	| IOT216 |	Google Assistant appearing on a new device
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:30,463	| IOT216 |	Oh yeah and with only waited I think 19 months for Sonos to get this integration
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:33,279	| IOT216 |	Hotel of elephants
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:34,303	| IOT216 |	So you know
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:37,375	| IOT216 |	Trixie I don't know I'll look that up after the show
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,655	| IOT216 |	But yes
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:42,495	| IOT216 |	It is available for me it became available earlier this week
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:45,311	| IOT216 |	When they announced that they said that software update would be required
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,871	| IOT216 |	And I got the software update I have a pair of
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,407	| IOT216 |	Are Sonos one speakers
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,943	| IOT216 |	Right here in my home office in fact
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,735	| IOT216 |	The setup
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,551	| IOT216 |	Typical of any
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:09:00,415	| IOT216 |	Third-party hardware setup with Google Assistant can I get bounced around from the device
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:05,535	| IOT216 |	App to the Google assistant app back and forth and whatnot so I'm kind of used to it but I don't like it
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:09,375	| IOT216 |	But once you get that done it works perfectly fine I tested it
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:12,191	| IOT216 |	With a bunch of my Smart Home Products
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:14,239	| IOT216 |	Any other Google Assistant
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:15,519	| IOT216 |	Google home device in my house
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:19,359	| IOT216 |	There are a few limitations
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:21,151	| IOT216 |	Processor third party
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:21,919	| IOT216 |	Device
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,455	| IOT216 |	Namely
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:26,527	| IOT216 |	If you use the Google homes that you have
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:29,343	| IOT216 |	To make or receive calls well that's not going to work here
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,135	| IOT216 |	Additionally
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:32,415	| IOT216 |	There are fewer
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:35,743	| IOT216 |	Music services that Google Assistant works with
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:36,767	| IOT216 |	Compared to
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:39,071	| IOT216 |	Madame a and I say that because the Sonos
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:41,375	| IOT216 |	Speakers got madhumeh integration
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,655	| IOT216 |	A while ago
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,447	| IOT216 |	Well over a year ago
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:47,263	| IOT216 |	And there are more music Services you can't control their
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:49,311	| IOT216 |	So that's another limitation
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:51,359	| IOT216 |	But other than that
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,383	| IOT216 |	I'm pretty happy with it
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:55,967	| IOT216 |	I guess I'm wondering why I need a Google home hub in front of me
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,527	| IOT216 |	And Google Assistant power
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:00,575	| IOT216 |	Sonos devices next to me now
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:01,599	| IOT216 |	So
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,647	| IOT216 |	I'm not sure what I'm going to do
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,951	| IOT216 |	Kevin you're going to keep everything so you can
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:06,975	| IOT216 |	Contest all the news
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:07,487	| IOT216 |	Latest greatest
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:12,095	| IOT216 |	So I'm going to keep everything so I can test the latest and greatest
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,143	| IOT216 |	Yes
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:17,727	| IOT216 |	I see I want put the Google home hub here because I can say hey
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:21,055	| IOT216 |	G show my front door when somebody is at the front door
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:24,383	| IOT216 |	I can't do that with a Sonos speaker says they have no screen off
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:25,151	| IOT216 |	Play Soho
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,967	| IOT216 |	Yeah I guess I'll keep both right now the home hub is muted
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:30,015	| IOT216 |	And the speakers are
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:30,783	| IOT216 |	Not but
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:33,599	| IOT216 |	We'll see
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:36,415	| IOT216 |	I wait long time for unhappy with us
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,999	| IOT216 |	And I didn't realize this but
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,559	| IOT216 |	Play no doubt you can get this on the Sonos beam
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,327	| IOT216 |	As well
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,863	| IOT216 |	II was about
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,911	| IOT216 |	I'm looking at one of those because
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:49,727	| IOT216 |	As part of my boob I will lose my surround sound that was built
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,007	| IOT216 |	My house
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:54,335	| IOT216 |	I now need one of those things that hangs above
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:54,847	| IOT216 |	TV
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:57,407	| IOT216 |	S7 work with my digital assist
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:03,295	| IOT216 |	All right so we've talked about a lot of digital assistant news one little other thing
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:05,087	| IOT216 |	Amazon we can talk of this last week
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:08,159	| IOT216 |	Sunset and sunrise
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:08,927	| IOT216 |	Notifications
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,975	| IOT216 |	So now you can use
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,999	| IOT216 |	That is a
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,511	| IOT216 |	A trigger when they
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:13,791	| IOT216 |	Routine
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,559	| IOT216 |	And
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:17,119	| IOT216 |	Google smart displays and now get
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:17,631	| IOT216 |	Their own
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:18,655	| IOT216 |	Routine button
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,703	| IOT216 |	Which I don't know if you want to talk
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:24,543	| IOT216 |	I would love to because again I have the Google home
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:29,663	| IOT216 |	It's not that exciting literally if you swipe down
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,455	| IOT216 |	On a Google home
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,223	| IOT216 |	Smart
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,247	| IOT216 |	Display
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:36,575	| IOT216 |	Where it normally would have no hear cure lights
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,855	| IOT216 |	Lights media
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,903	| IOT216 |	Broadcast MSS cameras Etc
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:40,927	| IOT216 |	There's a new button
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:41,695	| IOT216 |	Access routines
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,487	| IOT216 |	And if I tap it
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,791	| IOT216 |	I can see the names of my routines
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:51,679	| IOT216 |	Basically it's a way to quietly run any routine
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,471	| IOT216 |	Excellent
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:53,983	| IOT216 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:55,519	| IOT216 |	Yay routine
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:58,335	| IOT216 |	I'm not looking forward to having to set all of us up
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:00,127	| IOT216 |	But
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,431	| IOT216 |	It'll be a fun story a learning experience
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:06,527	| IOT216 |	Alright let's move away from the digital assistant world for just a little while
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,551	| IOT216 |	And talk about
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,599	| IOT216 |	The NB iot
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:11,647	| IOT216 |	SeaWorld last week we talked about
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,951	| IOT216 |	AT&T launching NB iot
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,487	| IOT216 |	Yay
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:18,303	| IOT216 |	Not to be outdone this week at iot world
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,327	| IOT216 |	Verizon announced
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:20,351	| IOT216 |	Their own
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,143	| IOT216 |	Nb-iot
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:25,471	| IOT216 |	Which puts the US now where Europe is
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:27,519	| IOT216 |	In the US the carriers
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:28,543	| IOT216 |	Sprint first with LTE
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:30,335	| IOT216 |	Cat 1M
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,615	| IOT216 |	Which has more bandwidth
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:34,175	| IOT216 |	But it isn't as battery efficient
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:37,503	| IOT216 |	Is it cost more so people were not thrilled
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:41,343	| IOT216 |	And now they're all like oh we made a mistake everybody wants nb-iot
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:45,439	| IOT216 |	So Verizon's network is now available over 92% of the US
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,207	| IOT216 |	Population
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,767	| IOT216 |	Control America
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:52,863	| IOT216 |	And NB iot just as a quick reminder is cellular
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,911	| IOT216 |	Very small data
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,191	| IOT216 |	Very tiny
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:13:02,591	| IOT216 |	And Verizon standard and big price plan is going to be
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:04,383	| IOT216 |	$1 monthly access fee
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:05,663	| IOT216 |	Her device
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:08,479	| IOT216 |	Very different than AT&T
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:08,991	| IOT216 |	Which is like
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:11,807	| IOT216 |	Here's $5
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:12,319	| IOT216 |	Her device
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,367	| IOT216 |	So
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:16,671	| IOT216 |	Verizon were already looking at $12
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:17,183	| IOT216 |	Per year
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,463	| IOT216 |	And
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,487	| IOT216 |	AT&T didn't really talk
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:22,815	| IOT216 |	That also I should tell you it was a starting
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:27,167	| IOT216 |	Well I can look at the consumer side of things I'm like I'm not paying for it but
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:30,239	| IOT216 |	Obviously if you are a business that's rolling out thousands and thousands of
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:34,591	| IOT216 |	Cellular connected devices for sensors and such that's going to add up quick
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,359	| IOT216 |	Avesis
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:42,271	| IOT216 |	Yeah there's a consumer you might see this like you might buy at a smoke detector for example that has an NB iot sensor
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:46,623	| IOT216 |	Granite not really care about it'll configure automatically to the network when you download your a porter
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,391	| IOT216 |	Turn it on
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:50,207	| IOT216 |	And what it will do is if anything happen
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:52,767	| IOT216 |	Like smoke is detected will send a signal that
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,303	| IOT216 |	Will either text you or give you
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,327	| IOT216 |	A notification
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,119	| IOT216 |	And that sort of thing
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:59,935	| IOT216 |	Will probably just be built into the
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:01,471	| IOT216 |	What device is my
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:04,287	| IOT216 |	Probably I would agree to be honest
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:08,895	| IOT216 |	I think I would want to see that in certain centers as a backup system because if my home internet is out
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,687	| IOT216 |	Whenever I get the notification
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:16,319	| IOT216 |	Your security alarm may be a flood leak detector
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:21,695	| IOT216 |	In a smart city they're looking at using mbit for temperature sensors maybe for
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:24,255	| IOT216 |	Bridge maintenance type of sensors.
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,815	| IOT216 |	So
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:28,607	| IOT216 |	Parking meters
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:30,911	| IOT216 |	Is there a transaction oriented that's a batter
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:35,519	| IOT216 |	It could be like yes someone is parked here right now
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:36,031	| IOT216 |	But I don't
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,615	| IOT216 |	Actually sending
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:40,895	| IOT216 |	Yep make sense
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,431	| IOT216 |	So
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:45,503	| IOT216 |	That is the Verizon NB iot Network
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:47,551	| IOT216 |	AT&T he retired SeaWorld
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:49,087	| IOT216 |	Not to be outdone by Verizon
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:51,135	| IOT216 |	Launched a
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:52,927	| IOT216 |	$1000000 collaboration
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,951	| IOT216 |	With the city of San Jose
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:56,255	| IOT216 |	Really this is mostly technical
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:59,839	| IOT216 |	And San Jose saying sure you could play
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:02,399	| IOT216 |	Play on our Network for Smart City stuff
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:05,983	| IOT216 |	So what they're doing is they're adding smart lighting
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:12,383	| IOT216 |	Controllers and lights to 14 Parks across San Jose so this is go + 100 + 1
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,151	| IOT216 |	Wi-Fi extenders
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:14,431	| IOT216 |	Yay
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,455	| IOT216 |	And
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:19,295	| IOT216 |	What they called digital infrastructure notes that will help improve Public Safety
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:25,439	| IOT216 |	Digital infrastructure is AT&T schedule for a piece of Hardware that you install online
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,719	| IOT216 |	A Lamppost or something
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,487	| IOT216 |	Like that
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:29,279	| IOT216 |	And it's designed for
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:30,559	| IOT216 |	The Smart City
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:32,351	| IOT216 |	And people can use that data
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,631	| IOT216 |	Pull the data from it
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,679	| IOT216 |	Lovely apps
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:37,727	| IOT216 |	Muttley
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:40,287	| IOT216 |	Plus AT&T is going to give Sam
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:41,055	| IOT216 |	San Jose to
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:41,823	| IOT216 |	$2,000
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,359	| IOT216 |	I assume so they could
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:43,871	| IOT216 |	Use this as
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,151	| IOT216 |	Case study
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:46,175	| IOT216 |	Press release
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:47,711	| IOT216 |	So
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:49,759	| IOT216 |	Go San Jose get it get it
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:51,551	| IOT216 |	All right
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:54,367	| IOT216 |	We also have in City News San Francisco
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:55,903	| IOT216 |	Band
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:58,719	| IOT216 |	Facial recognition is the first city in the US to do so
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:15:59,743	| IOT216 |	Ironic
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,023	| IOT216 |	Given the
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:03,839	| IOT216 |	A technical document of the people or maybe it's not ironic there's like
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:04,351	| IOT216 |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:08,191	| IOT216 |	The stuff is Daisy and or William as all get-out
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:08,703	| IOT216 |	So
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,007	| IOT216 |	Let's talk about this Kevin what has happened
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:14,591	| IOT216 |	Yeah so this is a new
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:17,407	| IOT216 |	He said a ban on facial recognition technology
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,967	| IOT216 |	But the devil's kind of in the details
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:21,247	| IOT216 |	Always hatin
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,039	| IOT216 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:24,575	| IOT216 |	When I first saw it on like
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:26,111	| IOT216 |	So nobody
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:27,903	| IOT216 |	Anywhere within the confines of
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:28,927	| IOT216 |	The city of
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:31,231	| IOT216 |	San Francisco will be able to use facial recognition
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:34,047	| IOT216 |	But that's not true it's the city itself
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:35,071	| IOT216 |	Basically if
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:37,375	| IOT216 |	City agencies would have to get approval to get
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:42,239	| IOT216 |	Surveillance devices in such an edit includes police body cameras license plate readers
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:43,007	| IOT216 |	Etc
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:45,567	| IOT216 |	They can continue use what they already have expenses
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,335	| IOT216 |	Sleeper new stuff
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,127	| IOT216 |	Private entities
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:49,151	| IOT216 |	Are not banned
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:49,919	| IOT216 |	Just to be clear
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,735	| IOT216 |	If you walking
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:53,759	| IOT216 |	Their private
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:55,807	| IOT216 |	Cuz they're private entities exactly
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:17:00,415	| IOT216 |	If you're walking around the Streets of San Francisco going forward you know you shouldn't
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:01,951	| IOT216 |	After really worried
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,743	| IOT216 |	About facial recognition in use
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:07,583	| IOT216 |	Other than maybe again private entities that are monitoring
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:10,143	| IOT216 |	I just walking past their front doors and such
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:14,751	| IOT216 |	Retailers use it inside their stores
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,519	| IOT216 |	2
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,799	| IOT216 |	Check for shoplifters
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:18,847	| IOT216 |	They have an own database of shoplifters and
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,615	| IOT216 |	If you get in there yet
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,407	| IOT216 |	Escorted out
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:23,199	| IOT216 |	Even things like Amazon go
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,967	| IOT216 |	I
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:25,247	| IOT216 |	Actually do they use facial
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:25,759	| IOT216 |	Ignition node
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,087	| IOT216 |	They use the app on your
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,391	| IOT216 |	Right
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,159	| IOT216 |	Mission to know what you buy
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,975	| IOT216 |	I'm not on the shoplifters database output
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,511	| IOT216 |	In the casinos
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,023	| IOT216 |	A little sketchy
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:38,303	| IOT216 |	Anyway
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:42,143	| IOT216 |	Are you dating the blackjack tables I'm like tell me where Kevin
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:45,983	| IOT216 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,007	| IOT216 |	The main reason
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:50,847	| IOT216 |	For that is something we talked about before these facial recognition systems
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:52,895	| IOT216 |	Are pretty much heavily biased
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,687	| IOT216 |	Against people of color
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:57,503	| IOT216 |	They're not accurate and then that
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:18:00,319	| IOT216 |	Has led to some very valid concerns about
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:04,415	| IOT216 |	Being I don't know people database for not doing anything just
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,183	| IOT216 |	Because
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:05,951	| IOT216 |	System
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:06,463	| IOT216 |	Can't detect
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:08,255	| IOT216 |	Your skin color properly
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,047	| IOT216 |	It's a it's a
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,071	| IOT216 |	Anyway
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,095	| IOT216 |	That's what's happening
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:14,399	| IOT216 |	I'm not against this I'll be honest
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:16,447	| IOT216 |	Alright let's move on to
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:23,359	| IOT216 |	So little bit of industrial news here we're going to talk about Lenovo they have introduced a new iot Gateway for the edge
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,639	| IOT216 |	Which combines menu
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:26,943	| IOT216 |	The hot exciting words that we talked about today at 8
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:28,479	| IOT216 |	Industrial iot
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:29,247	| IOT216 |	We got a
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:29,759	| IOT216 |	Wechat Gateway
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,039	| IOT216 |	We've got
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,111	| IOT216 |	We don't have a IR blaster
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:35,135	| IOT216 |	So
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:36,927	| IOT216 |	What is exciting about this
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,463	| IOT216 |	Anyting
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,487	| IOT216 |	Just new hardware
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,791	| IOT216 |	Hardware Ace
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:45,887	| IOT216 |	Kind of PC base I cannot with two small pc-based systems
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:49,215	| IOT216 |	Republic Bank Center Nano m90np
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,775	| IOT216 |	And also the M90 and iot
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,823	| IOT216 |	31
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:56,639	| IOT216 |	It's a small I guess I call it a brick
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:58,175	| IOT216 |	Runs on Intel processors
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:02,271	| IOT216 |	You can use Lenovo software on it or you can use Microsoft software on it if you'd like
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:07,135	| IOT216 |	I'm just basically more like an industrial Gateway
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:08,671	| IOT216 |	Know that whatever was getting into
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,975	| IOT216 |	Course that's where all the money is
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:16,863	| IOT216 |	Wasn't considering the price is going to list for $539
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,143	| IOT216 |	Damaged shipping
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:20,959	| IOT216 |	Equitation is August
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:25,567	| IOT216 |	Yes indeed in their time back into Microsoft's cloud
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:26,335	| IOT216 |	So
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:26,847	| IOT216 |	Diesel
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,639	| IOT216 |	Optimized for that nut
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:30,943	| IOT216 |	Two other things
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,991	| IOT216 |	But ye
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,527	| IOT216 |	Making the industrial iot
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:36,575	| IOT216 |	That's actually a huge theme
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:38,367	| IOT216 |	And we've been seeing
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,135	| IOT216 |	So yes I'm still sick
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:40,159	| IOT216 |	Iot world
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:45,279	| IOT216 |	We could have started approaching the Enterprise and Industrial iot with this perrytech Folk
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:51,167	| IOT216 |	Perspective which was like a jeweler will help you like to all the pieces together
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,471	| IOT216 |	And everyone was like we do not want that
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:57,311	| IOT216 |	We want you to build us a natural solution because we do not want a thing
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:57,823	| IOT216 |	Take that hard about
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,103	| IOT216 |	And so
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:00,383	| IOT216 |	That is
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:03,711	| IOT216 |	Happening you're still getting a more modular approach where you can buy a certain
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,223	| IOT216 |	Hardware in the
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:06,271	| IOT216 |	Match it to your cloud
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:10,367	| IOT216 |	But we are seeing lots of Si systems integrators at other company
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:10,879	| IOT216 |	He's coming in in
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:14,975	| IOT216 |	And basically hand-holding people through that process because it's still hard
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:19,327	| IOT216 |	And I don't think we're entirely there yet we're going to have some silos
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:22,399	| IOT216 |	Built up here in the next couple of years that will take
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:24,703	| IOT216 |	I don't know a few more years and more maturity
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:25,215	| IOT216 |	The breakdown
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:27,263	| IOT216 |	So that's where we are
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:30,591	| IOT216 |	Big picture that's the big Trend kind of thing I'm seeing here
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:31,359	| IOT216 |	And
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:33,407	| IOT216 |	Little bits of news that we forgot about
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:35,455	| IOT216 |	There's a rumor out there that ring
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:39,295	| IOT216 |	Has now finally been certified in a developer platform somewhere with
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:40,575	| IOT216 |	Apple homekit
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:43,391	| IOT216 |	This is something that's been promised since 2016
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,415	| IOT216 |	People that ring doorbells
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,183	| IOT216 |	Really want this to work
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:47,743	| IOT216 |	And I'm a little surprised by this
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:49,279	| IOT216 |	Really
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:51,327	| IOT216 |	Yes all I know was promised
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:54,399	| IOT216 |	But that was before Amazon bought ring
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,447	| IOT216 |	Yes but
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:59,519	| IOT216 |	They promised even after they bought it
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:04,895	| IOT216 |	That was one of the first questions we had in this actually all this ties into something that we didn't really talk about
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,175	| IOT216 |	We probably should have
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:09,759	| IOT216 |	Which is this idea that when you buy these products
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:13,855	| IOT216 |	You're not only buying a promise like Rings promise that it will one day work with homekit
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:16,416	| IOT216 |	What's the buy a promise that the device will stay
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,184	| IOT216 |	Functionally
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,464	| IOT216 |	The same
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:20,512	| IOT216 |	And that does not seem to be
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:21,536	| IOT216 |	Actually playing out
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:23,328	| IOT216 |	As we saw with the Google works with nest
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:25,376	| IOT216 |	As I saw actually
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:30,496	| IOT216 |	And everyone else all with the wise sensors and the changing of the privacy policy earlier
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:32,288	| IOT216 |	This month in preparation for the launch of it
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,824	| IOT216 |	Sense system
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,640	| IOT216 |	I wrote about this actually in the newsletter
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:38,176	| IOT216 |	This isn't a new topic
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:39,712	| IOT216 |	Because we
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:42,784	| IOT216 |	But it's this idea that all of your Hardware is now
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,600	| IOT216 |	I don't know how to feel about
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:47,392	| IOT216 |	Because there are clear advantage
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:50,720	| IOT216 |	Right and we've been through this with
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:52,000	| IOT216 |	The Kindle
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:56,352	| IOT216 |	Where you purchase a book on your Kindle you understand that you're buying basically
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:57,888	| IOT216 |	DRM protect
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:00,960	| IOT216 |	I could piece of work that may get pulled or changed and
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:02,752	| IOT216 |	Amazon will do the right thing
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,520	| IOT216 |	What you know
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:04,800	| IOT216 |	Give you money back and all that sort
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:07,360	| IOT216 |	But it's still not the same as owning
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:11,456	| IOT216 |	Write a book stores not going to come back to your house and take the book
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:16,064	| IOT216 |	Away from you that you purchase where is Amazon actually did do that at one point in time barrier Leon
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:20,672	| IOT216 |	I forget what what book it was on the Kindle the 1980s
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,464	| IOT216 |	That's how ironic
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,512	| IOT216 |	Help itching
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:26,816	| IOT216 |	Great example
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:29,376	| IOT216 |	Yes
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,656	| IOT216 |	Gold-plated I already there
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:32,704	| IOT216 |	Yes and so
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:33,216	| IOT216 |	I think
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:35,776	| IOT216 |	We have to get used to this with
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:37,312	| IOT216 |	Scented products
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:39,872	| IOT216 |	I think if we're going to buy them we have to recognize a
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:40,640	| IOT216 |	Set this is the new car
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:43,968	| IOT216 |	But I don't think we should just Advocate Oliver
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,528	| IOT216 |	So I think there should be some
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,576	| IOT216 |	Better Behavior
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,088	| IOT216 |	Around
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:50,880	| IOT216 |	If you're going to revoke us
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,160	| IOT216 |	Feature that is a
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:52,672	| IOT216 |	Definite
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:53,952	| IOT216 |	Downer
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:54,720	| IOT216 |	Customer
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:56,000	| IOT216 |	You should do it
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:56,768	| IOT216 |	A sugary treat
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:59,584	| IOT216 |	So not just a carrot mistake you should
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,352	| IOT216 |	You should give like
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:01,888	| IOT216 |	Ice cream sandwich
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:02,912	| IOT216 |	And
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:07,008	| IOT216 |	If you're going to revoke a future I think you need to offer something pretty substantial
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:10,336	| IOT216 |	I also think that if you're going to change
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,360	| IOT216 |	Change the privacy policy
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:13,920	| IOT216 |	I don't know Kevin is probably unrealistic that you
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:16,992	| IOT216 |	The challenge with the wise privacy policy
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:17,504	| IOT216 |	Sea change
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:21,600	| IOT216 |	You're like if you keep using this device you will agree to this change
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:26,208	| IOT216 |	If I had spent $600 on
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:27,744	| IOT216 |	Device
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,048	| IOT216 |	What am I going to do
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:33,120	| IOT216 |	I'm not going to throw away my $600
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:36,192	| IOT216 |	Right that's the thing I mean
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:38,752	| IOT216 |	Physical physical harder at that point
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,800	| IOT216 |	Yeah with these companies
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:43,104	| IOT216 |	Consider refunding your
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:45,920	| IOT216 |	Purchase pricing if you turn the product back in
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:46,432	| IOT216 |	They won't
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:50,272	| IOT216 |	I would love to see them do that because it would kind of force them to
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,808	| IOT216 |	Really hard
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:53,856	| IOT216 |	Evaluate if they're ever going to change.
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:57,440	| IOT216 |	Physical
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:00,000	| IOT216 |	Hardware return and refund policy
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:02,560	| IOT216 |	They're not likely going to
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:03,584	| IOT216 |	Change their price
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,656	| IOT216 |	Or they might
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,424	| IOT216 |	Because laws change
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,472	| IOT216 |	Acquisitions happen
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:12,544	| IOT216 |	They're actually very legitimate business reasons or
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,312	| IOT216 |	Legal reason
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,080	| IOT216 |	How to change your privacy
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:20,480	| IOT216 |	This is a good example it didn't fit the mini Marcus had a new product line with new features coming
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:22,784	| IOT216 |	And those features happen to work
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:23,296	| IOT216 |	The camera
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:24,320	| IOT216 |	So
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,136	| IOT216 |	I think transparency is the first thing
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:28,416	| IOT216 |	I think
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:30,976	| IOT216 |	Maybe it is a probation or maybe it is a coupe
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,536	| IOT216 |	So hard
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:36,864	| IOT216 |	If any of you guys have brilliant ideas send them to us this is
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:39,168	| IOT216 |	This is an area I'd like to explore a lot more
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,448	| IOT216 |	Because this isn't a problem
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:40,960	| IOT216 |	It's going to go away
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:42,496	| IOT216 |	And
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:44,032	| IOT216 |	We've probably only get worse to be honest
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:45,056	| IOT216 |	Yes
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:48,640	| IOT216 |	Thank you Kevin for that at dystopian
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:49,920	| IOT216 |	Cynical world view
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:51,200	| IOT216 |	Nevertheless.
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:53,248	| IOT216 |	All right my little
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:25:00,416	| IOT216 |	Find a little bit of news for you the this is for people
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,208	| IOT216 |	Pacquiao
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:05,280	| IOT216 |	The Wi-Fi Alliance has now extended it
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:07,072	| IOT216 |	Wi-Fi certified Home Design program
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:09,376	| IOT216 |	For single-family
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:10,144	| IOT216 |	Homes
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,936	| IOT216 |	Multi-family units and
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:12,448	| IOT216 |	Apartments
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:16,288	| IOT216 |	So basically everybody living in an apartment kind of
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:18,592	| IOT216 |	Just don't wear the smart home the smart
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:20,896	| IOT216 |	Homes
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,176	| IOT216 |	For wild it had this program
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:23,712	| IOT216 |	It's a way to design
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,480	| IOT216 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:25,504	| IOT216 |	Part of the
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:30,112	| IOT216 |	This means it's going to have awesome coverage everywhere in the home
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,648	| IOT216 |	And
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:33,184	| IOT216 |	They've got all kinds of
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:33,696	| IOT216 |	Tools
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:38,048	| IOT216 |	Ways to make this happen and it's something that the homebuilder does or the apartment
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:43,424	| IOT216 |	So if you are moving into a place that has Wi-Fi certified home design
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:44,192	| IOT216 |	It means
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:45,728	| IOT216 |	You're going to get a network connectivity
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:47,008	| IOT216 |	Attic
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:47,520	| IOT216 |	Forever Young
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:53,664	| IOT216 |	This is very forward-looking at the Wi-Fi Alliance I don't think many of us care about it as much today but
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:55,456	| IOT216 |	I think it's great that they're building this in
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:56,992	| IOT216 |	And also
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:26:00,320	| IOT216 |	Huge props to them for building their standard into
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,344	| IOT216 |	Episcopal homes
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:01,856	| IOT216 |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:05,184	| IOT216 |	Lennar is headed
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:09,280	| IOT216 |	Wi-Fi Home Design 262 new multifamily communities
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,048	| IOT216 |	Nationwide
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:13,376	| IOT216 |	Which that's a big deal in our bills
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:14,400	| IOT216 |	Ginormous
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:15,680	| IOT216 |	Planned community
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:18,496	| IOT216 |	All around I know in Texas we've got a bunch I went to visit one
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:21,056	| IOT216 |	And Pennsylvania
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,080	| IOT216 |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:24,640	| IOT216 |	And speaking of Wi-Fi

EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:37,856	| IOT216 |	So
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:40,416	| IOT216 |	Did you question did your highly likely

EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:46,304	| IOT216 |	Plus we are planning on doing any questions only
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:48,096	| IOT216 |	Episode very soon so
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:49,632	| IOT216 |	Cinnamon because otherwise
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:51,168	| IOT216 |	It's going to be a very very short
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:54,752	| IOT216 |	Already that is 5 1/2
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:56,800	| IOT216 |	623-7424
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:59,104	| IOT216 |	And let's get to this week's question which is from
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:02,176	| IOT216 |	Istation
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:03,456	| IOT216 |	My name is Jeff
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:05,248	| IOT216 |	What's on the show
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:07,296	| IOT216 |	Quick question regarding
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:08,832	| IOT216 |	System
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:11,136	| IOT216 |	Purchase the Google Wi-Fi mesh
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:13,184	| IOT216 |	I like it the only question I have is
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:17,024	| IOT216 |	My other competitors make one
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:19,584	| IOT216 |	Buckmore Wi-Fi
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:21,376	| IOT216 |	My backyard
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:23,168	| IOT216 |	Is there a way to hook up an X
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:24,448	| IOT216 |	To it
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:26,496	| IOT216 |	If not you have a different solution that would be
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:29,568	| IOT216 |	Island Pacific Market shell in Ark
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,384	| IOT216 |	Okay Jeff
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:34,176	| IOT216 |	We have
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:34,688	| IOT216 |	An answer for you
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:35,712	| IOT216 |	Which is
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:37,504	| IOT216 |	Good thing
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:39,552	| IOT216 |	And a really pricey thing
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:42,880	| IOT216 |	So you were not
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:46,976	| IOT216 |	Google Wi-Fi does not make an outdoor extender
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:47,744	| IOT216 |	But
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:48,512	| IOT216 |	Netgear orbi
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:49,536	| IOT216 |	Does
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:52,608	| IOT216 |	And when did be cool Kevin if he could just like
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:59,264	| IOT216 |	Put that extender in there and it would use that cool Wi-Fi mesh technology we talked about a year ago that was a standard
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:05,664	| IOT216 |	Would be so cool if it used ezmatch but it doesn't so you can
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:06,432	| IOT216 |	Because
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:09,248	| IOT216 |	Without the ezmatch standard implemented
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:12,320	| IOT216 |	You can only stand a mesh network with the
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:13,600	| IOT216 |	Same brand
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:15,392	| IOT216 |	That you have today in your home
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:18,720	| IOT216 |	What a bummer which is why we said this is kind of
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:19,232	| IOT216 |	Sake
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:21,280	| IOT216 |	Inexpensive because
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:26,400	| IOT216 |	If you buy the Netgear orbi one which obviously will not work there wi-fi your Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:29,728	| IOT216 |	Just the outdoor extender is $350
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:35,872	| IOT216 |	You also have to replace your tire in home Mesh networking system with orbi gear
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:38,688	| IOT216 |	And the router alone is $150 I think
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:40,224	| IOT216 |	I think it's 200
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:42,784	| IOT216 |	IS 250
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:46,880	| IOT216 |	Yeah so you're looking at like $600 just to extend
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:49,696	| IOT216 |	Tier outdoor so unfortunately
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:52,256	| IOT216 |	It's your money if you were my money and my
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:53,024	| IOT216 |	Use case
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:54,048	| IOT216 |	I don't use
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:55,584	| IOT216 |	Outdoor WiFi that much
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:57,632	| IOT216 |	And when I do
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:01,984	| IOT216 |	I actually have a Google wifi unit close to the back of the house so
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:03,520	| IOT216 |	Niacinamide deck Outdoors
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:04,800	| IOT216 |	I get a decent signal
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:07,872	| IOT216 |	Do you have to go property or you don't have a
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:09,408	| IOT216 |	Access point near me
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:11,968	| IOT216 |	You're Outdoors we're going to use your Wi-Fi
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:13,248	| IOT216 |	Maybe this works
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:13,760	| IOT216 |	$600
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:18,368	| IOT216 |	That's that's not a primary use case for me is another way of saying that I would not
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:20,160	| IOT216 |	You may want to
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:25,024	| IOT216 |	Yeah it really depends on your setup if you're going to do the indoor to Outdoor Connection
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:27,328	| IOT216 |	You know setting it up near a window will help
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:31,168	| IOT216 |	Help your signal light stand a little bit in the home that you just sold
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:32,960	| IOT216 |	Stacy you had
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,728	| IOT216 |	Roof deck
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:38,848	| IOT216 |	I did and I had actually I put an Eero Beacon cuz I had a covered area in the room
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:44,992	| IOT216 |	But and here's the here's the caveat with that I had an Eero Beacon that I plugged in under there that would
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:45,760	| IOT216 |	Be protective for the weather
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:48,832	| IOT216 |	What day did not think about was that it is not protected
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,112	| IOT216 |	Sheet
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:50,880	| IOT216 |	Texas Sun
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:52,416	| IOT216 |	And we get up to 100
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:53,184	| IOT216 |	1200
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:54,464	| IOT216 |	10 Degrees apus
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:55,232	| IOT216 |	Cabinet
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,000	| IOT216 |	And
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:57,024	| IOT216 |	Tequipment couldn't handle
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:31:01,120	| IOT216 |	So you don't just have to depend on where you live you don't just have to
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:03,168	| IOT216 |	To protect from the elements you have to protect from
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:05,216	| IOT216 |	Cold temperature extremes
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:06,752	| IOT216 |	So
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,776	| IOT216 |	Keep that in mind
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:11,616	| IOT216 |	The other thing I would say to you is I actually tried out the orbit gear
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:14,176	| IOT216 |	It is very powerful I have
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:16,224	| IOT216 |	Three of the traditional arrows in my house
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:17,760	| IOT216 |	And
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:19,040	| IOT216 |	One Beacon and that is
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:20,064	| IOT216 |	More than sufficient
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:26,464	| IOT216 |	But two of the Orbeez so the Domaine orbea then one satellite orbi
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:27,744	| IOT216 |	Covered my entire
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:29,792	| IOT216 |	So you may find
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:31,328	| IOT216 |	That the outdoor orbi
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:33,376	| IOT216 |	And1 indoor orbi
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:34,912	| IOT216 |	Works for you
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:38,752	| IOT216 |	So keep that in my you may not need like as many Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,312	| IOT216 |	All right
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:42,080	| IOT216 |	Will Jeff
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:46,432	| IOT216 |	I hope that answers your question I ever curious if you have a $350 outdoor extender
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:47,456	| IOT216 |	Use case
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:49,504	| IOT216 |	You're like yes it is totally worth it
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:54,624	| IOT216 |	All right that is included
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:55,904	| IOT216 |	This week's

EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:37,120	| IOT216 |	2.
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:39,936	| IOT216 |	Can you tell us a little bit more about
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:40,704	| IOT216 |	The news
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:42,752	| IOT216 |	So we just announced
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:45,312	| IOT216 |	Call Coyote Center
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:47,872	| IOT216 |	Fast and now we have both gas and on-prem
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:55,040	| IOT216 |	Dissolution is those for the it organization and ot to have complete disability
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:00,672	| IOT216 |	Advices
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:01,696	| IOT216 |	Edge computing
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:02,976	| IOT216 |	Unconnected Center
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:09,376	| IOT216 |	This allows them to onboard their devices
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:14,496	| IOT216 |	And have security across the device the data the application and the network
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:19,104	| IOT216 |	Excellent so how does this fit into Dell Technologies and VMware
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:20,384	| IOT216 |	Iot and Edge
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:25,248	| IOT216 |	We are developing an entire digital Foundation
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:31,648	| IOT216 |	It is a natural extension to what we are doing across multi-cloud
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:35,232	| IOT216 |	Ignition system
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:36,512	| IOT216 |	Which are gateways
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:38,304	| IOT216 |	Vices and Spencer
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:44,704	| IOT216 |	And that's what profile tri-center fits in then we all last week
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:45,472	| IOT216 |	Which is really
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:50,592	| IOT216 |	Jennifer classic BMW
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:52,896	| IOT216 |	Closer to where the things reside

EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:48,096	| IOT216 |	Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:49,376	| IOT216 |	Mario's of Asa
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:51,936	| IOT216 |	Who is the global head of Business Development
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:53,472	| IOT216 |	At 10
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:58,336	| IOT216 |	And Gray Station thanks for having me
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:03,200	| IOT216 |	Oh I am super excited for a couple reasons one we're going to talk a lot about intertek
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:07,296	| IOT216 |	So why insurance companies what they can do and get out of SmartThings
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:12,416	| IOT216 |	But two were also going to get an update on spin which is company I've been following for a while
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:14,464	| IOT216 |	Why don't you start
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:16,000	| IOT216 |	By telling us
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:19,072	| IOT216 |	A little bit about thin what it is what has just happened
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:24,448	| IOT216 |	Truciciel we have an intelligent water monitoring device
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:25,216	| IOT216 |	So what that is
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:27,776	| IOT216 |	The sensor that attaches to the main water line
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:34,688	| IOT216 |	And it measures three different things that measures the temperature at the point of installation measures how much flow is going through the
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:36,224	| IOT216 |	How much water using
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:37,760	| IOT216 |	I mean also measure pressure
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:44,160	| IOT216 |	Which will get into a little bit later on but what that allows it to do is to be able to understand how much water you're using
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:44,928	| IOT216 |	How your use
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:47,744	| IOT216 |	Senior water and if there's any leaks or anything that normal
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:53,376	| IOT216 |	So meaning when you we can tell you when you take a shower how long your shower is how much water
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,936	| IOT216 |	And we can tell you the difference between
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:56,704	| IOT216 |	A shower
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:58,496	| IOT216 |	A toilet a week
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:01,312	| IOT216 |	And we have the ability to turn off your water a remotely
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:05,152	| IOT216 |	You're on vacation and you get a call and it says Waters come
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:06,688	| IOT216 |	Feeling I don't know what
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:08,736	| IOT216 |	You do what you can just pull out your phone press a button
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:10,272	| IOT216 |	Turn the water off
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:11,552	| IOT216 |	Are you can automatically have
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:13,600	| IOT216 |	Turn the water off for you
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:14,112	| IOT216 |	Awesome
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:16,672	| IOT216 |	Yes it's going to be exciting music
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,952	| IOT216 |	We had it
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:19,232	| IOT216 |	The last we spoke
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:22,048	| IOT216 |	What's the 4 CS of last year the company
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:23,072	| IOT216 |	Stop a sound in 20
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,888	| IOT216 |	With over 10 years of
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:26,912	| IOT216 |	History and research
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:28,192	| IOT216 |	That started back
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:29,472	| IOT216 |	In 2009
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:30,240	| IOT216 |	The University of
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:32,544	| IOT216 |	3 commercially founded the company
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:35,360	| IOT216 |	2016 started selling a product in April
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:38,432	| IOT216 |	2018 and then last week
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:40,736	| IOT216 |	Anuel funding of $12
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:42,272	| IOT216 |	37
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:45,600	| IOT216 |	Awesome and what are you guys going to do
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:46,624	| IOT216 |	Latest round of
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:52,000	| IOT216 |	Two parties for Global expansion so we have Pilots running a multiple continents
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:53,280	| IOT216 |	This is really exciting
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:55,840	| IOT216 |	And then also on the product development and
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:57,632	| IOT216 |	Enhancement and in growing the team
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:38:02,752	| IOT216 |	Great so let's get into this idea of the smart home and how a device like this fits into
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:06,848	| IOT216 |	And you actually come from the insurance world you were at Farmers Insurance correct
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:08,384	| IOT216 |	That's right I was there for
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:10,944	| IOT216 |	Show all different parts
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:14,272	| IOT216 |	From forecasting the chief of staff to last week I was head of innovation
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:15,552	| IOT216 |	So connected home
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:17,088	| IOT216 |	Is very important
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:18,624	| IOT216 |	Send it
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:21,184	| IOT216 |	Industry-first living insurance
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:23,488	| IOT216 |	Related to the Harlem exit Smart Home
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:24,512	| IOT216 |	Waterlox
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:25,536	| IOT216 |	Severely import
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,304	| IOT216 |	Aspect
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:28,608	| IOT216 |	The second most frequent claim that is
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:30,400	| IOT216 |	Is files and over 10 billion of
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:35,264	| IOT216 |	Cleans annually and so understanding water loss and having be able to
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:39,360	| IOT216 |	To prevent it was really important and then looking at the car companies I was really impressed with
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:41,408	| IOT216 |	Send when they were first in beta stage
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:43,456	| IOT216 |	I meant rather progressions
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:46,528	| IOT216 |	Constantly stayed in touch with them and and was very
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:49,088	| IOT216 |	Continue to be impressed and I joined them last year
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:51,648	| IOT216 |	Awesome and I can tell you as a as a
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:52,160	| IOT216 |	Customer
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:58,816	| IOT216 |	I was with farmers and I believe you guys processed at least two water claims from miso
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:03,168	| IOT216 |	What happens it happens it's kind of crazy
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:07,264	| IOT216 |	It's at 2% of all homeowners so when out of 50 will have a water
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:08,032	| IOT216 |	Steam every year
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:10,848	| IOT216 |	And so when you start to look at that with the average cost
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:12,640	| IOT216 |	$9,600
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:17,248	| IOT216 |	Repair that home and then also average time out of that home 90 days
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:20,832	| IOT216 |	You really want to limit not only from a loft bed for a month
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:25,440	| IOT216 |	Perspective but also in the homeowner side and having to deal with contractors and
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:29,280	| IOT216 |	Special mold issues is an interesting out of your home we can prevent that
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:32,096	| IOT216 |	That's an amazing thing and that's before
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:34,912	| IOT216 |	So let's talk about this cuz the phone device
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:37,216	| IOT216 |	It's 699 which is in
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:40,800	| IOT216 |	Insanely expensive thinking about how much a water Insurance claim cost
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:42,336	| IOT216 |	What is also
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:44,640	| IOT216 |	Pretty expensive when you think that most
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:46,688	| IOT216 |	American households can't handle
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:47,968	| IOT216 |	Unexpected expensive forehead
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:49,760	| IOT216 |	This is a lot of money
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:51,296	| IOT216 |	And so
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:53,856	| IOT216 |	When we look at buying something like this
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:54,624	| IOT216 |	Do you think
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:40:00,768	| IOT216 |	It's going to be the end consumer who puts this on their home or you trying to get insurance companies to pay for part of the
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:03,328	| IOT216 |	How do we get this in people's homes
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:07,680	| IOT216 |	Yeah great question I think it's a mix of all I think that
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:13,056	| IOT216 |	When you first start you'll have first movers which will be those that really want the tech gadgets and really
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:15,616	| IOT216 |	To be on The Cutting Edge and bleeding
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:22,016	| IOT216 |	In technology and that's what we're seeing also from an insurance perspective it absolutely mitigates losses
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:24,576	| IOT216 |	Progressive carriers it is something
EDL	00:40:24,576	00:40:26,112	| IOT216 |	I bet they're looking at
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:30,208	| IOT216 |	I think that it comes into the cost and the amount of profit that in
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:35,072	| IOT216 |	Miniature house on a homeowner policy and then also there are some legal ramifications
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:41,472	| IOT216 |	Rebating and indifferent things that make it a bit more challenging but from certainly from a lost perspective having
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:43,776	| IOT216 |	These types of devices installed in the home
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:45,824	| IOT216 |	Is a material at dating
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:46,848	| IOT216 |	For the insurance
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:50,688	| IOT216 |	So what that translates to is having the consumer who buys it
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,712	| IOT216 |	Not only
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:56,832	| IOT216 |	Installing it but also earning discounts on their insurance so most carriers will offer between
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:57,600	| IOT216 |	5 + 10
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:41:00,672	| IOT216 |	Percent off of their insurance premium for having one of these devices
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:05,280	| IOT216 |	Stop doing that in the near-term I think that you'll see more of the discounts happening
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:06,304	| IOT216 |	And then Isaac
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:07,328	| IOT216 |	Continues to Progressive
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:09,376	| IOT216 |	Become more normal then you're gonna
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:12,192	| IOT216 |	Start to see it embedded in new bills and
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:13,984	| IOT216 |	Construction and then also retrofit
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:21,920	| IOT216 |	And in like new bills and constructions is that going to be something that the builders do as a competitive advantage
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:23,200	| IOT216 |	Is that going to be something that
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:26,272	| IOT216 |	Insurors I can be like yeah we need this in this neighborhood
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:27,552	| IOT216 |	How does that start to happen
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:32,160	| IOT216 |	But I think it'll start with Builders I mix of Builders and utilities
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:35,744	| IOT216 |	So when we when the company was founded it looked at
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:41,888	| IOT216 |	3 million macro-trends that were happening one being increasing population the other being changes in
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:42,656	| IOT216 |	Inclimate
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:43,936	| IOT216 |	And water being a dick
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:50,336	| IOT216 |	Feeding resource in the third being aging infrastructure both at the municipality level and then also at the house
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:51,104	| IOT216 |	Home level
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:53,407	| IOT216 |	And so as we start to see water
EDL	00:41:53,407	00:41:57,759	| IOT216 |	Continue to be stressed over the years I think it's going to become more and more important
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:42:01,343	| IOT216 |	To be able to limit that will rather understand water used
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:02,623	| IOT216 |	And prevent leaks from happening
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:04,159	| IOT216 |	And so
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:06,207	| IOT216 |	As we think about it that happen
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:12,607	| IOT216 |	Search for Builders and increasing what is really a smart home and how do you provide benefits back to the customer
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:15,167	| IOT216 |	Lowe's on the experience and also on the cost-saving side
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:17,983	| IOT216 |	What's switch back to the insurance world
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:20,031	| IOT216 |	Because there is so much there
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:20,543	| IOT216 |	And
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:25,151	| IOT216 |	Honestly I'm a little disappointed I thought I'd be seeing a lot more
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:26,943	| IOT216 |	Insurance participation
EDL	00:42:26,943	00:42:29,247	| IOT216 |	On the water leakage side on the security side
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:34,111	| IOT216 |	You like a basically get a 5 to 10% discount
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:34,623	| IOT216 |	On
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:37,183	| IOT216 |	One option so if I have a
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:38,463	| IOT216 |	Ismartalarm system
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:39,999	| IOT216 |	Attic fan really doesn't help me
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:41,279	| IOT216 |	Because I don't get an additional
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:42,047	| IOT216 |	Discount
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:44,095	| IOT216 |	And I don't see much
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:46,143	| IOT216 |	You know other than a few co-marketing agreement
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:48,959	| IOT216 |	I don't see much from the insurance forms
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:50,239	| IOT216 |	Pushing this so I'm
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:51,775	| IOT216 |	I'm really curious like
EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:53,311	| IOT216 |	Why this hasn't gone
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:54,847	| IOT216 |	Farther faster
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:43:01,503	| IOT216 |	Yeah I mean I think that's from an insurance perspective there are a couple of things that make it a little bit more challenging
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:03,295	| IOT216 |	Or just rather areas by
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:04,575	| IOT216 |	Need to be looked at
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:05,855	| IOT216 |	And Revisited
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:08,927	| IOT216 |	How something like this can be embedded into a carrier
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:09,951	| IOT216 |	When is the car
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:10,975	| IOT216 |	The Coffee Bean
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:12,511	| IOT216 |	Several hundred dollars that can be
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:14,815	| IOT216 |	You challenging Furniture because inter-process
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:16,607	| IOT216 |	Other percentages are not
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:19,935	| IOT216 |	What you would think of a normal technology company you know it's
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:20,703	| IOT216 |	It sucks
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:22,495	| IOT216 |	Percent is so in some years
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:23,775	| IOT216 |	It can be very very thin
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:27,615	| IOT216 |	And so when you're looking at an average policy of $1,000
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:28,895	| IOT216 |	Any device has several hundred
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:30,175	| IOT216 |	The cost
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:33,503	| IOT216 |	Justification doesn't make sense to make sense over 10 years
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:35,551	| IOT216 |	But those carriers are not sure how long this
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:37,343	| IOT216 |	Consumers are going to stay in the retention
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:38,111	| IOT216 |	Which one aspect
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:40,159	| IOT216 |	The second is that
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,439	| IOT216 |	There's also rebating laws
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:48,351	| IOT216 |	Which limit how much an insurer can provide to a customer for free so that they giving them a device
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:51,935	| IOT216 |	Because in many states that maximum is up to $25 per year
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:54,495	| IOT216 |	So that's a bit very small
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:57,823	| IOT216 |	The minimum amount and thirdly it sounded deicide
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:44:00,639	| IOT216 |	ISO general insurers of risk-averse company
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:02,431	| IOT216 |	And they want to validate
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:03,455	| IOT216 |	That an increase
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:04,991	| IOT216 |	Discount is warranted
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:09,087	| IOT216 |	And how they would do that is on average they look for a thousand coins
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:13,183	| IOT216 |	But if you think about that a new technology
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:14,207	| IOT216 |	It's going to take decades
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:15,231	| IOT216 |	To be able to validate
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:19,839	| IOT216 |	ISO a progressive carrier it's going to be one that is going to look at the indication
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:23,423	| IOT216 |	Who sang if I can turn the water off in someone's house
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:25,215	| IOT216 |	What's when an incident happens
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:26,239	| IOT216 |	Before that happened
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:31,359	| IOT216 |	That's going to be materials bathing that's going to be 75 90% reduction in the water lost cause
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:33,407	| IOT216 |	And so that's where
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:36,991	| IOT216 |	You know we're working with great partners and in doing
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:38,783	| IOT216 |	In discussions of
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:40,063	| IOT216 |	Of how we can
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:43,135	| IOT216 |	Strengthen what the carrier could do from A Loss Prevention side
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:49,791	| IOT216 |	That makes sense now what about some of the legal implications or the liability implications
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:52,095	| IOT216 |	Associated with like remotely turning off the water
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:53,887	| IOT216 |	Or maybe it's
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:54,911	| IOT216 |	Remotely
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:57,983	| IOT216 |	Doing something else based on a smart device in the
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:01,311	| IOT216 |	And I'm trying to come up with a really awesome
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:03,871	| IOT216 |	Example and I'm really having a hard time but
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:10,271	| IOT216 |	Like maybe there's a fire in the hole man someone's trying to like cool things down by turning on all the shower heads
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:13,087	| IOT216 |	And fins like there's a leak
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:15,135	| IOT216 |	And turns off the water that could be a problem
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:16,415	| IOT216 |	I know this is a really random
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:17,439	| IOT216 |	But
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:19,231	| IOT216 |	Sure that insurance
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:19,999	| IOT216 |	Companies are thick
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:20,767	| IOT216 |	Talking about
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:21,535	| IOT216 |	Liability
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:22,815	| IOT216 |	Remotely control
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:23,839	| IOT216 |	Things in people's homes
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:25,887	| IOT216 |	We haven't gotten concerns
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:27,167	| IOT216 |	From from that aspect
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:28,191	| IOT216 |	Find the carrier from the
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:28,703	| IOT216 |	Consumer yes
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:30,751	| IOT216 |	Concern on
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:34,847	| IOT216 |	Am I going to be in the shower and you know his grandma going to be in the shower and the water's going
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:36,895	| IOT216 |	Turn off I don't want the device to do that
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:39,199	| IOT216 |	And that's where it gets to be for fan
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:41,503	| IOT216 |	Two key principles that they fight for us in
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:44,063	| IOT216 |	Chords to what we do is one is that the
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:44,831	| IOT216 |	The hardware
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:45,855	| IOT216 |	The solid Construction
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:52,255	| IOT216 |	Is it something that it's not just your main water line so we want something that's very durable and is maintenance-free for the?
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:57,375	| IOT216 |	And into is on a dating site so really important to be able to understand the difference between
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:58,399	| IOT216 |	A shower
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:00,191	| IOT216 |	A regular shower and a leak
EDL	00:46:00,191	00:46:01,727	| IOT216 |	A pipe is burst
EDL	00:46:01,727	00:46:03,263	| IOT216 |	And so then I tried technology
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:06,335	| IOT216 |	Play where we are not only just measuring flow switch
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:08,383	| IOT216 |	Next one meter
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:09,919	| IOT216 |	But we also measure
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:10,431	| IOT216 |	Pressure
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:12,991	| IOT216 |	And so every device but every picture that you
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:15,295	| IOT216 |	Having your house as a different signature
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:18,367	| IOT216 |	If you can imagine when a toilet flapper goes up and it goes down
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:19,135	| IOT216 |	Steph Curry
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:19,903	| IOT216 |	A wave
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:21,951	| IOT216 |	Pattern in your water in your pipe
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:23,487	| IOT216 |	And I can tell us the difference
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:24,767	| IOT216 |	Search between a toilet
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:26,303	| IOT216 |	Extinct a faucet
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:26,815	| IOT216 |	Analy
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:28,351	| IOT216 |	And so
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:30,399	| IOT216 |	Always we put this in the hands of the
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:35,519	| IOT216 |	Consumer where we don't automatically fin would never automatically turn off your system your home
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:37,823	| IOT216 |	This is not something that you have passed
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:38,591	| IOT216 |	To you
EDL	00:46:38,591	00:46:41,663	| IOT216 |	Auto shut-off capabilities enabled by the homeowner
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:44,479	| IOT216 |	And then also when there is an alert
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:46,015	| IOT216 |	The consumer does receive
EDL	00:46:46,015	00:46:47,807	| IOT216 |	Is a text message and a push notification
EDL	00:46:47,807	00:46:50,111	| IOT216 |	Navigation before the water is shut off as well
EDL	00:46:50,111	00:46:52,927	| IOT216 |	And then once the water shut off there's also notification
EDL	00:46:52,927	00:46:54,975	| IOT216 |	We are very respectful of what
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:56,511	| IOT216 |	Customer wants to do
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:46:59,839	| IOT216 |	And also in informing them of what has happened
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:02,143	| IOT216 |	And what they may want to do as an extra
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:04,191	| IOT216 |	Got it
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:04,703	| IOT216 |	Okay
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:08,799	| IOT216 |	Let's talk about the insurance landscape from the perspective of
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:12,127	| IOT216 |	Data and new entrants into the market
EDL	00:47:12,127	00:47:14,431	| IOT216 |	Because when I see those Accenture Deloitte
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:15,455	| IOT216 |	Intertek
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:20,319	| IOT216 |	Reports that constantly harping on the fact that Google or Amazon
EDL	00:47:20,319	00:47:22,367	| IOT216 |	Come in with their smart home data
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:24,927	| IOT216 |	And basically offer competitive products
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:27,999	| IOT216 |	And I'm very curious from someone at a startup
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:30,559	| IOT216 |	And from someone who's worked in the insurance business
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:35,935	| IOT216 |	How do you view this idea of the big tech companies using all the data that they have to come into this Ma
EDL	00:47:36,959	00:47:38,239	| IOT216 |	I think there's a real advantage
EDL	00:47:39,519	00:47:45,663	| IOT216 |	It's two things one is that the insurance industry in and of itself is not a high-margin business so that's one of the challenges
EDL	00:47:46,943	00:47:48,223	| IOT216 |	Weather attack on
EDL	00:47:48,223	00:47:49,247	| IOT216 |	When you want to
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:51,295	| IOT216 |	Go into it themselves or not
EDL	00:47:51,295	00:47:52,063	| IOT216 |	To be crushed
EDL	00:47:52,063	00:47:54,111	| IOT216 |	Is there room for disruption absolute
EDL	00:47:54,623	00:47:57,695	| IOT216 |	And that's what you're seeing with new startups where they're just really
EDL	00:47:57,695	00:47:58,719	| IOT216 |	Changing the process
EDL	00:47:58,719	00:48:02,303	| IOT216 |	Instead of having something a policy being written taking
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:08,703	| IOT216 |	You you're signing up for a policy and in a legacy some that might take 30 minutes a new startup is doing that in 3 minutes
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:09,471	| IOT216 |	5 minutes
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:14,335	| IOT216 |	How are they doing that they're taking advantage of a lot of data that exist and they're also using
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:20,735	| IOT216 |	Other data sources to be able to validate what that loss ratio is if we just think about it
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:25,855	| IOT216 |	That is going to spend 699 on a water detection on a water shut-off device is offend
EDL	00:48:25,855	00:48:28,927	| IOT216 |	I'm installing it in the house is a customer that on
EDL	00:48:28,927	00:48:29,951	| IOT216 |	Their first blush
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:36,863	| IOT216 |	There a customer that cares about their house they don't want to have damaged their more engage this is an indicator of a better policy
EDL	00:48:36,863	00:48:39,167	| IOT216 |	Older than your average book of business
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:44,543	| IOT216 |	And so these kinds of things are indicators for what a carrier could look at in the
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:47,359	| IOT216 |	Future and certainly by having the data
EDL	00:48:47,359	00:48:49,919	| IOT216 |	A purchasing behavior of understanding
EDL	00:48:49,919	00:48:55,295	| IOT216 |	Alerts of understanding what types of devices they have changes the risk profile potentially
EDL	00:48:55,807	00:48:58,879	| IOT216 |	And so I think that's a company that has the most data will win
EDL	00:48:58,879	00:49:00,927	| IOT216 |	The company that knows how to use that data
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:01,695	| IOT216 |	Will be the winner
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:06,815	| IOT216 |	And what about our current legislation around privacy and data use
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:12,447	| IOT216 |	People are very concerned about how insurers may take their data and charge them more
EDL	00:49:12,959	00:49:14,495	| IOT216 |	Or less based on new facts
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:15,775	| IOT216 |	Basically
EDL	00:49:15,775	00:49:17,311	| IOT216 |	Honestly that's what insurance
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:18,335	| IOT216 |	What's is its
EDL	00:49:18,335	00:49:20,383	| IOT216 |	If you would behave in a risky manner
EDL	00:49:20,383	00:49:21,151	| IOT216 |	You should
EDL	00:49:21,151	00:49:22,175	| IOT216 |	Pay extra for it
EDL	00:49:22,175	00:49:23,711	| IOT216 |	But people are like
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:26,015	| IOT216 |	I used to know how insurance Price there in
EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:29,087	| IOT216 |	Prince now I'm like oh they have so many more options
EDL	00:49:29,599	00:49:33,183	| IOT216 |	I guess how do you think about that and how that may change the relationship
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:34,975	| IOT216 |	Laws that are out there
EDL	00:49:35,487	00:49:36,767	| IOT216 |	Ice cream bed
EDL	00:49:36,767	00:49:38,559	| IOT216 |	Data absolutely
EDL	00:49:38,559	00:49:41,119	| IOT216 |	Is very important than privacy is data
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:45,727	| IOT216 |	Are we take very seriously it's been a couple of things important
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:49,567	| IOT216 |	Carrier one is that the data needs to be accurate and consistent
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:50,591	| IOT216 |	Across the devices
EDL	00:49:50,591	00:49:51,871	| IOT216 |	So that's where the
EDL	00:49:51,871	00:49:52,639	| IOT216 |	Hardware
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:58,527	| IOT216 |	Discussion becomes important because the accuracy between one device and another device should be very similar
EDL	00:49:58,527	00:50:02,367	| IOT216 |	So that you understand that your data set is producing the right kind of data
EDL	00:50:02,367	00:50:03,135	| IOT216 |	Inside
EDL	00:50:03,135	00:50:04,671	| IOT216 |	To be able to Warrant a result
EDL	00:50:05,183	00:50:06,975	| IOT216 |	So once you get those thousand
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:07,743	| IOT216 |	Clean
EDL	00:50:07,743	00:50:10,047	| IOT216 |	Then I can use that from an Actuarial perspective
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:13,375	| IOT216 |	So let's work they want to start using that data
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:19,775	| IOT216 |	Potentially and also to be able to understand okay how much of a loss difference is there if someone has one of these.
EDL	00:50:19,775	00:50:21,823	| IOT216 |	Spices do they ever file a claim
EDL	00:50:21,823	00:50:23,615	| IOT216 |	Do they file other claims
EDL	00:50:23,615	00:50:28,223	| IOT216 |	Is water an indication of the riskiness of that household other inside statue
EDL	00:50:28,223	00:50:28,735	| IOT216 |	Wicked Game
EDL	00:50:29,247	00:50:32,319	| IOT216 |	No you'd have to insure has to get that data from a cut
EDL	00:50:33,087	00:50:35,135	| IOT216 |	And it can only get that with consent for the cusp
EDL	00:50:35,903	00:50:39,743	| IOT216 |	And so in order to get consent from the customer the customer has to
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:41,535	| IOT216 |	See the value that they Co
EDL	00:50:41,535	00:50:43,071	| IOT216 |	Is worthwhile
EDL	00:50:43,071	00:50:48,959	| IOT216 |	For the data that they're giving out they might they will who's ever going to do that though it's similar to when you first started seeing telematics
EDL	00:50:48,959	00:50:55,359	| IOT216 |	So this is when and Progressive was the first to do this to their program stop shop where you put a little OBD device it's been on
EDL	00:50:55,359	00:50:57,663	| IOT216 |	Onboard diagnostic device
EDL	00:50:57,663	00:50:59,199	| IOT216 |	Provided Data Insights on how the
EDL	00:51:00,223	00:51:01,503	| IOT216 |	And they received it this
EDL	00:51:01,503	00:51:06,623	| IOT216 |	Count in any industry moved into that we're now most carriers have some sort of telematics program
EDL	00:51:06,623	00:51:09,439	| IOT216 |	And what they do is they will offer a discount
EDL	00:51:09,439	00:51:15,839	| IOT216 |	And it is based on sharing the data so what you could see is that in the future now you're just receiving a blind
EDL	00:51:15,839	00:51:20,959	| IOT216 |	Discount on having one of these devices but in the future could be that you would receive a tiered discount
EDL	00:51:20,959	00:51:22,239	| IOT216 |	Perhaps higher
EDL	00:51:22,239	00:51:23,263	| IOT216 |	Significantly higher
EDL	00:51:23,263	00:51:24,799	| IOT216 |	By providing that data
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:26,847	| IOT216 |	And so for some consumers then that's
EDL	00:51:26,847	00:51:29,919	| IOT216 |	Going to be the triggers what they'll say you know what I'm I'm a good rest
EDL	00:51:29,919	00:51:31,455	| IOT216 |	And I should not be paying
EDL	00:51:31,455	00:51:32,223	| IOT216 |	This much
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:35,295	| IOT216 |	Premium because I'm off setting someone who's a bad risk
EDL	00:51:35,295	00:51:40,927	| IOT216 |	And I'm a good rest so then I want the discount and I'm okay to share that data and I think that's where you're going to start
EDL	00:51:40,927	00:51:41,951	| IOT216 |	To see that s***
EDL	00:51:41,951	00:51:44,511	| IOT216 |	We're consumers are going to be okay with sharing
EDL	00:51:44,511	00:51:45,791	| IOT216 |	Yeah I can see it
EDL	00:51:45,791	00:51:48,607	| IOT216 |	You know it might be really interesting if I purchased a fin
EDL	00:51:49,375	00:51:51,679	| IOT216 |	And if I could say to myself
EDL	00:51:51,679	00:51:58,079	| IOT216 |	Well I own this data and now I can offer that data through any sort of API ports to my
EDL	00:51:58,079	00:51:59,871	| IOT216 |	Insurance Company
EDL	00:51:59,871	00:52:01,663	| IOT216 |	And they will provide me possibly it
EDL	00:52:02,175	00:52:07,039	| IOT216 |	Tell her they will be like yes we will fight for your business I would love to see them did for my business based on my
EDL	00:52:07,551	00:52:08,575	| IOT216 |	My device data from
EDL	00:52:09,855	00:52:10,367	| IOT216 |	Is that crazy
EDL	00:52:10,879	00:52:12,159	| IOT216 |	No I think that's
EDL	00:52:12,159	00:52:13,183	| IOT216 |	Exactly where it needs
EDL	00:52:13,183	00:52:16,511	| IOT216 |	To go I think that you're you're the perfect example you have
EDL	00:52:16,511	00:52:17,535	| IOT216 |	You have so many
EDL	00:52:17,535	00:52:19,071	| IOT216 |	Devices but you're very connect
EDL	00:52:19,071	00:52:20,863	| IOT216 |	Is your ear connected to your home
EDL	00:52:20,863	00:52:22,911	| IOT216 |	Tuesday that's coming into your home
EDL	00:52:22,911	00:52:27,263	| IOT216 |	Which means that you are much much better risk for loss is not to happen in Euro
EDL	00:52:28,031	00:52:28,799	| IOT216 |	Because you're so connect
EDL	00:52:29,567	00:52:34,687	| IOT216 |	And because of that and because you've invested in your home and you put these devices in and you're monitoring them
EDL	00:52:34,687	00:52:35,711	| IOT216 |	Because you're a better risk
EDL	00:52:36,223	00:52:37,247	| IOT216 |	You should learn better this
EDL	00:52:37,759	00:52:40,831	| IOT216 |	Until I seen that what you're going to start to see carriers
EDL	00:52:40,831	00:52:42,879	| IOT216 |	So what's going to happen
EDL	00:52:43,647	00:52:46,975	| IOT216 |	And when you look at some carriers were there 50% Auto V
EDL	00:52:46,975	00:52:47,487	| IOT216 |	80% home
EDL	00:52:47,999	00:52:49,535	| IOT216 |	And you look way down the road
EDL	00:52:50,559	00:52:52,095	| IOT216 |	Shorter some say longer
EDL	00:52:52,095	00:52:53,887	| IOT216 |	Whenever it is it will happen
EDL	00:52:53,887	00:52:55,167	| IOT216 |	When it's on his cars
EDL	00:52:55,167	00:52:55,679	| IOT216 |	Come into play
EDL	00:52:56,191	00:52:57,471	| IOT216 |	The personalized
EDL	00:52:57,471	00:53:00,287	| IOT216 |	Auto premium as it is today goes away
EDL	00:53:00,287	00:53:06,175	| IOT216 |	That becomes a commercial policy the risk profile changes because now it's more product liability
EDL	00:53:06,175	00:53:08,735	| IOT216 |	So that premium has to be replaced with something
EDL	00:53:09,247	00:53:10,527	| IOT216 |	What is that something
EDL	00:53:10,527	00:53:15,903	| IOT216 |	You know that the home that's going to continue to be there and you're going to continue to have these smart devices
EDL	00:53:15,903	00:53:16,927	| IOT216 |	And more and more data
EDL	00:53:16,927	00:53:17,695	| IOT216 |	Soap
EDL	00:53:17,695	00:53:19,231	| IOT216 |	Where Progressive carriers
EDL	00:53:19,231	00:53:19,743	| IOT216 |	Are looking
EDL	00:53:20,767	00:53:22,559	| IOT216 |	Is to be not only there when
EDL	00:53:22,559	00:53:25,631	| IOT216 |	Claim happened and be there at the back end
EDL	00:53:25,631	00:53:26,911	| IOT216 |	To repair the home
EDL	00:53:26,911	00:53:29,727	| IOT216 |	But they're looking at how did they come in in the front end
EDL	00:53:29,727	00:53:31,263	| IOT216 |	Mdproactive
EDL	00:53:31,263	00:53:32,031	| IOT216 |	And health Act
EDL	00:53:32,031	00:53:34,079	| IOT216 |	Consumer before that clean even happen
EDL	00:53:34,591	00:53:37,919	| IOT216 |	And create a halo effect in just shifting but dynamic
EDL	00:53:37,919	00:53:39,711	| IOT216 |	A between an insurer and a consumer
EDL	00:53:40,991	00:53:42,015	| IOT216 |	Awesome I will look forward to that day
EDL	00:53:42,527	00:53:48,927	| IOT216 |	I think it's coming I think that there are some carriers that are really looking at it I think also the challenge with some Legacy
EDL	00:53:48,927	00:53:55,327	| IOT216 |	Companies is that they have very large books of business so in order to put one of these devices and then every one of those days
EDL	00:53:55,327	00:53:55,839	| IOT216 |	Nursing home
EDL	00:53:56,351	00:53:57,887	| IOT216 |	Is a massive Capital dream
EDL	00:53:57,887	00:54:02,751	| IOT216 |	And so some of the startups they have a real Advantage by being able to
EDL	00:54:02,751	00:54:05,567	| IOT216 |	Implement this new technology as their book Rose
EDL	00:54:06,079	00:54:07,871	| IOT216 |	Because the benefits are not
EDL	00:54:07,871	00:54:12,223	| IOT216 |	Not necessarily in your 1-year to it's in your 3 for pain
EDL	00:54:12,735	00:54:15,551	| IOT216 |	And so that's where you start to really see the benefits ended
EDL	00:54:15,551	00:54:19,647	| IOT216 |	Going to be a material Improvement for the book of business and their loss ratios for sure
EDL	00:54:20,415	00:54:23,487	| IOT216 |	Excellent all right we'll Muriel I feel smarter both about
EDL	00:54:23,487	00:54:25,535	| IOT216 |	What's going on with Finn and
EDL	00:54:25,535	00:54:29,631	| IOT216 |	How I might get to a better Insurance World thanks to all of my smart room Gadget
