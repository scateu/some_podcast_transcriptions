EDL	00:00:07,680	00:00:13,824	| IOT022 |	Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast which this week will be held on a construction site

EDL	00:00:23,296	00:00:24,320	| IOT022 |	You're not under attack
EDL	00:00:24,832	00:00:28,672	| IOT022 |	I thought maybe you were at the Target near the Metreon and they're expanding the IRT store
EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:32,256	| IOT022 |	Or maybe it's Apple getting ready to build their own smart home next door
EDL	00:00:34,048	00:00:36,608	| IOT022 |	That's not happening y'all that was not an official sanction a rumor
EDL	00:00:38,400	00:00:39,424	| IOT022 |	Okay so
EDL	00:00:40,192	00:00:41,728	| IOT022 |	Got you all excited

EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:48,128	| IOT022 |	Google onhub router reviews or should we start with
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:50,176	| IOT022 |	New thermostat
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:51,456	| IOT022 |	Take your pic
EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:58,624	| IOT022 |	What's up with Nest cuz you got the information I don't really know what's going on with Nest other than I saw hints of an FCC
EDL	00:00:58,624	00:00:59,392	| IOT022 |	Filing that
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:00,160	| IOT022 |	Eluded
EDL	00:01:00,160	00:01:01,952	| IOT022 |	To a new Nest Thermostat
EDL	00:01:01,952	00:01:06,560	| IOT022 |	Is that the real deal
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:08,352	| IOT022 |	New 3rd generation
EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:09,376	| IOT022 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:11,168	| IOT022 |	Is a Slimmer profile
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:15,008	| IOT022 |	And a 40% larger high-resolution screen
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:17,056	| IOT022 |	It's party
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:19,872	| IOT022 |	And now my nose looks bulky and ugly
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:24,736	| IOT022 |	Dang it
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:26,784	| IOT022 |	I will not
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:27,552	| IOT022 |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:28,832	| IOT022 |	I don't know if they can hear me
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:30,368	| IOT022 |	If it can
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:31,904	| IOT022 |	I'm going to be prepared for
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:34,208	| IOT022 |	I don't know either too warm or too cold sleeping tonight
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:36,256	| IOT022 |	This is what happens when you have to
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:38,560	| IOT022 |	Can the smart things in your house
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:40,352	| IOT022 |	So it's got new features
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:41,888	| IOT022 |	Including
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:43,168	| IOT022 |	They are calling this one
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:45,472	| IOT022 |	Farsight it automatically displays the
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:46,752	| IOT022 |	Target temperature
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:49,056	| IOT022 |	And the time when it senses movement in the room
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,848	| IOT022 |	And I'm not sure
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:52,640	| IOT022 |	What that means exactly
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:54,432	| IOT022 |	Oh I can tell you okay you tell me
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:58,016	| IOT022 |	I don't have this but I can tell you that my Nest has nearsighted meaning
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:02:01,088	| IOT022 |	You have to be back within two to three feet of it
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:01,856	| IOT022 |	Ford
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:05,440	| IOT022 |	The screen to actually open up and display show you the temp in Saint sauveur
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:07,744	| IOT022 |	So far sight sounds to me like
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:11,840	| IOT022 |	You can like you know being further away from it and the
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:13,632	| IOT022 |	The screen will actually light up
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:17,216	| IOT022 |	This explains also for people who heard
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:19,520	| IOT022 |	Probably a couple weeks or maybe a month ago
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,312	| IOT022 |	The Apple Store was
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:25,920	| IOT022 |	Seen getting rid of its nest thermostats and everyone's like
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:27,200	| IOT022 |	Spirits
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,736	| IOT022 |	Google owns Nest Apple Altamonte
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:29,760	| IOT022 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:34,368	| IOT022 |	With apple putting out yunnan pushing homekit what is this mean
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:39,488	| IOT022 |	But really what it meant was that they were clearing inventory the old inventory so
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:41,536	| IOT022 |	When the new Nest came out you could buy
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:43,328	| IOT022 |	Fresh new Destiny you wouldn't buy one
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,376	| IOT022 |	Today
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:45,888	| IOT022 |	Right before they

EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:52,032	| IOT022 |	Now for 249 the same price as the original nest
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,312	| IOT022 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:55,616	| IOT022 |	As of the time this podcast will Air
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,152	| IOT022 |	This is available now

EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:10,464	| IOT022 |	Target Verizon Wireless and the retail price is 249
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:14,560	| IOT022 |	Aren't you tell him
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:20,704	| IOT022 |	Thank you don't want this better display you can save yourself fifty bucks because they're going to
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:22,752	| IOT022 |	Discount for 2nd generation Nest
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:26,848	| IOT022 |	That's like retailers for 199a suggested retail price money to find a cheaper
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,640	| IOT022 |	So there you have it
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:33,760	| IOT022 |	Yeah so that's that's the new Nest news very exciting for everyone who
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:35,040	| IOT022 |	Lexi's nest
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,600	| IOT022 |	Anything else we should know
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:40,928	| IOT022 |	I do people care about how many pixels per inch are on their nest
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:42,720	| IOT022 |	229
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:43,488	| IOT022 |	But now they don't
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:47,584	| IOT022 |	That's why I know the new one has 229
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,608	| IOT022 |	Pixels per inch
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,120	| IOT022 |	Is
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,168	| IOT022 |	I wouldn't call it
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:55,776	| IOT022 |	Comprable to the retina displays and such on iPhones and similar devices but it's pretty darn good
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:58,336	| IOT022 |	More than the second
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,360	| IOT022 |	Generation X
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:01,152	| IOT022 |	If you go
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:03,456	| IOT022 |	Again to me I'm like am I watching
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:03,968	| IOT022 |	YouTube I mean
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:08,832	| IOT022 |	No no no I don't think and I would not recommend
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:11,392	| IOT022 |	That most people who currently have a nest
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:13,440	| IOT022 |	Upgrade to the new one I don't see the point
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:16,000	| IOT022 |	I don't either unless you're like
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:19,583	| IOT022 |	Your thermostat has something you're continually running into and the fact
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:20,351	| IOT022 |	But this is slimmer
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,655	| IOT022 |	Be compelling but
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:24,959	| IOT022 |	I Don't Think It's $249
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:27,775	| IOT022 |	If you're really running into your nest
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,311	| IOT022 |	Currently a lot in your house
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:32,127	| IOT022 |	I would just save your money and buy their house because
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:36,479	| IOT022 |	I can see by some glasses or stop drinking quite so much during the day
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,343	| IOT022 |	Your kind
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,647	| IOT022 |	So that's the new nest
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,183	| IOT022 |	Exciting
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:45,951	| IOT022 |	And
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:46,719	| IOT022 |	That's yes
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:51,583	| IOT022 |	Was it last week that we talked about the onhub router from Google it was tired last night
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:53,631	| IOT022 |	Oh see this
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,655	| IOT022 |	This maybe be drinking
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:56,703	| IOT022 |	Can too much during the day cuz I don't even remember
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:02,847	| IOT022 |	Because I am so excited
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,383	| IOT022 |	And this router
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:08,223	| IOT022 |	Is Google's router and it has weed inside
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:11,295	| IOT022 |	Which is Google's kind of protocol for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,575	| IOT022 |	It also has
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,087	| IOT022 |	Red
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:16,415	| IOT022 |	It supports thread we should say which is
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,951	| IOT022 |	Wireless radio
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:21,279	| IOT022 |	Nest Samsung and several other semiconductor
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,047	| IOT022 |	Companies are pushing
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,607	| IOT022 |	As an alternative mesh Network
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:25,887	| IOT022 |	2
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,167	| IOT022 |	Zippy
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:27,679	| IOT022 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:33,567	| IOT022 |	So what we have here are
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,359	| IOT022 |	The reviews are out
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:38,175	| IOT022 |	And actually today today is the day guys
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,967	| IOT022 |	I feel like a dr. Seuss book today's
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:42,783	| IOT022 |	The day you're on your way go to the store
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,807	| IOT022 |	And by 1 today
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:47,135	| IOT022 |	You can actually buy Google onhub router
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:47,903	| IOT022 |	Yes
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:48,415	| IOT022 |	Today
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:51,999	| IOT022 |	At many locations including the Google Store Walmart
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,023	| IOT022 |	And
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:54,303	| IOT022 |	Amazon I believe
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:58,655	| IOT022 |	199 and I was interested in buying one
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:03,519	| IOT022 |	Because I do have while I do have an 8:00 or 2:11.
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:06,591	| IOT022 |	11 AC router that I bought
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:09,151	| IOT022 |	Timbuktu years ago
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,431	| IOT022 |	AC
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:14,271	| IOT022 |	66 you and I know they've upgraded at once already to the 68 you
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:21,439	| IOT022 |	It's been great for me except the routers in one corner of the house on the second floor and in the opposite corner on the first floor I've got a
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,719	| IOT022 |	4K TV
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:24,767	| IOT022 |	Sketchy with signal
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,047	| IOT022 |	So I thought about it
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:27,839	| IOT022 |	And then I read the reviews
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,375	| IOT022 |	And I'm not thinking about it anymore
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:29,887	| IOT022 |	Because
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:32,447	| IOT022 |	I would say they're generally
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:34,495	| IOT022 |	In agreement that it's not that spec
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:36,543	| IOT022 |	Angular the only one I read that was
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:40,383	| IOT022 |	It was with the verge
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:42,687	| IOT022 |	It works really well in his house he
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,735	| IOT022 |	Router issues in his house
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,807	| IOT022 |	That's great I'm happy for Dad
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,343	| IOT022 |	But
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:51,135	| IOT022 |	Ron Amato guitarist
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:57,279	| IOT022 |	But if you're interested in the actual graphs and charts of actual test of this router versus many others that are out there
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:59,583	| IOT022 |	At similar price points are even less
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,399	| IOT022 |	You can see by the throughput and signal strength this is not up to
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:06,751	| IOT022 |	So that the big thing here is yes it makes it easy to
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:08,543	| IOT022 |	Set up because it comes with that
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:10,079	| IOT022 |	Software the on software
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,359	| IOT022 |	What
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:16,479	| IOT022 |	ARS Technica is testing worries ma'am and it just doesn't seem like it's going to solve any of my
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,247	| IOT022 |	Current problem
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:21,343	| IOT022 |	Then there's the other thing you've using the back of this thing right
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:21,855	| IOT022 |	I have
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:23,903	| IOT022 |	I will get there
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,999	| IOT022 |	They are lovely pictures however
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:30,559	| IOT022 |	The picture show that there is a definite
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,327	| IOT022 |	Black ports
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:37,471	| IOT022 |	Is there is one USB port that is basically useless right now if you can't connect to
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:39,263	| IOT022 |	Hard drive to router near the storage
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:40,799	| IOT022 |	There is
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,335	| IOT022 |	S1 internet port
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,871	| IOT022 |	On the back of it
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:44,383	| IOT022 |	And that's
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:50,527	| IOT022 |	And then while I appreciate that this looks nice and you could put this anywhere in your house and they want you to I want you to put in the middle of your house
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,831	| IOT022 |	Most people don't have their
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,599	| IOT022 |	ISP
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:54,879	| IOT022 |	Hardware
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,671	| IOT022 |	Wiring coming through the middle of their house
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:08:02,047	| IOT022 |	So you're still got to stick this somewhere in a corner of your house probably for most people
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:05,119	| IOT022 |	What else is on the back of that thing I'm looking for my pictures now
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:06,911	| IOT022 |	There is there's one additional
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:10,239	| IOT022 |	Port one Additionally the airport
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:15,871	| IOT022 |	So that brings it to okay Stacy you got X number of hugs here that all to connect to your router.
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,943	| IOT022 |	Or you have to buy it
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:19,967	| IOT022 |	Start Me Up
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,991	| IOT022 |	Switch right
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,039	| IOT022 |	And I actually so i a
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:28,159	| IOT022 |	We already have a switch plugged into my router Plus
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:31,487	| IOT022 |	Four ports
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:31,999	| IOT022 |	Send my router
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:34,815	| IOT022 |	And they're actually already taken up and I have
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,327	| IOT022 |	Switch
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:36,863	| IOT022 |	With
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,143	| IOT022 |	For additional ports
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,935	| IOT022 |	And those are
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:43,007	| IOT022 |	So you're an edge case I'm
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:48,639	| IOT022 |	Not quite that edge but I manage case as well
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,175	| IOT022 |	Your you're done
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,943	| IOT022 |	You have nothing
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,711	| IOT022 |	You have nothing
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,271	| IOT022 |	No help for you
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:57,599	| IOT022 |	You have to do the whole switching thing in that takes away from the
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,879	| IOT022 |	Simplicity
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:03,743	| IOT022 |	It's clear that Google has
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,791	| IOT022 |	High aspirations for this because this has a
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:10,399	| IOT022 |	Say relatively high-end smartphone processor inside from Qualcomm
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,167	| IOT022 |	It's got
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:15,775	| IOT022 |	A gig of RAM it's got 4 gigs of storage and I guarantee that is not all four
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,567	| IOT022 |	You know that the song
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,103	| IOT022 |	They're going to do something more with
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:19,871	| IOT022 |	Best we know that
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:25,247	| IOT022 |	But you can't do anymore with it just yet and what I want to do with it I really can't
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,039	| IOT022 |	Here's what
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:28,319	| IOT022 |	I didn't see a lot of
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,599	| IOT022 |	What's up
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:32,671	| IOT022 |	I didn't see great things on the software side of
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:33,951	| IOT022 |	Sinner reviews
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:37,535	| IOT022 |	A lot of things I don't like this was kind of a missing issue
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:39,839	| IOT022 |	Did you end I only saw so I
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:43,679	| IOT022 |	I read the verge's review I didn't spend a lot of time with ours
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,447	| IOT022 |	Ours is
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:44,959	| IOT022 |	Sweetie
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:47,519	| IOT022 |	Did you see that any coverage of like
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:51,359	| IOT022 |	I did and basically they said
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:54,943	| IOT022 |	It seemed towards Simplicity and the non power user
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:59,551	| IOT022 |	So you know for us you may have to go in and change the NAT tables or
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:01,855	| IOT022 |	You know Pocahontas firewall and so on
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,671	| IOT022 |	I don't know how much we can do here
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:07,487	| IOT022 |	I'm taking less nap tables and firewalls in Moore
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:10,815	| IOT022 |	When I think about a router today in the home
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:13,887	| IOT022 |	I think about a router from list
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:15,679	| IOT022 |	10 years ago in
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,191	| IOT022 |	A corporate Network
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:19,519	| IOT022 |	So as a parent I want to be able
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:21,055	| IOT022 |	Not just as a parent but is like
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:25,663	| IOT022 |	Connect network administrator of my home even though I don't think of myself that way
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,687	| IOT022 |	I want to be able to come
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,711	| IOT022 |	Control access to
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,223	| IOT022 |	Add devices
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:34,879	| IOT022 |	I want a software interface that lets me turn off my daughter's Kindle or computer at 8 at night
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:41,535	| IOT022 |	Yeah and as I look through the many many screenshots I know ours has a bunch I know
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:42,815	| IOT022 |	Some others do as well
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,119	| IOT022 |	I don't see any weight
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:48,959	| IOT022 |	You can prioritize Wifi traffic to a particular device
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:53,823	| IOT022 |	And it does capture the device names and the uploads and downloads
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:54,847	| IOT022 |	Of data over the past
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:57,919	| IOT022 |	7 days 30 days whatever so you can see
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:59,199	| IOT022 |	Historical usage
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:02,527	| IOT022 |	Do I see any
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,063	| IOT022 |	I don't see any
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,855	| IOT022 |	Setting such as that
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,671	| IOT022 |	There's just DNS and wins settings there's
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:10,719	| IOT022 |	Cloud services and usage stats
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,279	| IOT022 |	What's a good I mean
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:16,351	| IOT022 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,399	| IOT022 |	I think that's really
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:21,727	| IOT022 |	Important to have that kind of clearly defined
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:26,335	| IOT022 |	Ability to control devices and I also think
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:28,895	| IOT022 |	As iot becomes
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,711	| IOT022 |	The router is a great place to
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:33,247	| IOT022 |	Control a lot of devices
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:34,783	| IOT022 |	Like
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:36,319	| IOT022 |	Especially things like gas.
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:37,343	| IOT022 |	Access
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,647	| IOT022 |	That's up where we be great to be like
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:40,671	| IOT022 |	Hey
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:44,255	| IOT022 |	Sure like the five devices I want my guests
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,023	| IOT022 |	Where am I
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:45,791	| IOT022 |	Kids to be able to
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,839	| IOT022 |	I don't actually want my
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:50,143	| IOT022 |	Especially as my daughter gets older
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,191	| IOT022 |	Maybe I don't want her to be able to
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:52,959	| IOT022 |	Control the nest
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:53,471	| IOT022 |	Because you know
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,263	| IOT022 |	I know when I was a kid
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,287	| IOT022 |	You know I always wanted
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:12:00,895	| IOT022 |	Turn my air conditioning down to like 70 in the summer
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,455	| IOT022 |	And that never met her
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,991	| IOT022 |	Talk to me you know so I was just
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,015	| IOT022 |	You know Crank It Down
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,039	| IOT022 |	Going to be like
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:09,599	| IOT022 |	Battlerite
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:19,327	| IOT022 |	You know I'm going based on the reviews I don't have it a unit here right again I thought about buying it but I'm already heading towards not
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,351	| IOT022 |	Waiting to see
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:27,007	| IOT022 |	What they admit you know cuz I again nobody's mentioned any setting and as I look to the screenshots and it's pretty expensive
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:29,311	| IOT022 |	Bunch of screenshots of the software
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:32,383	| IOT022 |	On hard I don't see what it is that you're looking for
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,175	| IOT022 |	And I think it does need to be there
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:36,991	| IOT022 |	It almost seems to me like they got this thing out there
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:39,551	| IOT022 |	It's a lot of potential
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:46,463	| IOT022 |	The capabilities
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:49,791	| IOT022 |	No Doubt
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:52,351	| IOT022 |	And it looks it looks very kind of
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:54,399	| IOT022 |	Programmable kind of like an egg
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:55,679	| IOT022 |	What kind of a
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:57,471	| IOT022 |	We kind of way to program
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,775	| IOT022 |	So
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,567	| IOT022 |	I'm actually considering buying
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,615	| IOT022 |	Although I would say for your problems
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,407	| IOT022 |	Have you considered an access point
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:10,783	| IOT022 |	I actually do have two additional extenders range extender as access point in such so yes
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:18,719	| IOT022 |	Yeah I know I mean I'm not I'm not sucking wind in that that room is just it's not as consistent as I would like because I'm sharing this again
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,487	| IOT022 |	Pushing it
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,535	| IOT022 |	No further further access points
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,095	| IOT022 |	That is not ideal
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:26,655	| IOT022 |	I just want something more stable
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:29,983	| IOT022 |	But that's just me you also mentioned
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,007	| IOT022 |	Ziggy
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:35,103	| IOT022 |	You did it because this does
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,151	| IOT022 |	Work with zigbee
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:37,919	| IOT022 |	However
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:41,503	| IOT022 |	I'm looking at again Rotten Tomatoes review
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:44,063	| IOT022 |	Here's here's the deal
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:48,927	| IOT022 |	I'm going to just throw it in here so it supports
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:52,255	| IOT022 |	Sew thread is a wireless protocol.
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,023	| IOT022 |	It's built on
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:56,095	| IOT022 |	The IEEE 802.
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,375	| IOT022 |	15.
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:57,887	| IOT022 |	4
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:58,911	| IOT022 |	Standard
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,703	| IOT022 |	That's standard
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:01,727	| IOT022 |	What is the same
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:02,495	| IOT022 |	Radio
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:03,007	| IOT022 |	Precinct
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:04,799	| IOT022 |	So
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,823	| IOT022 |	Zigbee
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:08,383	| IOT022 |	As it is is that radio + software stack
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,711	| IOT022 |	And if use a different software stack
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:12,991	| IOT022 |	It makes it thread
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:14,783	| IOT022 |	So
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:16,831	| IOT022 |	Because
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:19,135	| IOT022 |	The differentiation is in the software
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,415	| IOT022 |	If you can make the
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,951	| IOT022 |	Two things work
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:22,975	| IOT022 |	Can run
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,791	| IOT022 |	You can
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:27,327	| IOT022 |	I mean but the question is
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,119	| IOT022 |	Will that eventually happen.
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,911	| IOT022 |	I'm just going to quote Ron here
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:35,007	| IOT022 |	Onhub 02. 15.4 support is close to zigbee
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,799	| IOT022 |	But it isn't compatible with zigbee
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:41,407	| IOT022 |	Zigbee devices can toss out the zucchini label get a software update and join Google team
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:44,223	| IOT022 |	But it doesn't seem like it will make itself compatible with them
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:45,759	| IOT022 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,039	| IOT022 |	Yep
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,951	| IOT022 |	Integrity software and chipsets
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,279	| IOT022 |	Backwards
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,303	| IOT022 |	Compatibility
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:02,399	| IOT022 |	Companies that are using those chips
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:03,935	| IOT022 |	Update your software
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:05,727	| IOT022 |	See what it comes down to me is
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:11,615	| IOT022 |	Again a lot of potential here I see where Google is going and I applaud them and I'd like the directions
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:15,199	| IOT022 |	But this gets back to way back when the vehicle came out
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:18,271	| IOT022 |	I didn't buy the echo in November for $99 because I looked at it like
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:20,063	| IOT022 |	It's got potential
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:22,367	| IOT022 |	Blackjack no guarantees or it's going to be able to do
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,903	| IOT022 |	You know eventually
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:27,743	| IOT022 |	I came around obviously in got one because of the additional features and things that work
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:29,535	| IOT022 |	I'm just leery of
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:33,887	| IOT022 |	What I'm getting for dinner dollars right now would I have to wait for and what may never come
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,167	| IOT022 |	I am with you on this
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,447	| IOT022 |	I am actually
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:40,031	| IOT022 |	So this is in my device I don't know about
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,823	| IOT022 |	I know I had it
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,359	| IOT022 |	I have it on my wishlist
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,663	| IOT022 |	And I'm I'm thinking about it and I
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:52,319	| IOT022 |	There's also a Kate Spade handbags
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:55,903	| IOT022 |	And it's basically the handbag
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:00,511	| IOT022 |	Well
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:06,655	| IOT022 |	You're like I really don't know what to say there I'm not sure where to go after that what I'm going to do is
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:09,727	| IOT022 |	I'm actually going to go to the Google store right now
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:12,543	| IOT022 |	And I'm going to see if there is
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:14,847	| IOT022 |	A 30-day return policy
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:18,431	| IOT022 |	Because that's the only way I would consider doing this
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:20,479	| IOT022 |	What's currently out of stock so it really doesn't matter
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:27,135	| IOT022 |	If it does have a 30 day return policy I will consider buying one and taking the chance for now
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,927	| IOT022 |	I'll look at you
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,951	| IOT022 |	Take one for the team
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,559	| IOT022 |	If you go to Amazon right now
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:37,375	| IOT022 |	It's not available right now so it's only
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,399	| IOT022 |	It's $400
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:40,959	| IOT022 |	No it's not cuz I'm not paying that
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:44,287	| IOT022 |	I may have a really good return policy too but I would not
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:46,079	| IOT022 |	Buy a 3rd party through Amazon
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:50,175	| IOT022 |	I'll wait and see when it comes available and maybe I'll get it
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,991	| IOT022 |	How can eliminate my access points
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,039	| IOT022 |	And still have fantastic coverage
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:57,343	| IOT022 |	Then it's an upgrade
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:59,391	| IOT022 |	But that's a lot to pay for that upgrade
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:01,439	| IOT022 |	With more potential
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:01,951	| IOT022 |	You know
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:03,999	| IOT022 |	It's true in
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,791	| IOT022 |	It's designer
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,815	| IOT022 |	Living room
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,583	| IOT022 |	Speaker
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:13,727	| IOT022 |	Is there a microphone out there's no microphone I've already looked at Maaco here's their answer to the echo
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:14,751	| IOT022 |	There's no microphone
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:16,543	| IOT022 |	Kadai enabling
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:19,103	| IOT022 |	Smartphone app that you talk to your phone and then
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:21,407	| IOT022 |	Maybe but
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:27,807	| IOT022 |	3 watt speaker Echo 15 watt speaker
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:31,903	| IOT022 |	Will in the here's here's the deal I've been waiting for this
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:33,183	| IOT022 |	And I don't know if it's actually
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:36,767	| IOT022 |	Make it in time or what there's a there's other wi-fi system
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,559	| IOT022 |	That I've been waiting for
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,351	| IOT022 |	It's called the Eero
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,887	| IOT022 |	Ber
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,679	| IOT022 |	And that's not going to come out
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,727	| IOT022 |	December 1st 2015 butt
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:48,543	| IOT022 |	Amazing
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,567	| IOT022 |	From a router stand for
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,103	| IOT022 |	For the internet
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:53,407	| IOT022 |	Thanks
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:59,551	| IOT022 |	It's a pretty sweet handbag
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:07,743	| IOT022 |	199 for the individual
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,559	| IOT022 |	The back has the same two
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:11,071	| IOT022 |	To Port problem
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:16,447	| IOT022 |	You can buy a three pack that has these access points
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:18,751	| IOT022 |	What are designed to solve what your problem is
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:20,031	| IOT022 |	Gotcha
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:20,543	| IOT022 |	So
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:23,615	| IOT022 |	Decisions decisions
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:28,991	| IOT022 |	I know I'm really excited though that Wi-Fi is actually finally becoming like the thing it should be which is
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:32,063	| IOT022 |	A recognition that it's super important
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:32,575	| IOT022 |	We still in
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:37,439	| IOT022 |	What is dead zones that we're trying to solve
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,023	| IOT022 |	Too much time talking about Wi-Fi
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,047	| IOT022 |	What is so important
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:46,655	| IOT022 |	Let's go into this new sensor thing because I am super
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,167	| IOT022 |	Interested
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:48,959	| IOT022 |	I don't know if you
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:53,823	| IOT022 |	Is this the sensors that make that according Cordon ApplianceSmart
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,359	| IOT022 |	From LG
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:00,991	| IOT022 |	Good lunch
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:02,527	| IOT022 |	Like I said
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,295	| IOT022 |	Lunch to Spanish
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:07,135	| IOT022 |	Smart brilliant
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:11,231	| IOT022 |	I'm so these are LG's new smart
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:11,999	| IOT022 |	Fix'd sensor
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:13,791	| IOT022 |	This is ifacs
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:18,143	| IOT022 |	Just this week and next will probably be talking about last stuff that I have Hader
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:21,215	| IOT022 |	Everything about today are at the LG sensor
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:21,983	| IOT022 |	Quickly and then
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:24,287	| IOT022 |	SmartThings coming on later
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:24,799	| IOT022 |	In the show
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:28,383	| IOT022 |	So this is the sensor it's a circular sensor you can stick it
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:29,663	| IOT022 |	On things in
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:32,223	| IOT022 |	It sent you a notification to your smartphone
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:37,855	| IOT022 |	Twining
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,463	| IOT022 |	So
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,487	| IOT022 |	I'm trying to see what's
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,535	| IOT022 |	Pretty sure this has all join
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:50,399	| IOT022 |	You don't want that kind of cool so that kind of opens it up a little bit
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:54,751	| IOT022 |	Supposed to like some of these older DIY
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:56,543	| IOT022 |	Tech savvy.
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:00,383	| IOT022 |	I'm hoping that when they officially debut this
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:05,247	| IOT022 |	Words free that would be better
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,271	| IOT022 |	No I hope that
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:09,087	| IOT022 |	Very quickly there's an if this then that channel
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:10,879	| IOT022 |	Alex gets to support this somehow
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:14,719	| IOT022 |	Maybe I mean with all joined what would be really cool is
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:16,511	| IOT022 |	This actually so
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:18,559	| IOT022 |	LG TVs already
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:19,327	| IOT022 |	Support
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,119	| IOT022 |	And I know not everybody has an LG
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,399	| IOT022 |	Letv but
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,423	| IOT022 |	Certain
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:24,959	| IOT022 |	Android phones can support
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:26,239	| IOT022 |	So
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:28,031	| IOT022 |	If you start looking at things like that
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,055	| IOT022 |	Maybe even cooler
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:33,151	| IOT022 |	Instead of having an assistant that channel for like my mom
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:34,943	| IOT022 |	Nativist better I agree
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:38,783	| IOT022 |	This suddenly just gives you a notification on your TV hey your washer
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:39,807	| IOT022 |	Stop
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:44,415	| IOT022 |	Oh crap I was just in the best part of the show
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:49,023	| IOT022 |	That's exactly what they're going after here
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:49,791	| IOT022 |	For people who
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:53,375	| IOT022 |	You don't know what these could be used for him and you can put it on the fridge and they say yeah
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:58,751	| IOT022 |	Send notification when a food item is about to expire or how many times the doors open
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:03,615	| IOT022 |	It's just about capturing data from these appliances which is interesting
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:04,895	| IOT022 |	I like it
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:14,879	| IOT022 |	Homeowners to use their smartphones to set the cooking mode temperature and cooking time for a given dish
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:17,440	| IOT022 |	I don't know how it actually implements that
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:19,488	| IOT022 |	I'm assuming that's on an LG oven
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:23,328	| IOT022 |	That's my suspicion because they even care
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:27,168	| IOT022 |	Sorry if I ever
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:29,984	| IOT022 |	Now they also have a smart air conditioner as well
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,008	| IOT022 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:32,544	| IOT022 |	Plastic lettuce.
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:33,568	| IOT022 |	Proprietary
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:34,592	| IOT022 |	Yeah soup
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:38,944	| IOT022 |	Not a retrofit
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:39,456	| IOT022 |	Bossa Nova
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:40,736	| IOT022 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:41,248	| IOT022 |	So
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:42,528	| IOT022 |	There we go
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,296	| IOT022 |	I was excited
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:46,368	| IOT022 |	Sorry to burst your bubble
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:48,160	| IOT022 |	My bubble can't stay Bruce for Long Beach
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:50,208	| IOT022 |	Also this week
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:51,232	| IOT022 |	Starting
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:52,256	| IOT022 |	Today
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:54,048	| IOT022 |	Hey you guys
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:55,840	| IOT022 |	If you go to smartthings.com
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,608	| IOT022 |	Order
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,376	| IOT022 |	And receive
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:59,168	| IOT022 |	The Next Generation huh
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:03,776	| IOT022 |	For $99 you can get the
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,568	| IOT022 |	42409 you can get a
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:06,848	| IOT022 |	A package of
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:08,896	| IOT022 |	Hub Essentials
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:09,920	| IOT022 |	Hub Essentials that is
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:10,688	| IOT022 |	That's not what I meant
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:12,224	| IOT022 |	Looking for a house
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:13,248	| IOT022 |	Security Essentials
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,296	| IOT022 |	So the new Hub is out
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:20,416	| IOT022 |	It is not homekit certified so I was speculating did
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:21,184	| IOT022 |	I was wrong
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:24,512	| IOT022 |	Tell us later on in the show
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:26,560	| IOT022 |	I guess it's Alex Hawkinson
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,840	| IOT022 |	CEO of SmartThings
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:30,144	| IOT022 |	He will tell us that it was actually
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:34,240	| IOT022 |	For international distribution and
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:36,800	| IOT022 |	Rebuilding entire app
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:38,336	| IOT022 |	From scratch
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:42,944	| IOT022 |	Cause of delays
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:47,296	| IOT022 |	We asked him about that so stay tuned to understand
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:47,808	| IOT022 |	Why that's not
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:50,624	| IOT022 |	Does he also
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:52,928	| IOT022 |	Tell you what's difference in this house
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,208	| IOT022 |	Of course he does
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:58,304	| IOT022 |	The short answer is
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:00,352	| IOT022 |	It has a battery backup
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:02,400	| IOT022 |	It has its own brains
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:05,472	| IOT022 |	So the previous version doesn't have an arm processor
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:08,288	| IOT022 |	So basically when it goes offline
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:10,592	| IOT022 |	It can think for itself so
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:11,872	| IOT022 |	Your programs will still run
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:13,152	| IOT022 |	I can't even do that
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:17,504	| IOT022 |	So that that's
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,528	| IOT022 |	Crucial difference
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:20,320	| IOT022 |	It has Z-Wave
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,368	| IOT022 |	I believe that will support
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:23,648	| IOT022 |	It adds Bluetooth
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:32,864	| IOT022 |	Other stuff so the new service it's going to
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:34,656	| IOT022 |	New services including
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:36,448	| IOT022 |	It supports
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:37,728	| IOT022 |	Video cameras for the first time
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:43,616	| IOT022 |	The services that they built
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:47,200	| IOT022 |	And what else do we want to know about smart things
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:50,272	| IOT022 |	I don't know but for 99 bucks
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:52,320	| IOT022 |	Just met order one
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:54,112	| IOT022 |	Dude is a great hub
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:56,416	| IOT022 |	The wink
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:24:00,256	| IOT022 |	I have a shoe release you said to me just before the show Hugh really only does lice so that's
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:04,864	| IOT022 |	Not too exciting so I can take the Hue out and put the SmartThings in there
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:07,680	| IOT022 |	She still has to
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:08,704	| IOT022 |	Prudential
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:09,728	| IOT022 |	With all of these
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:12,032	| IOT022 |	So much of that router
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,568	| IOT022 |	CC
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,848	| IOT022 |	Don't just go get a switch
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:18,688	| IOT022 |	The reason I'm excited because SmartThings
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:22,784	| IOT022 |	SmartThings is not supported on the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,064	| IOT022 |	Yes and you know what I have
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:28,672	| IOT022 |	No shield for SmartThings which means you can make
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:32,256	| IOT022 |	To work with your smart thing
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,280	| IOT022 |	If you're so inclined
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,072	| IOT022 |	Interesting
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:35,840	| IOT022 |	Which
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:39,936	| IOT022 |	You know if you're a DIY kind of person which some people on the show are
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:42,496	| IOT022 |	Not just on the show
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:48,640	| IOT022 |	You can actually make some crazy stuff this is not something that I do necessarily but
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:49,664	| IOT022 |	You Kevin
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:52,480	| IOT022 |	So maybe maybe I could
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:59,136	| IOT022 |	Ask my echo if the stock market arctis a how's the stock market doing and through the smart things are dino
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:04,512	| IOT022 |	We could light up green yellow or red depending on if the market Valpo down or unchanged
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,560	| IOT022 |	Sea or lake
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,864	| IOT022 |	Your house could go into like lockdown
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:16,288	| IOT022 |	You could prepare the apocalypse right there I am so prepared for the zombie apocalypse is not even
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,056	| IOT022 |	Funny
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:19,872	| IOT022 |	Just ask the people at Costco how much water we have bought in the last year
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,664	| IOT022 |	Water in canned goods
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:23,200	| IOT022 |	Can't wait
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,224	| IOT022 |	Bring it on zombies
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:29,856	| IOT022 |	So you know most people use it to make like homemade garage door openers that
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:30,880	| IOT022 |	Thanks but you know
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,392	| IOT022 |	You do what you want
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:36,000	| IOT022 |	I like to make little pretty lights blink
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:37,280	| IOT022 |	So there is
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:38,048	| IOT022 |	There's what you
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:39,328	| IOT022 |	I can do that with that
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:39,840	| IOT022 |	And
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:41,120	| IOT022 |	Yeah I think
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:48,800	| IOT022 |	Alright well let's hear more from from Alex cuz you got all the details
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:49,824	| IOT022 |	Stay tuned for that
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:59,808	| IOT022 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast and today
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:03,648	| IOT022 |	We have on our show Alex Hawkinson who is the CEO of smart things
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,416	| IOT022 |	Hey Alex
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:05,696	| IOT022 |	Hey Stacy
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:08,256	| IOT022 |	So good to have you here so
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:11,584	| IOT022 |	Last week actually Kevin and I talked about the integration of
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:14,144	| IOT022 |	SmartThings with Amazon Echo and
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:18,240	| IOT022 |	This week we talked about the new SmartThings that is coming out
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:19,264	| IOT022 |	Actually
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:25,408	| IOT022 |	Now for people who will buy it online and then in October for people who want to buy it on retail stores show
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,712	| IOT022 |	Retail store shelves
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:29,248	| IOT022 |	It's probably a graceful way to say that so
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,552	| IOT022 |	Congratulations
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:33,088	| IOT022 |	Yeah thanks it's been a
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:34,112	| IOT022 |	A big year
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:37,952	| IOT022 |	A lot of heads down work and getting ready for this so we're really excited to have the next
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:40,512	| IOT022 |	Next version to product in the platform out the door
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:42,816	| IOT022 |	See I was going to say it's been a long time coming
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:47,936	| IOT022 |	You can tell I'd I'm not trained by anyone to say things politely
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:50,496	| IOT022 |	People avoid me at parties
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:54,080	| IOT022 |	You guys actually have been
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:55,616	| IOT022 |	Pretty heads down pretty quiet
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:56,896	| IOT022 |	4
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:58,432	| IOT022 |	Actually like the last year so
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:00,736	| IOT022 |	I've been working on the new platform
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:03,552	| IOT022 |	We were expecting it back in May so
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:07,136	| IOT022 |	What happened what have you guys been doing and then
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,672	| IOT022 |	I'm going to say what took you so long
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:14,304	| IOT022 |	Oh you know just getting everything ready for the global scale now
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:20,704	| IOT022 |	Since we merged with Samsung a year ago you know the opportunity to scale up all the way
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:22,752	| IOT022 |	Around the world this is in front of us now and
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:24,032	| IOT022 |	Realized
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:26,592	| IOT022 |	You know announce the new Hobbit CS
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,616	| IOT022 |	But then we looked across the
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:31,200	| IOT022 |	The platform and realized you wanted to do much more and bring it all together
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:32,992	| IOT022 |	So not just the new hot but new
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:33,760	| IOT022 |	Devices
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:37,600	| IOT022 |	I totally new person at the Avenue video platform
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:38,880	| IOT022 |	And then of course please
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:42,976	| IOT022 |	Distribution channels for the make it accessible to people in the US send
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:44,512	| IOT022 |	And now beginning in
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,816	| IOT022 |	In the UK and send them to you as well
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:49,888	| IOT022 |	So you're right that is that is a lot going on
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:52,448	| IOT022 |	And since we actually
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:54,496	| IOT022 |	This last week we talked about you guys being
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:56,544	| IOT022 |	The granddaddy of smart
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:58,592	| IOT022 |	DIY smart home moving
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:04,480	| IOT022 |	Surreal to me because it still feels like it's gone so quickly you don't have to
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:09,856	| IOT022 |	Wake up everyday and realize that again remind myself it was just three years ago
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:13,184	| IOT022 |	You know that our our Kickstarter campaign is actually went live on August
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:13,952	| IOT022 |	XXII
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:15,232	| IOT022 |	2012
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,000	| IOT022 |	And
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:21,120	| IOT022 |	33 years ago that were in the middle of the kickstarter campaign and not notice or knowing if we're going to tip
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:22,912	| IOT022 |	Yeah and so on and it
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:24,192	| IOT022 |	That's really been a whirlwind
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,216	| IOT022 |	Since then.
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:26,240	| IOT022 |	Of course now
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:28,032	| IOT022 |	Tucson news very quickly and
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:30,080	| IOT022 |	3 years is a is a lifetime
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:31,872	| IOT022 |	You know we didn't know about a lot of things
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,408	| IOT022 |	Things that happened in Market
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:33,920	| IOT022 |	At that time
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:37,760	| IOT022 |	Let's jump in our time machine and go back a little bit because
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:39,808	| IOT022 |	I think it's worth kind of exploring
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:42,880	| IOT022 |	What has changed and how your philosophies
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:43,648	| IOT022 |	Changed because
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:46,976	| IOT022 |	The I actually recently picked up my SmartThings
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:48,256	| IOT022 |	Hub an app
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:51,328	| IOT022 |	After kind of a bit of a Hiatus with
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:52,608	| IOT022 |	The whole Amazon thing and I was like
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,656	| IOT022 |	Oh man you know
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:57,472	| IOT022 |	I've long bulbs SmartThings because of your open philosophy
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:02,336	| IOT022 |	And that has been my favorite and I recommend it to anybody who has
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:04,896	| IOT022 |	A lot of technical expertise in a lot of patients
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:06,688	| IOT022 |	Because
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:08,480	| IOT022 |	To me it's kind of like the Android of the smart
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:09,504	| IOT022 |	The sense that
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:12,576	| IOT022 |	My God it will work with anything
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:14,368	| IOT022 |	But you kind of have to be willing to work with it a little
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:15,904	| IOT022 |	It's not exactly
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:17,184	| IOT022 |	Intuitive
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:18,208	| IOT022 |	I'm sorry I
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:19,488	| IOT022 |	I'm so sorry
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:23,840	| IOT022 |	But it does require you to like really be like I know what I want to do
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:27,168	| IOT022 |	Erica Robertson dead.
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:30,240	| IOT022 |	It's been a big fight at point of the new launch but yeah you know
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:31,264	| IOT022 |	If you want to talk about this
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,032	| IOT022 |	History
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:36,896	| IOT022 |	I think the vision for the company's been consistent throughout and putting with this new launch you know we always
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:42,272	| IOT022 |	Yeah I had to sweat in my family house in the mountains and it was shocked back in
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:44,320	| IOT022 |	Zack and 2000
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:47,648	| IOT022 |	11 when I didn't realize that it was happening
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:49,696	| IOT022 |	How can be how can the world
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:52,512	| IOT022 |	Connected in a way that other things are
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:57,888	| IOT022 |	Jesse our smartphones and the initial Vision was going to try to make this easy enough for
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:03,008	| IOT022 |	Everyday People to get access to you but really realize also that the Innovation was
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:03,776	| IOT022 |	Income from
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:09,152	| IOT022 |	A worldwide movement of developers and device makers send to all sorts of other things in
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:10,944	| IOT022 |	It isn't open plateau
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:13,248	| IOT022 |	Farm so easy and open of all has been at the heart
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,272	| IOT022 |	Of SmartThings
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:18,112	| IOT022 |	And your your top use cases are security energy-saving inconvenience
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:19,392	| IOT022 |	And then
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:21,184	| IOT022 |	What you would call sign in
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,208	| IOT022 |	Entertainment
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:24,768	| IOT022 |	I think during sex
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:25,536	| IOT022 |	Monitoring
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:26,560	| IOT022 |	Dirty I don't
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:29,888	| IOT022 |	Like to just focus on security cuz it really is just out of answering the Clash
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:30,912	| IOT022 |	Is everything okay
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:35,776	| IOT022 |	In my home at this moment send that's a universal need and it's by far the
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:37,312	| IOT022 |	The top starting point then after that it
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:40,384	| IOT022 |	We said comfort and savings so kind of making it
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:44,736	| IOT022 |	Simple to be comfortable while saving money and the thermostat selenium
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:48,320	| IOT022 |	Example. There's lots of others by using energy rides and then
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:52,928	| IOT022 |	Bizaardvark episode of convenience and entertainment trying together its fans things that
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:59,840	| IOT022 |	May or may not save you money but people love them for lots of different reasons I connected lighting and then things that entertain you or make your stay
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:00,608	| IOT022 |	Please come to life
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,120	| IOT022 |	Like
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:08,032	| IOT022 |	Can I get audio then send more so those are the big three I wanted to kind of get to this idea because
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:12,896	| IOT022 |	A lot of other companies have had to do this in the space which is building a developer community
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:14,176	| IOT022 |	And then wrangling it
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:15,456	| IOT022 |	In front of everyone
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:18,272	| IOT022 |	I'm in front of your users in front of the press in front of
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:20,064	| IOT022 |	Everyone in
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:24,416	| IOT022 |	I actually think you guys have done it really well you've been very graceful as a comfy
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:24,928	| IOT022 |	Company doing this
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:26,720	| IOT022 |	And I would love to get
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:29,792	| IOT022 |	Sense of how you guys have done this
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:31,072	| IOT022 |	Speakwrite
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:33,632	| IOT022 |	I'm most of it is where were
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:34,400	| IOT022 |	Straddling
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:37,728	| IOT022 |	Set of two competing things seen as being easy and being open
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:40,544	| IOT022 |	You can be a toll against each other in some way
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:45,664	| IOT022 |	To be easier it's right something to close things down and try to make it narrower and narrower
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:48,224	| IOT022 |	But you know it's really this
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:48,736	| IOT022 |	Unconscious
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:50,272	| IOT022 |	Amaze to buy
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:53,600	| IOT022 |	The developer community in what they're doing
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:58,976	| IOT022 |	With the platform and all the things we didn't think of that are really meaningful in Prosecco
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:00,000	| IOT022 |	You know in everyday life
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:03,072	| IOT022 |	Frontier that easy nothing vision
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:05,376	| IOT022 |	Has always been at the heart of the company but it's
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:11,776	| IOT022 |	It's always it's fundamentally they pull in each Direction because developers want to do new stuff so that's not necessarily
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:13,056	| IOT022 |	The mainstream
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:14,592	| IOT022 |	I need queso
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:16,896	| IOT022 |	Enterprise at the heart of it I guess it
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:23,296	| IOT022 |	It took a while as you saw in the first-person the product and then we went through some decorations and now getting to this full revamp of the u.s.
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:25,344	| IOT022 |	Blacks but it hardens probably are
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:26,880	| IOT022 |	Are certification
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:27,904	| IOT022 |	Program
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,184	| IOT022 |	And
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:33,536	| IOT022 |	All the processes we built around that so developers start to get a sandbox
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,816	| IOT022 |	I can do whatever they want
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:37,888	| IOT022 |	But it's not exposed to all the other consumers in the ecosystem
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:39,936	| IOT022 |	And then we've created this
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:41,984	| IOT022 |	This really rebuff process where is smelt
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:43,008	| IOT022 |	Just want to share
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:44,032	| IOT022 |	With the can
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:50,176	| IOT022 |	Consumers and publish their Innovations for the devices are apps are now apps can have a ufi user experience inside of
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:52,992	| IOT022 |	May nap if you will
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:55,808	| IOT022 |	They have to go to the certification program
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:57,088	| IOT022 |	Not now includes
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,880	| IOT022 |	Security privacy checks
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:01,440	| IOT022 |	Enough putting it into the taxonomy
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:05,024	| IOT022 |	Consumers can understand where it goes and how it extends their lives
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:08,608	| IOT022 |	I think we're still in the early stages but thanks for the company
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:11,680	| IOT022 |	If we can't make the two sides the
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:15,520	| IOT022 |	Ecosystem easy and open both work then
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:18,080	| IOT022 |	You know I'll feel like we failed the position of the company
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:22,944	| IOT022 |	We're dead set on making it happen I'm sure but this next iteration
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:24,480	| IOT022 |	You'll get a lot more feedback
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:25,248	| IOT022 |	Is this looks like
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,040	| IOT022 |	This actually looks like
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:30,112	| IOT022 |	The version of the product that's probably going to hopefully push it into the mainstream
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:37,024	| IOT022 |	This user experience kind of concept in how your
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:38,816	| IOT022 |	Cuz this also
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:41,888	| IOT022 |	Touches on how you guys are introducing services
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:43,424	| IOT022 |	So there's kind of a lot to unpack here
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:43,936	| IOT022 |	Care of it
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:45,984	| IOT022 |	A new service
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:49,568	| IOT022 |	That you guys are launching as part of your security and monitoring
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:51,360	| IOT022 |	One of your security and monitor
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:52,640	| IOT022 |	Offering
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:55,456	| IOT022 |	So why don't you describe that for us and then we'll talk about like
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:56,224	| IOT022 |	How developers can
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:58,272	| IOT022 |	Sure
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:59,040	| IOT022 |	So
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:04,928	| IOT022 |	That there's a lot to unpack I mean in a nutshell what we're launching is we called smart home monitor and there's
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:08,768	| IOT022 |	I literally new kicks that goes on the retail shelves called the
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,560	| IOT022 |	Home monitoring kit that lets you
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:11,840	| IOT022 |	Answer that
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:12,864	| IOT022 |	Problem is everything
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:13,376	| IOT022 |	Okay at home
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:17,472	| IOT022 |	And it is made to be incredibly simple it's got its
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:18,496	| IOT022 |	User
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,520	| IOT022 |	Grant's inside of our app
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:21,568	| IOT022 |	It's very centered on
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:23,104	| IOT022 |	I'm answering that question
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:26,688	| IOT022 |	With that comes a premium service that's totally optional
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:27,456	| IOT022 |	Which is
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:29,504	| IOT022 |	Adding Bisquick video
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:33,344	| IOT022 |	Recording for connected video cameras and we did that in a very I think Innovative way
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,648	| IOT022 |	Consumer cell
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:37,184	| IOT022 |	It's unlimited clip
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:39,488	| IOT022 |	Recording where if they have connect
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:40,768	| IOT022 |	The cameras when an event
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:43,072	| IOT022 |	Checkers near house like the door opens in their way
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:45,632	| IOT022 |	It can take a snapshot of
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,400	| IOT022 |	That that's been
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:47,680	| IOT022 |	Acute up on our hub
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,448	| IOT022 |	And
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:52,544	| IOT022 |	See see what happened before and after the events and do that for any number of connected cameras
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:54,592	| IOT022 |	Tendency that way to be clear
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:55,360	| IOT022 |	4
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:57,664	| IOT022 |	People to get this they actually have
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:58,688	| IOT022 |	To buy the new hub
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:00,224	| IOT022 |	For $99
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:01,504	| IOT022 |	And then
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:03,040	| IOT022 |	You also have to buy the
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:05,344	| IOT022 |	But the additional new sensors
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:07,904	| IOT022 |	Which would be that whole kit for 249
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:09,184	| IOT022 |	You have to have the new hub.
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:10,464	| IOT022 |	That's true because we
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:12,000	| IOT022 |	We don't let the data from these
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:17,376	| IOT022 |	These cameras leave your house unless you physically requested or there's an incident they're not all the streaming
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:19,168	| IOT022 |	Because we found a lot of people.
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:19,680	| IOT022 |	Didn't want that
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:22,752	| IOT022 |	A model so it needs a new hub
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:25,056	| IOT022 |	But anybody that buys that and then I ended up working
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:29,152	| IOT022 |	A camera that works with it initially it's a lineup of Samsung
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:34,016	| IOT022 |	Cameras and D-Link cameras and then I will be over others but it's part of a broader Ark
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:36,576	| IOT022 |	We found that the Developers
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:38,112	| IOT022 |	You want to not just
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:43,232	| IOT022 |	Still device Integrations to make new devices work or a new what we've called smart apps
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:44,768	| IOT022 |	Historically which is for the behind-the-scenes
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:47,840	| IOT022 |	Rules or recipes or
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:52,448	| IOT022 |	Whatever your analogy is that run behind the scenes in SmartThings sensor to make
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:56,032	| IOT022 |	Yeah but they lights come on in response to the other things like that but now
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:36:01,408	| IOT022 |	We found this big desire to make life better for consumers by adding the services and
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:02,944	| IOT022 |	We created a mechanism
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,712	| IOT022 |	4
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:05,760	| IOT022 |	Using our own developer tools
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:07,808	| IOT022 |	We built this smart home monitor
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:11,392	| IOT022 |	Lippitt Hall uri inside of our app and now developers have access
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:12,160	| IOT022 |	It's not
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:13,184	| IOT022 |	As well as
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:15,744	| IOT022 |	And so we haven't announced them yet but we
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:21,376	| IOT022 |	See a proliferation starting to happen where there's this opportunity to launch Services that's all
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:23,424	| IOT022 |	Consumer problems and make life better
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:26,752	| IOT022 |	Upper people and the model will be
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:31,872	| IOT022 |	The developers have a chance to make money from that will take a small Revenue share that is similar to an app store
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:36,224	| IOT022 |	A model and you never really excited about it cuz it lets
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:42,880	| IOT022 |	What's a guy knows those mainstream consumers let them see a solution in place whatever that might
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:46,720	| IOT022 |	Be rather than it being the sort of gadgety things that run behind the scenes
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:48,768	| IOT022 |	So I could always set up
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:51,328	| IOT022 |	The smart home monitoring
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:53,632	| IOT022 |	But what I would pay for it
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:58,240	| IOT022 |	Where is the ability to store those clips for an extended amount of time from any of my cameras
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:37:01,568	| IOT022 |	Correct yes
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:04,896	| IOT022 |	As the solution inside of inside of smart things that you buy the smart come
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:05,920	| IOT022 |	The home monitoring kit
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:10,016	| IOT022 |	You can do it for free forever and if you have connected cameras
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:13,088	| IOT022 |	Streaming from them and then you get a trial of this
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:14,368	| IOT022 |	Premium
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:15,648	| IOT022 |	The clip recording
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:17,440	| IOT022 |	DVR service
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:23,072	| IOT022 |	And the ability to escalate to friends and family and so on and all that that is part of the page
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:25,632	| IOT022 |	It service and we don't know what the pricing is
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:26,144	| IOT022 |	Going to be on that
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:33,312	| IOT022 |	We haven't announced it but it's even my commitment as its you know part of making it easy is making it so accessible
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:39,200	| IOT022 |	That's going to alienate some of your partners who might also have a Services Revenue option so
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:40,736	| IOT022 |	I know that today
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:43,552	| IOT022 |	You guys don't have like a formal works with nest
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:45,600	| IOT022 |	For example but their nest cam
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:47,904	| IOT022 |	Has a Services model where
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:48,928	| IOT022 |	You can pay
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:49,952	| IOT022 |	X amount
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:50,720	| IOT022 |	I think it's
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,024	| IOT022 |	$10 a month for unlimited
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:53,792	| IOT022 |	Cloud storage
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:58,400	| IOT022 |	So if I look at what you might charge
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:37:59,936	| IOT022 |	And if I have a nest
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:02,752	| IOT022 |	Wait a second
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:05,312	| IOT022 |	I'll just store the interesting mon
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:07,360	| IOT022 |	Events for my SmartThings system
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:09,920	| IOT022 |	Finessed me look at you guys and be like you know what
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:10,688	| IOT022 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:11,456	| IOT022 |	Never
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:15,296	| IOT022 |	I hope that's not the case I mean it
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,832	| IOT022 |	Again we I think we have
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:17,600	| IOT022 |	The most open
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:20,416	| IOT022 |	That's of any platform out there so
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:21,440	| IOT022 |	Even our own
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:22,720	| IOT022 |	Services
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:27,328	| IOT022 |	Solutions which we're just trying to do it right by the consumer and make things easier for them but
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:30,400	| IOT022 |	Those are all published as exam
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:34,496	| IOT022 |	Samples in our developer tools they're all built with our own developer tools and
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:41,408	| IOT022 |	I'm sitting this test but I use for what an open model looks like but if others built a connected device with it
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:42,176	| IOT022 |	Sun premium service
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:44,224	| IOT022 |	We love to expose.
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:45,504	| IOT022 |	In the platform
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:47,808	| IOT022 |	And so without talking to nest
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:50,368	| IOT022 |	Yes specifically you know about their devices but
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:52,672	| IOT022 |	In a sum of their approach has
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:54,976	| IOT022 |	Then as open as we would love
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:55,744	| IOT022 |	To see
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:39:02,144	| IOT022 |	So how you know from my standpoint I want to give consumers maximum choice I don't think it's one size fits
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:06,240	| IOT022 |	And you know we'll let the marketplace in the developer because
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:08,544	| IOT022 |	System consumers decide for themselves
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:09,312	| IOT022 |	What they want
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:10,336	| IOT022 |	And
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:12,896	| IOT022 |	Let's while we're on the topic of devices
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:19,296	| IOT022 |	What kind of devices are going to be working with your new Hub in platform that we should be excited
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:20,832	| IOT022 |	At this point were
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:22,368	| IOT022 |	About 200
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:22,880	| IOT022 |	Compatible
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:26,720	| IOT022 |	Devices that consumers can all Discover right within our new app
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:30,560	| IOT022 |	And we talked back at CES
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:32,608	| IOT022 |	That you had mentioned that you guys were
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:36,192	| IOT022 |	Interested and supportive of homekit which is Apple's
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:38,240	| IOT022 |	Kind of standard in this space
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:41,824	| IOT022 |	We actually even talked about being interested in supporting thread on the new
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:43,616	| IOT022 |	So
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:45,152	| IOT022 |	Where Do We Stand assist
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:46,432	| IOT022 |	Is this
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:47,200	| IOT022 |	Sublet out
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:50,016	| IOT022 |	I don't believe it's hunk it certified so what happened there
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:52,832	| IOT022 |	You know I I love Zeppelin
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:54,368	| IOT022 |	Virus
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:55,136	| IOT022 |	Products
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:57,440	| IOT022 |	Apple products use a lot of them myself
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:40:00,000	| IOT022 |	Considering placing our customer base and
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:00,768	| IOT022 |	And I think that
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:02,560	| IOT022 |	It was funny after the
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:04,352	| IOT022 |	Integration of Samsung
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:06,400	| IOT022 |	The first iOS bugs that came out in
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,168	| IOT022 |	Spell community
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:07,936	| IOT022 |	Initially like
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:09,984	| IOT022 |	See I knew it you know but then we
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:12,032	| IOT022 |	Continue to iterate
EDL	00:40:12,032	00:40:13,312	| IOT022 |	And have a very big debt
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:15,360	| IOT022 |	Team around it Monster Apple Watch app
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:17,408	| IOT022 |	Yeah completely committed
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:19,968	| IOT022 |	I'm with homekit you know I think the
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:26,368	| IOT022 |	The disappointments so far we've been watching really carefully is been the proprietary Hardware components that you need in it
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:27,648	| IOT022 |	And we haven't seen the value
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:30,720	| IOT022 |	Yes in that ecosystem does not mature enough yet
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:31,232	| IOT022 |	So
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:32,256	| IOT022 |	It's not
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:37,120	| IOT022 |	The homekit chip isn't in the tub this new Hub can be expanded
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:44,032	| IOT022 |	Of your ports on the back so we're looking at it carefully and I'm totally open-minded about homekit in the future it's just
EDL	00:40:44,032	00:40:45,568	| IOT022 |	Still in the really early stages
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:46,336	| IOT022 |	So
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:47,872	| IOT022 |	Indeed it's not
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:50,176	| IOT022 |	Homekit certified the bunny hop
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:51,200	| IOT022 |	I yelled at this point
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:54,528	| IOT022 |	Standard scene I really all the scene SmartThings
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:55,808	| IOT022 |	Horsham clinic VA
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:56,576	| IOT022 |	Gnostic
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:57,600	| IOT022 |	Soldan's DeWitt
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:58,880	| IOT022 |	So
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:01,696	| IOT022 |	In cases like thread will say
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:02,720	| IOT022 |	French leaving weave
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:09,632	| IOT022 |	And others this Hub is LSA future ready for a lot of these things so as the red becomes means
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:10,912	| IOT022 |	Stream are Hub and devices
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:11,936	| IOT022 |	Portage
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:14,240	| IOT022 |	And then there's other emerging stand
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:18,080	| IOT022 |	That were very involved in some of the older ones like sigelei
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:24,480	| IOT022 |	Which is matured a lot of the last three years you know we're on the board for zigbee we're on the board for Z-Wave and we're trying to shape all these things
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:25,504	| IOT022 |	Directions that
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:29,088	| IOT022 |	Makes things easy for consumers and make it open for
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:32,160	| IOT022 |	Developers going to start charging you a quarter every time you say easy in open
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:36,256	| IOT022 |	Eugene open
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:37,280	| IOT022 |	That's my pocket song
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:38,816	| IOT022 |	You're like I'm just going to throw it out there
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:41,888	| IOT022 |	Demanding radio
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:44,960	| IOT022 |	Alright for that one
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:45,984	| IOT022 |	I want Lutron
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:49,568	| IOT022 |	And that one
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:51,616	| IOT022 |	Give me a test you know we see the actress
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:52,128	| IOT022 |	System emerging
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:54,687	| IOT022 |	I think the open model is
EDL	00:41:54,687	00:41:55,967	| IOT022 |	Is winning but I
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:59,807	| IOT022 |	You know you don't see in all cases of the other large companies
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:01,855	| IOT022 |	In space we don't see them all with a pure
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:03,135	| IOT022 |	Model that we
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:04,159	| IOT022 |	Be best
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:05,695	| IOT022 |	So we try to hammer
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:10,559	| IOT022 |	Sam of those those two messages every every time we sent
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:13,119	| IOT022 |	Especially without using the words easy and open but let's see what happens
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:15,679	| IOT022 |	How have you fared
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:17,471	| IOT022 |	Under a Samsung's ownership
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:19,519	| IOT022 |	Especially
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:23,871	| IOT022 |	You know that you you mentioned Apple obviously and people were very skeptical there like
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:26,175	| IOT022 |	Given their relationship
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:26,943	| IOT022 |	That's kind of dicey
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:28,991	| IOT022 |	But I think it's the
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:30,271	| IOT022 |	As other
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:31,807	| IOT022 |	Companies enter the Smart Home
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:34,879	| IOT022 |	You know I'm even thinking like appliances and
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:36,415	| IOT022 |	Televisions
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:39,999	| IOT022 |	Are you finding that companies
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:41,535	| IOT022 |	Speaker companies especially
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:45,375	| IOT022 |	Are a little nervous or skeptical about working with you guys
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:47,679	| IOT022 |	No I mean it's been
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:48,447	| IOT022 |	Honestly
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:51,007	| IOT022 |	This has been just the opposite it was what I was most paranoid
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:53,311	| IOT022 |	About when we decided to go forward
EDL	00:42:53,311	00:42:56,639	| IOT022 |	With the acquisition we we wanted to do it to reach Matchbox
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:59,711	| IOT022 |	Scale cuz we've always felt like we have this chance to
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:02,527	| IOT022 |	Bring our platform instead of change the world
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:03,295	| IOT022 |	Dubai
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:04,319	| IOT022 |	Bringing together consume
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:05,599	| IOT022 |	Sun Developers
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:06,367	| IOT022 |	True that
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:08,671	| IOT022 |	Model those two words
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:09,695	| IOT022 |	I talked to you earlier but
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:12,255	| IOT022 |	I'm in Samsung has incredible reach
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:13,023	| IOT022 |	Around the world
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:14,303	| IOT022 |	1 scale opportunities but
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:17,887	| IOT022 |	You know how to keep it I was worried about it staying completely pure and opa
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:21,727	| IOT022 |	I'm so if maintain SmartThings as a separate company you know we have our own offices we
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:24,287	| IOT022 |	Do things that are first principles like
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:30,943	| IOT022 |	We Samsung uses the same as a partner uses the same developer tools and certification price
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:34,527	| IOT022 |	But anyone else does on the outside so there's no
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:38,367	| IOT022 |	Favoritism towards their devices in our model on
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:42,463	| IOT022 |	Customer privacy and so on is Sanford developers this you own your own data
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:45,023	| IOT022 |	Answer that applies internally as well
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:48,095	| IOT022 |	It's actually not used in an available to anyone else so
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:55,263	| IOT022 |	All these policies I think of kept us open and then we seen what's great is that the ecosystems loves the scaling
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:57,823	| IOT022 |	Trinity so the chance to go out and serve reach more
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:44:00,383	| IOT022 |	People touch deeper into the home
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:03,711	| IOT022 |	Make this more inexpensive through the manufacturing scale
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:07,551	| IOT022 |	God and so on so I think it's been
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:09,599	| IOT022 |	The belief will be an execution now
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:10,879	| IOT022 |	That we are out in the market
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:12,415	| IOT022 |	Continue to demonstrate
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:13,951	| IOT022 |	That openness
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:14,975	| IOT022 |	But I think
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:20,095	| IOT022 |	Consumers and developers will really realize the benefits of the the scale knows we're in millions of households
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:22,911	| IOT022 |	Well think about the opportunity that that creates
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:25,727	| IOT022 |	If you're craving services on top of the platform to
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:27,263	| IOT022 |	Reach additional consumer
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:30,079	| IOT022 |	Berserker creating new device to get it rapid exposure
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:33,663	| IOT022 |	Guitar bass cell really excited.
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:36,735	| IOT022 |	No I'm not saying that he's not
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:38,015	| IOT022 |	But I
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:40,063	| IOT022 |	I'm confident that we're on the path
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:40,831	| IOT022 |	To be
