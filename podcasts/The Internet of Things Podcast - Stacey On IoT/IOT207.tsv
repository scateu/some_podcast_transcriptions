EDL	00:00:56,832	00:00:57,344	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	00:00:57,856	00:00:59,136	| IOT207 |	I am going to bring you
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:02,976	| IOT207 |	To South by Southwest because I hosted a panel
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:06,048	| IOT207 |	So I guess this week is actually lots of people
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:06,560	| IOT207 |	It is
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:09,376	| IOT207 |	Participants from that panel on the Smart Home
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:12,448	| IOT207 |	That was sponsored by you know me and we're going to hear from
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:13,984	| IOT207 |	Folks from Dallas
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:14,752	| IOT207 |	Tendril

EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:21,152	| IOT207 |	Voice recorded live so you're getting here a little bit of like
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:23,200	| IOT207 |	Fart noises in the background because he
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:24,736	| IOT207 |	It South by Southwest but
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:26,272	| IOT207 |	It's a really awesome
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:27,296	| IOT207 |	Panel and
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:29,088	| IOT207 |	So
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:30,624	| IOT207 |	Before we get started
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:37,536	| IOT207 |	Let's hear from this week sponsor this week sponsor is Western Digital Western did

EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:04,416	| IOT207 |	For those of you who are like
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:06,720	| IOT207 |	What the heck is an nvme
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:07,232	| IOT207 |	SSD
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:09,024	| IOT207 |	Kevin can you tell us
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:10,816	| IOT207 |	I can only because I built
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:12,864	| IOT207 |	Gaming PC with my son last weekend and
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:16,960	| IOT207 |	Aside from traditional SSD which is already fast
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:20,032	| IOT207 |	We installed an nvme SSD
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:22,336	| IOT207 |	Which is super fast like
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:26,432	| IOT207 |	The biggest insane transfer speeds with this so this is the way of the Future 4
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,200	| IOT207 |	Fast
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,480	| IOT207 |	Data transfer on computers
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,016	| IOT207 |	Awesome so
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,296	| IOT207 |	Way of the future
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:32,576	| IOT207 |	You heard it here first
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:35,904	| IOT207 |	Let's kick this show off with
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:39,488	| IOT207 |	Conversation about Charter this is news I'm actually
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:41,792	| IOT207 |	Well originally I was excited about then
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,584	| IOT207 |	Bummed because
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,632	| IOT207 |	Charter CEO
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:46,400	| IOT207 |	Tom run
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:48,960	| IOT207 |	Rutledge said that the ISP
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:50,240	| IOT207 |	Cable companies
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:50,752	| IOT207 |	Isb
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:55,104	| IOT207 |	Was going to roll out a smart home management
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:55,872	| IOT207 |	Platform
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,152	| IOT207 |	In Austin Texas
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,944	| IOT207 |	That's where you are
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,224	| IOT207 |	Yeah
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:02,016	| IOT207 |	Today but they're going to roll it out in the
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:02,528	| IOT207 |	Fall
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,600	| IOT207 |	So
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:08,928	| IOT207 |	I was a little bummed about this but the story is interesting basically
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:11,488	| IOT207 |	Rutledge was speaking of the Deutsche Bank Media
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,768	| IOT207 |	Internet until c** comp
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:14,304	| IOT207 |	Big deal
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:19,680	| IOT207 |	And he said that Charter is developing a quote-unquote control plane to help
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,984	| IOT207 |	Customers manage the devices that connect to their
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:25,824	| IOT207 |	Particularly from a privacy and security stamp
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:28,384	| IOT207 |	This news is not surprising
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,664	| IOT207 |	We have seen
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:33,248	| IOT207 |	Comcast actually Focus very deeply on this both for me
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:35,296	| IOT207 |	Wi-Fi just making it better
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:36,576	| IOT207 |	Through an arrangement with
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,344	| IOT207 |	Peacock plume
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:42,976	| IOT207 |	And also through an arrangement with a company called Cujo it is implemented security Serv
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,024	| IOT207 |	So I think
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:47,328	| IOT207 |	What isps are basically doing is saying
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:48,608	| IOT207 |	Oh man
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:50,144	| IOT207 |	We have got to get up
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:53,216	| IOT207 |	And be responsible for Wi-Fi at home security
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,008	| IOT207 |	In customers homes
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,824	| IOT207 |	Comcast actually charges you
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:58,592	| IOT207 |	For this privilege
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:04,480	| IOT207 |	And I am very curious if Charter will see this as a new business opportunity as well
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:07,552	| IOT207 |	Like you said this is not surprising and I personally am not a
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:12,160	| IOT207 |	Cable subscriber anymore I haven't been for three years nor my big unlikes
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:12,672	| IOT207 |	Subscriptions
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:13,696	| IOT207 |	However
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:18,303	| IOT207 |	No Comcast XVI and now this new Charter platform and others
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:22,143	| IOT207 |	I probably wouldn't have a problem paying for the platform
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:22,655	| IOT207 |	If
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:29,567	| IOT207 |	It closes the security loopholes and gaps that are in a lot of beatitude products today like I would pay for that piece of mind
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:32,383	| IOT207 |	Tiffany if the device makers and such are not going to
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,151	| IOT207 |	Truly provide it
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:34,943	| IOT207 |	Then I'm okay with that
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:39,039	| IOT207 |	Yeah I don't think you could control all the security looks like there's a lot of
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,831	| IOT207 |	Insecure things such as
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:41,343	| IOT207 |	Hey
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:45,183	| IOT207 |	Once your password is in the cloud is it stored correctly or
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,719	| IOT207 |	My gosh
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:53,119	| IOT207 |	I got a weakness in some of my radio Technologies and again those hats do require physical access to the.
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:55,167	| IOT207 |	Zorbing near the device in most cases
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,959	| IOT207 |	It won't solve everything
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:58,239	| IOT207 |	Realself something
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,031	| IOT207 |	It makes it better I'm off work
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:01,055	| IOT207 |	Excellent
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:02,335	| IOT207 |	Next up
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:05,663	| IOT207 |	Are two stories on facial recognition that
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,431	| IOT207 |	Scare the pants off
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,991	| IOT207 |	The first is from BuzzFeed
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:12,063	| IOT207 |	Which published documents from the e f f
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,599	| IOT207 |	The basically showed that
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:17,439	| IOT207 |	The government is basically going to use facial recognition in airports
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,719	| IOT207 |	2
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,487	| IOT207 |	Track
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:22,303	| IOT207 |	American citizens as they enter the country
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,607	| IOT207 |	And use that to
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,399	| IOT207 |	Basically with four people who are
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,423	| IOT207 |	Not supposed to be
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,191	| IOT207 |	Entering the country
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:30,751	| IOT207 |	What they didn't do
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,775	| IOT207 |	As part of this is
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:34,079	| IOT207 |	They didn't set any limits on how
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:36,895	| IOT207 |	Airlines could use that facial recognition data
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:37,407	| IOT207 |	Which feels like
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,711	| IOT207 |	And they also
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,503	| IOT207 |	Didn't have any public
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,527	| IOT207 |	Comment about
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:46,367	| IOT207 |	Hey everybody we're going to be using facial recognition to track you when you come into the country
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:49,695	| IOT207 |	And didn't ask how we all felt about that as Citizens
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:51,231	| IOT207 |	That was not awesome
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,023	| IOT207 |	Write the next news item
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,815	| IOT207 |	On facial recognition
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:56,863	| IOT207 |	Was an NBC news story
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:06:03,263	| IOT207 |	It showed that many of the facial recognition algorithms that are being built right now are being built using photos
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:05,823	| IOT207 |	Scrape from websites without users
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:06,591	| IOT207 |	Consent
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:08,383	| IOT207 |	So IBM put out a big database
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,919	| IOT207 |	Got a year ago at
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:10,687	| IOT207 |	I think it was
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,455	| IOT207 |	And it was
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:18,111	| IOT207 |	Lauded is awesome because it had truly diverse people in it so a big problem with facial recognition is
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:20,159	| IOT207 |	When do you collect images from
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:22,463	| IOT207 |	People computer scientist had been using
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:24,767	| IOT207 |	A lot of images of white people so it was really
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:28,351	| IOT207 |	Not awesome when it came to any people of color
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,631	| IOT207 |	Or even women in some case
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:32,703	| IOT207 |	So IBM was like how we will fix that
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:34,495	| IOT207 |	And they annotated
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:36,287	| IOT207 |	A lot of photos what
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:38,591	| IOT207 |	We didn't realize they pulled those photos from
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:39,359	| IOT207 |	Flickr
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:41,663	| IOT207 |	An annotated them and then provided the database to pee
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:46,271	| IOT207 |	Write this is all to train the algorithm switch okay then
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:49,343	| IOT207 |	Makes sense to me and facial recognition is actually
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,367	| IOT207 |	Little more tricky than
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:52,415	| IOT207 |	Object recognition because
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,183	| IOT207 |	People
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:54,719	| IOT207 |	Change over time
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:58,559	| IOT207 |	So I get why they want to use these photos but just going out
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:01,887	| IOT207 |	On the web mean I don't know how many photos of Muir on the where the heck of a lot
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:07,007	| IOT207 |	There's more my dog that's irrelevant without my consent like that to train the models I'm not sure I'm thrilled with that
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:08,799	| IOT207 |	We are entering
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,847	| IOT207 |	Scary
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,615	| IOT207 |	Fairy
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:13,151	| IOT207 |	Deep water
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:17,503	| IOT207 |	Is here is an unknown area where we should be having conversation
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,271	| IOT207 |	It's not just about
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:22,879	| IOT207 |	How we get these images to train the data and also how we're training things have
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:26,975	| IOT207 |	But we're optimizing for in facial recognition is basically optimizing for accuracy
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:27,743	| IOT207 |	And the person
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:28,511	| IOT207 |	So
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:31,839	| IOT207 |	It's good that we recognize that these weren't accurate
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:34,143	| IOT207 |	Four huge swaths of the population
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:34,911	| IOT207 |	And try to fix that
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,447	| IOT207 |	But
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,983	| IOT207 |	It's scary to think
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:40,031	| IOT207 |	Your photographs might be
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:40,543	| IOT207 |	Used
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,103	| IOT207 |	I guess help improve this
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,919	| IOT207 |	Yay and then see it being used for something
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,967	| IOT207 |	Without people's consent like
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:48,991	| IOT207 |	Border control
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:53,599	| IOT207 |	It comes back to something you said many times and it really stuck with me
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:57,439	| IOT207 |	Once you give up the date at once you lose the data control
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,975	| IOT207 |	You don't know what's going to be done with it
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,511	| IOT207 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,047	| IOT207 |	It might be good if I be bad
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,839	| IOT207 |	But you know we should probably talk
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,119	| IOT207 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:08,703	| IOT207 |	Now will move into our next big story of the week
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,215	| IOT207 |	Witches
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,263	| IOT207 |	Which is another air crash
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,031	| IOT207 |	Is 1 in
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:18,431	| IOT207 |	Ethiopia which was also a Boeing 737 Max this was the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,199	| IOT207 |	302
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:21,759	| IOT207 |	5 months prior we saw the crash of
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,783	| IOT207 |	Lion Air
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:25,855	| IOT207 |	And we have talked about this on the show but basically the issue
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:30,207	| IOT207 |	The we highlighted was The Lion Air crash was a result of
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:32,767	| IOT207 |	A sensor reporting inaccurate info
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:33,279	| IOT207 |	Information
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:36,351	| IOT207 |	And the pilots of the plane
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,655	| IOT207 |	Fighting to keep the nose of the airplane
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,447	| IOT207 |	Up when the sensor
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,471	| IOT207 |	Which was inaccurate
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:42,751	| IOT207 |	Information was telling it
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:43,775	| IOT207 |	To go down
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:48,127	| IOT207 |	It was actually making the plane Point down
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:52,479	| IOT207 |	What town in the second part of this that we found out later
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,271	| IOT207 |	Was the Des Plaines
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,039	| IOT207 |	And this
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:59,903	| IOT207 |	Problem was actually a result of Boeing updating the 737 with
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:00,671	| IOT207 |	With a software update
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:03,231	| IOT207 |	That changed some of the way that
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,511	| IOT207 |	Spleen function
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,535	| IOT207 |	And in the pilots
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,071	| IOT207 |	We're not perhaps
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,863	| IOT207 |	Made completely aware
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:11,679	| IOT207 |	So when that malfunction happened
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:14,751	| IOT207 |	The pilots reacted as they have been trained to do
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:17,055	| IOT207 |	On the non updated version
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,871	| IOT207 |	And that helped lead to the crash
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,407	| IOT207 |	And thus
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,943	| IOT207 |	We got into a conversation about
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,223	| IOT207 |	Hey
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:25,503	| IOT207 |	Software updates
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,783	| IOT207 |	Need training
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,807	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,855	| IOT207 |	How all of that
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,623	| IOT207 |	That plays out
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,671	| IOT207 |	This week in the wake of the
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,695	| IOT207 |	Latest crash
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:34,463	| IOT207 |	Of this jet
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:35,487	| IOT207 |	Many
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,791	| IOT207 |	Many countries have grounded these
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,071	| IOT207 |	Particular Airlines
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,351	| IOT207 |	The US has yet
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,887	| IOT207 |	Two grounded as of Wednesday morning
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,447	| IOT207 |	But we're also seeing a lot of
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:48,799	| IOT207 |	Hot takes on this where they like you don't want to drive in a self-driving car
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,335	| IOT207 |	After this and
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,895	| IOT207 |	A lot of stories that are not helpful
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:56,223	| IOT207 |	They're freaking out and they don't talk about the things that we need to do
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:59,039	| IOT207 |	When we trust more of our infrastructure
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:01,343	| IOT207 |	Just software and automation
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,135	| IOT207 |	We need to think about
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:05,695	| IOT207 |	How we instill safeguard
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:09,791	| IOT207 |	The hot takes are making a very high-level logical leap
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:13,631	| IOT207 |	Details
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:15,935	| IOT207 |	That comes down to management software updates
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,727	| IOT207 |	Communication of those updates
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:21,823	| IOT207 |	At least in the case about when are playing me for self-driving cars self-driving you wouldn't have to
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,871	| IOT207 |	Train the person so to speak
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,151	| IOT207 |	After software update
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:25,663	| IOT207 |	Testing
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,991	| IOT207 |	Are there so many factors no different than
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,271	| IOT207 |	Then
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,039	| IOT207 |	Any kind of
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:31,551	| IOT207 |	Suffer
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:36,415	| IOT207 |	Has to be properly tested has to be documented has to be communicated
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:36,927	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:40,511	| IOT207 |	VDS inherent dangers in relying upon
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:44,607	| IOT207 |	Sensors that could be program faulty or could fail I suppose but
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:48,191	| IOT207 |	To make that logical leap like hey this is a problem at all self
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:51,519	| IOT207 |	Driving or whatever Vehicles is just not smart
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:55,103	| IOT207 |	And it brings home to me the fact that
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:57,663	| IOT207 |	Even if we have self-driving vehicles
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:59,711	| IOT207 |	We're still going to have to have
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,991	| IOT207 |	People responsible
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:01,503	| IOT207 |	For them
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:02,783	| IOT207 |	Somewhere
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,063	| IOT207 |	Are in the chain so
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:06,367	| IOT207 |	I actually wrote about this for IEEE
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:08,159	| IOT207 |	After interviewing a bunch of
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,487	| IOT207 |	Connect to car makers and this was actually a big topic
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,535	| IOT207 |	This winter is CES
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:19,423	| IOT207 |	Is everyone acknowledging that yes there will still be people in the chain and the reason is
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:22,239	| IOT207 |	Sometimes software can fail sometimes computers will
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:23,519	| IOT207 |	Have
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:25,311	| IOT207 |	Weird situations that they're like
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:27,103	| IOT207 |	I don't know what to do here
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:28,383	| IOT207 |	And that's what a human operator
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:29,663	| IOT207 |	Take over
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,711	| IOT207 |	There always has to be in my opinion a
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:35,039	| IOT207 |	I take over mode that is very quickly and easily excessive
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:38,111	| IOT207 |	So I think the big thing to think about is
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:38,879	| IOT207 |	Hey
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:42,207	| IOT207 |	If you're updating software on something and that's actually what happened
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:45,279	| IOT207 |	Boeing updated the software and said
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:49,375	| IOT207 |	Did it was similar enough to Prior generations of the plane
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:51,423	| IOT207 |	The pilots didn't need to be retrained
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,447	| IOT207 |	Because that was something that would
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:54,239	| IOT207 |	Cost a lot of money and time
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,007	| IOT207 |	It would lead
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:58,591	| IOT207 |	Customers Airline customers to say yeah we're going to pass on this pretty
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:01,151	| IOT207 |	Eurasian boy wants to sell planes
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,687	| IOT207 |	Suicide no
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,711	| IOT207 |	You don't need
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:05,503	| IOT207 |	Extra training for your Pilots
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:07,039	| IOT207 |	And the FAA said
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,063	| IOT207 |	Alright sure
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,599	| IOT207 |	And then
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,879	| IOT207 |	Didn't get the training
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,671	| IOT207 |	And this is what happen
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:14,975	| IOT207 |	Fence and so there's a lot of layers here
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:17,279	| IOT207 |	Quick-take of
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,583	| IOT207 |	Connected devices that are
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,631	| IOT207 |	Controlled by computers are bad is not the right time
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:24,191	| IOT207 |	We're going there we have to go there
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:27,263	| IOT207 |	There are things that are too complex for
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,799	| IOT207 |	People
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:29,311	| IOT207 |	To handle
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:33,919	| IOT207 |	And I do believe self-driving cars will ultimately be safer
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:35,967	| IOT207 |	And as we add software
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,015	| IOT207 |	To these devices
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:41,599	| IOT207 |	We're going to have to establish new regulatory procedures
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:43,391	| IOT207 |	Recognize how much software
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:44,671	| IOT207 |	Change
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,975	| IOT207 |	The operational experience
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:49,535	| IOT207 |	And then enforce basic rules like
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,303	| IOT207 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,095	| IOT207 |	Rules around testing software
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,887	| IOT207 |	Rules around training The Operators
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,399	| IOT207 |	Etcetera
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,447	| IOT207 |	Okay that was like
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,215	| IOT207 |	Hohhot
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:58,751	| IOT207 |	Haha take on the hot take
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,287	| IOT207 |	Which was a cooler take
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,079	| IOT207 |	So
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:05,151	| IOT207 |	Let's talk about smart displays because Google
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:05,663	| IOT207 |	Has just gone
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:06,943	| IOT207 |	Got nuts
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:08,479	| IOT207 |	Google is God nuts
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:10,015	| IOT207 |	Continued conversation
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:13,855	| IOT207 |	Are smart displays is now out for Google devices
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,647	| IOT207 |	This means what
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:22,047	| IOT207 |	What this means just like your smart speakers either you or Echo devices or your Google home devices
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:24,095	| IOT207 |	You can start a conversation with a
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:26,911	| IOT207 |	Google smart display and then continue it
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:28,447	| IOT207 |	Up until now
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:30,239	| IOT207 |	You would ask question like
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,519	| IOT207 |	What is the weather
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:34,847	| IOT207 |	But you couldn't follow up with what is the weather for tomorrow how about
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:35,615	| IOT207 |	Next week
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:40,991	| IOT207 |	Cancel. Now you can do that we tested it right before the show on my Google home hub here in the office in it
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:44,063	| IOT207 |	Work pretty well there's even a little in Decatur now
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:46,367	| IOT207 |	At the top left to show you visually that
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:49,695	| IOT207 |	The display is still listening for a continued conversation
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:50,975	| IOT207 |	Yes
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,255	| IOT207 |	Next Google story
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,535	| IOT207 |	This isn't
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:54,303	| IOT207 |	White
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,327	| IOT207 |	Coyote story but
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:56,607	| IOT207 |	It may be soon
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:14:00,959	| IOT207 |	So Google has moved its machine learning for speech recognition down to the phone
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,751	| IOT207 |	I got this this morning it was like hey
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:06,335	| IOT207 |	Do you watch faster speech recognition on your keyboard
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,359	| IOT207 |	Download this
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,407	| IOT207 |	It was small was actually very small
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,455	| IOT207 |	What and it's not yours
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:11,967	| IOT207 |	Faster
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:18,623	| IOT207 |	Because up until now everything would go out to the cloud Google would do its natural language processing and and send it back to you
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,647	| IOT207 |	It works offline
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:20,927	| IOT207 |	Yes
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,695	| IOT207 |	And that's what
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:24,255	| IOT207 |	Exciting so guess right now it's on the phone
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:27,071	| IOT207 |	Yay phones have a lot of processing power
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:27,839	| IOT207 |	They have a lot of storage
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:28,351	| IOT207 |	But
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:30,143	| IOT207 |	Imagine this on your smart display
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:35,263	| IOT207 |	Suddenly local control of things or things when there is no internet access
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:37,567	| IOT207 |	As long as it's not a cloud to Cloud integration
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:39,615	| IOT207 |	We could start seeing local control
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:40,895	| IOT207 |	So that would be awesome
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:43,199	| IOT207 |	I'm a fan
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:44,479	| IOT207 |	Google pixel phone
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:50,111	| IOT207 |	Google pixel phones there was a feature announced that last year's Google IO called Lookout
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:53,695	| IOT207 |	That is now available to pixel phones I have not used it on my pixel
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:55,743	| IOT207 |	But what Lookout is
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:58,559	| IOT207 |	It is a way for the phone
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,095	| IOT207 |	To provide
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:04,447	| IOT207 |	Information about someone's surroundings meaning somebody who is a visually impaired
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:09,311	| IOT207 |	So the phone could be your set of eyes R example with Lookout
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,079	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:14,943	| IOT207 |	If you're visually impaired you can hold your phone around the room and it could tell you what objects are in there dog
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:16,479	| IOT207 |	Speaker table
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:16,991	| IOT207 |	Chair
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,271	| IOT207 |	So very cool
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:19,551	| IOT207 |	Also
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,831	| IOT207 |	Are the accessibility friend
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,111	| IOT207 |	We've got an update
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:22,879	| IOT207 |	From Microsoft
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:27,231	| IOT207 |	Right now Microsoft has a similar product called seeing AI
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:30,303	| IOT207 |	And they are pushing forward with some new features
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:32,351	| IOT207 |	With their custom vision service
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:36,447	| IOT207 |	To explore photos by touch which is a really interesting so
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,215	| IOT207 |	You can
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:41,311	| IOT207 |	Can I have a spoken description of something on a screen if you touch the screen
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:44,639	| IOT207 |	They brought this to the iPad as well now so it's not just on
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:49,759	| IOT207 |	They've also brought this seeing AI to iPads what you did not have before so
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,807	| IOT207 |	They are pushing forward with
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:53,087	| IOT207 |	Accessibility things
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:53,599	| IOT207 |	2
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,391	| IOT207 |	You don't make life better
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,927	| IOT207 |	But using the cloud and sensors
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:59,231	| IOT207 |	That's awesome yes I actually
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:02,303	| IOT207 |	After I did another talk at South by Southwest
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:02,815	| IOT207 |	Yesterday
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:07,679	| IOT207 |	And afterwards somebody who worked on Google Assistant doing accessibility stuff came up and talked
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:12,799	| IOT207 |	And I was really excited to see the enthusiasm with which she
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:15,103	| IOT207 |	She didn't tell me anything that was like particularly
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,895	| IOT207 |	She obviously didn't share the
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:17,663	| IOT207 |	Product roadmap
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:24,063	| IOT207 |	But we talked very badly about the need for accessibility and it felt very much like this was an important initiative
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:26,623	| IOT207 |	Obviously for her personally because it's her job
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,391	| IOT207 |	But even at goo
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:31,487	| IOT207 |	I'm encouraged as we bring voice
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,255	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:35,071	| IOT207 |	Speakers more broadly into our home
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,351	| IOT207 |	We're also
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,655	| IOT207 |	Bringing technology to people who
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:40,447	| IOT207 |	May have historically had a difficult time
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:43,263	| IOT207 |	Yeah I think this is a
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:45,311	| IOT207 |	I want saying overlooked Market but I think
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:51,711	| IOT207 |	A lot of developers and product makers out there don't dismiss it but don't give it the attention it deserves I see a lot of opportunity
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:57,599	| IOT207 |	Be there I just mentioned to you Stacey before the show that my comp sci Professor reached out to me this morning saying
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:02,207	| IOT207 |	Hey we've got a blind student in the music program year college and
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:04,767	| IOT207 |	They can't use the music Boards
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:08,863	| IOT207 |	Programming music Boards because the button so we can see them they light up and
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:12,191	| IOT207 |	Green might be in a certain instrument red light mean another instrument and
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:17,311	| IOT207 |	So we're going to try and buy some either interface or a braille silicone keyboard overlay for this person
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,359	| IOT207 |	I never would have thought to do that
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,383	| IOT207 |	I mean there's just so many
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:24,735	| IOT207 |	So many opportunities in this area for four Good Hits just a bit mazes
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:26,015	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:28,831	| IOT207 |	In a lot of ways and this is actually philosophy at Amazon
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:31,135	| IOT207 |	Designing things that are accessible
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,951	| IOT207 |	Make it easier and better for
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:35,231	| IOT207 |	Any number of other people
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:38,815	| IOT207 |	So when you're doing things for the visually impaired
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:42,911	| IOT207 |	You're actually also helping people who are maybe older and unable to
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:43,935	| IOT207 |	C as well
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,727	| IOT207 |	Okay moving
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,031	| IOT207 |	Rachel all we have
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:49,311	| IOT207 |	An appliance store
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,383	| IOT207 |	GE Appliances has signed up
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:54,175	| IOT207 |	To add Wi-Fi
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:56,223	| IOT207 |	Capability via serrant
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:56,991	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:58,271	| IOT207 |	If you guys are like what is happening
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:01,087	| IOT207 |	Basically sierant is a company
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:02,879	| IOT207 |	Was actually bought by Cypress recent
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:06,975	| IOT207 |	Is a company that makes it easier to get devices online
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,023	| IOT207 |	What happens is
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:12,095	| IOT207 |	It uses what is essentially a public Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,631	| IOT207 |	Created by
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:17,215	| IOT207 |	Most Wi-Fi routers from isps today
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:19,007	| IOT207 |	Have a public setting and a
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:19,519	| IOT207 |	A private setting
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:21,567	| IOT207 |	You use the private setting
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:22,591	| IOT207 |	But the public setting
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:26,431	| IOT207 |	It can actually be used for like a cable providers Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:28,735	| IOT207 |	Or a company like Siri
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:31,039	| IOT207 |	Associate has these deals in place to use that
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:34,879	| IOT207 |	What it does is the connected Appliance gets on that public net
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:35,647	| IOT207 |	Work in the moment
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:38,975	| IOT207 |	You plug it in it Finds Its token in the cloud
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:40,255	| IOT207 |	K'Nex
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:43,839	| IOT207 |	And then you can connect it as a consumer if you want to
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:47,679	| IOT207 |	And then once you connect it you're going to do a hand over from
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,447	| IOT207 |	Public network
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:49,471	| IOT207 |	Your personal net
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,543	| IOT207 |	So Electrolux is done this
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,335	| IOT207 |	They were one of the first big customers
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:54,847	| IOT207 |	Hours for Sears
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,127	| IOT207 |	Bose has another
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:58,943	| IOT207 |	And now geappliances Society
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:03,295	| IOT207 |	The reason I'm interested in this and the reason I'm telling you about this
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,319	| IOT207 |	Is because
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:08,927	| IOT207 |	That public network makes it possible for your appliances to be online without you bringing
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:14,047	| IOT207 |	Which could worrisome people I actually think it's
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:16,863	| IOT207 |	Mostly a positive and the reason I say that
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,655	| IOT207 |	Is because if
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:21,471	| IOT207 |	GE has this always connected device in your
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:24,031	| IOT207 |	You can actually
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:25,823	| IOT207 |	When you call in and say hey
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:28,383	| IOT207 |	My water filter doesn't seem to be working
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,431	| IOT207 |	They can say something along the lines of
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:35,807	| IOT207 |	Well would you mind if I looked up Diagnostics on that device and if you opt-in
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:37,343	| IOT207 |	They can say okay
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:43,743	| IOT207 |	Look up the Diagnostics and then suddenly tell you from afar what's wrong and then send the repair person out with
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,511	| IOT207 |	With the right
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,023	| IOT207 |	Heart
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,559	| IOT207 |	Time Saver
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:52,703	| IOT207 |	Yeah overall I think this is a positive but I do think it's something consumers should know so you might be bringing in
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:53,983	| IOT207 |	Appliance that
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:56,799	| IOT207 |	Is connected to the internet even though you haven't connected it
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:20:00,383	| IOT207 |	I would hope that Appliance companies are not
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:02,175	| IOT207 |	Using data from this without
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:02,687	| IOT207 |	Your permission
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:03,967	| IOT207 |	But it is something
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:06,271	| IOT207 |	And I do think ultimately
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:09,599	| IOT207 |	It is a good feature having had devices in my home
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,623	| IOT207 |	Home appliances breakdown
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:14,975	| IOT207 |	I regret actually every time one of my appliances breaks down because I'm like
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:15,999	| IOT207 |	Smart
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:16,511	| IOT207 |	I could just be like
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:20,351	| IOT207 |	I'm sending someone out with this part to fix
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:22,399	| IOT207 |	Yeah even some of the
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:24,191	| IOT207 |	I'll call them
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:29,567	| IOT207 |	Little glitches in cooking with the June oven for example from time to time something has happened in the past 2 years
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:33,663	| IOT207 |	Going to customer support or like do you mind if we get the logs off of your machine and
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:35,967	| IOT207 |	You know they ask him in advance
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:37,759	| IOT207 |	And you either concentric or don't
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:40,831	| IOT207 |	But having that data has solved the problem every single time
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:46,207	| IOT207 |	Yeah so as long as there's transparency around the connectivity and transparency around
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,999	| IOT207 |	Opting into sharing the data
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,023	| IOT207 |	All
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:50,303	| IOT207 |	Or it
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:53,375	| IOT207 |	So I thought I'd share that with you guys cuz it's probably not something
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:53,887	| IOT207 |	You're thinking about
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,423	| IOT207 |	And finally

EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:14,111	| IOT207 |	Yeah there's a really good blog post on that Euro site just reiterating
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:14,623	| IOT207 |	That
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:17,952	| IOT207 |	Amazon chairs that Euro philosophy about

EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:25,120	| IOT207 |	And they say with every new product and feature reveals this is very promising to me

EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:37,664	| IOT207 |	They only collect Network diagnostic information improve performance at such
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:41,760	| IOT207 |	And they try to actively minimizing outdated a access
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:45,088	| IOT207 |	M&a to access your data they treated with the utmost security so
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:47,392	| IOT207 |	I mean that's a very positive thing of it

EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:00,704	| IOT207 |	But we can take this full circle
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,216	| IOT207 |	Because
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:07,616	| IOT207 |	Cheetah habitat about Charter and their device management Security Services Amazon's actually building this to

EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,168	| IOT207 |	So
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:45,568	| IOT207 |	I have these fabulous Z-Wave Outlet plugs and I've had them for years all around my house that using for my Halloween Christmas and any other random
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,336	| IOT207 |	Outdoor decorations
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:47,360	| IOT207 |	Want to use it for
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:49,664	| IOT207 |	They are made by Jasco
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:56,576	| IOT207 |	There's actually a version of this on Amazon it's got the Chasco 45 704 and it's about
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,344	| IOT207 |	$28
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,368	| IOT207 |	Which is an awesome deal
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:00,928	| IOT207 |	Jessica was the company that makes
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:04,512	| IOT207 |	The same product for both Honeywell and GE
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,560	| IOT207 |	But GE
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:09,120	| IOT207 |	He has their product which is the GE and Brighton
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:11,424	| IOT207 |	Z-Wave plus outdoor smart plug switch
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:13,984	| IOT207 |	That sells for 40 to 50
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:15,520	| IOT207 |	I Amazon
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:19,104	| IOT207 |	And then Honeywell also has a Honeywell Z-Wave plus outdoor on off
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:21,152	| IOT207 |	Like an appliance switch for $40
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:22,688	| IOT207 |	So
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,992	| IOT207 |	You have the same product
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:26,528	| IOT207 |	Couple different prices
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:29,344	| IOT207 |	The downside of this product is
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:31,392	| IOT207 |	It is not IP
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:31,904	| IOT207 |	Faded
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:34,976	| IOT207 |	It is rated for a UL standard
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:36,256	| IOT207 |	Because it's pul
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,536	| IOT207 |	To get that standard I have
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:38,816	| IOT207 |	How to pay the UL to see the whole
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,864	| IOT207 |	It is water resistant
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:41,632	| IOT207 |	Basically
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:42,656	| IOT207 |	It is not water
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,448	| IOT207 |	So
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,984	| IOT207 |	I would not plug this in
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:47,520	| IOT207 |	A place that
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:48,544	| IOT207 |	You know it's going to be
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,336	| IOT207 |	Sitting in a puddle
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:51,872	| IOT207 |	Immersed in rain
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:56,480	| IOT207 |	But I have had it outside during the winter holiday season
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:58,784	| IOT207 |	And every now and then I do have to reset
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:01,600	| IOT207 |	I have to admit my GF eyes
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:04,160	| IOT207 |	Click on and I have to reset those but
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:05,440	| IOT207 |	It's pretty good
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:08,512	| IOT207 |	I wonder if using that plug will
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:13,376	| IOT207 |	Get your over most of the hump here for a from a water-resistant standpoint but maybe some kind of
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,680	| IOT207 |	External cover over it
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:17,728	| IOT207 |	Derek help do the trick
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:20,544	| IOT207 |	I mean I keep mine on my balcony so it's covered
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:21,312	| IOT207 |	Anyway
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:23,104	| IOT207 |	I have another one outside
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:24,896	| IOT207 |	I'm on the wall in
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:26,688	| IOT207 |	Don't think that's covered
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:28,480	| IOT207 |	And I have it
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:31,552	| IOT207 |	I mean also be smart like I plug it in and it's facing down
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:33,344	| IOT207 |	It is very rugged
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,880	| IOT207 |	It is not a wimpy plug
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:36,928	| IOT207 |	So basically if water doesn't get into the outlet
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,208	| IOT207 |	You're fine
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:39,744	| IOT207 |	Sometimes I wrap it with Saran Wrap
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:41,792	| IOT207 |	Can help
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,560	| IOT207 |	They may not look
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:45,632	| IOT207 |	The prettiest in this is not at this is a big chunky plug
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,936	| IOT207 |	But that is really
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:49,984	| IOT207 |	Option we found for you and then
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:52,800	| IOT207 |	The only other thing we could think of
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:54,336	| IOT207 |	Is someone left
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:57,408	| IOT207 |	Voicemail a couple months back where they use an
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:58,688	| IOT207 |	Outdoor rated
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,968	| IOT207 |	USB charger for
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:00,480	| IOT207 |	Your phone

EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:12,768	| IOT207 |	What's basically a portable battery that you would use to charge your phone on the go but they repurposed at 4

EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:32,736	| IOT207 |	Do it as needed so that's another option for you
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,016	| IOT207 |	That might work
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:36,064	| IOT207 |	Good luck with your wyzecam
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:36,832	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:37,600	| IOT207 |	Good luck with
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:38,624	| IOT207 |	This particular project
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,160	| IOT207 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:41,440	| IOT207 |	I feel
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:43,232	| IOT207 |	Like it is time
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:46,816	| IOT207 |	For us to go and visit the magical bars of
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:47,584	| IOT207 |	Austin
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:48,352	| IOT207 |	We will take you
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:52,192	| IOT207 |	To the yonomi offices because you know me did
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:53,728	| IOT207 |	Have me in two Hostess panel
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:54,240	| IOT207 |	Where
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:56,288	| IOT207 |	It is South by Southwest
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:59,360	| IOT207 |	We are having a really in-depth conversation
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:00,128	| IOT207 |	About data
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:02,944	| IOT207 |	Privacy and what's going right and what's going wrong
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:03,712	| IOT207 |	With a smart home
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:04,992	| IOT207 |	Stay tuned for that
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:06,272	| IOT207 |	After a message
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:12,672	| IOT207 |	Sponsor. We are taking a quick break from the air
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:15,744	| IOT207 |	Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:20,608	| IOT207 |	This week sponsor is a pharaoh and we are back with Joe Britt the CEO of a pharaoh
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:23,424	| IOT207 |	Last week we talked about the work if arrow is doing with Mitsubishi
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:25,984	| IOT207 |	And the Pharaohs effort to create a horizontal payment
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:30,592	| IOT207 |	So Jo do you mind reminding our listeners what it is
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:34,432	| IOT207 |	As you mentioned a pharaoh provides an iot platform that
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:36,736	| IOT207 |	Simplifies how you connect really anything
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:42,880	| IOT207 |	To the internet we can help you build a business case and take you all the way through roll out and ongoing management as well as data analyst
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:44,672	| IOT207 |	Customers tell us that
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:45,696	| IOT207 |	Pharaoh is the best choice
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:49,280	| IOT207 |	Experience and developer productivity
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:50,304	| IOT207 |	A beautiful design
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:51,328	| IOT207 |	Easy to use
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:52,096	| IOT207 |	Very fast
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:53,376	| IOT207 |	Very very
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,144	| IOT207 |	Secure
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:56,448	| IOT207 |	So a lot of customers decide that
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:29:01,056	| IOT207 |	Instead of going to an outside platform they want to build their own hardware and software to connect your devices
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:04,384	| IOT207 |	But why should customers use a platform instead
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:07,200	| IOT207 |	Let me answer that from two different perspective
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:12,064	| IOT207 |	Well every customer and every device is different there's a lot that's in common
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:12,832	| IOT207 |	In iot
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:14,624	| IOT207 |	Overtime that commonality
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:16,160	| IOT207 |	Becomes better understood
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:17,696	| IOT207 |	Better automated
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:18,464	| IOT207 |	Better integrated
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:22,304	| IOT207 |	It's what you end up with is actually a platform
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:23,840	| IOT207 |	And it becomes its own product
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,376	| IOT207 |	What analogy
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:28,704	| IOT207 |	Is the operating system on a computer and the apps that run on it
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:29,728	| IOT207 |	In the early days
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:30,496	| IOT207 |	We didn't have a break
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:33,824	| IOT207 |	Didn't have compilers libraries debugger
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:34,848	| IOT207 |	All the modern soft
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,384	| IOT207 |	Accelerate
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:40,224	| IOT207 |	Development in people had to either write applications to run on the hardware Direct
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:41,760	| IOT207 |	Go ahead to build their own topper
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,320	| IOT207 |	Application
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:45,856	| IOT207 |	The same sort of thing is happening
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:47,904	| IOT207 |	It's more complex
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,440	| IOT207 |	Because it's
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:52,000	| IOT207 |	It's a different environment that the software is running
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:53,280	| IOT207 |	That's much more varied
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:55,584	| IOT207 |	Even harder to build your own
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:59,936	| IOT207 |	And even if you do it's really hard to keep it portable hard to keep it reliable hard.
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:01,216	| IOT207 |	Maintain and enhance
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:04,032	| IOT207 |	And it's something that you have to do from one project
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:05,312	| IOT207 |	To another
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:10,176	| IOT207 |	We really think that the time has come for it to have its own proper platform layer
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:10,944	| IOT207 |	And of course
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:13,504	| IOT207 |	We on our customers think a pharaoh is
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:15,040	| IOT207 |	The best iot platform out there
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:17,344	| IOT207 |	All right and what is the second perspective
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:18,624	| IOT207 |	II
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:19,392	| IOT207 |	Perspective
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:22,720	| IOT207 |	Is from going over all the questions that we need to ask
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:25,280	| IOT207 |	For an iot project actually starts
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:28,864	| IOT207 |	Let me hear the top three the first one and this is critical
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:30,144	| IOT207 |	Is onboarding
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:34,752	| IOT207 |	Can the users phone make a fast and reliable connection with the device they want to control
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:35,776	| IOT207 |	With a pharaoh
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:37,312	| IOT207 |	Simple QR code scan is all at
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:38,848	| IOT207 |	Next point is
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:39,616	| IOT207 |	Scale
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:42,944	| IOT207 |	Can the system scale to meet The Man Without loss of quality
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:45,248	| IOT207 |	Today if there'll has hundreds of thousands of
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:46,016	| IOT207 |	The devices in
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:48,064	| IOT207 |	The field and the service is designed
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:54,464	| IOT207 |	Descale far beyond that I'd like to share is around security is the whole process secure
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:56,000	| IOT207 |	Immune to Fleet scale attack
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:31:00,096	| IOT207 |	Afero provides a VPN like tunnel for your devices
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:01,888	| IOT207 |	Regardless of how they connect
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:03,168	| IOT207 |	And the list goes on but
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:05,728	| IOT207 |	Most customers find it very costly and time-consuming
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:08,800	| IOT207 |	To assemble the teams and skills necessary
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:10,080	| IOT207 |	To build a system
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:11,872	| IOT207 |	They can successfully address all of
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:13,920	| IOT207 |	Excellent
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:17,504	| IOT207 |	Please remind us where we should go to get more information about a pharaoh
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:19,296	| IOT207 |	Apeiro. IO
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:21,344	| IOT207 |	/ Go - big is
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:22,368	| IOT207 |	The best place to start
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:26,464	| IOT207 |	If you're a developer also check out developer. Of pharaoh. IO and
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:32,864	| IOT207 |	You might also want to take a look at all the other resources that we have on a Vera. IO
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:38,752	| IOT207 |	I am Stacy Higginbotham I have a show called

EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:53,344	| IOT207 |	Let's start
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:54,368	| IOT207 |	With
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:56,416	| IOT207 |	Alright how everyone

EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:09,472	| IOT207 |	Or by connecting to Smart devices in the home
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,264	| IOT207 |	Pretty good
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:14,336	| IOT207 |	My name is Tim Hunter I work with a gummy called Dallas

EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:56,064	| IOT207 |	Hi my name is Mark Reimer work for a company called Charter Communications under the Spectrum brand
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:58,368	| IOT207 |	And I lie connected home and home security products
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:00,672	| IOT207 |	Awesome alright
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:03,488	| IOT207 |	So one of the challenges with the smart home I feel is
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:07,840	| IOT207 |	Everything's really expensive and a lot of us we
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:08,608	| IOT207 |	Don't
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:12,960	| IOT207 |	The mainstream consumer many of us are probably tinkering nerds who love to play with stuff
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:14,496	| IOT207 |	But for the normal people
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:17,312	| IOT207 |	It can be really hard to understand why you might want something
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:19,616	| IOT207 |	Disconnected and talks back to the internet
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:21,408	| IOT207 |	Lord only knows
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:23,712	| IOT207 |	So I would like to ask each of you
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:24,736	| IOT207 |	For a time that
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:26,528	| IOT207 |	Smart devices
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:27,296	| IOT207 |	Procedure life
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:28,064	| IOT207 |	Or just
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:28,576	| IOT207 |	Made it better
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:34,208	| IOT207 |	So the first thing that came to mind for me was my smart thermostat
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:40,352	| IOT207 |	I have an ecobee and whenever we go on vacation my husband I like to travel at we'd totally forget to program
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:42,144	| IOT207 |	Thermostat into away mode
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:47,520	| IOT207 |	Turn off at the gate every time we're opening up the app and we're setting a thermostat on vacation mode
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:50,336	| IOT207 |	Which keeps are kitties happy at home
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,872	| IOT207 |	But we don't use too much power either
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:55,200	| IOT207 |	So I've been doing this for 25 years so
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:56,736	| IOT207 |	There's a lot of pain I have to get past
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:57,504	| IOT207 |	Come up with an answer
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,344	| IOT207 |	I think that
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:02,112	| IOT207 |	For me
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:04,928	| IOT207 |	The value that I can we actually helps me
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:07,744	| IOT207 |	Is when it brings information that
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:09,792	| IOT207 |	Affects me
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:13,120	| IOT207 |	And specifically I mean such as about turning the light on her off lips
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:14,656	| IOT207 |	Methadone
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:16,192	| IOT207 |	Just a minor thing it's about
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:18,752	| IOT207 |	Maybe knowing the pollutants that are in my house
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:22,336	| IOT207 |	I think that is something to me this importance of an air sensor
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:25,920	| IOT207 |	And in technology like that they can help me be more aware
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:28,736	| IOT207 |	The hidden things that are going on that I don't know about
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:32,320	| IOT207 |	So I could shamelessly self-promote but
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:34,624	| IOT207 |	Was told not to do that
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,648	| IOT207 |	You right now
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:37,952	| IOT207 |	So I'm not going to say my Roomba
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:38,464	| IOT207 |	But
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:43,072	| IOT207 |	Exactly you're onto me
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:51,264	| IOT207 |	My camera is so I have two little ones at home I have a 7 month old and a three-year-old and
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:54,848	| IOT207 |	Last night for example I put my three-year-old down and I
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:57,152	| IOT207 |	Went out and took the dog for a walk and I get a notice
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:58,432	| IOT207 |	Application on my phone
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:34:59,456	| IOT207 |	Of movement
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:01,504	| IOT207 |	And as far as I knew she was
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,272	| IOT207 |	Completely asleep
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,576	| IOT207 |	Open up the app
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:06,112	| IOT207 |	Can I look at the camera
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:08,416	| IOT207 |	And she is sitting on her potty in her room
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:11,488	| IOT207 |	With the book
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:13,536	| IOT207 |	Reading it like a newspaper
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:15,072	| IOT207 |	Until I
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:18,400	| IOT207 |	Set my my wife attacks and said you should probably go in and
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:19,680	| IOT207 |	Take take care of
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:23,264	| IOT207 |	So that's a learned behavior
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:24,288	| IOT207 |	Yes
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,312	| IOT207 |	That's right
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:29,152	| IOT207 |	So I have I have two teenage boys at home
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:30,432	| IOT207 |	16 + 13
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:31,968	| IOT207 |	And if you have teenage
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:35,296	| IOT207 |	Boys in your house then you know that they don't know how to close
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:38,112	| IOT207 |	They don't know how to close garage door
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:39,648	| IOT207 |	And they don't know how to lock
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:40,160	| IOT207 |	Front doors
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:41,696	| IOT207 |	And so
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:44,256	| IOT207 |	Things that I'm sure have saved my life are
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:47,328	| IOT207 |	Smart garage door openers and sensors and
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:49,120	| IOT207 |	Certainly a Smart Lock
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:49,632	| IOT207 |	On the front door
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:53,472	| IOT207 |	Don't have the 2 a.m. oh my God is the garage door
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:56,032	| IOT207 |	That's a good one
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:36:00,384	| IOT207 |	First thing that comes to mind for me as my smart irrigation controller
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:04,736	| IOT207 |	Cuz I have an automation that says if anyone's walking around my backyard after Dark
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:07,040	| IOT207 |	Like 10 11 12 midnight
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:08,832	| IOT207 |	Turn on the water
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:10,880	| IOT207 |	Spray-on recorded send the video to me
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:12,416	| IOT207 |	So
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:17,536	| IOT207 |	I've yet to catch someone but I'm waiting for that day all uploaded to Twitter as soon as it happens
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:20,352	| IOT207 |	That's it that's the kind of automation you're like
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:22,400	| IOT207 |	Come on
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:27,008	| IOT207 |	I can't win it happens I want you to call and we'll
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:27,520	| IOT207 |	Will put it up on the web
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,312	| IOT207 |	Cuz I think we'd all like to
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:31,872	| IOT207 |	All right
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:32,896	| IOT207 |	What I'm noticing is
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:34,432	| IOT207 |	That a lot of these things
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:35,456	| IOT207 |	AR
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:36,736	| IOT207 |	They're not smart
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:39,808	| IOT207 |	Their automations there one off
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,856	| IOT207 |	Did they don't work together in
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:43,648	| IOT207 |	I think that's
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:46,720	| IOT207 |	Kind of been the issue that a lot of people have when we're trying to talk about this
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:48,768	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:52,352	| IOT207 |	Alexa Smart Home in the people who like okay yeah and then
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,120	| IOT207 |	PetSmart
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:54,656	| IOT207 |	I really wanted it to
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:55,168	| IOT207 |	Two Lakes
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:57,216	| IOT207 |	Assist me somehow in my life
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:37:01,568	| IOT207 |	You know I'm I'm thinking about the devices that really make a difference in my life
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:03,360	| IOT207 |	Those that do are super smart
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:04,640	| IOT207 |	And they have a i
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:06,176	| IOT207 |	And they're using their data for
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:06,688	| IOT207 |	Mybatis
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:10,272	| IOT207 |	So then the question I have for you guys
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:12,064	| IOT207 |	Cuz of the consumer that's what I want
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:13,088	| IOT207 |	I want my life to be
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:13,600	| IOT207 |	Easier
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:15,136	| IOT207 |	For the most part
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:16,672	| IOT207 |	So
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:19,232	| IOT207 |	Why do businesses want to sell us
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:20,000	| IOT207 |	That's what is
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:21,792	| IOT207 |	What is your goal in
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:23,072	| IOT207 |	Getting us to buy bezoar
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:24,096	| IOT207 |	Building this
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:26,400	| IOT207 |	Am I can start for that one
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:28,960	| IOT207 |	You know in the case of tendrils
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:29,984	| IOT207 |	We work with utility come
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:31,776	| IOT207 |	And so
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:38,176	| IOT207 |	We've been figuring out how to fine-tune the messages for consumers we know for some folks it's about being a little bit more green
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:40,480	| IOT207 |	That doesn't resonate with everybody it could be about
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:43,552	| IOT207 |	Call protect me from a high bill
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:48,160	| IOT207 |	Help me from being surprised but I bill before it's too late or something similar
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:49,184	| IOT207 |	Are you at the club
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:57,376	| IOT207 |	That's what you want to think about energy that much that's one of the big takeaways is you know a lot of us in this room might be energy nerds or Gadget
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:37:59,680	| IOT207 |	Nerds but that's not the general population it's
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:01,728	| IOT207 |	How can we make it happen behind the
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:07,360	| IOT207 |	So the customer gets the best outcome they're comfortable and they're happy with
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:10,944	| IOT207 |	Do you know using green energy or spending my son their bill but they don't have to work any harder
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:11,456	| IOT207 |	The device.
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:13,760	| IOT207 |	So
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:15,552	| IOT207 |	I want to address the
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:16,320	| IOT207 |	The question directly
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:19,904	| IOT207 |	What's the motivation behind people that are building products
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,416	| IOT207 |	Putting me out there
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:22,464	| IOT207 |	Motivation
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:25,280	| IOT207 |	Is they want to make money becomes
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:27,328	| IOT207 |	Successful in any other things
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:29,888	| IOT207 |	I think that the peace that they miss
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:33,728	| IOT207 |	And that only very few get is it really is
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:36,032	| IOT207 |	About the experience and experience has to be
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:37,312	| IOT207 |	Expression freeze pasta
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:39,872	| IOT207 |	You mentioned earlier you said these
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:42,432	| IOT207 |	The smart switches any smart lights these are these are expensive
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:44,736	| IOT207 |	When will you think about expense
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:46,272	| IOT207 |	Don't you stop at the Dollar
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:50,368	| IOT207 |	Think about the time it takes for that to be put in think about the prostration
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:53,440	| IOT207 |	When that pickle technology from company a doesn't work the way it's supposed to
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:56,768	| IOT207 |	Especially when you find out the product from company a doesn't work
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:58,048	| IOT207 |	Maybe
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:39:01,376	| IOT207 |	There's a lot of the challenges there that when we talk about the cost
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:02,400	| IOT207 |	A bad experience
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:04,448	| IOT207 |	We really
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:06,496	| IOT207 |	In general the industry doesn't really think about
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:08,288	| IOT207 |	That full-on cost
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:09,568	| IOT207 |	And if it's there
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:12,384	| IOT207 |	And I think that we need to do a better job of doing that
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:18,528	| IOT207 |	Sopra my motivation perspective I think the motivation should be to create relationship with customers or Everlasting
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:19,040	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:22,112	| IOT207 |	You got to do that by respecting the customers and their time
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:25,184	| IOT207 |	I think they think we change that model
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:25,696	| IOT207 |	Might get some
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:29,536	| IOT207 |	Brighten Hans I want to tweak it just a little
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:30,304	| IOT207 |	Are you guys
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:31,840	| IOT207 |	Specifically
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:33,632	| IOT207 |	IRobot wants to sell me
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:34,912	| IOT207 |	Robotic vacuums
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:36,704	| IOT207 |	Lawn mowers at whatever
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:37,984	| IOT207 |	Karina Washington
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:39,264	| IOT207 |	But
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:40,288	| IOT207 |	Why
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:40,800	| IOT207 |	Connect it
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:41,824	| IOT207 |	What is the real
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:44,128	| IOT207 |	2
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:45,664	| IOT207 |	Russ and end
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:47,456	| IOT207 |	The room has been around since 2002
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:50,272	| IOT207 |	So in the world of the smart home that's it
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:52,064	| IOT207 |	The pit of a dinosaur
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:58,464	| IOT207 |	And it took us a while for us to connect our products because the devalue you meet the reason to
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:00,000	| IOT207 |	To do so is not immediately clear
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:07,168	| IOT207 |	What did viking finally convinced the company to do so was it came down to Mission completion so
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:09,472	| IOT207 |	Having a connected product for us
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:12,288	| IOT207 |	Especially one with that has a vision enabled
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:15,616	| IOT207 |	Navigation system like the last few iterations of the Roomba
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:17,152	| IOT207 |	Enabled us to have
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:18,944	| IOT207 |	A higher Mission completion rate
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:19,712	| IOT207 |	Right so
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:20,992	| IOT207 |	Roomba is leaving the dock
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:24,832	| IOT207 |	It's cleaning the room the area was supposed to and it's coming back
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:27,392	| IOT207 |	And it's now sending a signal saying we're done
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:29,952	| IOT207 |	We didn't have the ability to do that.
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:31,488	| IOT207 |	Long time and end and it's
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:37,888	| IOT207 |	Because it's connected it can get itself out of certain situations and so is a higher there's a higher Mission completion rate
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:39,168	| IOT207 |	Great for us and that's
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:41,728	| IOT207 |	The ultimate goal from our perspective is its
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:42,752	| IOT207 |	Happiness in
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:44,032	| IOT207 |	Convenience for the for the cost
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:46,080	| IOT207 |	Yasso
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:48,384	| IOT207 |	My company doesn't make devices
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:49,920	| IOT207 |	And our customers
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:51,712	| IOT207 |	Are insurance companies they don't make
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:52,736	| IOT207 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:53,760	| IOT207 |	Right but
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:58,880	| IOT207 |	Overtime the bet in the insurance business
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:40:59,392	| IOT207 |	This is that
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:01,440	| IOT207 |	Your data
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:03,744	| IOT207 |	Is going to help your insurance company
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:06,304	| IOT207 |	Understand how you live in your home
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:10,656	| IOT207 |	In the same way that an auto telematics insurance companies are learning
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:11,680	| IOT207 |	How you drive in your car
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:12,960	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:14,240	| IOT207 |	That
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:16,800	| IOT207 |	In an auto telematics that has led to
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:18,592	| IOT207 |	Discounting
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:20,896	| IOT207 |	Across-the-board there's not an insurance company that
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:21,920	| IOT207 |	Surcharges
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:23,200	| IOT207 |	For your telematics
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:24,992	| IOT207 |	So the same thing
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:27,040	| IOT207 |	Is going to be made in
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:28,832	| IOT207 |	Home telematic
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:31,136	| IOT207 |	If you will near-term though
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:33,440	| IOT207 |	Insurance companies believe it or not
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:34,976	| IOT207 |	Want to
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:36,000	| IOT207 |	Engage
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:37,536	| IOT207 |	With their customers
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:40,096	| IOT207 |	In an interesting and different way than they ever had
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:42,656	| IOT207 |	So they don't really want to lead with a
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:44,960	| IOT207 |	The data strategy they want to lead with a
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:48,032	| IOT207 |	I've got a consumer that's connected to me
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:49,056	| IOT207 |	In a different way
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:55,199	| IOT207 |	What can I tell them about their home that they don't already know or what can I tell them about how they're living in their home
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:57,247	| IOT207 |	That might affect
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:42:00,063	| IOT207 |	How they live how they maintain their home in overtime
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:01,087	| IOT207 |	Are there in
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:06,207	| IOT207 |	So as an internet service provider we don't make her cell connected devices
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:11,071	| IOT207 |	But will you get the phone calls when those connected devices are hard to get on the network
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:18,239	| IOT207 |	Or when they're installed in places that don't have good coverage like outside of your house or in your garage or
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:19,007	| IOT207 |	By your circuit breaker
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:24,895	| IOT207 |	So what we want to do is simplify that onboarding by working with different partners and two
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:28,735	| IOT207 |	Different standards and make that really really easy and provide connectivity everywhere
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:30,271	| IOT207 |	Just sew it
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:34,879	| IOT207 |	What's a better consumer experience we're not going to monetize that are charged for it is just part of
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:36,159	| IOT207 |	A great connectivity experience
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:37,951	| IOT207 |	So that's really what we're
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:38,719	| IOT207 |	We're looking to do
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:40,767	| IOT207 |	All right
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:43,071	| IOT207 |	In one of the topics that we
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:44,095	| IOT207 |	Constantly here is
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:47,167	| IOT207 |	Data so the insurance are like hay
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:49,215	| IOT207 |	We can get data and then maybe
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:49,727	| IOT207 |	We can
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:51,519	| IOT207 |	Lower your premium
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:52,543	| IOT207 |	Yay
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:53,567	| IOT207 |	In an energy
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:55,359	| IOT207 |	Data. My energy use
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:56,127	| IOT207 |	Yay
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:43:01,503	| IOT207 |	And my robots example data about the layout of my home so you can avoid getting
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:04,063	| IOT207 |	I'm stuck in the same spot every time
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:06,879	| IOT207 |	So these all sound good
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:08,671	| IOT207 |	But it feels like
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:11,487	| IOT207 |	We are not there yet in for the last
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:16,095	| IOT207 |	I would say four or five years we've been talking about how all of this data is going to come in and
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:21,215	| IOT207 |	Be magical for me as a consumer but also do something amazing for your bottom line and
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:25,311	| IOT207 |	I just saw a survey actually that within 5 years
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:29,407	| IOT207 |	Certain percentage of corporate Executives and I was really high was like
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:32,735	| IOT207 |	70-something percent believe that data is going to be as a line item on
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:34,271	| IOT207 |	Their accounting sheet
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:34,783	| IOT207 |	It's like
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:37,087	| IOT207 |	Vodafone survey if you guys are looking
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:38,367	| IOT207 |	So
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:40,671	| IOT207 |	So what's holding us back from turning this
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:42,975	| IOT207 |	Cold hard data into Cold Hard Cash
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:45,535	| IOT207 |	I think
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:48,351	| IOT207 |	That's so I'll I'll answer as a consumer of these things
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:49,375	| IOT207 |	And as of
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:50,655	| IOT207 |	An industry professional
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:52,191	| IOT207 |	I think that we lack
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:52,959	| IOT207 |	A
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:55,007	| IOT207 |	Clear and compelling value proposition
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:57,823	| IOT207 |	I'm across most of the things that we have
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:44:01,663	| IOT207 |	The SmartThings in my house I have because they're cool
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:02,943	| IOT207 |	Write in
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:07,039	| IOT207 |	They give me something to talk to my 16 year old
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:09,599	| IOT207 |	TT kit about right and
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:11,903	| IOT207 |	I'm also I think they're going to help me at some point
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:13,183	| IOT207 |	But
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:16,767	| IOT207 |	Even still as you said we I have SmartThings but my house
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:18,047	| IOT207 |	It's still pretty dumb
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:22,655	| IOT207 |	So I think in the absence of a really clear really compelling
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:25,983	| IOT207 |	Value proposition it's going to be hard to realize
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:28,287	| IOT207 |	Of the true value of the data
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:29,311	| IOT207 |	Commercial
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:33,663	| IOT207 |	I would I would actually answer this a little differently
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:36,991	| IOT207 |	I would think that it's not Nestle data they wanted contacts
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:37,503	| IOT207 |	Xbone
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:40,063	| IOT207 |	And I would say that what context is a picture
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:44,159	| IOT207 |	And if you think about a picture any picture look at any picture you look at
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:45,439	| IOT207 |	Text made by Sears a pixel
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:48,511	| IOT207 |	And we don't have enough pixels degree pictures
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:51,327	| IOT207 |	When we talk about the date of this coming
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:53,375	| IOT207 |	Often it's a lot of repeated data over time
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:58,751	| IOT207 |	And it data actually dies on the line it's 99% of that data is actually useless
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:02,847	| IOT207 |	The moment we look at it and it and we're looking at Trend at so we may see 5 data points
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:04,383	| IOT207 |	Not a lot of pixels
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:07,967	| IOT207 |	That's just a little bit of motion of Noise Within an environment
EDL	00:45:07,967	00:45:09,503	| IOT207 |	Not only do we have to have a pixel
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:12,319	| IOT207 |	We're going to be able to rain some correctly to create the picture
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:14,879	| IOT207 |	So we got a long way to go before
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:15,903	| IOT207 |	The data
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:17,439	| IOT207 |	Nnic Longway
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:18,719	| IOT207 |	Enable
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:19,743	| IOT207 |	Way to think about
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:21,023	| IOT207 |	How fast things are moving
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:21,535	| IOT207 |	Stop that one
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:23,071	| IOT207 |	But
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:23,839	| IOT207 |	Because
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:24,863	| IOT207 |	We don't
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:27,935	| IOT207 |	Have those pixels because we don't have that context
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:29,983	| IOT207 |	The day that doesn't have value yet
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:31,263	| IOT207 |	But that's changing
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:33,055	| IOT207 |	There's more more things coming online
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:38,175	| IOT207 |	Yeah I mean I I generally agree with that but I would we do have the pixels mean a lot there's lots of
EDL	00:45:38,687	00:45:39,711	| IOT207 |	Example of the cameras
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:42,271	| IOT207 |	Is lots of cameras ISP cameras
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:45,087	| IOT207 |	Rocky cameras I'm sorry are extremely popular
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:46,623	| IOT207 |	They're everywhere
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:51,743	| IOT207 |	But but what to do with them that the context dit-dit-dit is captured in that stream
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:52,767	| IOT207 |	Is lost
EDL	00:45:52,767	00:45:56,607	| IOT207 |	It's right and it's so it's in his lots of things you need to know it's what's in this picture
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:58,911	| IOT207 |	What's going on what time of day is it
EDL	00:45:58,911	00:46:01,727	| IOT207 |	What's all the things that you need to do that we do
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:03,007	| IOT207 |	Naturally
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:05,311	| IOT207 |	Right watching my daughter and my son
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:09,663	| IOT207 |	Learn things right it's it's it's amazing to watch a child
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:12,479	| IOT207 |	And how they learn and how complex that process is
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:16,575	| IOT207 |	We're not there yet in terms of the technology in My Mind
EDL	00:46:17,087	00:46:19,903	| IOT207 |	To do that I do think it's coming in
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:20,671	| IOT207 |	Tappening
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:21,951	| IOT207 |	In our case
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:26,303	| IOT207 |	Being able to map the room yes the primary reason is to complete the mission
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:30,399	| IOT207 |	But now it's we can understand at least the spatial understand spatial
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:31,679	| IOT207 |	Context of that home
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:33,471	| IOT207 |	The size of that home
EDL	00:46:33,983	00:46:36,031	| IOT207 |	Even what particular rooms are
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:38,335	| IOT207 |	That's a layer of information that does add up to that
EDL	00:46:39,359	00:46:42,431	| IOT207 |	So I will uplift that back to you and say I agree with you
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:43,711	| IOT207 |	At the local level
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:48,063	| IOT207 |	You're solving a problem locally to the home and the humans are closest to that Kant
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:50,623	| IOT207 |	So they can actually fill in some gaps
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:52,159	| IOT207 |	That you wouldn't be able to
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:53,695	| IOT207 |	You can mention the word
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:57,279	| IOT207 |	We know when you're doing this and you're doing that and you're doing the other thing
EDL	00:46:57,791	00:46:58,559	| IOT207 |	That to me is scary
EDL	00:46:59,071	00:47:01,887	| IOT207 |	I like that Humanity's doing this we are doing this
EDL	00:47:01,887	00:47:03,679	| IOT207 |	Not necessarily that individual data
EDL	00:47:03,679	00:47:04,959	| IOT207 |	Cuz of that individual data
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:08,799	| IOT207 |	Has its own challenges of how it's being used because
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:13,151	| IOT207 |	In Europe gdpr the general data protection regulation has changed the relationship
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:16,991	| IOT207 |	Between the data the people have and the people who are trying to take your data from them
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:19,551	| IOT207 |	In California the California consumer protection act
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:23,135	| IOT207 |	It's a trend that's making it so that I own the day that you can't take the dative
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:25,951	| IOT207 |	And if you do there's some
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:26,463	| IOT207 |	Sarcastic
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:29,023	| IOT207 |	Work out well
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:30,815	| IOT207 |	I would agree with you
EDL	00:47:30,815	00:47:31,839	| IOT207 |	Debt from a local
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:33,887	| IOT207 |	Perspective but when you talk about the industry
EDL	00:47:33,887	00:47:36,191	| IOT207 |	And you guys haven't seen the bottom line at the Enterprise level
EDL	00:47:36,959	00:47:41,567	| IOT207 |	No it's a much higher view that you got to get and you got to get a lot more generalized 804
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:45,407	| IOT207 |	Personalization is
EDL	00:47:45,407	00:47:46,687	| IOT207 |	What makes it useful to
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:47,199	| IOT207 |	Consumers
EDL	00:47:48,223	00:47:53,087	| IOT207 |	And so utilities have actually been struggling with this for a long time they've been upgrading their meters
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:55,391	| IOT207 |	Two Smart Meters show instead of rolling the truck
EDL	00:47:55,391	00:47:59,999	| IOT207 |	Once every 30 days and taking a read They're not reading it every 15 minutes and they struggled
EDL	00:47:59,999	00:48:01,279	| IOT207 |	To prove value to the
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:04,607	| IOT207 |	About why it's worthwhile to roll these
EDL	00:48:04,607	00:48:05,375	| IOT207 |	Things out
EDL	00:48:05,375	00:48:07,423	| IOT207 |	And so they start with just sharing the data with
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:09,471	| IOT207 |	The customer says
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:11,775	| IOT207 |	Great I used 5 kilowatt-hours last
EDL	00:48:11,775	00:48:13,055	| IOT207 |	Tuesday between 2 and 3 p.m.
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:14,591	| IOT207 |	What is that
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:16,127	| IOT207 |	Is that good is that bad
EDL	00:48:16,127	00:48:17,407	| IOT207 |	What should I do with this information
EDL	00:48:18,687	00:48:22,015	| IOT207 |	Let the bass line but then what you have to do is personalizing
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:22,527	| IOT207 |	Experience for
EDL	00:48:23,295	00:48:24,831	| IOT207 |	To point out an abnormality
EDL	00:48:24,831	00:48:31,231	| IOT207 |	You're using more than similar home there we noticed an unusual P class Tuesday there might be something going on
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:34,303	| IOT207 |	With your air conditioning unit for example until you have to bring it that
EDL	00:48:34,303	00:48:34,815	| IOT207 |	Personal level
EDL	00:48:35,327	00:48:36,863	| IOT207 |	I'm in order to provide.
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:40,191	| IOT207 |	There is a trend right now
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:43,775	| IOT207 |	In the home space for local control in local understanding
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:47,615	| IOT207 |	And also not sharing your data
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:48,639	| IOT207 |	Beyond certain
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:49,151	| IOT207 |	Parties
EDL	00:48:49,919	00:48:51,455	| IOT207 |	So there's that's one trend
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:58,623	| IOT207 |	But at the same time there's is completely different red where we're like looks like everything I took Google and Alexa
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:48:59,391	| IOT207 |	Without
EDL	00:48:59,903	00:49:02,207	| IOT207 |	People seeming to realize that
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:07,071	| IOT207 |	When they do that they're actually sharing the data that they were worried about in the first
EDL	00:49:08,351	00:49:10,143	| IOT207 |	I would love for you guys to talk about
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:13,215	| IOT207 |	How to communicate with consumers
EDL	00:49:13,215	00:49:14,239	| IOT207 |	What's actually happening
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:21,663	| IOT207 |	Do we think it's even reasonable are possible or even valuable for consumers to actually own their data as it were
EDL	00:49:21,663	00:49:22,431	| IOT207 |	I'm very curious
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:30,111	| IOT207 |	So Stacy and I were talking about a little bit about this earlier I always come back to the example where 5 years ago
EDL	00:49:30,623	00:49:36,767	| IOT207 |	Samsung put microphones in its TVs and it CNET did a pig piece on it and it was this big uproar
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:40,095	| IOT207 |	Meanwhile Alexa had actually launched
EDL	00:49:40,095	00:49:40,863	| IOT207 |	A couple months ago
EDL	00:49:40,863	00:49:41,887	| IOT207 |	Before that happened
EDL	00:49:41,887	00:49:43,679	| IOT207 |	No one knew what it was yet
EDL	00:49:43,679	00:49:44,703	| IOT207 |	No one cares
EDL	00:49:45,215	00:49:46,751	| IOT207 |	Six months to a year later
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:51,103	| IOT207 |	They're selling while the time it will now millions of these things
EDL	00:49:51,615	00:49:56,991	| IOT207 |	And no one seems to care at all and the reason for that is because people got a basic utility out of
EDL	00:49:56,991	00:49:58,015	| IOT207 |	What's the device right
EDL	00:49:58,015	00:50:00,063	| IOT207 |	People were worried about Samsung it was less
EDL	00:50:00,063	00:50:02,623	| IOT207 |	I do think that it was over there's a microphone in my house now
EDL	00:50:03,135	00:50:06,463	| IOT207 |	The clearly people got over that when they knew they could set a timer listen to music
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:07,999	| IOT207 |	So
EDL	00:50:07,999	00:50:13,631	| IOT207 |	I do think that there is a certain amount of this that comes back to just what is the utility that the consumed that the customer is getting
EDL	00:50:14,143	00:50:17,215	| IOT207 |	But they're also now is it big transparency problem
EDL	00:50:17,727	00:50:21,567	| IOT207 |	Where it it could be abused it is being abused we seen it
EDL	00:50:21,567	00:50:25,663	| IOT207 |	And I think everyone has to be a little bit more transparent with the user
EDL	00:50:26,175	00:50:26,943	| IOT207 |	About that
EDL	00:50:26,943	00:50:28,991	| IOT207 |	That's a very Company by company
EDL	00:50:29,503	00:50:31,295	| IOT207 |	Right very specific we're not going to sell
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:32,575	| IOT207 |	Your data
EDL	00:50:32,575	00:50:34,367	| IOT207 |	You at we have a map of your home
EDL	00:50:34,367	00:50:35,647	| IOT207 |	It lives on that robot
EDL	00:50:36,415	00:50:37,695	| IOT207 |	It's not going anywhere
EDL	00:50:37,695	00:50:38,719	| IOT207 |	We met
EDL	00:50:38,719	00:50:39,999	| IOT207 |	Tell someone
EDL	00:50:39,999	00:50:44,607	| IOT207 |	There's something called the kitchen because you may want to be able to turn the lights on your kitchen with Alexa
EDL	00:50:44,607	00:50:45,887	| IOT207 |	But that's all it would know
EDL	00:50:45,887	00:50:46,655	| IOT207 |	Is that there is a kitchen
EDL	00:50:48,191	00:50:50,751	| IOT207 |	Yeah I agree I think it's all about giving consumers
EDL	00:50:52,031	00:50:58,431	| IOT207 |	And then letting them decide and if they choose that they don't want that data shared make it very easy for them to
EDL	00:50:58,431	00:51:00,991	| IOT207 |	Delete that data everywhere that it's been stored
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:05,855	| IOT207 |	And make it really clear is this date a live on the device or does it also live in some other system
EDL	00:51:06,879	00:51:11,487	| IOT207 |	I think I don't know if that's the full prescription of had it like label what the date is but I think
EDL	00:51:11,487	00:51:14,559	| IOT207 |	Is it local or is it cloud and then make it very easy to see it in
EDL	00:51:15,327	00:51:16,095	| IOT207 |	Delete it
EDL	00:51:16,095	00:51:20,703	| IOT207 |	So how are we doing it that today we're late scale of 1 to 10 1 being
EDL	00:51:21,471	00:51:26,079	| IOT207 |	Facebook Cambridge analytica we are
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:32,479	| IOT207 |	Tell Amazon or turning on your light in the following groups and
EDL	00:51:32,479	00:51:37,343	| IOT207 |	And also the color scale
EDL	00:51:38,111	00:51:41,951	| IOT207 |	I think that my answer to this is that we are very low in that scale
EDL	00:51:42,463	00:51:44,767	| IOT207 |	And I wanted to interject because I needed that
EDL	00:51:45,279	00:51:46,303	| IOT207 |	Follow up
EDL	00:51:47,583	00:51:53,727	| IOT207 |	I think I have to agree with you that it's a cost versus value relationship that were trying to evaluate but I think that
EDL	00:51:54,495	00:51:55,263	| IOT207 |	Human beings
EDL	00:51:55,775	00:51:58,591	| IOT207 |	Are are very much driven by whatever
EDL	00:51:58,591	00:51:59,871	| IOT207 |	Their needs are at the time
EDL	00:52:00,383	00:52:00,895	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	00:52:01,407	00:52:04,735	| IOT207 |	We'll see like said we we have very short memories with the guard
EDL	00:52:05,247	00:52:06,015	| IOT207 |	The different things that have
EDL	00:52:06,783	00:52:09,343	| IOT207 |	So you'll see this idea and then there's a there's a
EDL	00:52:09,343	00:52:10,623	| IOT207 |	Concept that we have
EDL	00:52:11,135	00:52:11,903	| IOT207 |	On the coast
EDL	00:52:12,671	00:52:16,255	| IOT207 |	Dick in any technology that people care about the privacy of their data
EDL	00:52:16,767	00:52:20,351	| IOT207 |	And sometimes I think that maybe that is something that we
EDL	00:52:20,351	00:52:22,911	| IOT207 |	Archie holding ourselves because we know what's under the covers
EDL	00:52:23,423	00:52:24,447	| IOT207 |	Other people are like
EDL	00:52:24,447	00:52:28,287	| IOT207 |	So what they don't want McDonald's think they got my GPS on my phone that helps me get around
EDL	00:52:28,799	00:52:29,823	| IOT207 |	Tell him make that
EDL	00:52:29,823	00:52:32,127	| IOT207 |	Relationship of the value of the cost.
EDL	00:52:33,407	00:52:35,967	| IOT207 |	I agree just to kind of blend the two
EDL	00:52:35,967	00:52:36,991	| IOT207 |	The two topics
EDL	00:52:38,015	00:52:39,039	| IOT207 |	I think you mentioned
EDL	00:52:39,551	00:52:41,599	| IOT207 |	Some of the emerging standards gdpr
EDL	00:52:42,111	00:52:43,647	| IOT207 |	We we need that
EDL	00:52:43,647	00:52:45,439	| IOT207 |	Or we need some of those principles
EDL	00:52:45,951	00:52:47,487	| IOT207 |	And we're a long ways
EDL	00:52:47,487	00:52:48,767	| IOT207 |	From where we need to be
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:50,047	| IOT207 |	I think
EDL	00:52:50,047	00:52:53,119	| IOT207 |	Consistently reminding consumers that you shared your data
EDL	00:52:53,119	00:52:54,143	| IOT207 |	For this reason
EDL	00:52:54,143	00:52:58,751	| IOT207 |	Is is going to be something that has to happen in it and it doesn't happen today
EDL	00:52:58,751	00:53:01,311	| IOT207 |	But I think we also have to harken back to
EDL	00:53:02,847	00:53:05,151	| IOT207 |	2D value proposition
EDL	00:53:05,151	00:53:06,431	| IOT207 |	If I share my
EDL	00:53:06,943	00:53:08,479	| IOT207 |	Fitbit data with my
EDL	00:53:08,991	00:53:11,295	| IOT207 |	Gym because they give me
EDL	00:53:11,295	00:53:13,343	| IOT207 |	50% off of my monthly fee
EDL	00:53:13,855	00:53:15,647	| IOT207 |	I don't have to be reminded of that
EDL	00:53:15,647	00:53:16,415	| IOT207 |	I get it
EDL	00:53:16,415	00:53:17,183	| IOT207 |	Right
EDL	00:53:17,183	00:53:18,719	| IOT207 |	And so what's the story
EDL	00:53:18,719	00:53:21,535	| IOT207 |	Answer your question we're not doing a good job today
EDL	00:53:22,047	00:53:22,559	| IOT207 |	We
EDL	00:53:23,071	00:53:23,839	| IOT207 |	The debate we
EDL	00:53:24,863	00:53:26,655	| IOT207 |	But I am optimistic about
EDL	00:53:27,935	00:53:31,775	| IOT207 |	I think we're technically checking the boxes just buried in terms and
EDL	00:53:31,775	00:53:33,823	| IOT207 |	Mission but nobody read yes
EDL	00:53:33,823	00:53:34,847	| IOT207 |	Yeah
EDL	00:53:36,639	00:53:38,175	| IOT207 |	And so it's about how do you
EDL	00:53:38,687	00:53:39,967	| IOT207 |	Either directly Tire
EDL	00:53:39,967	00:53:45,599	| IOT207 |	Add to Value so customers understand or just say it in plain English or show them the same data that you have access
EDL	00:53:45,599	00:53:46,879	| IOT207 |	Text you that you're sharing and
EDL	00:53:46,879	00:53:48,159	| IOT207 |	How to draw the connection
EDL	00:53:48,159	00:53:48,927	| IOT207 |	Here's what we have
EDL	00:53:49,439	00:53:51,743	| IOT207 |	Here's what we're using it for here's where you can get a chain
EDL	00:53:52,511	00:53:53,791	| IOT207 |	So there's a user experience
EDL	00:53:55,327	00:53:56,863	| IOT207 |	Add another layer
EDL	00:53:56,863	00:53:57,631	| IOT207 |	Honest
EDL	00:53:57,631	00:53:58,911	| IOT207 |	And that is
EDL	00:53:58,911	00:54:02,239	| IOT207 |	We're talking about Jada like my actual I turn this light bulb on
EDL	00:54:02,239	00:54:05,311	| IOT207 |	But let's take it up a notch to inference so let's
EDL	00:54:05,311	00:54:07,615	| IOT207 |	Now we're all talking about AI it's very exciting
EDL	00:54:08,127	00:54:10,431	| IOT207 |	Now you might say oh
EDL	00:54:10,431	00:54:12,223	| IOT207 |	When someone turns their light on
EDL	00:54:12,223	00:54:13,247	| IOT207 |	At 3 a.m.
EDL	00:54:13,759	00:54:14,527	| IOT207 |	Consistently
EDL	00:54:15,295	00:54:17,855	| IOT207 |	They probably have insomnia which is associated with
EDL	00:54:17,855	00:54:19,135	| IOT207 |	I'm going to make this up heart attack
EDL	00:54:19,647	00:54:21,695	| IOT207 |	And us there a terrible risk for
EDL	00:54:22,207	00:54:23,999	| IOT207 |	A health insurance company and then suddenly
EDL	00:54:25,279	00:54:26,047	| IOT207 |	We're looking at
EDL	00:54:27,071	00:54:28,095	| IOT207 |	In this is this is
EDL	00:54:28,095	00:54:28,607	| IOT207 |	Morris
EDL	00:54:29,119	00:54:33,727	| IOT207 |	People's fear when they start looking at me like I do not want the naked pictures of me
EDL	00:54:34,239	00:54:36,799	| IOT207 |	Turn my video camera on the web which is totally understandable you
EDL	00:54:37,567	00:54:40,383	| IOT207 |	But there's also potential for economic
EDL	00:54:40,383	00:54:41,151	| IOT207 |	Harm
EDL	00:54:41,151	00:54:42,943	| IOT207 |	Coming for this and I'm curious
EDL	00:54:43,455	00:54:46,015	| IOT207 |	What your take is on that I don't think we're there yet but
EDL	00:54:46,527	00:54:48,319	| IOT207 |	There's a real fear that we get going
EDL	00:54:49,599	00:54:52,415	| IOT207 |	Hollywood Center really good job of scaring us on the sleeves top
EDL	00:54:53,439	00:54:57,023	| IOT207 |	If you eat some of these movies I even for the last 20 years it's like
EDL	00:54:57,023	00:55:02,399	| IOT207 |	Oldest person has this terrible diseases person has been diagnosed with AIDS for example back in the
EDL	00:55:02,399	00:55:04,959	| IOT207 |	There's a movie it was one of the the
EDL	00:55:05,983	00:55:06,495	| IOT207 |	It's like
EDL	00:55:07,775	00:55:11,103	| IOT207 |	I think the movie was one of the Harrison Ford movies where he was
EDL	00:55:11,615	00:55:12,895	| IOT207 |	And idea was
EDL	00:55:12,895	00:55:13,663	| IOT207 |	That guy was being black
EDL	00:55:14,431	00:55:16,223	| IOT207 |	And I think that's where it comes to
EDL	00:55:16,223	00:55:18,015	| IOT207 |	It's not about your data
EDL	00:55:18,015	00:55:19,295	| IOT207 |	Actually being used
EDL	00:55:19,295	00:55:20,319	| IOT207 |	In the way that you intended to
EDL	00:55:20,831	00:55:22,111	| IOT207 |	It's about as being lost
EDL	00:55:22,111	00:55:22,879	| IOT207 |	Controller
EDL	00:55:22,879	00:55:24,415	| IOT207 |	Gdpr trying to help
EDL	00:55:24,927	00:55:27,743	| IOT207 |	Making sure that the people are responsible your good Steward with data
EDL	00:55:28,511	00:55:31,071	| IOT207 |	The attendance of that are you have the right to be forgotten
EDL	00:55:31,583	00:55:33,631	| IOT207 |	You can wipe anytime you want do you have the right to
EDL	00:55:33,631	00:55:34,655	| IOT207 |	Opt-out you have
EDL	00:55:34,655	00:55:37,471	| IOT207 |	You have more rights than you used to have in control of that data
EDL	00:55:37,983	00:55:42,591	| IOT207 |	And the companies that actually on that dead and now there's there's teeth in that because they can be fine
EDL	00:55:43,103	00:55:43,871	| IOT207 |	That's what was
EDL	00:55:43,871	00:55:44,383	| IOT207 |	The missing piece
EDL	00:55:44,895	00:55:47,455	| IOT207 |	Is as far as the energy goes it really does take
EDL	00:55:48,735	00:55:51,039	| IOT207 |	For some degree some negative impact
EDL	00:55:51,039	00:55:55,391	| IOT207 |	There's a lot less products out there if you've ever noticed now that you can bring up
EDL	00:55:55,391	00:55:57,951	| IOT207 |	And they have password is a default password
EDL	00:55:57,951	00:55:58,719	| IOT207 |	When you turn them on
EDL	00:55:59,231	00:56:01,535	| IOT207 |	The reason is because the industry took a shot
EDL	00:56:01,535	00:56:03,839	| IOT207 |	About two years ago from something called Mariah
EDL	00:56:03,839	00:56:07,167	| IOT207 |	That biscuit was looking at all the photos you were out there
EDL	00:56:07,167	00:56:07,935	| IOT207 |	End
EDL	00:56:07,935	00:56:12,031	| IOT207 |	Everybody said we can't be bondable anymore so we got to ship a product that actually has
EDL	00:56:12,031	00:56:14,591	| IOT207 |	Some level of security built into it so you're not
EDL	00:56:14,591	00:56:16,639	| IOT207 |	A victim as soon as you plug the darn thing internet
EDL	00:56:17,407	00:56:20,735	| IOT207 |	The clothes on that I think that the whole point of that is
EDL	00:56:20,735	00:56:22,015	| IOT207 |	The data itself
EDL	00:56:22,527	00:56:24,319	| IOT207 |	And the stewardship of that data
EDL	00:56:24,319	00:56:25,343	| IOT207 |	From when the
EDL	00:56:25,855	00:56:26,879	| IOT207 |	Either take it from you
EDL	00:56:27,391	00:56:28,415	| IOT207 |	Or you share it with them
EDL	00:56:28,927	00:56:30,719	| IOT207 |	And how that that is actually
EDL	00:56:30,719	00:56:34,047	| IOT207 |	Managed in life cycle is extremely important we don't spend enough
EDL	00:56:34,047	00:56:34,815	| IOT207 |	Time talking about that
EDL	00:56:36,095	00:56:38,143	| IOT207 |	Yeah that's right I agree I think
EDL	00:56:38,143	00:56:38,655	| IOT207 |	Take that
EDL	00:56:39,167	00:56:41,471	| IOT207 |	When we think about who owns today that which is
EDL	00:56:41,471	00:56:43,519	| IOT207 |	The recurring question that comes up
EDL	00:56:43,519	00:56:45,055	| IOT207 |	The consumer has to own it
EDL	00:56:45,567	00:56:47,615	| IOT207 |	And you know your analogy of the
EDL	00:56:48,383	00:56:49,663	| IOT207 |	3 a.m. wake up
EDL	00:56:51,711	00:56:53,247	| IOT207 |	Hits home with us because
EDL	00:56:53,759	00:56:55,551	| IOT207 |	We support the life insurance pays
EDL	00:56:55,551	00:56:58,367	| IOT207 |	And sleep is a really big indicator of
EDL	00:56:58,879	00:56:59,647	| IOT207 |	Mortality
EDL	00:56:59,647	00:57:01,439	| IOT207 |	Right and so
EDL	00:57:01,439	00:57:05,791	| IOT207 |	We have to be super responsible are guiding principles have to begin with
EDL	00:57:05,791	00:57:08,095	| IOT207 |	Value to the consumer and privacy
EDL	00:57:08,607	00:57:10,911	| IOT207 |	And of course data ownership
EDL	00:57:10,911	00:57:11,679	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	00:57:11,679	00:57:16,287	| IOT207 |	They have to know what that's being used for and it has to be in their control to change it
EDL	00:57:17,311	00:57:20,383	| IOT207 |	Do you foresee that happening where my smart home data
EDL	00:57:21,407	00:57:24,479	| IOT207 |	Starts affecting and I know you said nobody gives you surcharge
EDL	00:57:25,503	00:57:26,527	| IOT207 |	Associated with
EDL	00:57:27,039	00:57:28,319	| IOT207 |	Your data but do you see that
EDL	00:57:28,831	00:57:31,647	| IOT207 |	Helping establish new Actuarial tables
EDL	00:57:31,647	00:57:32,159	| IOT207 |	Pause and
EDL	00:57:32,671	00:57:38,047	| IOT207 |	Changing the way people pay for their life insurance based on or health insurance based on their active
EDL	00:57:38,559	00:57:40,351	| IOT207 |	Yeah I think so
EDL	00:57:40,351	00:57:44,447	| IOT207 |	So I don't support the health insurance pays that gets really itchy and
EDL	00:57:44,447	00:57:45,727	| IOT207 |	There's a thing called Head Moen
EDL	00:57:46,239	00:57:48,543	| IOT207 |	So that's it that's an independent business but
EDL	00:57:48,543	00:57:52,383	| IOT207 |	Life I think so home I think so because
EDL	00:57:53,151	00:57:56,223	| IOT207 |	You know we live in our homes in a very unique way
EDL	00:57:56,223	00:57:56,735	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	00:57:57,759	00:58:00,575	| IOT207 |	In a world where we all sort of
EDL	00:58:00,575	00:58:03,647	| IOT207 |	Hunger for cheaper insurance rates Home Auto
EDL	00:58:04,159	00:58:05,695	| IOT207 |	Life commercial what have you
EDL	00:58:06,975	00:58:09,791	| IOT207 |	If there is a compelling story
EDL	00:58:09,791	00:58:11,071	| IOT207 |	Actuarial
EDL	00:58:11,071	00:58:11,839	| IOT207 |	Story
EDL	00:58:11,839	00:58:14,399	| IOT207 |	Around how you live in your home and what that means
EDL	00:58:14,911	00:58:15,935	| IOT207 |	To the
EDL	00:58:15,935	00:58:16,959	| IOT207 |	The premium you pay
EDL	00:58:17,471	00:58:18,239	| IOT207 |	Then
EDL	00:58:18,239	00:58:19,519	| IOT207 |	I think it's going to matter
EDL	00:58:19,519	00:58:24,127	| IOT207 |	I think it's going to take time this isn't next year this might not even be 5 years from now
EDL	00:58:24,639	00:58:25,407	| IOT207 |	Right but
EDL	00:58:25,919	00:58:29,247	| IOT207 |	There is a story to tell and I think it's even broader than
EDL	00:58:29,247	00:58:30,783	| IOT207 |	Just your connected home
EDL	00:58:30,783	00:58:32,319	| IOT207 |	Your connected car is
EDL	00:58:32,319	00:58:34,111	| IOT207 |	Is actively interacting with
EDL	00:58:34,111	00:58:34,623	| IOT207 |	With your home
EDL	00:58:35,135	00:58:36,159	| IOT207 |	And with your Fitbit
EDL	00:58:36,671	00:58:37,439	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	00:58:37,439	00:58:39,231	| IOT207 |	Those are threaded together
EDL	00:58:39,743	00:58:40,511	| IOT207 |	Paint
EDL	00:58:40,511	00:58:44,095	| IOT207 |	A vivid three-dimensional picture of who you are as an insurance risk
EDL	00:58:44,607	00:58:48,703	| IOT207 |	Right but that's how we have to be thinking about this as sort of
EDL	00:58:49,215	00:58:50,495	| IOT207 |	Data and insurance vision
EDL	00:58:51,519	00:58:52,799	| IOT207 |	You're scared to death
EDL	00:58:52,799	00:58:55,615	| IOT207 |	This is it from Meijer to paper in my sink
EDL	00:58:55,615	00:58:56,639	| IOT207 |	To test smoke alarm
EDL	00:58:57,151	00:58:59,711	| IOT207 |	So I can tell you my insurer is going to be like oh no
EDL	00:59:00,735	00:59:01,503	| IOT207 |	No
EDL	00:59:02,783	00:59:06,623	| IOT207 |	I saw a compelling demonstration at CES of a company
EDL	00:59:06,623	00:59:07,903	| IOT207 |	It did something very simple
EDL	00:59:08,415	00:59:09,695	| IOT207 |	They put motion sensors
EDL	00:59:09,695	00:59:13,535	| IOT207 |	In the major areas if it one of the better in the Twin the living room all the world in motion sense
EDL	00:59:14,559	00:59:17,119	| IOT207 |	And over a period of two months
EDL	00:59:17,119	00:59:18,399	| IOT207 |	They plotted the motion
EDL	00:59:18,399	00:59:19,423	| IOT207 |	In the spaces overtime
EDL	00:59:20,191	00:59:23,775	| IOT207 |	And there's for example a very clear indication when you have an ulcer
EDL	00:59:23,775	00:59:24,799	| IOT207 |	Somebody approaching Alzheimer
EDL	00:59:25,567	00:59:26,335	| IOT207 |	Because
EDL	00:59:26,335	00:59:27,871	| IOT207 |	They're up in the middle of the night
EDL	00:59:27,871	00:59:30,943	| IOT207 |	And because they're randomly going from room to room
EDL	00:59:30,943	00:59:32,991	| IOT207 |	Something you wouldn't know without being a measure that
EDL	00:59:33,503	00:59:35,807	| IOT207 |	But you take that back around 2
EDL	00:59:35,807	00:59:39,135	| IOT207 |	The things that you're doing from from the insurance of the home because
EDL	00:59:39,135	00:59:40,671	| IOT207 |	Now you have a
EDL	00:59:40,671	00:59:42,719	| IOT207 |	A challenge to the safety of the home
EDL	00:59:42,719	00:59:45,023	| IOT207 |	Now you have a challenge to the health of the individual
EDL	00:59:45,023	00:59:46,303	| IOT207 |	It's a very real
EDL	00:59:46,815	00:59:51,167	| IOT207 |	And you can do it without invading the Privacy you don't have to have cameras focus on everything is there
EDL	00:59:51,167	00:59:52,959	| IOT207 |	You just have to intelligently
EDL	00:59:52,959	00:59:55,007	| IOT207 |	Look at the the cause and effect
EDL	00:59:55,519	00:59:57,567	| IOT207 |	Of different conditions that you want to
EDL	00:59:58,591	01:00:00,383	| IOT207 |	Who do you tell that I have all time
EDL	01:00:01,663	01:00:02,431	| IOT207 |	Haven't told anybody yet
EDL	01:00:04,223	01:00:06,271	| IOT207 |	Alright let's talk about
EDL	01:00:06,271	01:00:10,111	| IOT207 |	When we buy the stuff cuz you mentioned terms and conditions and how they're not awesome
EDL	01:00:10,879	01:00:12,159	| IOT207 |	I thought those were not your exact
EDL	01:00:12,671	01:00:13,695	| IOT207 |	What I'm saying
EDL	01:00:15,999	01:00:16,511	| IOT207 |	So
EDL	01:00:17,023	01:00:23,423	| IOT207 |	What are some ways we can do to communicate with people who are busy and who did not I mean we all know that no one's going to read this.
EDL	01:00:23,423	01:00:26,495	| IOT207 |	How they've been talked about nutrition labels for data but
EDL	01:00:27,007	01:00:33,407	| IOT207 |	What are some ideas that are percolating in your industry about how to talk to people in create these value prop
EDL	01:00:33,407	01:00:34,687	| IOT207 |	Positions and how we talk
EDL	01:00:34,687	01:00:35,455	| IOT207 |	And use about
EDL	01:00:35,455	01:00:35,967	| IOT207 |	Use your data
EDL	01:00:38,015	01:00:41,599	| IOT207 |	It could be as simple as if you have some sort of
EDL	01:00:41,599	01:00:43,647	| IOT207 |	App for email that goes out to customers
EDL	01:00:44,159	01:00:44,927	| IOT207 |	Use your smart
EDL	01:00:44,927	01:00:45,439	| IOT207 |	Tobias
EDL	01:00:45,951	01:00:47,999	| IOT207 |	You show them the data that they have
EDL	01:00:47,999	01:00:52,095	| IOT207 |	And then you give them some useful information about it some sort of inside that they wouldn't have already
EDL	01:00:52,607	01:00:55,679	| IOT207 |	That they wouldn't have gotten without this device in their home
EDL	01:00:55,679	01:00:56,703	| IOT207 |	So for example
EDL	01:00:57,215	01:01:01,823	| IOT207 |	Maybe how they use energy across the course of the day or what their average set point is and how it compares to
EDL	01:01:01,823	01:01:03,103	| IOT207 |	Dissimilar homes
EDL	01:01:03,103	01:01:09,247	| IOT207 |	And in just plain English say you know this is how we know this this is what we do with your data and here's where you can
EDL	01:01:11,807	01:01:14,367	| IOT207 |	I agree with that I think it's still in the context
EDL	01:01:14,367	01:01:14,879	| IOT207 |	Best of
EDL	01:01:15,647	01:01:17,439	| IOT207 |	Or tying it the some way to
EDL	01:01:17,439	01:01:18,463	| IOT207 |	Back to the value back to the
EDL	01:01:19,487	01:01:22,047	| IOT207 |	Ikea is an example of the things that we're doing with this
EDL	01:01:22,559	01:01:24,351	| IOT207 |	You mentioned I think you know repeating
EDL	01:01:25,119	01:01:27,423	| IOT207 |	Repeating at some Cadence in a
EDL	01:01:28,191	01:01:28,703	| IOT207 |	Relatively
EDL	01:01:29,727	01:01:35,871	| IOT207 |	Friendly kind way that this might be something that you're doing with it and just and just that just just reminding them of that
EDL	01:01:38,431	01:01:41,759	| IOT207 |	My remote might give me like an outline of my house or something
EDL	01:01:42,271	01:01:43,295	| IOT207 |	A map of my house
EDL	01:01:45,599	01:01:51,487	| IOT207 |	Yeah no absolutely right and end and I get the kitchen example that I that I mentioned right the newest Roomba
EDL	01:01:51,487	01:01:52,511	| IOT207 |	Does do that
EDL	01:01:52,511	01:01:53,535	| IOT207 |	For you and you can
EDL	01:01:53,535	01:01:54,303	| IOT207 |	It will
EDL	01:01:55,327	01:02:00,447	| IOT207 |	In the app you will see a layout of whatever space that it was clean it will then
EDL	01:02:00,447	01:02:03,775	| IOT207 |	Start a label those rooms you have the power to label those rooms
EDL	01:02:03,775	01:02:06,335	| IOT207 |	It just simple things like that
EDL	01:02:06,335	01:02:10,175	| IOT207 |	Right and we're getting there to the point where the context up well if it's
EDL	01:02:10,175	01:02:14,527	| IOT207 |	The kitchen we know that we should probably clean that more often because that's where there's more messes
EDL	01:02:14,527	01:02:19,391	| IOT207 |	Where the kids are in the kids room or the playroom or whatever it is and just those little nudges
EDL	01:02:19,391	01:02:21,695	| IOT207 |	At the same time or just building credibility
EDL	01:02:21,695	01:02:24,255	| IOT207 |	Right it's a it's really a credibility thing in the transparency
EDL	01:02:25,535	01:02:31,935	| IOT207 |	I think in addition to showing what data is being collected I think it should be required in the technical
EDL	01:02:31,935	01:02:32,703	| IOT207 |	Full specs the list
EDL	01:02:33,215	01:02:38,847	| IOT207 |	All of the data collection abilities you have so if you build a microphone in your product you have to list there's a microphone
EDL	01:02:39,359	01:02:42,687	| IOT207 |	Warren air quality sensor every sensor that collects data
EDL	01:02:42,687	01:02:44,991	| IOT207 |	I've listened to and here's the type of data it collects
EDL	01:02:46,015	01:02:47,807	| IOT207 |	Yeah we didn't we talk about this
EDL	01:02:47,807	01:02:50,367	| IOT207 |	Sephora but I think it gets did to those sort of when your
EDL	01:02:50,367	01:02:51,647	| IOT207 |	Actually making physical product
EDL	01:02:52,671	01:02:54,207	| IOT207 |	Chrissy mention this on your pocket
EDL	01:02:55,231	01:02:55,743	| IOT207 |	I'll plug your
EDL	01:02:58,047	01:03:01,375	| IOT207 |	Italy it if you're creating physical devices in the home
EDL	01:03:01,375	01:03:04,959	| IOT207 |	This has to start even if it's a software device that is software product
EDL	01:03:04,959	01:03:06,239	| IOT207 |	This has to start
EDL	01:03:06,239	01:03:09,311	| IOT207 |	It has to be a basic Foundation of basic building block
EDL	01:03:09,311	01:03:12,127	| IOT207 |	Of the concept development process in the product development process
EDL	01:03:12,639	01:03:13,663	| IOT207 |	Cuz if it's not
EDL	01:03:13,663	01:03:14,943	| IOT207 |	That is never going to happen
EDL	01:03:15,711	01:03:16,479	| IOT207 |	Regulation
EDL	01:03:16,479	01:03:18,527	| IOT207 |	You could step in but we need to be better than
EDL	01:03:21,087	01:03:22,879	| IOT207 |	As I mentioned we work with Wellness
EDL	01:03:22,879	01:03:27,231	| IOT207 |	We work at Mayo Clinic the Cleveland Clinic with a lot of medical experts and weed
EDL	01:03:27,231	01:03:29,279	| IOT207 |	Are in the commercial and unplugging
EDL	01:03:29,279	01:03:31,327	| IOT207 |	Al commercial Hospitality in the resident
EDL	01:03:31,327	01:03:33,119	| IOT207 |	Sector there's a lot of data to be gathered
EDL	01:03:33,631	01:03:34,911	| IOT207 |	So I think that the
EDL	01:03:34,911	01:03:38,239	| IOT207 |	Way to think about this is is to change the storage
EDL	01:03:38,239	01:03:39,007	| IOT207 |	Just a little bit from us
EDL	01:03:39,519	01:03:40,031	| IOT207 |	Mentality
EDL	01:03:40,543	01:03:41,311	| IOT207 |	Imagine
EDL	01:03:41,311	01:03:43,103	| IOT207 |	But I'm not just sharing my data
EDL	01:03:43,103	01:03:44,895	| IOT207 |	Imagine that there's somebody
EDL	01:03:45,663	01:03:48,223	| IOT207 |	That is an employee of mine in Henrietta off to them
EDL	01:03:48,223	01:03:50,015	| IOT207 |	What would I expect of them
EDL	01:03:50,015	01:03:54,367	| IOT207 |	Brexit to give the data and then run and go do stuff with it and then just tell me you're going to give it to me
EDL	01:03:54,367	01:03:55,135	| IOT207 |	I'm gone
EDL	01:03:55,135	01:03:56,927	| IOT207 |	Now we expect to have reports back
EDL	01:03:57,439	01:03:59,487	| IOT207 |	How that data is actually doing good
EDL	01:03:59,999	01:04:01,791	| IOT207 |	How the date is actually being used
EDL	01:04:01,791	01:04:04,351	| IOT207 |	Soaked to the point of yeah this will do this
EDL	01:04:04,351	01:04:05,119	| IOT207 |	No no
EDL	01:04:05,119	01:04:06,399	| IOT207 |	This is also doing
EDL	01:04:06,911	01:04:09,215	| IOT207 |	I think that's the big piece that's missing is
EDL	01:04:09,215	01:04:11,775	| IOT207 |	How that data is actually transforming other people's lives
EDL	01:04:12,287	01:04:16,639	| IOT207 |	There's a there's a big opportunity for that transparency to carry through the life cycle of a
EDL	01:04:17,663	01:04:19,199	| IOT207 |	I want to ask you
EDL	01:04:19,711	01:04:20,991	| IOT207 |	Again
EDL	01:04:20,991	01:04:24,063	| IOT207 |	Where are we on the spectrum of actually
EDL	01:04:24,063	01:04:25,599	| IOT207 |	Communicating this back to the
EDL	01:04:25,599	01:04:26,367	| IOT207 |	Customer
EDL	01:04:26,367	01:04:26,879	| IOT207 |	In
EDL	01:04:27,391	01:04:29,183	| IOT207 |	Creating dispositive
EDL	01:04:29,183	01:04:31,999	| IOT207 |	Feedback loop where would we have this
EDL	01:04:31,999	01:04:33,023	| IOT207 |	You're getting this out of it
EDL	01:04:33,535	01:04:36,351	| IOT207 |	I would say even in creating music.
EDL	01:04:36,351	01:04:38,143	| IOT207 |	Everyone I talked to has this great
EDL	01:04:38,655	01:04:40,447	| IOT207 |	Warm and fuzzy Vision but
EDL	01:04:40,447	01:04:45,567	| IOT207 |	Really the only thing I hear about is like how Facebook's using my stuff to like sell ads delay
EDL	01:04:45,567	01:04:46,079	| IOT207 |	Nazis are
EDL	01:04:48,639	01:04:49,407	| IOT207 |	That's pretty scary
EDL	01:04:52,735	01:04:54,015	| IOT207 |	I think that
EDL	01:04:54,783	01:04:57,599	| IOT207 |	Turd for my company we struggle because
EDL	01:04:57,599	01:04:59,903	| IOT207 |	People don't care that much about energy
EDL	01:04:59,903	01:05:01,695	| IOT207 |	Great at the end of the day like
EDL	01:05:01,695	01:05:04,767	| IOT207 |	If the lights turn on and my bills not too high
EDL	01:05:04,767	01:05:06,815	| IOT207 |	It's it's really it's like not a type of
EDL	01:05:08,607	01:05:09,375	| IOT207 |	And so
EDL	01:05:09,887	01:05:16,287	| IOT207 |	I think we do a pretty good job communicating everything that's available it's just how do you engage customers on those
EDL	01:05:16,287	01:05:20,895	| IOT207 |	As meaningful insights that we derive from the data so they understand why it matters and we're not just
EDL	01:05:20,895	01:05:21,919	| IOT207 |	Chain for Dontae
EDL	01:05:27,039	01:05:27,807	| IOT207 |	Exactly
EDL	01:05:28,831	01:05:32,415	| IOT207 |	Exactly so we work with utilities who
EDL	01:05:32,415	01:05:34,463	| IOT207 |	Have incentives to either reduce
EDL	01:05:34,463	01:05:38,559	| IOT207 |	System and overall or pull it out of certain high peak times to pray
EDL	01:05:38,559	01:05:40,095	| IOT207 |	Prevent blackouts herb
EDL	01:05:40,095	01:05:41,631	| IOT207 |	Firing up at Peak planners
EDL	01:05:41,631	01:05:43,423	| IOT207 |	Something like that so there is a massive
EDL	01:05:44,703	01:05:49,055	| IOT207 |	Impact to the world for us doing this just had to get customers to care
EDL	01:05:51,103	01:05:53,407	| IOT207 |	And make it a compelling value proposition
EDL	01:05:53,407	01:05:54,175	| IOT207 |	Searching for them
EDL	01:05:54,175	01:05:57,759	| IOT207 |	Individual a so much so that they'll opt into the program
EDL	01:05:57,759	01:06:02,623	| IOT207 |	Because usually the the feel-good message that it's good for the world isn't enough for somebody to sign
EDL	01:06:03,903	01:06:07,231	| IOT207 |	There's a sensitive data point that we all carry around with us today
EDL	01:06:07,231	01:06:10,303	| IOT207 |	That existed long before smarthome that's our credit score
EDL	01:06:10,815	01:06:11,583	| IOT207 |	And
EDL	01:06:11,583	01:06:12,607	| IOT207 |	We all I think
EDL	01:06:12,607	01:06:14,655	| IOT207 |	Hold our credit score near and dear to us
EDL	01:06:14,655	01:06:17,471	| IOT207 |	And we guard it we want to know if and when and how it's used
EDL	01:06:17,983	01:06:21,055	| IOT207 |	But we don't always know if and when and how it's used
EDL	01:06:21,567	01:06:22,079	| IOT207 |	But
EDL	01:06:22,591	01:06:24,383	| IOT207 |	It's governed in a
EDL	01:06:25,407	01:06:26,687	| IOT207 |	Very rigorous way
EDL	01:06:26,687	01:06:28,735	| IOT207 |	And I think a way that smart home data should be
EDL	01:06:29,247	01:06:31,551	| IOT207 |	And anytime your credit score is used
EDL	01:06:32,063	01:06:34,879	| IOT207 |	Bit to make a loan or an insurance transaction or
EDL	01:06:35,391	01:06:36,415	| IOT207 |	In your utility
EDL	01:06:36,927	01:06:38,719	| IOT207 |	Transaction I don't know if credit scores use
EDL	01:06:40,511	01:06:44,351	| IOT207 |	And a decision is made using that using your credit score you have to know about
EDL	01:06:45,119	01:06:46,399	| IOT207 |	The
EDL	01:06:46,399	01:06:51,007	| IOT207 |	The business that used it has to tell you that they used it you have to give consent
EDL	01:06:51,519	01:06:54,079	| IOT207 |	And then if an adverse decision was made
EDL	01:06:54,079	01:06:55,103	| IOT207 |	In the use of that
EDL	01:06:55,103	01:06:56,639	| IOT207 |	Then a letter has to go out
EDL	01:06:56,639	01:06:59,199	| IOT207 |	And you had you have the ability to
EDL	01:06:59,199	01:06:59,711	| IOT207 |	Respond to that
EDL	01:07:00,223	01:07:02,271	| IOT207 |	So there may be some lessons to be learned
EDL	01:07:02,783	01:07:03,551	| IOT207 |	From
EDL	01:07:03,551	01:07:06,111	| IOT207 |	That one datapoint that none of us want to give up
EDL	01:07:06,623	01:07:08,415	| IOT207 |	Right and
EDL	01:07:08,415	01:07:09,439	| IOT207 |	And use
EDL	01:07:09,439	01:07:09,951	| IOT207 |	Everyday
EDL	01:07:10,719	01:07:11,487	| IOT207 |	Let's
EDL	01:07:11,487	01:07:12,511	| IOT207 |	Take a trip
EDL	01:07:12,511	01:07:13,279	| IOT207 |	Back in time
EDL	01:07:13,791	01:07:18,655	| IOT207 |	And I am curious what you guys many of y'all have been in the industry for a really long time
EDL	01:07:19,679	01:07:23,007	| IOT207 |	What would you change or would you change how we're developing
EDL	01:07:24,031	01:07:24,543	| IOT207 |	Maybe it's
EDL	01:07:25,055	01:07:28,895	| IOT207 |	What would you change your how would you like to see an idealized rollout
EDL	01:07:28,895	01:07:31,711	| IOT207 |	At the smart home and like how we talk about the stuff at
EDL	01:07:31,711	01:07:32,223	| IOT207 |	Communicated
EDL	01:07:33,759	01:07:35,295	| IOT207 |	What's your I can jump in
EDL	01:07:35,807	01:07:37,087	| IOT207 |	So I think
EDL	01:07:37,087	01:07:37,855	| IOT207 |	Standard
EDL	01:07:37,855	01:07:38,879	| IOT207 |	Protocol
EDL	01:07:38,879	01:07:44,511	| IOT207 |	So that third-party apps who want to talk to all these devices have a standard integration
EDL	01:07:44,511	01:07:45,023	| IOT207 |	Mission paw
EDL	01:07:46,047	01:07:47,839	| IOT207 |	If I could go back in time that's what I would ask for
EDL	01:07:48,351	01:07:50,399	| IOT207 |	Because we integrate with
EDL	01:07:50,399	01:07:51,423	| IOT207 |	All the different thermostat
EDL	01:07:52,191	01:07:53,215	| IOT207 |	And all of them have did
EDL	01:07:53,215	01:07:54,239	| IOT207 |	Different apis
EDL	01:07:54,239	01:07:56,287	| IOT207 |	But have different levels of control
EDL	01:07:56,287	01:07:58,847	| IOT207 |	That change from time to time and it's
EDL	01:07:59,359	01:08:02,431	| IOT207 |	You know a full-time job just to keep up with all that stuff
EDL	01:08:02,431	01:08:03,711	| IOT207 |	Princess and standardization
EDL	01:08:05,247	01:08:05,759	| IOT207 |	I know
EDL	01:08:09,087	01:08:10,367	| IOT207 |	It's created opportunity
EDL	01:08:10,367	01:08:10,879	| IOT207 |	Brothers 2
EDL	01:08:12,671	01:08:19,071	| IOT207 |	Yeah I mean it and I guess the question I have is this how much of this is a wish list a true wish list right cuz I I completely agree but without
EDL	01:08:19,071	01:08:20,095	| IOT207 |	Getting into the details of
EDL	01:08:20,095	01:08:21,375	| IOT207 |	The prisoner's dilemma another
EDL	01:08:21,887	01:08:25,471	| IOT207 |	Game Theory like there's a lot of reasons why that didn't happen and
EDL	01:08:25,471	01:08:28,799	| IOT207 |	And why that also enabled us to get to where we are
EDL	01:08:28,799	01:08:30,335	| IOT207 |	Right even though it is messy and
EDL	01:08:30,847	01:08:32,127	| IOT207 |	Manassas technology
EDL	01:08:32,127	01:08:33,407	| IOT207 |	Write it it it it
EDL	01:08:33,919	01:08:37,247	| IOT207 |	It rarely ends up rolling out in a very clean
EDL	01:08:37,247	01:08:40,319	| IOT207 |	Way initially and it takes longer than you expect
EDL	01:08:40,831	01:08:42,879	| IOT207 |	But when it does arrive
EDL	01:08:42,879	01:08:43,903	| IOT207 |	It usually
EDL	01:08:43,903	01:08:44,927	| IOT207 |	Write the meaning
EDL	01:08:44,927	01:08:45,951	| IOT207 |	Progress is progress
EDL	01:08:47,487	01:08:49,279	| IOT207 |	I would say if we went back in time
EDL	01:08:49,791	01:08:52,351	| IOT207 |	To all Implement security by Design
EDL	01:08:52,351	01:08:53,631	| IOT207 |	So implement
EDL	01:08:54,143	01:08:57,471	| IOT207 |	The online security from the very beginning so we don't have all these data
EDL	01:08:58,239	01:09:01,567	| IOT207 |	I still worried that if we don't get her act together people
EDL	01:09:01,567	01:09:03,615	| IOT207 |	Will just get turned off to the whole technology
EDL	01:09:04,383	01:09:05,919	| IOT207 |	So we really need to address that
EDL	01:09:06,943	01:09:07,455	| IOT207 |	So
EDL	01:09:07,967	01:09:10,527	| IOT207 |	I think that it all starts in the education system
EDL	01:09:11,551	01:09:13,343	| IOT207 |	I think personally we jump the shark
EDL	01:09:14,111	01:09:20,255	| IOT207 |	When a company put a product in and labeled it programmable thermostat and put it in the shelves of the mass mark
EDL	01:09:20,255	01:09:21,023	| IOT207 |	Stores
EDL	01:09:21,791	01:09:23,583	| IOT207 |	That's not the value proposition of the
EDL	01:09:23,583	01:09:24,351	| IOT207 |	Consumer
EDL	01:09:24,351	01:09:27,935	| IOT207 |	So if we took the engineering guys and we force them
EDL	01:09:27,935	01:09:31,263	| IOT207 |	To learn about consumer experience and N2 understand
EDL	01:09:31,263	01:09:34,847	| IOT207 |	That's the most important thing and you need to go backwards from that
EDL	01:09:35,359	01:09:39,455	| IOT207 |	If we gave them jobs 101c Jazz 101 Smule Theory there
EDL	01:09:39,455	01:09:41,247	| IOT207 |	I think that might change
EDL	01:09:41,247	01:09:44,319	| IOT207 |	That the relationship between people and Technology
EDL	01:09:44,319	01:09:45,087	| IOT207 |	That
EDL	01:09:45,087	01:09:46,111	| IOT207 |	Today
EDL	01:09:46,111	01:09:47,135	| IOT207 |	Nanotechnology
EDL	01:09:47,647	01:09:48,671	| IOT207 |	6 way down here
EDL	01:09:48,671	01:09:49,695	| IOT207 |	Fundamentally and people
EDL	01:09:49,695	01:09:50,463	| IOT207 |	Bose speaker
EDL	01:09:50,463	01:09:54,303	| IOT207 |	We're Bridging the Gap a little bit never falling back and then I think that we just
EDL	01:09:54,303	01:09:55,583	| IOT207 |	How to divide between the
EDL	01:09:55,583	01:09:57,119	| IOT207 |	People that are making the technology
EDL	01:09:57,119	01:09:58,143	| IOT207 |	And the people that are using the
EDL	01:09:59,935	01:10:03,519	| IOT207 |	To be fair the guy that created the nest was a Steve Jobs disciple
EDL	01:10:07,103	01:10:08,895	| IOT207 |	Toni wasn't quite a disciple
EDL	01:10:12,223	01:10:13,247	| IOT207 |	Cannabis
EDL	01:10:13,247	01:10:14,527	| IOT207 |	All right everybody
EDL	01:10:15,039	01:10:21,183	| IOT207 |	Please big round of applause for us
EDL	01:10:23,999	01:10:27,583	| IOT207 |	And a big thank you to our sponsors and hosts
EDL	01:10:29,119	01:10:35,263	| IOT207 |	Thank you this is great discussion preciate everybody coming for the sand
EDL	01:10:36,031	01:10:38,847	| IOT207 |	I am sure these payments are going to hang around for a while if you want to
EDL	01:10:38,847	01:10:39,871	| IOT207 |	Interact with them
EDL	01:10:39,871	01:10:41,407	| IOT207 |	Also in terms of the
EDL	01:10:41,407	01:10:42,431	| IOT207 |	The co-host
EDL	01:10:42,943	01:10:44,735	| IOT207 |	Just wanna make sure everybody knows that
EDL	01:10:44,735	01:10:47,807	| IOT207 |	Their effects from Gentex here raise your hand if you're from Gentex
EDL	01:10:48,575	01:10:52,927	| IOT207 |	Perhaps you saw their only connect them over here which is really amazing what's a good
