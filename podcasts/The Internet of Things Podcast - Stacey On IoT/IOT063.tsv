EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:26,880	| IOT063 |	We're going to talk about
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:28,160	| IOT063 |	A possible deal for
EDL	00:00:28,160	00:00:28,928	| IOT063 |	Control
EDL	00:00:28,928	00:00:30,464	| IOT063 |	So let's get started Kevin
EDL	00:00:30,976	00:00:31,744	| IOT063 |	I purchased
EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:32,768	| IOT063 |	Fitness tracker
EDL	00:00:32,768	00:00:33,536	| IOT063 |	Yes
EDL	00:00:34,304	00:00:36,352	| IOT063 |	Tell tell people what you bought
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:41,728	| IOT063 |	First because you did not get yours yet you ordered it I actually have two in my hand so what did you buy
EDL	00:00:41,728	00:00:43,520	| IOT063 |	I bought the Under Armour
EDL	00:00:43,520	00:00:44,032	| IOT063 |	Healthbox
EDL	00:00:44,544	00:00:45,568	| IOT063 |	You recommended last week
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:47,104	| IOT063 |	Week 4
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:49,408	| IOT063 |	Father's Day special in the reason I did it
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:50,688	| IOT063 |	Because I have been looking
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:52,224	| IOT063 |	SportsCenter looking at it
EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:52,736	| IOT063 |	Since it launched
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:55,040	| IOT063 |	I got a $40 off
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:56,832	| IOT063 |	Promo code for UnderArmour
EDL	00:00:56,832	00:00:57,600	| IOT063 |	Because I'm at my fitness
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:00,416	| IOT063 |	Sam
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:01,184	| IOT063 |	Yes we say
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:07,584	| IOT063 |	And there it was already $50 off in the store so I got a total of 90 bucks off I don't know what that's going to
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:08,352	| IOT063 |	Astilbe
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:10,144	| IOT063 |	Available to People by the time this run
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:11,680	| IOT063 |	Right
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:12,960	| IOT063 |	The $50 off was
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:14,240	| IOT063 |	The way it was
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:22,944	| IOT063 |	So you don't have it yet but as I mentioned last week I wouldn't recommend it if I didn't like it and I do like it
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:23,456	| IOT063 |	I haven't
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:27,040	| IOT063 |	I think what you'll appreciate and we can talk about
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:28,064	| IOT063 |	Why does the port in a few minutes
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:32,160	| IOT063 |	I think you'll appreciate the whole view that they give you
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:33,696	| IOT063 |	Of your health meaning
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:37,536	| IOT063 |	If you wear the tracker in the heart rate monitor and use the scale
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:39,584	| IOT063 |	Obviously getting your weight body fat
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:40,864	| IOT063 |	Getting your steps
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:41,632	| IOT063 |	Your sleep
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:43,168	| IOT063 |	Activity
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:45,216	| IOT063 |	Because they own map my
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:46,752	| IOT063 |	Fitness and also MapMyRun
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:49,312	| IOT063 |	You can track your nutrition at MyFitnessPal
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:53,152	| IOT063 |	Sinks in nicely so you get a nice dashboard
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:54,944	| IOT063 |	In there app for IOS and Android
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:59,808	| IOT063 |	It's complete I love that I love that the reason I'm not using it
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:05,184	| IOT063 |	Is because they don't have like a GPS tracking device which I like to use when I run
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:11,584	| IOT063 |	I like my maps and whatnot and I've got seven years of data in RunKeeper all the map information and elevation and
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:18,496	| IOT063 |	Anyway that's why I'm not using it but I love it I think you're going to love it too but when I guess we'll find out in a week or two
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:20,032	| IOT063 |	We will it arrives on when
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:22,080	| IOT063 |	So cool
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:26,432	| IOT063 |	Okay so I actually did go out and purchase to fitness trackers
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,456	| IOT063 |	In two days
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:28,480	| IOT063 |	Over the past weekend
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:29,760	| IOT063 |	One's going back already
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:37,184	| IOT063 |	Tell you what I bought and why is my back and then leading to the bigger picture here because I'm going to get cranky in a few minutes about Health Data
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:40,512	| IOT063 |	So I bought the Samsung Gear Fit
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,280	| IOT063 |	2
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:44,096	| IOT063 |	Which looks very much like a Microsoft band it's it's
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,632	| IOT063 |	Pretty slim in Felton
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:48,448	| IOT063 |	Has a beautiful display and I love the harder
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:52,288	| IOT063 |	Just it just launched last week I got it like the day it came out and $179
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,312	| IOT063 |	It does
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:56,128	| IOT063 |	Work with any Android phone
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:58,688	| IOT063 |	Android 4.4 better and I said that because
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,968	| IOT063 |	Previous Samsung
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:03,296	| IOT063 |	Wearables on the first timeout only work with Samsung phones which was a
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:05,344	| IOT063 |	Terrible no no shame on Samsung for that
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:08,160	| IOT063 |	Twitter iOS user this is pretty much useless to you as well
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:09,440	| IOT063 |	So
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:15,072	| IOT063 |	I used it for a day and I will like the hardware the software is okay
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:18,912	| IOT063 |	It pretty much tracks everything is got a optical heart rate monitor
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:20,448	| IOT063 |	Scott GPS Senate even though it's
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:21,728	| IOT063 |	Pretty small
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:25,568	| IOT063 |	It actually can store 1000 songs
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,848	| IOT063 |	Turn on Bluetooth
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:27,360	| IOT063 |	It really nice
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:29,152	| IOT063 |	Sleep information was kind of like
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:31,456	| IOT063 |	The reasons going back
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:33,248	| IOT063 |	Has to do with my bigger picture
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,272	| IOT063 |	I'm going to get cranky now
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:37,344	| IOT063 |	S-health is the software that uses
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,624	| IOT063 |	Samsung S Health
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:43,232	| IOT063 |	Until a few days ago S Health really didn't work with any other services
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:46,816	| IOT063 |	I say until a few days ago because it wasn't update to S Health
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:52,960	| IOT063 |	I just Friday last week I believe where they share data with Microsoft Misfit RunKeeper and Strava
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:55,776	| IOT063 |	But here's my issue
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:04:00,128	| IOT063 |	And this may not be a problem for you Stacy cuz you're all in one package
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:01,152	| IOT063 |	Record
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:03,968	| IOT063 |	I am calling for a global
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:06,272	| IOT063 |	Mobile Health Data standards
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:08,064	| IOT063 |	Because all of these different
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:10,368	| IOT063 |	Applications all these trackers Ali services
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,928	| IOT063 |	They all want to own the data themselves
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:14,208	| IOT063 |	Occasionally
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:17,536	| IOT063 |	Some of them let you export your data manually which is great
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:20,863	| IOT063 |	Some of them sink to some Services some of them don't seem to others
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:24,703	| IOT063 |	And even when some a service or tracker says it syncs with something
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,471	| IOT063 |	It
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:29,055	| IOT063 |	You want to check the fine print because only certain things go
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,335	| IOT063 |	2
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,383	| IOT063 |	Get synced over property example
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:34,687	| IOT063 |	S-health actually does sync over to Fitbit
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:36,479	| IOT063 |	But all it stinks over is steps
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:37,759	| IOT063 |	To all of my
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,295	| IOT063 |	Calories burned my
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,087	| IOT063 |	Tracking my activities
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:41,855	| IOT063 |	None of that goes
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:44,671	| IOT063 |	They say it's thanks but just
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:45,439	| IOT063 |	This bit
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,463	| IOT063 |	Guess you better
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:51,583	| IOT063 |	Okay so this actually ties in cuz our guest this week is it for Desta Ramirez who is actually a
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,351	| IOT063 |	Public Health
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:58,239	| IOT063 |	PhD who did research on this so wonderful about why this matters
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,007	| IOT063 |	What's happening
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:01,567	| IOT063 |	But
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,335	| IOT063 |	What about
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,359	| IOT063 |	Something like healthkit
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,127	| IOT063 |	Cuz that's kind of what
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:07,455	| IOT063 |	IOS only
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:13,855	| IOT063 |	Right ok Google as Google Fit which actually is IOS and Android if I'm not mistaken it's Andrew and obviously
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,135	| IOT063 |	But frankly
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:19,487	| IOT063 |	It just doesn't track enough information and does not sync reliably for me I was thinking
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:24,607	| IOT063 |	Data over to Google Fit And it's like 4-5 days it would show nothing and then all of a sudden it would show like
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,375	| IOT063 |	Three days worth of stuff
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:30,495	| IOT063 |	It's just not reliable enough for me I mean I know other people use it
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:34,591	| IOT063 |	Google fits great if you don't even have a Tracker because your phone is your tracker
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:38,175	| IOT063 |	And in that case maybe it works well but I have dedicated trackers
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:42,015	| IOT063 |	Because I need more than what my phone gives me Android don't want to carry my phone everywhere
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:46,879	| IOT063 |	So you write how get it supposed to be that book of record Google Fit is supposed to be that book of records
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,415	| IOT063 |	Microsoft has their healthvault
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,695	| IOT063 |	The problem is
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:52,255	| IOT063 |	It's still very segmented peep
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:54,047	| IOT063 |	Still want to own the data
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:59,167	| IOT063 |	You know what it does not get any more personal than my personal Hell Date I should own the data
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:01,471	| IOT063 |	And be able to use anything I want and make it work
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:04,799	| IOT063 |	Because I have a broken toe for the last 4 weeks
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:06,335	| IOT063 |	Really disappointing
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,103	| IOT063 |	Bye
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,895	| IOT063 |	Jawbone software it is like
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,407	| IOT063 |	Stacy
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,735	| IOT063 |	Okay I'm like
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,503	| IOT063 |	I think I should be an injury
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,295	| IOT063 |	Itsfunneh
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:21,439	| IOT063 |	It's funny you say that because there is in your Under Armour app if you're going to have you can log a day as a rest day so you won't get mad
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:25,535	| IOT063 |	It's beautiful
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:28,607	| IOT063 |	You can you can you have
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,143	| IOT063 |	Now every time.
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:30,655	| IOT063 |	Consider that rest
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:37,567	| IOT063 |	We also I forgot to mention I also got a Fitbit Aria scale because my daughter has a Fitbit
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:42,431	| IOT063 |	And I just figured it was an easier thing to do is just at 1 skip
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:44,991	| IOT063 |	Then again it's getting the data from one map to the other
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,039	| IOT063 |	So we're on the Aria scale
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,063	| IOT063 |	Automat my
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,111	| IOT063 |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,159	| IOT063 |	Scale data
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:52,927	| IOT063 |	REI
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:57,791	| IOT063 |	It does so eat you will find things duesing but you got to
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:00,863	| IOT063 |	Don't assume everything will sink when somebody says it sent but you are correct
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:03,167	| IOT063 |	You can get your your weight data
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:06,751	| IOT063 |	Into other apps through MapMyFitness
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,519	| IOT063 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:09,055	| IOT063 |	I just hope this will be big for me
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,335	| IOT063 |	Cuz like I've never owned a scale
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:14,687	| IOT063 |	All right with that
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,455	| IOT063 |	So
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:15,967	| IOT063 |	New news
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,783	| IOT063 |	No actually read reviews first
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:19,551	| IOT063 |	Because
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:22,367	| IOT063 |	Sorry about this I mentioned this on a couple podcast ago
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:23,903	| IOT063 |	This is the first
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:26,207	| IOT063 |	Color rated outdoor
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:29,023	| IOT063 |	It's a par38 downlight
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:29,791	| IOT063 |	Yeah out there
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,887	| IOT063 |	Set a resistant all water resistant
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,423	| IOT063 |	And super water resistant
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:37,471	| IOT063 |	Because it's actually rained like 9 in
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:37,983	| IOT063 |	Since I put it up
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:40,031	| IOT063 |	And my uncovered roof
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,055	| IOT063 |	It is in a
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,615	| IOT063 |	So it's in a lighting fixture so the lighting pic
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:44,895	| IOT063 |	What it is
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:46,943	| IOT063 |	Because of the radios that are in it
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:51,551	| IOT063 |	It is a little bit more sensitive to moisture and dirt and stuff
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:52,831	| IOT063 |	So this is been up on my roof
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,855	| IOT063 |	For about
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,647	| IOT063 |	Two weeks now
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:58,463	| IOT063 |	This is the ilumi Outdoor rated color
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,743	| IOT063 |	BR30
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,279	| IOT063 |	It's $70
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,607	| IOT063 |	$60 is
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:07,167	| IOT063 |	Running rate for you-know-what connected light bulb
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,447	| IOT063 |	That's color
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:10,495	| IOT063 |	And it uses Bluetooth
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,775	| IOT063 |	Not to be
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:14,079	| IOT063 |	Bluetooth light bulb
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,103	| IOT063 |	And
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:17,151	| IOT063 |	It's been out there it's been like
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:20,223	| IOT063 |	Raining a lot it's super hot on my roof
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:23,039	| IOT063 |	Cuz I'm in Texas it's been like 95° outside
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:27,647	| IOT063 |	You know it hasn't made it through the 110 degree heat but you know
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:28,927	| IOT063 |	It's still pretty good
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,463	| IOT063 |	So
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,511	| IOT063 |	I really
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:34,047	| IOT063 |	Enjoy the illumise
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:34,815	| IOT063 |	They
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,095	| IOT063 |	Make a nice green
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:37,887	| IOT063 |	B Hughes don't actually do it
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,655	| IOT063 |	The green at all
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,959	| IOT063 |	And it has a fun feature
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,471	| IOT063 |	Where
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:47,871	| IOT063 |	You could do typical scene-setting in that sort of thing but they have a music setting which for my roof where we hold a lot of parties and stuff
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,175	| IOT063 |	Secret to
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,687	| IOT063 |	Spotify
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:51,967	| IOT063 |	Or Google Play
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:57,599	| IOT063 |	I hear your phone so what happens is and on your iOS device it will actually sync to download
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,391	| IOT063 |	That is
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:03,231	| IOT063 |	The music thing and what happens if you play this on your phone
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,255	| IOT063 |	And the lights
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:05,791	| IOT063 |	Go intermittent times
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,607	| IOT063 |	The downside is
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:09,887	| IOT063 |	If I
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:11,679	| IOT063 |	Because it doesn't work with Sonos switch
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,215	| IOT063 |	Speaker system I have on the
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:16,543	| IOT063 |	I would have to turn the volume down on my phone
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,591	| IOT063 |	Cuz it's not actually pulling for the volume
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:21,151	| IOT063 |	Are from the actual physical sound
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:23,199	| IOT063 |	Turn the volume
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:24,735	| IOT063 |	I can get the same kind of party
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:25,247	| IOT063 |	Experience
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,039	| IOT063 |	Fancy I
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:28,831	| IOT063 |	Sink a little
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:32,927	| IOT063 |	Like disco effect
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:35,231	| IOT063 |	And you're not really worried about the
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:36,767	| IOT063 |	You could do the same thing
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:41,887	| IOT063 |	Yeah since it's Bluetooth radio inside these there's you don't need a hub this works on the app
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,959	| IOT063 |	It does so here's where things get a little bit
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:51,615	| IOT063 |	Because it's on my roof which is really far away from the rest of my stuff
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:54,175	| IOT063 |	It's setup a Bluetooth mesh Network
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:55,711	| IOT063 |	But
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,991	| IOT063 |	Right now I don't have an
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:10:02,879	| IOT063 |	I don't have any other ilumi lights anywhere in the house so I have to actually go in my second floor and kind of Stand Out On The Roof
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:06,975	| IOT063 |	Like a little bit on the terrorist I don't have to climb the pole stairs but
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,255	| IOT063 |	To turn it on
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,023	| IOT063 |	Gotcha
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:13,375	| IOT063 |	Limited limited range of Bluetooth and it would help if you had other devices other
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,423	| IOT063 |	Illumise cuz she said it would be mashed
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:18,239	| IOT063 |	So that is your downside
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:24,639	| IOT063 |	There's no way to make them work with any Hub but she might therefore Place little closer to them or no
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,687	| IOT063 |	I don't see that is not an option I
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:30,015	| IOT063 |	Now there are Bluetooth hubs out there
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,551	| IOT063 |	The
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,831	| IOT063 |	Mesh they're using
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,599	| IOT063 |	I should have checked this way
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,903	| IOT063 |	I will find out what mesh there
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:40,255	| IOT063 |	I don't know if it's the standard
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:41,535	| IOT063 |	Richard Smash Hit
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:44,351	| IOT063 |	Is tomorrow cuz I'm not sure if that's actually
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,655	| IOT063 |	Implemented yet is a
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,167	| IOT063 |	Tortoise and
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,471	| IOT063 |	I know that it's been talked about
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:50,751	| IOT063 |	I don't know that everyone
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,263	| IOT063 |	Got that out there
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:52,543	| IOT063 |	Right
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:55,103	| IOT063 |	Right now
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:59,711	| IOT063 |	I can't I can't control it from anywhere except for within woot
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,223	| IOT063 |	What is range
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,527	| IOT063 |	Of the light bulb itself
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:07,903	| IOT063 |	Your mileage may vary
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:10,207	| IOT063 |	Outside
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:12,255	| IOT063 |	I mean I think it's
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,023	| IOT063 |	The color is
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,583	| IOT063 |	Ed
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:18,399	| IOT063 |	Udo having having the ability to turn your outside
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:20,959	| IOT063 |	You know your porch light or whatever this color
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,983	| IOT063 |	Is just fine
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:24,287	| IOT063 |	What do your neighbors think of this
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,615	| IOT063 |	My neighbors know I'm
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:34,783	| IOT063 |	All right
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:39,903	| IOT063 |	Let's say we should talk about a bit about news of the week before
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:41,695	| IOT063 |	Skipping to
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:45,535	| IOT063 |	Another review this time for the rachio 2nd gen sprinkler
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,303	| IOT063 |	That my
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,839	| IOT063 |	My father-in-law is going to help us
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:50,655	| IOT063 |	And I don't
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:54,239	| IOT063 |	Oh I do I'm getting away from that lawn and
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,031	| IOT063 |	Right you're leaving here line
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:57,823	| IOT063 |	Leaving one acre behind
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:00,127	| IOT063 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:00,895	| IOT063 |	You got something from Domino's
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:07,551	| IOT063 |	Yeah I thought this was kind of interesting I mean it's a little less irth but still smart devices
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:11,135	| IOT063 |	Domino's is actually testing
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:14,463	| IOT063 |	A on time cooking service for pick up customers
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:18,047	| IOT063 |	Basically they're going to use the GPS
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,583	| IOT063 |	To track where you are
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,375	| IOT063 |	On the way to pick up your pizza
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:27,775	| IOT063 |	And it really going to make the Peter start making it when you're close enough to the store so that way it is as fresh as pause
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,799	| IOT063 |	Possible literally
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:32,895	| IOT063 |	Custom made for you at a specific time based on your location so
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:36,991	| IOT063 |	If you're going to Domino's pick up a pizza and using the service you know don't make any side trips
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,271	| IOT063 |	You're going to
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,039	| IOT063 |	Hours of the pizza
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,319	| IOT063 |	Delivery
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,087	| IOT063 |	Because
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,367	| IOT063 |	They're going to make it in a computer
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:45,695	| IOT063 |	But I thought was kind of needles it's a start use of GPS
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:48,255	| IOT063 |	It is and other most people probably
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,535	| IOT063 |	Well maybe people order p
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:52,607	| IOT063 |	Pizza delivery on the way home I'm trying to think about the use case cuz
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,887	| IOT063 |	I usually order
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,655	| IOT063 |	Pizza when I'm already home
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:58,495	| IOT063 |	Driving from someplace to someplace then I just
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:03,615	| IOT063 |	Pick it up yes yes and actually use you still will pick it up but once you order it
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,639	| IOT063 |	Oh
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:08,735	| IOT063 |	They won't make it until you get close enough so that it's guaranteed so to speak fresh
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:15,647	| IOT063 |	They're trying to cut down there the time to actually making and they want pizza sitting around
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:17,951	| IOT063 |	They want them fresh for you when you get there
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:21,535	| IOT063 |	Don't know that because they'll see you so to speak on your way to pick it up
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:24,863	| IOT063 |	And oh no it takes us 7 1/2 minutes to make this pizza
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:27,423	| IOT063 |	Stacy is 7 1/2 minutes to get that thing in the oven
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,983	| IOT063 |	I guess it doesn't occur to me to actually
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,007	| IOT063 |	Stop and pick up a Domino's
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:32,287	| IOT063 |	Because
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:38,687	| IOT063 |	I cannot say that I we just we don't have one nearby it's like 10 miles away so
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:45,599	| IOT063 |	Yeah there's two people to do a common thing there's a coffee cup
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:48,159	| IOT063 |	Today in austin texas that call briggo
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:49,439	| IOT063 |	And they have a
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:52,255	| IOT063 |	Robot coffee maker on the UT campus that
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:55,839	| IOT063 |	When you it uses your GPS to know when to start making your coffee
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,399	| IOT063 |	Similar things
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:00,703	| IOT063 |	Other news
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:02,239	| IOT063 |	Last week I reported
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:03,007	| IOT063 |	That
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:06,847	| IOT063 |	Comcast and alarm.com are in talks to buy icontrol
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:10,431	| IOT063 |	What's going to happen is they're going to split I control into two bits
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:12,223	| IOT063 |	I am control
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:13,759	| IOT063 |	Flight control actually became
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,439	| IOT063 |	They control
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,999	| IOT063 |	That is the
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:26,303	| IOT063 |	News we should hear hopefully something on that in the neck
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:29,375	| IOT063 |	And it sounds like a deal that
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:31,423	| IOT063 |	Basically I control when they they
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,447	| IOT063 |	Put out some products
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:34,239	| IOT063 |	This is part of the kind of DIY effort
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:40,639	| IOT063 |	That seemed to confuse their customers cuz I controls customer base was companies like ATT and Comcast
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,407	| IOT063 |	Xfinity home
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,199	| IOT063 |	And I control
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,991	| IOT063 |	Would manage the backend software for
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:48,831	| IOT063 |	You started putting out products that were
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:52,415	| IOT063 |	They bought Piper which is an all-in-one security device
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:55,999	| IOT063 |	And then they introduced on the call Touchstone which was helping diyre setup
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:57,023	| IOT063 |	They're kind of home secure
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:57,791	| IOT063 |	Dirty stuff
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:58,559	| IOT063 |	And I probably
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:02,399	| IOT063 |	I'm imagining it best confuse their customers were like High
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:05,215	| IOT063 |	These products compete now with our product
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:05,727	| IOT063 |	What's happening
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,263	| IOT063 |	So
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:11,871	| IOT063 |	They've been kind of having some issues and some of their customers have not upgraded to
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:15,711	| IOT063 |	New contracts with them or added new devices with them
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,479	| IOT063 |	I'm so
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:17,759	| IOT063 |	Sounded like I control was having
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,855	| IOT063 |	I should note that
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:26,463	| IOT063 |	Because of recording schedules we are not going to be talking about what was announced it Apple's event
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:30,815	| IOT063 |	Cuz I type in a few hours from now
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,583	| IOT063 |	It's happening soon
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,655	| IOT063 |	We won't put this out for awhile in
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:36,191	| IOT063 |	Kevin is on the road
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:36,703	| IOT063 |	Because Kevin is
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:38,239	| IOT063 |	A man in demand
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:42,847	| IOT063 |	On the road all day and cross-country trips today in about an hour but
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:46,943	| IOT063 |	Before packing a lot I was paying attention to E3 which is the
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:53,087	| IOT063 |	Video game Electronics conference that's going on right now it's kinda like the CES of electronic video games
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:55,391	| IOT063 |	And I noticed
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:58,463	| IOT063 |	Late last night as I was watching the live stream
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:00,767	| IOT063 |	Tiaras getting a healthy nod
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:06,399	| IOT063 |	In the form of actual games on consoles with VR headsets
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:11,007	| IOT063 |	I think the HTC Vive will actually be supported by Bethesda software
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:13,055	| IOT063 |	And they are the makers of and
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:14,079	| IOT063 |	These are not kids games
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,359	| IOT063 |	I'm working it out
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,895	| IOT063 |	The makers of Doom
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,943	| IOT063 |	And Fallout 4
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:24,063	| IOT063 |	Both of which they were demonstrating in VR you can actually go where VR goggles and play the games
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:27,135	| IOT063 |	I thought you were out there in LA which I was not but
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:31,999	| IOT063 |	I just thought it was very interesting that the VR as we will
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,023	| IOT063 |	Boom right
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:36,607	| IOT063 |	From the center there it was at that III so it'll be interesting to watch
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,887	| IOT063 |	We'll keep an eye out
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,935	| IOT063 |	Alright well Kevin thanks so much
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,471	| IOT063 |	Let's see I think we will
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:46,335	| IOT063 |	Skip to our rachio review now and then stay tuned after that for our guest
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,871	| IOT063 |	Who is Ernesto Ramirez
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:49,151	| IOT063 |	Talking about public health
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,175	| IOT063 |	Data actually
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:53,503	| IOT063 |	Medical data and Public Health
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:59,903	| IOT063 |	As I mentioned before I'm bringing my father-in-law Gregg Allman on the show to talk about his
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:02,975	| IOT063 |	Experience with the rachio sprinkler
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,743	| IOT063 |	Where is I do not
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:13,471	| IOT063 |	So we saw this about 6 weeks ago and
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:15,263	| IOT063 |	The install process would you think
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,311	| IOT063 |	Steelers very simple Acts
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:21,407	| IOT063 |	Promise of the rachio is that it takes your old kind of dumb
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:24,735	| IOT063 |	Irrigation controls in Dad's kind of a wifi-connected
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:26,015	| IOT063 |	System that
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:28,063	| IOT063 |	Look at the weather forecast
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:32,671	| IOT063 |	We need to water we don't need to water it also takes into consideration, the type of
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:35,231	| IOT063 |	You can remotely control
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,255	| IOT063 |	Your Zone
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,303	| IOT063 |	What goes off at what time
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,327	| IOT063 |	So overall Greg
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:40,607	| IOT063 |	After living with this
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:41,887	| IOT063 |	What do you think
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:45,983	| IOT063 |	I think it is an excellent approach
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:49,311	| IOT063 |	Frankfort water
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,335	| IOT063 |	I
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,615	| IOT063 |	Think that
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:54,943	| IOT063 |	As good as the other measurements that are available
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:57,247	| IOT063 |	And in that regard about some issues
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,783	| IOT063 |	Nothing yet
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,551	| IOT063 |	Having mind
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:05,439	| IOT063 |	Home location not being too consistent with the weather station data that I'm
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:06,975	| IOT063 |	Ah-So
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:09,279	| IOT063 |	Your weather station how far away is
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,095	| IOT063 |	Does a mile and a half
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:14,399	| IOT063 |	All right and you told me that you had had
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:15,423	| IOT063 |	One day where it was
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:16,959	| IOT063 |	At your place in
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:18,495	| IOT063 |	0 according to Ranchos measure
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:19,775	| IOT063 |	Correct
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:23,871	| IOT063 |	Now you can connect sensors via if this then that
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:26,431	| IOT063 |	Put your own weather station in Leica netatmo woodwork
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:28,735	| IOT063 |	Or you could also add like
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,759	| IOT063 |	Moisture sensor
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:30,271	| IOT063 |	Jennifer soil
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:34,367	| IOT063 |	I think there's actually a connection for that but you don't have any of those things
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,159	| IOT063 |	Do you think it's safe
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:36,671	| IOT063 |	Yuan
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:39,487	| IOT063 |	Why would raisins
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,535	| IOT063 |	Certainly is contrasted
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:45,119	| IOT063 |	To just letting it
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:47,679	| IOT063 |	We're in one of those water areas where
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:50,495	| IOT063 |	The city says you can only water on these days so you have
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:51,775	| IOT063 |	Set that up
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:56,127	| IOT063 |	And then rocchio resident deciding which date
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:58,175	| IOT063 |	Side skip or not
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,455	| IOT063 |	Always a trainee.
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:01,503	| IOT063 |	So it's skip quite a bit
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:03,807	| IOT063 |	And therefore I've been saving money
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:08,415	| IOT063 |	I'm in my alternative in the past
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:13,023	| IOT063 |	That part is handled and if I'm away from home
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:15,071	| IOT063 |	It's only handled where I couldn't otherwise
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:17,119	| IOT063 |	Best Russo like
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,655	| IOT063 |	I think you were out of town for like a week
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,423	| IOT063 |	A couple weeks ago
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,471	| IOT063 |	We were out
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:21,983	| IOT063 |	It was raining
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:25,055	| IOT063 |	That's correct
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:26,079	| IOT063 |	But I did get messages
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:31,455	| IOT063 |	I was saying okay peace of mind and that way you got a little link to the weather back home
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:36,831	| IOT063 |	All right and what are the downsides like I know
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,599	| IOT063 |	Some trouble
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,111	| IOT063 |	Honda Wi-Fi
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,391	| IOT063 |	That is
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,951	| IOT063 |	Screw you do need a
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,743	| IOT063 |	Strong enough WiFi connection
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:45,791	| IOT063 |	30 weeks
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:50,143	| IOT063 |	Corner of the garage or waves
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:51,423	| IOT063 |	My router
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,447	| IOT063 |	We got it up
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,031	| IOT063 |	To turn onto it
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,823	| IOT063 |	Call three blues
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:01,919	| IOT063 |	But then I found out that I was getting messages but Russia was
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:03,199	| IOT063 |	Offline
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:05,503	| IOT063 |	And so I can put it that
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:08,063	| IOT063 |	Intermittently at least disconnect
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:08,575	| IOT063 |	Be quiet
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,879	| IOT063 |	So that's on the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:13,951	| IOT063 |	So I did Remedy by getting up
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:17,535	| IOT063 |	Stronger range extender in the new location in sunset time
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:18,559	| IOT063 |	It's been steady
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,839	| IOT063 |	All right
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,375	| IOT063 |	So the big question
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:27,263	| IOT063 |	The rachio 8 zone is $200 and the 16th
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:29,055	| IOT063 |	Is $250
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:32,127	| IOT063 |	When I take this away to send it back to rachio
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:32,895	| IOT063 |	Would you buy another one
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:35,199	| IOT063 |	What what you doing
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:45,439	| IOT063 |	Certainly has to also think through the other sensor situation because
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:49,279	| IOT063 |	In our local condition I think the make it
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:50,047	| IOT063 |	Really
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:51,071	| IOT063 |	A good performing
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,351	| IOT063 |	Item
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:54,399	| IOT063 |	I'd have to put in some sort of local sensor
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,703	| IOT063 |	But it's enough of a savior
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:57,983	| IOT063 |	In terms of not having
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,543	| IOT063 |	And having that
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:02,847	| IOT063 |	Remote access I guess for testing sprinkler heads
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:03,359	| IOT063 |	Isn't that kind of thing
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:10,015	| IOT063 |	All right well that's great now I know it's get your Father's Day so
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:13,087	| IOT063 |	And for the rest of you guys
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:14,367	| IOT063 |	You also
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,647	| IOT063 |	Because after this
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:22,304	| IOT063 |	We are going to be back with the Ernesto Ramirez talking about what to do with wearable data's and privacy and Public Health
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:30,496	| IOT063 |	Greater break into the podcast for a message from Wolf SSL here I've got Larry stefanik who is this
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,264	| IOT063 |	CEO
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:32,800	| IOT063 |	Larry who is
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,568	| IOT063 |	Wolf SSL
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:40,480	| IOT063 |	Stacy worthy experts on device security we've been working in the space for the last decade
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:44,320	| IOT063 |	We're now the most widely deployed security solution
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:48,160	| IOT063 |	For the iot with over a billion devices secured at this point
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:49,952	| IOT063 |	That is a lot
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:50,976	| IOT063 |	Devices
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:52,512	| IOT063 |	What goes into
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:54,048	| IOT063 |	Securing an iot device
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:57,376	| IOT063 |	So we think about three key things first of all
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:22:00,448	| IOT063 |	The data in transit or the data between your device
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:02,240	| IOT063 |	And your cloud
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:05,568	| IOT063 |	So the the traditional are most popular way
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:08,896	| IOT063 |	To secure that data is through
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:12,480	| IOT063 |	The SSL protocol which is the protocol that is used
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:14,528	| IOT063 |	Unrest of the internet for securing
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:15,808	| IOT063 |	Data in transit
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:17,600	| IOT063 |	We also think a lot about
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:20,160	| IOT063 |	Securing data on the device itself
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:24,000	| IOT063 |	So encrypting data that you might have on your device that uses
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,024	| IOT063 |	Needs to be private
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:29,888	| IOT063 |	And it finally we help companies secure their firmware updates
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:36,288	| IOT063 |	It's one of the clever things that attackers like to do two devices is installed their firmware instead of year
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:39,360	| IOT063 |	So what you need to do is have a secure Channel
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:43,456	| IOT063 |	To your device the best way to do that the most common way to do that is through
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:43,968	| IOT063 |	SSL
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:46,784	| IOT063 |	And we do all of the above that's what we do
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:54,208	| IOT063 |	4Runner smart grid where in automotive Industrial Automation consumer devices
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:23:00,608	| IOT063 |	In medical devices and we address this wide range of markets through a long list of Partnerships that we
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:04,192	| IOT063 |	We have with the silicone vendors in that the operating system vendors
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,472	| IOT063 |	Alright was everywhere
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:06,240	| IOT063 |	Where can we find
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:13,664	| IOT063 |	So just check us out and wolf ssl.com coyote
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:20,064	| IOT063 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,984	| IOT063 |	Zoe super-smart Ernesto
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:39,264	| IOT063 |	Thank you for coming on the show The
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,824	| IOT063 |	Picture of an excited to be here
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:44,384	| IOT063 |	Me too so I met Ernesto
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:46,944	| IOT063 |	Go to South by Southwest event
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:49,248	| IOT063 |	Was right after Apple introduced healthkit
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:52,064	| IOT063 |	And he was talking about what this
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:54,880	| IOT063 |	Gave to the medical community and how they might do something like
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:56,672	| IOT063 |	And I was just
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:57,184	| IOT063 |	Smitten
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,720	| IOT063 |	Smitten with his ideas
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,560	| IOT063 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:03,840	| IOT063 |	Wearables
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,376	| IOT063 |	And Health Data
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,144	| IOT063 |	Big picture
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:08,192	| IOT063 |	What should I be thinking about
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,728	| IOT063 |	This space
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:10,496	| IOT063 |	What's the Big Apple
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:12,288	| IOT063 |	I think
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:13,056	| IOT063 |	They're almost
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:13,824	| IOT063 |	I wouldn't say there's
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:15,360	| IOT063 |	Limitless opportunities
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:18,944	| IOT063 |	What's available and what's possible with wearable but I think
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:19,712	| IOT063 |	We haven't
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,480	| IOT063 |	Quite scene
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:23,552	| IOT063 |	You know we see lots of things like
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,600	| IOT063 |	Step counters Eagle on your wrist
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:27,648	| IOT063 |	Hot reminders now that you can wear on your wrist
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:30,208	| IOT063 |	But I think the interesting thing that's going to happen
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:36,608	| IOT063 |	When these type of devices start talking to each other
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:40,960	| IOT063 |	And there's devices Note 8 screen start talking to other
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:42,752	| IOT063 |	Like the things in your home
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:44,032	| IOT063 |	Like your car
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:44,800	| IOT063 |	Like your medical record
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:48,896	| IOT063 |	Okay so like
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:51,456	| IOT063 |	CII know that I talked to somebody who
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:57,088	| IOT063 |	Kind of devices for monitoring people who are aging in place and they were talking about using
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:25:00,160	| IOT063 |	Censored on the bathroom door
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,952	| IOT063 |	Assess someone's
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,720	| IOT063 |	Health
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,256	| IOT063 |	Because apparently there's a correlation
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:07,328	| IOT063 |	Those are the kind of things that you're talking about
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:10,400	| IOT063 |	Exactly so
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:12,192	| IOT063 |	Yo I'm more connected future
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:14,496	| IOT063 |	What are the things that I
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:17,568	| IOT063 |	I think would be exciting this is something I'm still looking for someone
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:20,128	| IOT063 |	Hopefully one day I'll have enough money to buy it
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:22,176	| IOT063 |	If my bathroom scale
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:25,248	| IOT063 |	An my wearable device to understand all of my fitness
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:27,296	| IOT063 |	Can talk to my kitchen
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:29,088	| IOT063 |	That's what magic can really start to happen
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:33,696	| IOT063 |	So secrets in Seattle
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,464	| IOT063 |	Getting a lot of weight
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:36,768	| IOT063 |	I'm not very good at tracking my diet
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:41,632	| IOT063 |	What kitchen do what kind of food I had you can recommend the meals that I
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:42,400	| IOT063 |	Can make
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:43,168	| IOT063 |	2
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:49,056	| IOT063 |	No regionals and I'm ready to be physically active
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:53,152	| IOT063 |	Am I a technical standpoint I think will be really interesting to see in the future
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:54,688	| IOT063 |	My freezer would never let me at the ice
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:56,480	| IOT063 |	I know it
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:00,320	| IOT063 |	You haven't exercised
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:00,832	| IOT063 |	Enough
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,392	| IOT063 |	She want to lose those last 5 pounds
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:04,672	| IOT063 |	The answer is no
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:10,560	| IOT063 |	This is a great vision
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:13,120	| IOT063 |	Let's talk about the where we are today
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:15,680	| IOT063 |	It feels like I am inundated with
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:20,032	| IOT063 |	Studies showing that like my Fitbit isn't accurate was the most recent one
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:23,104	| IOT063 |	My Fitbit data into one of my doctors and they're like
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:26,432	| IOT063 |	Stacy I do not want to see that I don't care
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:32,320	| IOT063 |	So let's talk about how do we get this into the medical sphere or should we even
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:33,344	| IOT063 |	Get it into the medical sphere
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:35,392	| IOT063 |	That's a great question I think
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:40,000	| IOT063 |	Future
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:45,632	| IOT063 |	Which is a very very interesting question because it starts to get
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:46,400	| IOT063 |	Yelp
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:49,728	| IOT063 |	Try to ask yourself what
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:53,056	| IOT063 |	You know what is a Stafford what is the heart rate
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:54,592	| IOT063 |	And you have to really ask
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,640	| IOT063 |	What are these things
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:59,712	| IOT063 |	Could store and Bear
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:02,272	| IOT063 |	Even your bathroom
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,088	| IOT063 |	Stop medical device
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:06,880	| IOT063 |	Haven't gone through
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:09,440	| IOT063 |	That's rigorous FDA clearance process
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:12,000	| IOT063 |	Required of the things that we
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:13,280	| IOT063 |	We can't trim clinical
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:16,608	| IOT063 |	Actually I think
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:21,472	| IOT063 |	Fairly accurate the things that they say they do
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:22,752	| IOT063 |	And then
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:26,592	| IOT063 |	Once we decide whether or not they are accurate
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:28,640	| IOT063 |	Useful for what kind of day today
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:31,456	| IOT063 |	Getting them to talk to the medical record
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:35,296	| IOT063 |	It's a huge conversation and it's
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:37,088	| IOT063 |	So
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,624	| IOT063 |	Let's see how do we get them to
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:39,136	| IOT063 |	To talk to
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:43,744	| IOT063 |	A medical record cuz most of those are kind of proprietary they're locked up there
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:48,352	| IOT063 |	HIPAA compliance stairs
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:50,912	| IOT063 |	So what is this future world of
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:51,424	| IOT063 |	Look like
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,728	| IOT063 |	There's two pieces
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:56,544	| IOT063 |	What you just said that are super important
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,848	| IOT063 |	How do we get this data
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:27:59,872	| IOT063 |	Into the system
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:02,688	| IOT063 |	Which is not a insurmountable
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:05,248	| IOT063 |	Although there are closed system
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:06,784	| IOT063 |	But you had your ethics in your cerner's
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:09,600	| IOT063 |	Electronic medical record providers
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,904	| IOT063 |	They are starting to be
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:17,280	| IOT063 |	More open to allowing data from other places
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:21,120	| IOT063 |	That's me, text
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:23,680	| IOT063 |	Is a
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:27,264	| IOT063 |	Not easy thing to do but it's not something that's going to be impossible
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:31,360	| IOT063 |	The social tees I think is even more interesting and
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:33,408	| IOT063 |	Probably orders of magnitude more important
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:37,504	| IOT063 |	Anti-social onion is how do we get the medical system
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:39,040	| IOT063 |	All the way down the line
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:41,600	| IOT063 |	All of those providers the position
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:42,624	| IOT063 |	The nurses
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:44,160	| IOT063 |	Assistant
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:49,024	| IOT063 |	To understand the type of information that people are using in the course of their everyday lives
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:52,608	| IOT063 |	How can I use that for actually impacting that character.
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:55,680	| IOT063 |	And so far we've actually seen this
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:58,496	| IOT063 |	Happen in a couple of instances there was the
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:28:59,776	| IOT063 |	The famous case where
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:02,336	| IOT063 |	Some guy 42 year old man cave
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:04,640	| IOT063 |	Commando hospital after I believe it was a seizure
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:08,736	| IOT063 |	They used his Fitbit data so it feels like and I don't know if that's
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:10,272	| IOT063 |	Indicative of more to come
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:11,296	| IOT063 |	Is that
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,576	| IOT063 |	I don't know what do you think
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:22,560	| IOT063 |	Because I have something wrong with her heart rate
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:24,096	| IOT063 |	Know if we will chat
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,888	| IOT063 |	The wearable throughout their right
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:27,936	| IOT063 |	Now what are they measuring
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:29,984	| IOT063 |	What do people actually do anything
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:32,800	| IOT063 |	Health and wellness spaces
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:36,640	| IOT063 |	And then they're measuring what they eat
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:38,176	| IOT063 |	And those three things
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,968	| IOT063 |	Really add up to
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:43,296	| IOT063 |	I'm major in Canada to having a major impact on
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,320	| IOT063 |	Chronic disease
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:46,880	| IOT063 |	United States and worldwide
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:51,488	| IOT063 |	Edison could figure out a way to actually make that part of
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:56,864	| IOT063 |	You can have the conversation of hay
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:57,888	| IOT063 |	We noticed that
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:02,496	| IOT063 |	You know you haven't gone for a run or gone to the gym or you haven't got more than 5,000
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:05,568	| IOT063 |	Going on
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,848	| IOT063 |	How can you be helpful
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:10,688	| IOT063 |	Yes I actually have a friend that I share my fitness data with
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,456	| IOT063 |	And
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:13,248	| IOT063 |	A couple weeks ago I actually
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:14,272	| IOT063 |	Dislocated my
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,832	| IOT063 |	Sounds ridiculous but
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:18,368	| IOT063 |	I've been walking around in this boot
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:20,672	| IOT063 |	And I haven't been able to walk as much so
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:22,720	| IOT063 |	She actually sent me a text and she was like
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:27,328	| IOT063 |	Dude what is up with your barely making 4000 steps a day
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,960	| IOT063 |	You may not believe this but
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:35,008	| IOT063 |	Part of my dissertation research was
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:40,128	| IOT063 |	Talking to people about their experiences using
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:46,528	| IOT063 |	Talking to someone about their physical activity for what's going on your life
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,832	| IOT063 |	Is not actually that uncommon
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:49,856	| IOT063 |	We do it all the time
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,648	| IOT063 |	See that's so how do we
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:52,928	| IOT063 |	Take something like that
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:59,840	| IOT063 |	And make it I mean that that is kind of interesting if your doctor like even if it was an automated text
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:01,120	| IOT063 |	About something like that
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:01,888	| IOT063 |	To you I don't know how
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:04,192	| IOT063 |	How would you turn that into something
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:05,216	| IOT063 |	Good for health
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:07,520	| IOT063 |	There's a good example of people doing
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:09,056	| IOT063 |	Stuff like that
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:13,408	| IOT063 |	Nothing
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:14,176	| IOT063 |	PeopleNet
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:16,992	| IOT063 |	A company in San Francisco
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:18,784	| IOT063 |	What they did is they took
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:23,648	| IOT063 |	Clinically
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:25,952	| IOT063 |	Statistically significant
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:29,280	| IOT063 |	On obesity
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:30,560	| IOT063 |	And overall health
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:39,264	| IOT063 |	And they took that basically said let's just make this thing and now they're showing the same
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:42,848	| IOT063 |	We can make a difference
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:44,384	| IOT063 |	You can stay called yesterday
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:47,712	| IOT063 |	Base of a program that was developed a while ago
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:48,992	| IOT063 |	Without these
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:49,760	| IOT063 |	Schools
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:51,040	| IOT063 |	That being said
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:52,320	| IOT063 |	I don't think that that
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:53,600	| IOT063 |	It's going to be probably the case
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:32:00,512	| IOT063 |	Overall I don't think magically everyone's going to
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:01,280	| IOT063 |	Because
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,560	| IOT063 |	Well what happened
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,096	| IOT063 |	If there's data
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:06,912	| IOT063 |	Inside your physical activity tracker
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:09,984	| IOT063 |	Sitting in your weight scale
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:16,384	| IOT063 |	And that shows that something might actually wrong with you that they nest know what are the
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:20,480	| IOT063 |	Cactus plants
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:22,528	| IOT063 |	That's something else I don't think any of us know yet
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:27,136	| IOT063 |	What my doctor didn't see my heart attack coming on my
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:28,672	| IOT063 |	Fitbit charge
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:31,232	| IOT063 |	Exactly this is the world we live in
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:34,816	| IOT063 |	Stop
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:38,400	| IOT063 |	That information
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:40,960	| IOT063 |	You know what's weird is that responsibility
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:42,240	| IOT063 |	That's worrisome
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:44,544	| IOT063 |	Let's switch a little too
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:46,848	| IOT063 |	Another use case for wearables
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:48,896	| IOT063 |	Cuz we talked about it mostly in the medical sense
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:49,664	| IOT063 |	Switch
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:51,456	| IOT063 |	Yeah but there's also an option
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:53,760	| IOT063 |	And players are keeping their employees
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:56,576	| IOT063 |	Fitbit sore jaw bones and
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:59,392	| IOT063 |	That opens up a can of worms on the Privacy side
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:01,184	| IOT063 |	I'd love to talk to you about
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:02,976	| IOT063 |	Kind of this the day that we're collecting
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:03,744	| IOT063 |	Privacy
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:05,792	| IOT063 |	What it means when
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:07,584	| IOT063 |	Your employer is asking you to wear what
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:11,168	| IOT063 |	Starting to give
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:12,704	| IOT063 |	Their employees devices
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:13,984	| IOT063 |	As part of these corporate Wellness
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:16,288	| IOT063 |	Plant or subsidized
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:19,104	| IOT063 |	Weight scalar or what-have-you
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:23,200	| IOT063 |	And then as part of Wellness Lee makes it up
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:25,248	| IOT063 |	Petition
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:28,320	| IOT063 |	North Central College
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:30,368	| IOT063 |	Corporate Wellness
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:31,904	| IOT063 |	And
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:34,208	| IOT063 |	It remains to be seen on way or what
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:35,744	| IOT063 |	What do we have a right to enter
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:37,536	| IOT063 |	Privacy around
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:41,376	| IOT063 |	Best Health Data Networks tracking you know it's not maybe as
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:43,936	| IOT063 |	Privacy Centric as blood testing results
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:45,472	| IOT063 |	But it's not
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:46,752	| IOT063 |	Nothing
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:50,336	| IOT063 |	You know it could be used against us for whatever reason
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,872	| IOT063 |	What might happen in the future
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:57,248	| IOT063 |	Sure I can see I think there was an article in the Wall Street Journal that talk to I think it was
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:34:00,320	| IOT063 |	Shrp
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:02,880	| IOT063 |	They had this crazy anecdote
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:03,904	| IOT063 |	It was hypothetical
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:08,000	| IOT063 |	If you saw that one of your salespeople
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:11,840	| IOT063 |	Slept really well last night versus the other one who had
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:12,864	| IOT063 |	Like 2 hours of sleep
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:14,656	| IOT063 |	Seem to be lagging
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:18,496	| IOT063 |	You would choose the one that got more sleep to make the big pitch tomorrow
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:21,312	| IOT063 |	And I thought that was a really interesting
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:24,640	| IOT063 |	Example because you know there are plenty of people
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:27,968	| IOT063 |	Who is he of course she would give you know this person who's
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:29,760	| IOT063 |	More physically fit
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:36,160	| IOT063 |	To do something like that but that doesn't take into account all kinds of extraneous things like maybe they have a newborn at home and
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:37,952	| IOT063 |	Maybe they're still really awesome at pitching
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:39,744	| IOT063 |	Even when it had 2 hours of sleep
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:43,328	| IOT063 |	Cuz people tend to make correlations about things
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:44,864	| IOT063 |	Without actually
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,400	| IOT063 |	Having the root cause
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:48,960	| IOT063 |	I get what you're saying at the end of the day
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:51,520	| IOT063 |	Whatever you know you're wearing one of these things
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:53,056	| IOT063 |	You're using your phone to track your active
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:54,336	| IOT063 |	Heads up
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:35:00,992	| IOT063 |	Zeros and ones in the database that's some kind of information
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:04,064	| IOT063 |	It doesn't really know who you are if you can't
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:05,600	| IOT063 |	Tell who I am
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:08,416	| IOT063 |	Employee and just because
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:09,696	| IOT063 |	I took
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:11,744	| IOT063 |	Steps one day and 10000 the next
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:13,280	| IOT063 |	I don't know
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:13,792	| IOT063 |	I might make some
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:20,192	| IOT063 |	There's a Reddit article and it was confirmed
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:23,008	| IOT063 |	Of Fitbit being able to anticipate somebody being pregnant
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:25,312	| IOT063 |	I'm just based on I think it was her heart rate
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:28,128	| IOT063 |	That was really interesting because
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:30,688	| IOT063 |	My employer's of all been very cool
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:34,016	| IOT063 |	About people getting pregnant but you know there's plenty out there who are not
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:36,576	| IOT063 |	And if someone could see something like that
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:42,720	| IOT063 |	Especially before the employee told them they could fire them right away and not run afoul of any sort of
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:44,768	| IOT063 |	Can people from fire
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:48,096	| IOT063 |	These are not
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:49,376	| IOT063 |	Crazy farfetch
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:50,912	| IOT063 |	Maybe
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:53,984	| IOT063 |	Definitely not and I think it does kind of
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:57,056	| IOT063 |	Who makes the case for us being careful
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:59,360	| IOT063 |	And how we use these devices
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:02,432	| IOT063 |	Where this data goes what decisions make about it
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,968	| IOT063 |	There was actually it is
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:06,016	| IOT063 |	Remind me there's a great example of
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:08,064	| IOT063 |	Tesco in the UK
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:12,416	| IOT063 |	I put device tracking devices on their users basically RFID tags
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:15,488	| IOT063 |	And how much
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:16,768	| IOT063 |	Where do we going in the warehouse
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:20,352	| IOT063 |	Expect too much time
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:21,120	| IOT063 |	In the restroom
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:24,960	| IOT063 |	That is the other
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:26,496	| IOT063 |	Utopia
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:33,152	| IOT063 |	So what do you recommend I mean like
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:35,200	| IOT063 |	Let's take it from a variety of different
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:35,968	| IOT063 |	Perspectives
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:39,040	| IOT063 |	From the perspective of a fitness tracking
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:41,344	| IOT063 |	How should they be thinking about these
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:42,368	| IOT063 |	Is a privacy
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:43,648	| IOT063 |	All of the things
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:44,928	| IOT063 |	What's your advice
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:46,464	| IOT063 |	I think
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:49,536	| IOT063 |	Whoever it is it's always think of the individual
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:50,816	| IOT063 |	Using the system
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:51,584	| IOT063 |	Yo
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:53,120	| IOT063 |	A person that that bought
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:54,656	| IOT063 |	Or is strapped on
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:55,936	| IOT063 |	That device on the wrist
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:57,728	| IOT063 |	For the person who
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:36:59,008	| IOT063 |	And who's wearing it
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:01,568	| IOT063 |	That's true
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:05,152	| IOT063 |	Is it to get the end of the day it is always going to be the person that
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:07,200	| IOT063 |	Excuse
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:09,248	| IOT063 |	Where is haneda originating
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:10,272	| IOT063 |	And you don't
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:12,320	| IOT063 |	It whether or not your employer pot it for you
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:14,368	| IOT063 |	Or your grandma
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:15,648	| IOT063 |	If you're wearing it
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:18,464	| IOT063 |	You are the originator of that data and that at the end of the day
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:21,536	| IOT063 |	Needs to be
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:24,864	| IOT063 |	You to understand that they can trust
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:25,888	| IOT063 |	Whatever entity
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:30,496	| IOT063 |	Is making the right decision
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,264	| IOT063 |	So that
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:32,032	| IOT063 |	They are protective
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:34,080	| IOT063 |	In terms of their privacy
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:35,360	| IOT063 |	But also I think
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:37,408	| IOT063 |	You know I'm a big proponent of data access
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:39,456	| IOT063 |	It's actually quicker
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:41,760	| IOT063 |	Privacy is being able to actually have access
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:46,368	| IOT063 |	Should the information that you're creating and contributing to these huge data system
EDL	00:37:47,136	00:37:50,208	| IOT063 |	So I think as long as people are are taking those
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:53,280	| IOT063 |	Taking those ideas to Heart
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:55,328	| IOT063 |	I think you could look pretty good place
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:56,608	| IOT063 |	Okay and what about
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:59,168	| IOT063 |	Regulators so if I'm a lawmaker and I'm
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:00,960	| IOT063 |	Looking at these cases
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:05,056	| IOT063 |	What needs to change about how we manage the stuff
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:08,896	| IOT063 |	Should be done be looking at like what HR is doing
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:15,552	| IOT063 |	Like I said I'm a proponent for Access I think we should have some sort of legal structure that sets up
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:16,320	| IOT063 |	Are rice
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:17,856	| IOT063 |	To access the data
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:19,136	| IOT063 |	We are collecting
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,672	| IOT063 |	So
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:21,696	| IOT063 |	Lafayette Indiana weather.
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:25,024	| IOT063 |	You'll be able to go online and get a CSV download
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:25,792	| IOT063 |	Or
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:28,352	| IOT063 |	Being able to understand where that data is flowing
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:30,912	| IOT063 |	The way data flows right now is
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:34,240	| IOT063 |	Is just a weird tricky jumble of
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:34,752	| IOT063 |	Contract
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:37,056	| IOT063 |	Negotiations that we never see
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:38,848	| IOT063 |	I think having that open up
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:42,176	| IOT063 |	Especially with this deeply personal data
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:44,480	| IOT063 |	It needs to be taken care of at the legal level
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:46,784	| IOT063 |	Okay so what would your advice to
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:47,808	| IOT063 |	The businesses
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:49,088	| IOT063 |	Who are buying
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:49,856	| IOT063 |	Wearables
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:51,904	| IOT063 |	I think my number one piece of advice
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:52,928	| IOT063 |	Protect
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:54,976	| IOT063 |	And
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:55,744	| IOT063 |	I think
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:56,512	| IOT063 |	What is it
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:58,304	| IOT063 |	Things that people could do to protect our users
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:39:00,608	| IOT063 |	Make sure people have access to their data
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:03,936	| IOT063 |	And like I said
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:05,472	| IOT063 |	Especially because
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:08,288	| IOT063 |	This is it still the Wild Wild West
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:10,336	| IOT063 |	In terms of like wearables
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:13,664	| IOT063 |	Devices in companies you know every day you hear about
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:18,784	| IOT063 |	1 feeling are going out of business because they feel they couldn't make enough money to keep the lights on
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:21,344	| IOT063 |	And then crazy things are happening
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:22,368	| IOT063 |	Either they just
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:23,904	| IOT063 |	Turn off the light
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:25,696	| IOT063 |	Shut down the servers
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:26,208	| IOT063 |	And that day.
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:27,232	| IOT063 |	Gone
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:30,304	| IOT063 |	And the people that use that device for
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:32,352	| IOT063 |	Six months or a year or a decade
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:34,144	| IOT063 |	Never going to be able to see it again
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:35,424	| IOT063 |	Or
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:38,496	| IOT063 |	That device in that data that IP the servers
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:40,288	| IOT063 |	It's sold to another third-party that
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:43,104	| IOT063 |	Keep device alive
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:46,432	| IOT063 |	They may contact those users again say Hey you can buy
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:48,224	| IOT063 |	Come get your dad out of this system
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:49,504	| IOT063 |	Who knows what
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:50,528	| IOT063 |	Actually
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:54,880	| IOT063 |	I don't know if you ever heard of the co that sleep tracking device
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:59,744	| IOT063 |	Remember this thing that you know you was crazy like a headband
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:02,560	| IOT063 |	You're really nice
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:03,840	| IOT063 |	Ariat
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:06,144	| IOT063 |	Really nice your sleep tracking system
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:09,472	| IOT063 |	And after two years I just couldn't make a go of it
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:11,264	| IOT063 |	Shut the lights off close down
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:15,872	| IOT063 |	But then all of that data and all of their IP was sold to another third-party
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:18,176	| IOT063 |	Call Musa
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:19,712	| IOT063 |	Hundreds of days
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:25,600	| IOT063 |	One day they had access the next day
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:27,392	| IOT063 |	Let someone else had all the
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:32,768	| IOT063 |	Clear data exactly and then someone else has all of their data and they don't know who that someone
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:36,864	| IOT063 |	Sometimes these companies don't do very good job of saying hey guess what
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:38,656	| IOT063 |	Shutter doors but
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:40,704	| IOT063 |	Yo company XYZ
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:43,776	| IOT063 |	She bought all of our stuff and they're going to do a really good job and they're going to
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:45,824	| IOT063 |	You know do all of these things for all of our past
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:51,456	| IOT063 |	No not the rule in this industry unfortunately
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:56,064	| IOT063 |	And then the people that actually signed
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:58,624	| IOT063 |	Disinformation and those devices note application
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:00,160	| IOT063 |	The left with nothing
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:02,464	| IOT063 |	You know a device it doesn't work
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:05,024	| IOT063 |	An application to stop tracking anything anymore
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:09,376	| IOT063 |	And nobility to make any sense out of that in your Richard formation that was a part of their life
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:11,680	| IOT063 |	Yes I would be really ticked off
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:14,240	| IOT063 |	If I lost all of my previous
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:15,264	| IOT063 |	Years of Fitness tracking
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:17,568	| IOT063 |	I've been wearing one since 2011
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:18,336	| IOT063 |	So yeah
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:20,128	| IOT063 |	Exactly
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:26,016	| IOT063 |	Just don't exist
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:27,808	| IOT063 |	That's why we hold them
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:28,320	| IOT063 |	To a higher standard
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:29,344	| IOT063 |	Okay
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:32,672	| IOT063 |	What is your advice to doctors
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:33,440	| IOT063 |	Or medical
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:35,232	| IOT063 |	Professionals who are looking at all of this
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:38,048	| IOT063 |	Listen to physics
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:40,352	| IOT063 |	No I think
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:42,144	| IOT063 |	Even though it may not be clinically
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:44,192	| IOT063 |	In terms of your practice
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:47,776	| IOT063 |	It doesn't mean it's not clinically meaningful for the life of an individual
EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:50,592	| IOT063 |	I think understanding of what role
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:53,663	| IOT063 |	The devices in the data play in the life of the person
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:55,711	| IOT063 |	That's why I think we need to spend
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:56,479	| IOT063 |	What time is it
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:59,039	| IOT063 |	Acknowledging
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:41:59,551	| IOT063 |	These things are important
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:02,367	| IOT063 |	And how they can actually help them
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:04,159	| IOT063 |	Illbleed life they want to leave
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:07,231	| IOT063 |	Will end on that very profound
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:09,535	| IOT063 |	Ernesto thank you so much for coming on the show
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:16,447	| IOT063 |	Thank you was great being there thank you for listening and
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:22,591	| IOT063 |	Please tune in next week
