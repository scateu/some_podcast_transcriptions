EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:28,992	| IOT230 |	Cake
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,784	| IOT230 |	Heaven
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,552	| IOT230 |	It's time
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:32,064	| IOT230 |	M4
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,624	| IOT230 |	Water meters and water monitoring
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:40,256	| IOT230 |	So thin is a company that we have talked about a whole bunch I've even had people from the
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,792	| IOT230 |	Company on the show as a guest
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,072	| IOT230 |	And
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,096	| IOT230 |	This is an
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,120	| IOT230 |	Spit out from Belkin
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:48,448	| IOT230 |	And uponor which is a
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,216	| IOT230 |	Professional Plumbing
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,776	| IOT230 |	A couple years ago
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:52,544	| IOT230 |	Created
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,312	| IOT230 |	A
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:56,384	| IOT230 |	Was about $800 sensor in since gun down to 619
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,944	| IOT230 |	But this was a sensor that
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,736	| IOT230 |	Plumber installed on your water meter
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,296	| IOT230 |	And it monitored
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:04,576	| IOT230 |	Your home for
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:06,624	| IOT230 |	Ford leaks slow leaks past leagues all time
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,672	| IOT230 |	And
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:09,440	| IOT230 |	I loved it
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,208	| IOT230 |	I thought it was cool
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:12,000	| IOT230 |	I thought it was way too much money
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,280	| IOT230 |	So
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:16,864	| IOT230 |	What they've done now is created a $299
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,632	| IOT230 |	Product
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,912	| IOT230 |	It's under your sink
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:22,496	| IOT230 |	It goes under the kitchen sink so what you need to do
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:25,568	| IOT230 |	Anyone can install it you don't have to have a plumber
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,336	| IOT230 |	You sick
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,360	| IOT230 |	You unthread your
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:29,152	| IOT230 |	Curse you turn off your water
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,432	| IOT230 |	That's the first part sorry
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:32,480	| IOT230 |	Then you unthread
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:36,320	| IOT230 |	You enter at the hot water line to cold water line you stick a sensor up on each side
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,112	| IOT230 |	And then you plug this thing in
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,672	| IOT230 |	Which means you do need to have power under your
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,208	| IOT230 |	And
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:43,488	| IOT230 |	Guala
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:46,304	| IOT230 |	You now have something it will monitor water flow
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,608	| IOT230 |	It cannot turn off the wall
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,632	| IOT230 |	Water if a leak is data
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:52,192	| IOT230 |	So what you'll get is a series about
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:52,960	| IOT230 |	Alerts
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:57,056	| IOT230 |	And that's very different from those 699 version which does turn off your water
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,592	| IOT230 |	Yes but
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,872	| IOT230 |	I think people really didn't
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:00,384	| IOT230 |	Want to pay
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:03,712	| IOT230 |	I'm curious how with
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:09,088	| IOT230 |	Ashley Manor is the entire hot and cold water flow of the house just from that
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:11,392	| IOT230 |	One set of pipes in the kitchen
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:11,904	| IOT230 |	Algorithm
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:15,744	| IOT230 |	Algorithms are best friends
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:19,839	| IOT230 |	This is my favorite answer I'd like to know if your secret magic algorithm
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:24,191	| IOT230 |	But what they've done is they taken I mean and they do have a lot of research on how water
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:24,703	| IOT230 |	Close to the house
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:28,287	| IOT230 |	They're basically using that research and
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:30,079	| IOT230 |	The accompanying sensors
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:32,383	| IOT230 |	To understand water pressure
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,407	| IOT230 |	Carflo
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:34,943	| IOT230 |	And
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:38,783	| IOT230 |	What's cool on this particular one because they have both the hot and the cold
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:39,295	| IOT230 |	Water
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:41,855	| IOT230 |	And there I guess inside the house
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:46,719	| IOT230 |	They can tell you a little bit more great early what device is being used so
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:48,255	| IOT230 |	On the
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,791	| IOT230 |	External expensive model
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:52,351	| IOT230 |	They can say hey a shower is
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,119	| IOT230 |	Running
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:55,167	| IOT230 |	But here they can actually tell you
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,447	| IOT230 |	It's a shower in the master bedroom
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:58,239	| IOT230 |	Or it's your teenager shower
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:00,031	| IOT230 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:01,311	| IOT230 |	Using all the hot water
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:04,127	| IOT230 |	So I thought that was kind of interesting in this won't come out
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:04,895	| IOT230 |	Until September
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,711	| IOT230 |	But it's something I really want
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:08,223	| IOT230 |	To try
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:09,759	| IOT230 |	Because
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:10,271	| IOT230 |	This
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,063	| IOT230 |	It sounds like it'll do
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,855	| IOT230 |	Most of what I wanted to do
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,647	| IOT230 |	And worst case scenario I can call my neighbor
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:18,207	| IOT230 |	Turn off the water it's leaking
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,743	| IOT230 |	Yeah it's
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:25,631	| IOT230 |	Obviously much more cost-effective and I wonder if this has something to do with it because
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:29,727	| IOT230 |	On the prowl page it says if you have a leak or abnormal you said you didn't alert
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:34,847	| IOT230 |	The Smart Water assistant gives you the option to contact a plumber in app
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,895	| IOT230 |	Partnership with HomeAdvisor
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,431	| IOT230 |	Oh yeah they do have it
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:40,479	| IOT230 |	I don't think that's
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:40,991	| IOT230 |	Nefarious
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:50,975	| IOT230 |	I just wonder if that's another Revenue stream that partnership in that can help keep the cost lower than it would have been without it
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:54,303	| IOT230 |	I think the thing that keeps the cost as low as possible
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:56,863	| IOT230 |	Is the fact that you don't have a motor that store
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:03,519	| IOT230 |	Which is a shut-off that's a very expensive thing to do and you have to over engineer it because you're
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:05,055	| IOT230 |	Essentially dealing
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:05,823	| IOT230 |	With the water in
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:07,103	| IOT230 |	And people sound so you don't answer that
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,919	| IOT230 |	So yeah I'm excited
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:15,551	| IOT230 |	I am one of those weird people who don't have power under my sink so I'm going to have to have an electrician come in in
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,831	| IOT230 |	And install an outlet
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,367	| IOT230 |	Most people will
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,671	| IOT230 |	Because they've got a garbage disposal
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:25,279	| IOT230 |	This is something I talked about actually when I installed the Madam a power
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,047	| IOT230 |	Faucet
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,839	| IOT230 |	Thank the Delta faucet
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,119	| IOT230 |	And
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:31,167	| IOT230 |	Not everybody has power
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:34,495	| IOT230 |	Ran under my sink I do score
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,519	| IOT230 |	But in my new house I don't
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,055	| IOT230 |	Soho
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:39,359	| IOT230 |	I'm a little sad but I do have a junction box
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:40,895	| IOT230 |	For my dishwasher
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:46,271	| IOT230 |	You're in a place that doesn't have a dishwasher or a garbage disposal I'm going to bet you don't
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,039	| IOT230 |	Empower under your sink
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:48,575	| IOT230 |	And
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:51,647	| IOT230 |	You may we should just you should just move
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,159	| IOT230 |	Basically
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,719	| IOT230 |	Just leave same if you don't have neutral wire
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,999	| IOT230 |	It's just go
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,303	| IOT230 |	Oh it is terrible
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:02,655	| IOT230 |	But yeah and if you're building a new house in this sort of thing sounds interesting to you
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:03,935	| IOT230 |	Maybe you'll make sure there's power

EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,999	| IOT230 |	Madame a Google Assistant
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,279	| IOT230 |	And with if
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:33,375	| IOT230 |	Okay moving over from under the sink technology
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,399	| IOT230 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:36,447	| IOT230 |	Lights
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:38,495	| IOT230 |	Blinds
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:41,311	| IOT230 |	No action
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,359	| IOT230 |	This is a terrible Segway
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:44,639	| IOT230 |	But we're sticking with
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,663	| IOT230 |	Ikea
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,967	| IOT230 |	My favorite furniture store has launched
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,503	| IOT230 |	It's
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:51,039	| IOT230 |	HomeSmart business
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,063	| IOT230 |	As a separate business
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:55,903	| IOT230 |	And it will be headed by your block who's been on the show twice
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:58,207	| IOT230 |	Congratulations Bjorn
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,535	| IOT230 |	All right that feels about a seller
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,559	| IOT230 |	Victoria's Swedish
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:06,143	| IOT230 |	I don't know
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:06,911	| IOT230 |	I don't know
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:12,031	| IOT230 |	I actually did not realize it the Ikea smart home effort started back in 2012
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,335	| IOT230 |	Yes they've been doing this a while
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:16,383	| IOT230 |	While and what's interesting about the
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:17,919	| IOT230 |	HomeSmart
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,943	| IOT230 |	Business
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,735	| IOT230 |	Or what apparently was not its own business
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,015	| IOT230 |	Was that
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:25,855	| IOT230 |	The whole goal was not actually create things that were
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:28,927	| IOT230 |	Connected to the internet it was to integrate technology into things
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:33,023	| IOT230 |	Furniture so things like remember they have that table that does wireless charging
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:35,839	| IOT230 |	So
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,703	| IOT230 |	I did not say that
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,239	| IOT230 |	I did not have enough
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,519	| IOT230 |	Ivan maisel
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,055	| IOT230 |	But the
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,079	| IOT230 |	If since
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:49,919	| IOT230 |	Really focused on and they have a very different idea it's not just adding connect
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:50,687	| IOT230 |	Nativity it's like
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:52,479	| IOT230 |	Hey how can we make products in the hole
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:53,759	| IOT230 |	Man Furniture in Chennai
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,039	| IOT230 |	Easier to
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,575	| IOT230 |	And that is their core
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,367	| IOT230 |	Which is
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,903	| IOT230 |	Why they made some of the decisions
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:01,695	| IOT230 |	Around
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,207	| IOT230 |	Things like
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:05,279	| IOT230 |	Connectivity Technologies the fact that
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:08,351	| IOT230 |	Tri-City lights are their own system and
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:11,167	| IOT230 |	All of that work together it doesn't
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:13,471	| IOT230 |	Integrated out with other stuff although it does
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,751	| IOT230 |	Work with Madam a
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:15,775	| IOT230 |	Homekit
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,055	| IOT230 |	These others
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:22,687	| IOT230 |	And I think they're one of the few problems or tan companies because it's the say now they smart unit
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:25,247	| IOT230 |	This makes sense is the most obvious
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:27,039	| IOT230 |	What's design
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:27,807	| IOT230 |	Into
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,855	| IOT230 |	These products in a different way because
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:33,695	| IOT230 |	Products typically a that look like Ikea products and be
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:34,975	| IOT230 |	They don't look
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:35,743	| IOT230 |	Like smart
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:37,279	| IOT230 |	Products
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,559	| IOT230 |	Fit naturally in the home
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,351	| IOT230 |	Yes and
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:43,935	| IOT230 |	I thought this was really nice when I went to Ikea and talk to them about
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:46,751	| IOT230 |	They also have a sustainability
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:47,519	| IOT230 |	Focus
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:48,543	| IOT230 |	Most comfy
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:49,567	| IOT230 |	Probably don't have
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,103	| IOT230 |	So
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:53,407	| IOT230 |	They're not going to make connected things that just get through
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,943	| IOT230 |	They have a certain liking
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:59,039	| IOT230 |	Locations for anything that's connected it has to have a certain shelf life and
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,063	| IOT230 |	You know this won't go outside
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:02,367	| IOT230 |	A year so
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,647	| IOT230 |	That's kind of nice
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,183	| IOT230 |	And probably
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:09,535	| IOT230 |	But for all of us are waiting for those Ikea smart blinds
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,071	| IOT230 |	She theater
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:16,191	| IOT230 |	Anime eyes
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,983	| IOT230 |	I'll leave that to you to mess up Stacy
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,031	| IOT230 |	They will not be home care
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,311	| IOT230 |	Compatible
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,335	| IOT230 |	At launch
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,103	| IOT230 |	And this is going to display
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:28,991	| IOT230 |	This actually happened with the truck pretty smart plug
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:32,063	| IOT230 |	Because that was going to support homekit lawn sprayer
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:35,903	| IOT230 |	It was like a six-month delay before got that support so
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,439	| IOT230 |	Kind of importunate
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,975	| IOT230 |	This is becoming a trend
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:44,607	| IOT230 |	Regardless it is with the promise of homekit I'm sure it will happen
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:47,679	| IOT230 |	It's just not going to happen when the blinds actually wants
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,727	| IOT230 |	Which is fine because the blind
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:50,239	| IOT230 |	Already a little
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,031	| IOT230 |	We were expecting
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:52,543	| IOT230 |	Women April
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:54,335	| IOT230 |	In the fall
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,639	| IOT230 |	Hopefully they will stick to that fall dead
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:59,711	| IOT230 |	But I'm excited
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,991	| IOT230 |	Liking.
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:03,807	| IOT230 |	Ikea smart things I actually like my tradfri lights
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:06,111	| IOT230 |	Put them back in after they fix their Google in
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:06,623	| IOT230 |	Immigration
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:07,903	| IOT230 |	And that's something
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,207	| IOT230 |	That we probably don't say enough
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:11,999	| IOT230 |	But we probably should say more often on the show
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:15,327	| IOT230 |	With connected Home Products if you don't like it
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:18,143	| IOT230 |	Wait 6 months and a software updates going to come along
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,935	| IOT230 |	And probably make it a lot better
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:22,495	| IOT230 |	You'll just love it wait 6 months
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,263	| IOT230 |	I'm not saying that
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:32,479	| IOT230 |	These are not static products which is nice in most cases
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:37,087	| IOT230 |	Belews functionalities in most cases because
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:42,207	| IOT230 |	Let us talk about improvements losing functionality and software updates
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:42,719	| IOT230 |	Chadwick
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,839	| IOT230 |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:50,911	| IOT230 |	To those who do not know you can now
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:52,191	| IOT230 |	Migrate you are
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:54,751	| IOT230 |	Nest account to a Google account
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:55,519	| IOT230 |	This was
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:59,359	| IOT230 |	Announced back in May that would be happening at the Google IO
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:02,175	| IOT230 |	Event where they rebranded
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:05,247	| IOT230 |	Some of the Google Home Products become
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:08,319	| IOT230 |	Nest products specifically bee nest Hub and the nest
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,343	| IOT230 |	Max
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,647	| IOT230 |	They're killing the works with
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,159	| IOT230 |	What's nest Pro
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:14,207	| IOT230 |	Is probably so
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,487	| IOT230 |	That's what they said
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:18,047	| IOT230 |	Originally there were like we're going to kill the whole thing just Deadpool
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,327	| IOT230 |	As of August
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,607	| IOT230 |	31st people freaked out
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:21,887	| IOT230 |	Because
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:23,423	| IOT230 |	Legitimately pets
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,215	| IOT230 |	What's the big news to take in
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:27,519	| IOT230 |	So now what they're doing is they're offering you a choice
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,079	| IOT230 |	You can migrate your stuff over
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,895	| IOT230 |	Nest stuff into York
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:33,919	| IOT230 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:35,967	| IOT230 |	Google home stuff you migrate all that over to
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,479	| IOT230 |	To your Google account
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:37,759	| IOT230 |	Or
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:41,855	| IOT230 |	You can maintain your nest account but after August 31st it's going to be static
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:44,159	| IOT230 |	And nothing will change
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,183	| IOT230 |	Machines it won't get better
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,463	| IOT230 |	Add a circuit
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,511	| IOT230 |	Correct
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:54,911	| IOT230 |	Correct and if you don't want to do that so you don't want to migrate Your Nest account into your Google account this way this way
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,447	| IOT230 |	If you do it after August 31st
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:58,751	| IOT230 |	If you like read it you can't go back
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:00,543	| IOT230 |	So it if you migrate
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,383	| IOT230 |	You can't go back
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,687	| IOT230 |	I don't think I don't think I can go back
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:10,271	| IOT230 |	Cuz I did this I ran through the process and
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,807	| IOT230 |	I'm flabbergasted
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:12,575	| IOT230 |	Frankly
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:13,855	| IOT230 |	Because
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:18,207	| IOT230 |	Nest has been a part of either Google or alphabet or Google again
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,487	| IOT230 |	For five years
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:21,023	| IOT230 |	Clearly
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,303	| IOT230 |	Google has
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:25,119	| IOT230 |	Smart home information that we
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:28,447	| IOT230 |	Put into our Google accounts with Google home
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:31,519	| IOT230 |	And Nest has the information for all the nest products
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,311	| IOT230 |	And yet
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,335	| IOT230 |	The process
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,103	| IOT230 |	2
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:35,871	| IOT230 |	Migraine
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:38,175	| IOT230 |	M&S account-to-account
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:45,599	| IOT230 |	It's a little daunting it's actually very easy but it's like 9 steps and there's all kinds of little guachos and things that I'm concerned
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:50,719	| IOT230 |	Not everybody will be the same concern products but for example
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:52,767	| IOT230 |	I have the nest by Yale lock
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:54,303	| IOT230 |	And
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:56,863	| IOT230 |	As soon as I migrated my account
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:59,167	| IOT230 |	I had to invite
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:02,751	| IOT230 |	My family to be part of the new Google account for the home
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:06,335	| IOT230 |	And until they accept that they can't get in the front door
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,127	| IOT230 |	Because they're
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:11,455	| IOT230 |	Passcode is no longer good
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,735	| IOT230 |	Once they migrate
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:17,599	| IOT230 |	My family is not too quick on the uptake for these things so
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:20,671	| IOT230 |	I haven't even invited them to the new home yet I'm just going to
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:25,279	| IOT230 |	Let them ring the doorbell other issue that I see
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:27,071	| IOT230 |	Is that Google says that
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,887	| IOT230 |	Call members
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:33,983	| IOT230 |	Have the same level of access control as you meaning me
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:36,287	| IOT230 |	Who used to be the homeowner
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,311	| IOT230 |	Ennis
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,079	| IOT230 |	System
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:42,687	| IOT230 |	Now anybody can delete me in my home or invite other people to our home and
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:46,271	| IOT230 |	I don't think that's a very good idea but that's just me
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:47,551	| IOT230 |	So
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:50,623	| IOT230 |	You seem like so many steps were taken here that
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:55,743	| IOT230 |	Shortcut it because the information is already available in nest and Google and
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,023	| IOT230 |	I'm just shocked
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:58,815	| IOT230 |	Adjust flapper
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:01,119	| IOT230 |	So I would say I wouldn't
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:04,191	| IOT230 |	I've wondered when hearing about your experience
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,495	| IOT230 |	With everyone having admin
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,263	| IOT230 |	Enright's
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:09,311	| IOT230 |	I wonder if this was a response to some of the
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:10,847	| IOT230 |	Domestic abuse
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,127	| IOT230 |	Complaints or
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,431	| IOT230 |	People using the Smart Home
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,479	| IOT230 |	Houses
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:18,271	| IOT230 |	And this puts control right back
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,807	| IOT230 |	If they're going to invite them in
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:21,087	| IOT230 |	You really want to come
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:22,367	| IOT230 |	Control your spouse I guess you just leave
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,391	| IOT230 |	People blocked out at all times
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,439	| IOT230 |	So maybe you just never invite
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:27,231	| IOT230 |	But that's one thought is
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:32,095	| IOT230 |	You just give them a guest passcode for the door lock tell them that they were part of the home even when they're not
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:32,863	| IOT230 |	I mean
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,655	| IOT230 |	Yeah there's ways around that I think
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,423	| IOT230 |	Partially right
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:39,775	| IOT230 |	I don't know if there are other legal reasons or Iona
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:43,103	| IOT230 |	And we should say that the reason we suspect Google
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,639	| IOT230 |	Who is doing this is because
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,919	| IOT230 |	It was very comp
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:47,967	| IOT230 |	Placated to manage all these integration
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:49,503	| IOT230 |	Are two different
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:57,183	| IOT230 |	So now what's going to happen is instead of having a nest brain and a Google home brain you're going to have one Google home brain
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:59,231	| IOT230 |	The entire experience
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:15:59,999	| IOT230 |	Which
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:02,559	| IOT230 |	Make sense it doesn't make sense it's going to make
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:04,095	| IOT230 |	Google's life easier it's going to make
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,911	| IOT230 |	Controlling who has access to certain
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:08,191	| IOT230 |	Apis way easier
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:08,703	| IOT230 |	And that sort of thing
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,775	| IOT230 |	But it is going to frustrate users who
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:15,103	| IOT230 |	Baby relied on Nest having
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,383	| IOT230 |	Its own brain tool
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,151	| IOT230 |	Like Thai and
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:19,455	| IOT230 |	Other products and systems like it
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,223	| IOT230 |	For example
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:23,039	| IOT230 |	Right and there's no solution yet for
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:26,111	| IOT230 |	This new I guess works with Google
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:27,647	| IOT230 |	Thrift for example
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,439	| IOT230 |	Right everything's going to be now control
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,487	| IOT230 |	Home account so things like
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:35,071	| IOT230 |	Are Nest temperature triggers and things like that
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:37,631	| IOT230 |	Will stop working if you migrate
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:39,935	| IOT230 |	Over and you rely on if
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,703	| IOT230 |	For those things
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,983	| IOT230 |	Sofibella
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:44,799	| IOT230 |	Sensor that says hey when my Nest thermostat is
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:47,615	| IOT230 |	It's like 60 degrees turn on my space heater
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:50,431	| IOT230 |	Those things are going to break and it's not
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,199	| IOT230 |	Clear
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:53,759	| IOT230 |	If Google's going to allow the same tree
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:54,271	| IOT230 |	Triggers is
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:58,367	| IOT230 |	Right now if you don't do this migration it will still work
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,927	| IOT230 |	Eventually they're going to
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:05,791	| IOT230 |	You can manually do this now right in your nest app
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:07,071	| IOT230 |	Which isn't going away
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:10,399	| IOT230 |	Your point about having all the apis and everything in one place make sense
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,191	| IOT230 |	But yet we still up to app switch
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:15,263	| IOT230 |	I don't really get but that's all motorists entirely
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:21,919	| IOT230 |	You can manually upgrade or I'm sorry migrate to your account now or you can wait for your quote-unquote invitation email
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,711	| IOT230 |	Which is probably going to be
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:26,271	| IOT230 |	You have to do this at some point now
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:29,343	| IOT230 |	Yeah and I think August 31st is
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:29,855	| IOT230 |	The changeover
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,391	| IOT230 |	I'm glad you did this
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:38,559	| IOT230 |	Ivan died I've seriously been Kevin and I should talk about who's going to my grave
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:41,631	| IOT230 |	Maybe I shouldn't migrate and then I'll see how deprecated I
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,399	| IOT230 |	My life gets
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,935	| IOT230 |	That's one way to do it
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:50,335	| IOT230 |	The challenge I have is I no longer have some of my Nest gear cuz I had a nest hello doorbell I had a nest thermostat
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,103	| IOT230 |	Stat
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:52,127	| IOT230 |	In a rental house I
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,407	| IOT230 |	I have none of these things
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:56,223	| IOT230 |	Write it made sense for me to do it because
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:58,783	| IOT230 |	We're pretty much all in on the Google
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,551	| IOT230 |	Home
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:00,575	| IOT230 |	Ecosystem here
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:04,159	| IOT230 |	And I do have the nest hello doorbell as well as the nest by Yale lock
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:05,439	| IOT230 |	So what you just made sense
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:08,511	| IOT230 |	That's where I was going.
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:09,791	| IOT230 |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:12,095	| IOT230 |	This would be you because you're
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,887	| IOT230 |	More on the echo side of things
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,679	| IOT230 |	And this was a big pool
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:17,215	| IOT230 |	Google announced this back in
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:17,983	| IOT230 |	Mets
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:18,495	| IOT230 |	Basically
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:22,079	| IOT230 |	Matinee Integrations with stopped working skills and such
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:28,223	| IOT230 |	However they took that feedback too hard and a longer than everything migration they announced that there is a new
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:29,503	| IOT230 |	Madame a skill
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:31,807	| IOT230 |	I have not installed it yet but that should
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,087	| IOT230 |	Allow you to
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:35,647	| IOT230 |	Use my tab a with your Google Nest products
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,951	| IOT230 |	All right well we'll look forward to next week
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,463	| IOT230 |	Carrying your
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:40,255	| IOT230 |	Haha
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:43,583	| IOT230 |	Amazon
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,631	| IOT230 |	Once met a man every
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:47,167	| IOT230 |	Car according to Bloomberg
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:49,471	| IOT230 |	This is not surprising
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,751	| IOT230 |	Amazon is in talks with
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,287	| IOT230 |	Automakers to
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:55,871	| IOT230 |	Play Padme in cars I don't know how else to say that
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:57,151	| IOT230 |	And
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,431	| IOT230 |	They have already signed up
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:01,759	| IOT230 |	BMW and Audi
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,039	| IOT230 |	BMW and Audi
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,319	| IOT230 |	Wanted to say something
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,087	| IOT230 |	Also thank you
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,391	| IOT230 |	So they've already signed a BMW and Audi
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:07,903	| IOT230 |	He said this
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,951	| IOT230 |	It's basically like you know you have
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,719	| IOT230 |	Carplay
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:11,487	| IOT230 |	And
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:11,999	| IOT230 |	Android
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:13,023	| IOT230 |	I always forget what
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,303	| IOT230 |	Trites Carthage
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:16,095	| IOT230 |	Android auto
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:17,631	| IOT230 |	You would also have
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,679	| IOT230 |	What I
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:24,543	| IOT230 |	Really found fun about the story is they talk to a guy who had the Amazon Echo Auto
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,055	| IOT230 |	Which I have had
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:27,103	| IOT230 |	It just did not work
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:27,871	| IOT230 |	For me and
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,663	| IOT230 |	I felt a little bad about that
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:30,687	| IOT230 |	Cuz like I really hate when
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:31,711	| IOT230 |	I have
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:32,735	| IOT230 |	It has no
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,271	| IOT230 |	Fishers
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:37,343	| IOT230 |	That's how this article actually starts because the person who tested it
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:43,231	| IOT230 |	Talk about all the bugs and issues and basically said my part of a beta program I don't understand why the project is not work
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:43,999	| IOT230 |	Because
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:50,399	| IOT230 |	It's connected to your phone where the matinee at is team anime app is driving all the smarts and everything else
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:56,799	| IOT230 |	It's just a speaker microphone with Bluetooth connection to your phone is so dodgy
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:20:01,663	| IOT230 |	Doesn't seem to work as well I think having the app on all the time causes problems
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,455	| IOT230 |	There's a lot of issues
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:06,527	| IOT230 |	And I think the car environment is a difficult
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:07,295	| IOT230 |	TV Guide
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:10,879	| IOT230 |	Road noise if that's car speaker noise you got all of that so
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:12,671	| IOT230 |	Really I'm going to say
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:15,487	| IOT230 |	90% of the problems we had with our
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:19,839	| IOT230 |	Echo Auto in my husband's car and in mine were related to
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:25,471	| IOT230 |	And there's a lot of variables there's so many different types of cars are so many did
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:26,751	| IOT230 |	Different types of phones
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:28,287	| IOT230 |	Close permutations together and
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:29,311	| IOT230 |	It's a lot
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,359	| IOT230 |	But there's not a good experience
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:33,919	| IOT230 |	I was sort of part of the beta program
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:34,687	| IOT230 |	Because
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,991	| IOT230 |	I will say I did get a survey the other day
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,295	| IOT230 |	It was from Amazon
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:42,111	| IOT230 |	Tell us about your experience with this
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:43,135	| IOT230 |	As we seek to make it better
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:44,415	| IOT230 |	So
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:46,207	| IOT230 |	Having it integrated
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:46,975	| IOT230 |	The car should
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:48,511	| IOT230 |	Solve some of the
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:49,023	| IOT230 |	Those
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:55,423	| IOT230 |	I definitely should because most people who use these in-car entertainment systems whether it's a
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:57,215	| IOT230 |	Built-in from the manufacturer or its
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,263	| IOT230 |	Android auto or carplay
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,567	| IOT230 |	Pretty darn well so
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:04,127	| IOT230 |	Are you people are like why do you need your
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:04,895	| IOT230 |	Echo in the car
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:05,663	| IOT230 |	Are in the answer
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:06,687	| IOT230 |	Is
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:12,319	| IOT230 |	The answer is probably you don't I like it because
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:13,599	| IOT230 |	At least once during
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:15,135	| IOT230 |	Every car trip we have a question that we
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:16,672	| IOT230 |	Oh how many is this
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:18,464	| IOT230 |	And then we just don't know
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:22,304	| IOT230 |	And yes we could squeeze our foe or I could squeeze my phone and ask Google and sometimes I do
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:24,352	| IOT230 |	But sometimes it's just nice to not have to
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:26,400	| IOT230 |	To pick up a phone while you're driving and just to say
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:27,936	| IOT230 |	Hey
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:30,496	| IOT230 |	Do that sort and yes I know I could also talk
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:33,056	| IOT230 |	It's usually in my
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,336	| IOT230 |	Curse it's usually not
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:34,848	| IOT230 |	Listening
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,664	| IOT230 |	Yeah I just I connect my
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,432	| IOT230 |	I don't understand
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:46,368	| IOT230 |	No no no I mean what was for this week Bobby so yes you could talk to your phone we could have done that before all these Integrations came into play
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:51,744	| IOT230 |	The speakers and microphones in these in car systems are
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:54,304	| IOT230 |	Probably better suited for
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:56,352	| IOT230 |	That kind of use hands-free number one
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:22:00,704	| IOT230 |	So I I just plug my pixel 3XL into
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:04,544	| IOT230 |	My car and just use the in-car stuff that integrates through Android auto
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,336	| IOT230 |	Flawlessly
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:09,152	| IOT230 |	Yeah and that's really what I want
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:13,504	| IOT230 |	But like I said maybe in six months it's going to be amazing
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:14,528	| IOT230 |	Or maybe a
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:16,320	| IOT230 |	Amazon will do these deals and it
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,088	| IOT230 |	Google totally deaf
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:18,112	| IOT230 |	Look at the product and nothing will change
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,952	| IOT230 |	Baby I spent $25 just to be
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:25,280	| IOT230 |	All right
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:27,328	| IOT230 |	Let's talk about SimpliSafe
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:31,680	| IOT230 |	Which is a home security company I'm sure lots of you guys have
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:32,192	| IOT230 |	It's very
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:35,008	| IOT230 |	Easy to install and now they have
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:36,800	| IOT230 |	A brand new door lock
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:41,664	| IOT230 |	Yes it's $99 it will be available next
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:46,016	| IOT230 |	Restaurants directly from SimpliSafe later it'll come to Best Buy thing in October
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:49,088	| IOT230 |	Keypad on the outside and in very
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,112	| IOT230 |	August lock
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:52,416	| IOT230 |	Right look inside to me
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:53,440	| IOT230 |	Is it route
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:57,024	| IOT230 |	It's definitely not round design features yes
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:23:00,352	| IOT230 |	Without a doubt it just reminds me of the August lock but
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:03,424	| IOT230 |	Deadbolt lock or is it like does it have a
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:05,984	| IOT230 |	Is it an actual lock that you install or is it just a deadbolt
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:07,776	| IOT230 |	Does the August lock of the day
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:09,312	| IOT230 |	As opposed to
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:13,920	| IOT230 |	This looks to me like a
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:14,944	| IOT230 |	Integrated
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:15,456	| IOT230 |	Dentals
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:16,736	| IOT230 |	Cuz it's
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:20,320	| IOT230 |	Does not look like it fits over an existing one
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,856	| IOT230 |	But the interesting thing is
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:23,904	| IOT230 |	It will automatically lock
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:26,976	| IOT230 |	And when you set your SimpliSafe home alarm just
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:30,048	| IOT230 |	The one downside
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:31,840	| IOT230 |	If you want to use an app
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,120	| IOT230 |	To unlock your door
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:35,680	| IOT230 |	Then you're going to have to be
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:40,800	| IOT230 |	Part of the company's monthly service
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:42,592	| IOT230 |	Yeah she's not
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:45,408	| IOT230 |	It's true that's true
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,992	| IOT230 |	No no no
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:50,784	| IOT230 |	What are people who don't use them on ring
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:54,368	| IOT230 |	Are you going to choose to pay for the monitoring to
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:58,208	| IOT230 |	Unlock my app just not going to use that picture at all because it's not free
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,072	| IOT230 |	Alright well
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:08,448	| IOT230 |	We also have a brand new breakthrough in energy harvesting
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:11,008	| IOT230 |	Which is really important
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:11,520	| IOT230 |	Because
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:14,592	| IOT230 |	If we're going to have a kajillion sensors everywhere
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:17,408	| IOT230 |	We cannot spend the time changing batteries I don't care
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:19,968	| IOT230 |	What people tell you about battery life
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:23,552	| IOT230 |	Even if it's every ten years you're either going to toss that sensor
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:24,832	| IOT230 |	Because it's cheap enough in
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:25,856	| IOT230 |	Environmentally friendly
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,136	| IOT230 |	Or
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,672	| IOT230 |	You're going to need something this energy
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,696	| IOT230 |	Harvesting because
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,208	| IOT230 |	We're just knocking
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:35,328	| IOT230 |	MIT has created an underwater sensor
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:35,840	| IOT230 |	That does not need
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:38,656	| IOT230 |	It is exciting
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:41,984	| IOT230 |	Its energy harvesting method it's using
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,032	| IOT230 |	Which is
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:44,800	| IOT230 |	Physical
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:45,312	| IOT230 |	Connecticut
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,360	| IOT230 |	When something moves
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,152	| IOT230 |	That's my
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:51,200	| IOT230 |	Non scientific version of that for everyone
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:55,040	| IOT230 |	But they're using
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:55,808	| IOT230 |	That
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,320	| IOT230 |	And
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:57,856	| IOT230 |	Backscatter
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:59,392	| IOT230 |	This is basically
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,160	| IOT230 |	When
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,184	| IOT230 |	RFC
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:05,792	| IOT230 |	Radio waves or in this case acoustical waves are sent through the water
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:06,816	| IOT230 |	They generate energy
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,352	| IOT230 |	In the piezoelectric
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:09,376	| IOT230 |	Center
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,680	| IOT230 |	Converts that energy to a zero
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:14,752	| IOT230 |	And once were in zeros and ones
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:15,264	| IOT230 |	Or digital
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:16,544	| IOT230 |	And voila
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:17,568	| IOT230 |	We can do things
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:19,360	| IOT230 |	This is actually
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,920	| IOT230 |	Old school both Technologies are
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:23,968	| IOT230 |	Well-researched
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,272	| IOT230 |	Piezoelectric sensors have been
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,040	| IOT230 |	Around forever
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,832	| IOT230 |	I actually have one in my Hue tap and I love
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:31,648	| IOT230 |	Every time I tap it it generates enough energy to
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,160	| IOT230 |	Keep that thing power
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:35,744	| IOT230 |	And Backscatter is something that's been around for
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:36,512	| IOT230 |	It's been around as long as
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:43,936	| IOT230 |	Talking about harvesting it for energy for the last decade or so in
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,216	| IOT230 |	We're getting better
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:45,984	| IOT230 |	Better at it
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:47,264	| IOT230 |	The cool part of this
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:48,544	| IOT230 |	Is
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:52,128	| IOT230 |	We could use this both on Earth underwater in places
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:53,408	| IOT230 |	But we can also use it
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:56,992	| IOT230 |	For space exploration and putting sensors
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:58,016	| IOT230 |	In place
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:00,064	| IOT230 |	They can generate their own energy so
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,600	| IOT230 |	You know for kids
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,624	| IOT230 |	Crazy
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,392	| IOT230 |	We can talk about
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:05,184	| IOT230 |	The article talks about
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:05,696	| IOT230 |	Putting it on
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:07,232	| IOT230 |	Titan
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:08,512	| IOT230 |	Which is Saturn's largest moon
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,304	| IOT230 |	Jersey Giant sub surface
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:12,864	| IOT230 |	Is ocean and we know nothing about it we could drop one of these in there
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:13,888	| IOT230 |	Invokana
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:20,288	| IOT230 |	Information
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:22,336	| IOT230 |	I saw that this was three
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:23,360	| IOT230 |	Pillow Pets
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:23,872	| IOT230 |	Per second
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:26,432	| IOT230 |	Across up to 10
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,200	| IOT230 |	Yes
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:27,968	| IOT230 |	Well ghetto
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:29,248	| IOT230 |	Bees acoustical waves
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:30,784	| IOT230 |	Don't have that much power
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:33,600	| IOT230 |	Like blowing on some
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:34,880	| IOT230 |	Supposed to happen
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:38,976	| IOT230 |	It's something
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,512	| IOT230 |	I should have saved
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:46,912	| IOT230 |	Because I'm so obsessed with energy harvesting I know there are also other efforts for underwater sensors that use temperature
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:48,192	| IOT230 |	Gradient differences
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:49,728	| IOT230 |	Basically there's some
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:50,496	| IOT230 |	Authentic column
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:53,312	| IOT230 |	Where are you got cold water the bottom and
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:54,336	| IOT230 |	Where what are the top in it
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:56,384	| IOT230 |	Moves that rotates
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:59,200	| IOT230 |	So those kind of things are also being used
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:26:59,968	| IOT230 |	Power
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:01,248	| IOT230 |	Underwater sensors
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:02,528	| IOT230 |	Those temperature changes
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:05,344	| IOT230 |	So there's actually a lot of really cool work Happening Here
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,880	| IOT230 |	And I mean again
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:08,928	| IOT230 |	Not going to send a lot of data but
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:10,208	| IOT230 |	Maybe we shouldn't be so
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:11,488	| IOT230 |	Data hockey anyway
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:12,512	| IOT230 |	All right
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:17,632	| IOT230 |	I think this might be our final story I got some news that. Way which is a Chinese
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:20,960	| IOT230 |	IP camera manufacturer these cameras are
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:21,472	| IOT230 |	Everywhere
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,264	| IOT230 |	They
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:26,080	| IOT230 |	Just signed a deal with a company here in the US
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:26,848	| IOT230 |	Pepper iot
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:29,152	| IOT230 |	Pepper is
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:33,248	| IOT230 |	Iot platform company that provides the cloud computing and
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,016	| IOT230 |	Underlying
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,808	| IOT230 |	Ties management and all that fun stuff
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:41,184	| IOT230 |	What's notable here is this is a Chinese company that is specifically moving to use
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:43,744	| IOT230 |	A u.s. based platform that is
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:45,536	| IOT230 |	Optimized for security
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:47,840	| IOT230 |	Pepper's actually done a deal with a
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:49,120	| IOT230 |	Iot security company that
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:51,680	| IOT230 |	Has certified it keeps
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:53,472	| IOT230 |	Pentesting monitoring their platform
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,264	| IOT230 |	As a way to ensure
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,800	| IOT230 |	The devices on the spot
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:00,384	| IOT230 |	So I thought this was notable
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,408	| IOT230 |	Because
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:03,968	| IOT230 |	Most Chinese companies they might do
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:05,248	| IOT230 |	Do it themselves to make you something
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:05,760	| IOT230 |	I like to you
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:11,904	| IOT230 |	This seems like a real security play insensitive IP camera company I thought it was worth noting since I
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:12,672	| IOT230 |	Leica cameras are so
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:13,184	| IOT230 |	The worst
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,488	| IOT230 |	So I don't know
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,280	| IOT230 |	Maybe this is a trend
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:19,584	| IOT230 |	Maybe it's not but now I feel
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:20,608	| IOT230 |	Maybe a little better
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,120	| IOT230 |	About buying
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:22,656	| IOT230 |	Cameras
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:24,192	| IOT230 |	When you can buy
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:25,984	| IOT230 |	And they're much cheaper
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:33,408	| IOT230 |	I think it's about time for our voice mail what do you think
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:35,200	| IOT230 |	That sounds good
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:38,272	| IOT230 |	Okay for the section of the iot podcast

EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:28,448	| IOT230 |	This week's question comes from Joshua
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:30,496	| IOT230 |	Who is shopping
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:34,080	| IOT230 |	Hairstyles Joshua
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,616	| IOT230 |	I'm coming about 8
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,384	| IOT230 |	Spartan lights
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:36,896	| IOT230 |	Switch
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,176	| IOT230 |	At Walmart
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:42,016	| IOT230 |	Some company called Merkury Innovations
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:44,832	| IOT230 |	Genie
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:45,856	| IOT230 |	I really don't know which is which
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:49,440	| IOT230 |	That's a lot of information about them online and I'm just trying to
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:50,208	| IOT230 |	Ceased
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:53,280	| IOT230 |	If you guys have heard anything or you can try them out
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:55,840	| IOT230 |	Barry singing to take a price but
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:58,656	| IOT230 |	I'm not sure if it's worth money cheat in try
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:00,448	| IOT230 |	You can let me know I'd appreciate it
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:03,264	| IOT230 |	Oh Joshua I'd lied
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:09,408	| IOT230 |	You ask this because I noticed probably a year ago or so that Walmart had this whole Brandon I did a little bit of research into it
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:13,504	| IOT230 |	This is a company that
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:15,040	| IOT230 |	The products I actually bought a
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:15,552	| IOT230 |	Connected
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:18,624	| IOT230 |	Outlet has like a light switch no not
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:19,904	| IOT230 |	I'd Outlet
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:21,696	| IOT230 |	Place where you plug in things
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,208	| IOT230 |	And
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:24,512	| IOT230 |	Download the app the app is all right
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:26,048	| IOT230 |	It's not awesome there's nothing
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:27,072	| IOT230 |	It's not terrible
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:27,840	| IOT230 |	But it's not great
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:32,704	| IOT230 |	The app is the genie part that Joshua asked about because he was unsure of the name is
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:34,752	| IOT230 |	Merkury Innovations that Genie
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:35,776	| IOT230 |	Puccini is the app
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:37,824	| IOT230 |	And
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:38,848	| IOT230 |	It's a fine Prada
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:43,968	| IOT230 |	I will say that the company underlying Merkury Innovations with
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:44,736	| IOT230 |	Platform
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:46,016	| IOT230 |	Is a company called to you
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:47,808	| IOT230 |	Which is a Chinese company
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:48,576	| IOT230 |	They also
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,880	| IOT230 |	Do tons of business there
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:53,696	| IOT230 |	I think Charlie the second most popular maybe now the most pop
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:54,464	| IOT230 |	Popular iot
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:56,512	| IOT230 |	And
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:57,792	| IOT230 |	Those guys
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:31:03,680	| IOT230 |	They are based in China so you're going to see traffic from your Merkury Innovations products going to China
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:04,704	| IOT230 |	Because of
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:05,472	| IOT230 |	Patrulla connection
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:07,776	| IOT230 |	It is up to you to decide how
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:10,592	| IOT230 |	I
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:13,152	| IOT230 |	Didn't see anything horribly problematic
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:14,688	| IOT230 |	But I'm also not a secure
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:15,456	| IOT230 |	Dirty researcher
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:18,272	| IOT230 |	I think for the light switch I probably be okay with
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:21,344	| IOT230 |	I know they make other products such as cameras and such
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:24,160	| IOT230 |	Be a little more concerned
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:24,928	| IOT230 |	But
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:26,720	| IOT230 |	Light switch in this case
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:27,744	| IOT230 |	Ibuprofen
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:30,048	| IOT230 |	There's two issues right there's the issue of them can
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,328	| IOT230 |	Controlling are seeing the date
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:33,376	| IOT230 |	Camera light switch the other issue is
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:35,680	| IOT230 |	That could create a hole in your network
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:36,704	| IOT230 |	To which they could go to you
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:39,008	| IOT230 |	To see other things
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:40,288	| IOT230 |	That's bad
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:41,824	| IOT230 |	I'm not saying that they can
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:42,592	| IOT230 |	I'm saying that would be
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:45,408	| IOT230 |	The point here is
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:47,712	| IOT230 |	Is Deezer cheaper devices
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:50,784	| IOT230 |	Chuuya has been responsive to security
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:51,552	| IOT230 |	Abilities
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:54,112	| IOT230 |	So and I hate to be like a Chinese fear monger
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:55,136	| IOT230 |	Radii
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:58,208	| IOT230 |	I feel questionable about that but at the same time I'm also
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,256	| IOT230 |	It's not
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:02,304	| IOT230 |	Completely outlandish to be
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:03,840	| IOT230 |	Aware of that
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:04,608	| IOT230 |	I guess so
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,632	| IOT230 |	Be aware of that
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:07,680	| IOT230 |	The experience is
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:08,448	| IOT230 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:08,960	| IOT230 |	If there's nothing
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:11,008	| IOT230 |	Terribly fabulous
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:11,776	| IOT230 |	Terrible about it
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:14,336	| IOT230 |	I have that same feeling actually when I
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:16,384	| IOT230 |	I work with tp-link Kasa line of stuff
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:19,200	| IOT230 |	Honest and so
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:20,224	| IOT230 |	It's on par with that maybe
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:22,016	| IOT230 |	Less smooth
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:23,552	| IOT230 |	A little less fancy
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:25,088	| IOT230 |	Colossia
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:30,464	| IOT230 |	But you're you're just paying for utility Hermina says $18.88 for a Wi-Fi switch
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:31,744	| IOT230 |	You don't need a hug
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:36,352	| IOT230 |	He works with Madam a Google assistant and even Cortana issues Cortana
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:39,168	| IOT230 |	When does the
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:41,472	| IOT230 |	Phasing Cortana out of the homes
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:41,984	| IOT230 |	That's not
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,008	| IOT230 |	Batter for two
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:45,824	| IOT230 |	I can't wait to find out more about that
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:49,408	| IOT230 |	Because I'm sure you saw this but Microsoft hired bill
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:50,688	| IOT230 |	Stacy
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:51,200	| IOT230 |	Stasi
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:53,760	| IOT230 |	Who's the guy in charge of Siri
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:54,528	| IOT230 |	And so
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:33:00,672	| IOT230 |	I was really excited about this I'm like oh man is he going to be doing something cool with
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:01,184	| IOT230 |	Cortana
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:02,464	| IOT230 |	Maybe
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:05,280	| IOT230 |	Did he do anything cool with Siri I don't know
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:08,608	| IOT230 |	I just say that because I I find it to be the worst of the
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:10,400	| IOT230 |	The Big Three
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:13,728	| IOT230 |	All right
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:15,008	| IOT230 |	You'll find out
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:17,312	| IOT230 |	He's going to be heading up in AI
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:18,592	| IOT230 |	4
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,104	| IOT230 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:20,384	| IOT230 |	Who knows
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:22,176	| IOT230 |	But it does say
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:23,456	| IOT230 |	He'll quote
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:26,784	| IOT230 |	Where to help Align Technology strategies across the
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:27,296	| IOT230 |	Company
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:34,208	| IOT230 |	So maybe Cortana will get integrated into more Microsoft and products and maybe we'll finally see some of the cool stuff they keep
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:36,000	| IOT230 |	Keep showing us around Boise and enter
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:36,768	| IOT230 |	Surprise
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:37,792	| IOT230 |	All right
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:40,352	| IOT230 |	That feels like a bunch of dudes that
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:42,656	| IOT230 |	Was fun to talk about but it's time
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:44,704	| IOT230 |	For us to move on
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:47,264	| IOT230 |	To our guests this week's guest is Tim Ferriss
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:50,592	| IOT230 |	TMF Associates were going to be talking about
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:55,200	| IOT230 |	The likelihood of all of these iot satellite companies even the small set companies
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:56,992	| IOT230 |	How likely is it that they will succeed
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:58,272	| IOT230 |	So
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:34:04,672	| IOT230 |	Stay tuned for that after a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:06,208	| IOT230 |	Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:11,072	| IOT230 |	Message from our sponsor sponsor is nutanix and I have such him
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:13,120	| IOT230 |	Donnie here from nutanix
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:14,400	| IOT230 |	Here to talk to us
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:14,912	| IOT230 |	Sasha
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:20,032	| IOT230 |	Iot is projected to be more than a trillion dollar market by 2025
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:23,104	| IOT230 |	What are the obstacles in the way of that actually happened
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:29,248	| IOT230 |	I see there's two kinds of obstacles Technical and non-technical
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:31,808	| IOT230 |	It is a combination of many different
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:33,088	| IOT230 |	Technology challenges
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:35,136	| IOT230 |	Challenges around containerizing

EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:40,256	| IOT230 |	Using Advanced data processing Concepts
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:42,816	| IOT230 |	It's a large application and device security
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:45,376	| IOT230 |	Literally Planet scale and so on and so forth
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,912	| IOT230 |	These technical challenges
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:47,680	| IOT230 |	Translate
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:54,080	| IOT230 |	Two non technical challenges for an organization as well they feel stretched in terms of the type of talent
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:56,640	| IOT230 |	Destiny 2 how to make an IT project
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,944	| IOT230 |	Successful Danita combination of talents

EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:12,256	| IOT230 |	Are you in special Starmount of time and resources connect to dedicate to them
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:14,304	| IOT230 |	Got it I have heard this a problem
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:17,120	| IOT230 |	So what is nutanix working on to get rid of these Ops 2
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:21,728	| IOT230 |	We have too many different things but just to give you some concrete examples
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:23,008	| IOT230 |	In one instance
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:24,800	| IOT230 |	Re-creators Nai service
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:32,224	| IOT230 |	Complexity of end-users having to deal with many different kinds of
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:37,088	| IOT230 |	Can focus more on the business logic
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,624	| IOT230 |	I'm on the machine models
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:44,000	| IOT230 |	Unless on how does models make of operationalize

EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,704	| IOT230 |	And I have
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:57,472	| IOT230 |	Talk to him
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:58,752	| IOT230 |	For probably the last
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:36:59,264	| IOT230 |	20 years
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:01,568	| IOT230 |	Various satellite issues
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:03,104	| IOT230 |	Tim thanks for joining me
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:04,896	| IOT230 |	Text Stacy
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:07,456	| IOT230 |	I am super excited to have you we're going to be talking
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:09,760	| IOT230 |	About iot and satellites
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:10,784	| IOT230 |	As promised
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:11,552	| IOT230 |	So let's
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:13,856	| IOT230 |	Kick it off with an understanding of
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:16,672	| IOT230 |	Where does satellite fit into the iot
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,696	| IOT230 |	I always think of
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:19,744	| IOT230 |	Hey maybe I could be good for
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:23,072	| IOT230 |	Obviously remote areas with no connectivity but also things like
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:25,120	| IOT230 |	Pallets across the ocean
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:25,632	| IOT230 |	What do you think
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:28,192	| IOT230 |	But I think the idea that
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:32,800	| IOT230 |	Extending connectivity everywhere it's a really important thing to
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:34,080	| IOT230 |	Consider the many
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:38,688	| IOT230 |	Customers but the question about whether they want to pay for it is a particularly relevant issue
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:45,088	| IOT230 |	And if you go back 25 years at home then was talking about satellite phones and say all we want time open
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:46,880	| IOT230 |	Call 712 Cafe why we going to
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:50,976	| IOT230 |	How to stop light component in that will go mom to that whenever we go outside temperature
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:54,560	| IOT230 |	And what happened in the end well if people didn't really want to pay for
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:38:00,960	| IOT230 |	But they were trying to buy the idea of a phone that works anywhere but when it came to it and more expensive phone with a big on
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:01,728	| IOT230 |	Antenna
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:07,616	| IOT230 |	Having to pee alot for the moving time and then he went outside coverage of a small percentage
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:10,432	| IOT230 |	Did the time in the end the market turned out to
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:12,224	| IOT230 |	Not very exciting people didn't
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:13,760	| IOT230 |	Black mom to stop slicing
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:16,832	| IOT230 |	People use that to stay within a disaster or they win
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:17,600	| IOT230 |	In a war
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:18,624	| IOT230 |	Or other
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:20,160	| IOT230 |	Yo situations what did I say
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:22,720	| IOT230 |	In the middle of the ocean but they didn't use it as a
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:23,744	| IOT230 |	Aphrodite
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:25,536	| IOT230 |	Feature that moves outside
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,304	| IOT230 |	Iot
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:28,096	| IOT230 |	Satellite connectivity
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:35,264	| IOT230 |	10 years ago people say okay well people use satellites as a backup to terrestrial lobomon to that week
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:36,032	| IOT230 |	Incorporate
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:40,128	| IOT230 |	Listen to all these iot devices and what's happened is it
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:41,920	| IOT230 |	Terrestrial is FM's by leaps
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:44,480	| IOT230 |	Sometimes the cost of satellite equipment
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:49,088	| IOT230 |	Cost of satellite ad time is still a great deal higher than it is on
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:53,184	| IOT230 |	Terrestrial side and it remains to be seen whether that's enough
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:54,208	| IOT230 |	Need
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:57,024	| IOT230 |	Satellite to justify adding in that
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:57,792	| IOT230 |	Satellite capability
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:39:04,960	| IOT230 |	Transporting nuclear fuel around the country. You probably want to know where it is every minute of the day but if you're transported in Utah
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:09,568	| IOT230 |	What's the food around the countries that maybe it's not quite so important to not so much with thankful
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:14,176	| IOT230 |	Exactly I'd like to buy container of $5 t-shirts
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:15,200	| IOT230 |	It fell into the ocean
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:19,808	| IOT230 |	That's alright okay so before we go much deeper I feel like it's probably important
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:20,576	| IOT230 |	To talk about
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:22,112	| IOT230 |	The costs associated
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:22,880	| IOT230 |	With satellites
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:25,184	| IOT230 |	This'll give us a good context for when we
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:25,952	| IOT230 |	We switch from
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:27,744	| IOT230 |	Like a traditional to some of the small SAS
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:29,792	| IOT230 |	Recall that down
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:36,192	| IOT230 |	Tranquilizer designed specifically for iot with a classic
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:37,472	| IOT230 |	Old-time system
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:40,800	| IOT230 |	Let's be told called where they have relatively small satellite they spend
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:43,616	| IOT230 |	Something like two hundred million dollars on building I like you
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:46,432	| IOT230 |	System and its really only good for small amounts of data
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:50,528	| IOT230 |	In contrast you have satellites Adamo generally adoptable
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:52,832	| IOT230 |	Iridium being a classic example wedding
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:55,392	| IOT230 |	Just spent about asleep billion dollars upgrading next
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:40:02,304	| IOT230 |	Jumpits iot is only a small part of that total offering and they have most of that business phone
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:04,608	| IOT230 |	Mobile phones and a growing proportion
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:05,376	| IOT230 |	Humble Bundle
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:08,448	| IOT230 |	In both of those cases they are looking
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:09,472	| IOT230 |	To drive iotv
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:11,008	| IOT230 |	Space Wolf
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:15,616	| IOT230 |	The cost of that systems and the amount of capacity on those satellites
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:17,920	| IOT230 |	Well yeah that a long way away
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:20,224	| IOT230 |	The beams are pretty big they might have two stacks
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:21,248	| IOT230 |	Very limited
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:27,648	| IOT230 |	And soak this about a small amount of capacity compared to what you might have honestly jio4g
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:34,048	| IOT230 |	5G Network on the ground and when we talkin about the cost of the end-user you also need a relatively high up
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:40,448	| IOT230 |	Teletubby know if you have complex Electronics because you go to deal with a non sanded and unsanded interface
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:41,216	| IOT230 |	All those things
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:43,776	| IOT230 |	Me and that you were talking about terminal cost
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:44,800	| IOT230 |	Twitch started
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:48,640	| IOT230 |	Show me like $100 for the transceiver but once you put it into a terminal lights
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:49,920	| IOT230 |	Hundreds of dollars
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:56,320	| IOT230 |	And you talk about a time call switch today at generally in the range of thousands of dollars per megabyte
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:41:01,696	| IOT230 |	So many of the services because you're paying by the message in the message of a few bites might cost
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:05,280	| IOT230 |	Sample sentence with even the hot 10 or $0.20
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:06,048	| IOT230 |	Message
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:07,584	| IOT230 |	And that's been the big
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:08,096	| IOT230 |	Acmarket
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:15,520	| IOT230 |	The satellite providers which is expensive if you want to use this for like LTE data services but if you got like a
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:18,336	| IOT230 |	Single message that goes out once or twice a day
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:19,616	| IOT230 |	It's just a few bites
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:20,896	| IOT230 |	It's relatively
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:21,920	| IOT230 |	Inexpensive
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:25,504	| IOT230 |	What I'm hearing though is on the receiving side of the radio sign in
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:26,272	| IOT230 |	Device that
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:26,784	| IOT230 |	Still probably
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:31,904	| IOT230 |	Add a lot of cost of the device it depends what you need if you are application
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:38,304	| IOT230 |	Is being designed to take advantage of Lte and you're looking at transmitting two hats SFO megabytes ammo
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:40,352	| IOT230 |	Then you really have to do something
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:44,192	| IOT230 |	Pretty different Matt uses satellite when you're paying your by the message
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:45,728	| IOT230 |	Can you paint multiple sensor
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:48,032	| IOT230 |	Ten cents the message then you really need
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:49,056	| IOT230 |	To be just
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:49,824	| IOT230 |	Setting the most
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:52,128	| IOT230 |	So one of the challenges
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:52,895	| IOT230 |	This is Ben.
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:53,663	| IOT230 |	Yeah maybe
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:56,991	| IOT230 |	10 to 15 years ago satellite and terrestrial
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:42:03,135	| IOT230 |	You know what we had to G on the ground GPRS sounds like wasn't so far behind and you can maybe implement the same after
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:03,903	| IOT230 |	Applications
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:08,255	| IOT230 |	Co satellites Inuit Westfield Lincoln things would be simpler now you have to implement
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:11,839	| IOT230 |	It's quite different to satellite in many cases and
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:18,239	| IOT230 |	That means that there's an extra virgin on the end user to really decide whether they want to go to that trouble bussin
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:19,263	| IOT230 |	Southwest side
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:22,591	| IOT230 |	On the hardware side in adding the cost of a satellite transceiver
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:23,871	| IOT230 |	All right
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:28,991	| IOT230 |	We have talked to the past about some of the bigger classic satellite providers who
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:32,319	| IOT230 |	Giant birds in constellations way up there in Spanish
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:34,367	| IOT230 |	What we're seeing now
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:35,903	| IOT230 |	Is a launch
EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:37,439	| IOT230 |	Spa Sasse
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:43,839	| IOT230 |	In every time I talk to somebody who's talking about lunch a bunch of small sets for the iot and ideas
EDL	00:42:43,839	00:42:47,167	| IOT230 |	Is beside a satellite you could just toss them out there cheaper
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:48,703	| IOT230 |	They fly closer to
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:49,983	| IOT230 |	To the ground and
EDL	00:42:50,495	00:42:51,775	| IOT230 |	They're going to just change the world
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:53,311	| IOT230 |	Talk to me about
EDL	00:42:53,311	00:42:53,823	| IOT230 |	How should be
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:55,871	| IOT230 |	Because some of them actually
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:56,383	| IOT230 |	He seemed really
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:58,175	| IOT230 |	Track lights
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:43:01,503	| IOT230 |	I've got more efficient but it's important to know the old car
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:08,415	| IOT230 |	What's the original small satellite its original satellite launched back in the mid-to-late 1990s anyway
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:09,183	| IOT230 |	Wait a few tens
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:11,999	| IOT230 |	Kilograms in choosing format to Eva
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:16,095	| IOT230 |	Smaller today but the old
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:20,191	| IOT230 |	The capabilities are they still have to have access to
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:21,983	| IOT230 |	The Spectrum which is a big.
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:26,847	| IOT230 |	I don't comes fighting with some people who trying to get shared access to its own Bond
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:30,431	| IOT230 |	Other people have talked about accessing other satellite band
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:31,455	| IOT230 |	Switch fa.
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:36,831	| IOT230 |	Does Sally have playoffs device to access they may have looked at things like unlicensed
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:40,159	| IOT230 |	Spectrum laugh it's not really clear that the rules committee
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,695	| IOT230 |	Use of some of those on lights
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:43,999	| IOT230 |	Suspense by satellite to access dispatch
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:47,839	| IOT230 |	Big barrier-to-entry the technology has definitely improved
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:50,655	| IOT230 |	But things are not as different as you might have see it
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:53,727	| IOT230 |	Maybe in the group and weld it is different
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:57,567	| IOT230 |	That in most of the existing satellites on GO station
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:44:01,663	| IOT230 |	Turn red when talking about multi-ton satellites and we're going down to a few
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:03,711	| IOT230 |	Kilograms. In the world
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:07,039	| IOT230 |	You know we've had a video and old, vans for
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:09,343	| IOT230 |	20 + years they've got dispatch
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:10,111	| IOT230 |	Kitchen lights on
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:12,415	| IOT230 |	Improving ability to operate that got
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:15,231	| IOT230 |	Sales channels and infrastructure in different
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:17,023	| IOT230 |	Peace around the world end
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:18,303	| IOT230 |	These new satellites
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:19,583	| IOT230 |	Will light be sufficient
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:20,607	| IOT230 |	Different well
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:22,399	| IOT230 |	I don't even know if
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:27,007	| IOT230 |	Oldham will get the rights to operate in terms of access to
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:27,775	| IOT230 |	The Spectrum
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:29,823	| IOT230 |	You know that's a big area
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:30,847	| IOT230 |	Pressure on
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:32,383	| IOT230 |	Access to satellites bad
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:35,455	| IOT230 |	This is not is not available to Dedicated satellite purpose
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:39,039	| IOT230 |	It might have been in the past so a lot of this comes back to
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:42,879	| IOT230 |	Spectrum evening fuel Technologies Advance you have the right to operate
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:43,903	| IOT230 |	Can you get access
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:48,255	| IOT230 |	Can you deliver a compelling service building the infrastructure building the disc
EDL	00:44:48,255	00:44:51,583	| IOT230 |	Distribution getting people to adopt this is all challenging as well
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:56,447	| IOT230 |	Alright Spectrum I will keep that in mind is like the big scary thing to look at
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:45:00,031	| IOT230 |	I will say I feel like on a distribution side and getting
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:01,311	| IOT230 |	Cost Eleanor
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:07,967	| IOT230 |	It is just a marketing channel but when I look at deals like Amazon working with iridium on that 3 billion dollar upgrade
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:08,991	| IOT230 |	Example of
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:10,527	| IOT230 |	For iot
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:16,671	| IOT230 |	That feels like perhaps a really significant sales Channel and curious how you look at some of these Partnerships
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:19,999	| IOT230 |	Is that going to help change the name of the game
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:24,607	| IOT230 |	But I think it really depends on how customers decide to use satellite capability
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:29,727	| IOT230 |	It's not the light stays is that last resort solution just like a satellite phone is and it's
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:30,751	| IOT230 |	Something you
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:35,103	| IOT230 |	Leaving the cupboards and you take out when you going out to the middle of the ocean oil
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:41,503	| IOT230 |	Transporting nuclear fuel Calgary around the country or whatever then.
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:47,135	| IOT230 |	Something where it's a more widely accepted part of your everyday infrastructure
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:47,647	| IOT230 |	Can you come by month
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:54,559	| IOT230 |	It's not clear that the economics of change
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:55,583	| IOT230 |	Distribution
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:46:01,983	| IOT230 |	Can the special wine has all the economics going to work to include this in people's everyday use of iot
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:03,263	| IOT230 |	I don't know I don't think I don't
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:04,543	| IOT230 |	You seen that yet
EDL	00:46:04,543	00:46:07,359	| IOT230 |	In general I would say to rescue Lisa found
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:11,711	| IOT230 |	So fast but it's very very difficult for satellite to keep up
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:12,479	| IOT230 |	Satellites
EDL	00:46:12,479	00:46:16,575	| IOT230 |	The most serious is full and feather behind to Asheville expectations
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:19,135	| IOT230 |	In the last 20 years Boston getting
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:20,671	| IOT230 |	Closer to meeting to ask Alexa
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:25,535	| IOT230 |	They might meet something that someone wants because they made special expectations
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:28,095	| IOT230 |	From 10 or 15 or 20 years ago
EDL	00:46:28,095	00:46:32,959	| IOT230 |	But it doesn't keep Pace with what the latest is on the celestial side and X
EDL	00:46:32,959	00:46:33,471	| IOT230 |	Detectability
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:38,335	| IOT230 |	Okay it in terms of those capabilities are you talking about things like Gatorade
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:39,359	| IOT230 |	Lights or
EDL	00:46:39,359	00:46:42,687	| IOT230 |	Again the biggest argument that people make that satellite can
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:44,991	| IOT230 |	Can actually win with iot is because there
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:48,319	| IOT230 |	Relatively few and relatively small messages
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:51,903	| IOT230 |	I guess you're saying that the economics just still don't
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:52,415	| IOT230 |	Make sense
EDL	00:46:52,927	00:46:56,255	| IOT230 |	Because they're relatively few in relatively soon
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:46:56,767	| IOT230 |	Small messages
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:59,071	| IOT230 |	Text messages are expensive
EDL	00:47:00,351	00:47:03,679	| IOT230 |	AstroWorld iot really shift
EDL	00:47:03,679	00:47:05,727	| IOT230 |	To a study intermittent
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:07,007	| IOT230 |	Transmission
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:08,287	| IOT230 |	All very small amount
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:08,799	| IOT230 |	What's the date
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:11,871	| IOT230 |	We could meet that but the
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:13,919	| IOT230 |	Idea of Shifting to that
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:20,319	| IOT230 |	Small amounts of intermittent data is that the cost goes to a very very low
EDL	00:47:20,319	00:47:21,599	| IOT230 |	Boats to the hardware Evans
EDL	00:47:22,623	00:47:23,647	| IOT230 |	I'm so
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:25,695	| IOT230 |	You know when we're talkin about satellites look
EDL	00:47:26,207	00:47:29,279	| IOT230 |	How to get all twos in the multiple dollars per month
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:30,559	| IOT230 |	Andrew Luck
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:33,375	| IOT230 |	Looking at Hardware costs which are in the hundreds
EDL	00:47:33,375	00:47:34,399	| IOT230 |	DiBella's engine
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:35,167	| IOT230 |	Then
EDL	00:47:35,167	00:47:38,495	| IOT230 |	It's very difficult to to converge events
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:40,031	| IOT230 |	If you can deliver
EDL	00:47:40,031	00:47:41,055	| IOT230 |	That smoke
EDL	00:47:41,055	00:47:41,823	| IOT230 |	Statues of people
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:43,871	| IOT230 |	Alesso SF
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:45,407	| IOT230 |	Pacific visa application
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:51,551	| IOT230 |	I think there will be a market for that but I don't understand how
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:52,575	| IOT230 |	Fraud that will be
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:53,343	| IOT230 |	And you're right
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:55,647	| IOT230 |	They're already workarounds for things like
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:48:02,047	| IOT230 |	Containers at Sea and tracking those a lot of the times they're like yeah we'll just put something like a lorawan
EDL	00:48:02,047	00:48:03,839	| IOT230 |	Situation at a port
EDL	00:48:03,839	00:48:05,631	| IOT230 |	And as the ships
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:06,911	| IOT230 |	Come hear it enough
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:08,959	| IOT230 |	They're still there
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:11,263	| IOT230 |	So I share your Sceptre
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:15,103	| IOT230 |	That's not to say that there is
EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:19,199	| IOT230 |	Significant growth that we have several million terminals out that operating
EDL	00:48:19,199	00:48:20,223	| IOT230 |	Talk like that
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:20,991	| IOT230 |	But
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:23,551	| IOT230 |	If you look at for example some of the application
EDL	00:48:24,063	00:48:25,087	| IOT230 |	Play music in the past
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:29,439	| IOT230 |	That idea of tracking cargo at sea
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:32,767	| IOT230 |	Attack while on top of one another and if you was at like 7
EDL	00:48:32,767	00:48:35,071	| IOT230 |	We need to see the satellites going over head in the
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:41,215	| IOT230 |	The sky is on the bottom of the stack of Thea for containers send division to ability to make a line of sight to the
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:43,263	| IOT230 |	And so
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:46,847	| IOT230 |	The ideas that everything will be direct bicycle lights
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:48,639	| IOT230 |	Has transmuted into
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:50,431	| IOT230 |	For example using
EDL	00:48:50,431	00:48:53,247	| IOT230 |	Children's Wireless on board the ship transmitting
EDL	00:48:53,247	00:48:59,135	| IOT230 |	Get to a terminal on the shed which is a single B-side terminal sending it back to a regular cycle
EDL	00:48:59,135	00:49:05,535	| IOT230 |	It's going by satellite that's not what most people are thinking about when they thinking about sex
EDL	00:49:05,535	00:49:06,047	| IOT230 |	Flight iot
EDL	00:49:06,559	00:49:07,327	| IOT230 |	You're right
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:08,095	| IOT230 |	That is not worth it
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:10,655	| IOT230 |	But that as a Gateway kind of
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:15,007	| IOT230 |	What is a bridge technology makes a lot of sense plus ships already have satellite links on them
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:16,543	| IOT230 |	Because hey
EDL	00:49:16,543	00:49:17,311	| IOT230 |	Their ships
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:18,335	| IOT230 |	Out of the middle of the ocean
EDL	00:49:18,335	00:49:24,735	| IOT230 |	Alright Tim I know this is a little out of your purview possibly but I am curious for everyone who listens and every time
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:25,247	| IOT230 |	Write about satellite
EDL	00:49:26,015	00:49:27,295	| IOT230 |	Space trash
EDL	00:49:27,295	00:49:32,671	| IOT230 |	What about it all these small satellites there going to be a problem do you have a taker possibilities of dealing with it
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:34,463	| IOT230 |	Well I think that
EDL	00:49:34,975	00:49:41,375	| IOT230 |	There is a move towards deploying smaller and smaller satellites because of the Haya capabilities

EDL	00:52:57,215	00:52:59,519	| IOT230 |	They worry that these small price will get
EDL	00:52:59,519	00:53:02,335	| IOT230 |	Crushed under the circle to deploy
EDL	00:53:02,335	00:53:05,151	| IOT230 |	Because it's a very new set of application

EDL	00:53:12,575	00:53:18,975	| IOT230 |	Materialize it in in terms of Revenue generation and it's easy to look at Bull bandhan sale KY
EDL	00:53:18,975	00:53:25,375	| IOT230 |	Well that's a multibillion-dollar market already know we've got a couple of million people in North America already paying for satellite
EDL	00:53:25,375	00:53:28,191	| IOT230 |	Hope and maybe they'll be lots more of those overtime
EDL	00:53:28,191	00:53:34,591	| IOT230 |	I'd say okay that's why we're so concerned about 8 I would like to buy some people like you I must ingest that sauce and maybe wear
EDL	00:53:34,591	00:53:37,151	| IOT230 |	Not going to give money to these more

EDL	00:53:40,735	00:53:47,135	| IOT230 |	The case then people are going to run into the sand over the next year 18 months I think we're on the point at which we met
EDL	00:53:47,135	00:53:48,927	| IOT230 |	I see some failures
EDL	00:53:48,927	00:53:50,975	| IOT230 |	All these small players
EDL	00:53:50,975	00:53:52,511	| IOT230 |	Over the next 12 months
EDL	00:53:52,511	00:53:53,279	| IOT230 |	I'm so sorry
EDL	00:53:53,279	00:53:57,375	| IOT230 |	Which would be a bad sign if we see something bigger than that
EDL	00:53:57,375	00:54:00,447	| IOT230 |	We see a major multibillion-dollar Soco system
EDL	00:54:00,447	00:54:06,847	| IOT230 |	So then that would be even worse but I think we're at the point where I some of these small players are need to push up or shut

EDL	00:54:17,087	00:54:17,855	| IOT230 |	Does that a business
EDL	00:54:18,367	00:54:22,719	| IOT230 |	What happens to their constellation I know a lot of these only have either done some
EDL	00:54:23,231	00:54:24,255	| IOT230 |	Demo launches
EDL	00:54:24,255	00:54:25,279	| IOT230 |	But they still have stuff up
EDL	00:54:26,047	00:54:32,447	| IOT230 |	Yes that's right and to some degree that they do have a level of responsibilities for deorbiting face craft
EDL	00:54:32,447	00:54:33,727	| IOT230 |	If they have lost things
EDL	00:54:35,775	00:54:42,175	| IOT230 |	As we talked about before things like lights glad and Tara start writing medetai spectravite
EDL	00:54:42,175	00:54:42,943	| IOT230 |	Unconverted
EDL	00:54:42,943	00:54:49,343	| IOT230 |	Did the terrestrial Spectrum the maybe some assets that go on here so people who have satellites faction lights won't

EDL	00:54:53,183	00:54:54,719	| IOT230 |	Whistle to say
EDL	00:54:54,719	00:55:00,607	| IOT230 |	How that comes about other how that develops but if these people got to a point where they they don't believe they can
EDL	00:55:00,607	00:55:05,215	| IOT230 |	Consult that sounds like business they made much with other people who might be able to take Advanced L license
EDL	00:55:05,727	00:55:07,007	| IOT230 |	Was it say they may try
EDL	00:55:07,519	00:55:08,543	| IOT230 |	Something like
EDL	00:55:08,543	00:55:10,591	| IOT230 |	Converting the satellite license
EDL	00:55:10,591	00:55:11,871	| IOT230 |	To address your license
