EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:48,384	| IOT099 |	About it
EDL	00:00:48,384	00:00:50,944	| IOT099 |	Tim Cook uses homekit
EDL	00:00:50,944	00:00:52,736	| IOT099 |	Because it's always good to get those kind
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:54,016	| IOT099 |	Opinions
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:58,624	| IOT099 |	And I'm finally finally going to talk about my experiment in double Network
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:03,232	| IOT099 |	We're going to do all of this time we're gonna have a word from our sponsor spin dance
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:05,536	| IOT099 |	And then we're going to have Jenny
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:09,632	| IOT099 |	Who is the head of techstars iot incubator talking about
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:11,680	| IOT099 |	What is trendy
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:13,728	| IOT099 |	Right now for startups in the internet
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:15,264	| IOT099 |	Now
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:16,288	| IOT099 |	Before we get to all of that
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:23,200	| IOT099 |	Let's have a word from another one of our sponsors this week sponsor is a Lynette
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:29,600	| IOT099 |	Kayla is an Enterprise internet-of-things platform that is empowering the world's leading manufacturers by simple
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:36,000	| IOT099 |	Find the inherent complexity of the internet of things in their products into smart connected systems
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:42,400	| IOT099 |	Transform their businesses to compete in the game changing world is coming tippity
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:48,800	| IOT099 |	Complexity of developing connected products and is trusted by some of the leading brand so they can focus on what they do best
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:52,896	| IOT099 |	Kayla is solving the internet of things so you don't have to
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:54,432	| IOT099 |	To download the whitepaper
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:02:00,832	| IOT099 |	Biggest mistakes manufacturers make when launching iot products at Stacey on iot
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:02,880	| IOT099 |	.com
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:05,952	| IOT099 |	Paper cuz I'm very curious what those massage
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:06,720	| IOT099 |	State Farm
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:07,744	| IOT099 |	Alright Kevin
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:08,768	| IOT099 |	Let's get started
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:09,280	| IOT099 |	Let's start with
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:17,472	| IOT099 |	Yes and that's which has a range of products or products they have improved the notifications on their nest cam
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:23,360	| IOT099 |	It can now identify a door for example and turn it into like a a Zone
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:27,712	| IOT099 |	For monitoring so that way if it's
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,480	| IOT099 |	And you said yes it is
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,784	| IOT099 |	They can actually monitor
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,064	| IOT099 |	Activity through that
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:36,416	| IOT099 |	And that will help you understand who's coming and going in your house
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:42,560	| IOT099 |	So you could always manually trolleys activity zones but now that Nest is smart enough to actually kind of figure out
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:46,400	| IOT099 |	What is ask you is this an activity Zone you might want to look at us
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:47,936	| IOT099 |	Additionally
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:51,520	| IOT099 |	The alerts on the nest protect are better because
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:56,384	| IOT099 |	If your smoke alarm senses smoke or carbon monoxide
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:03:02,016	| IOT099 |	You automatically get live video from all the nest Cam that you have in your house which is kind of cool I think it was like
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:04,320	| IOT099 |	Is this a false alarm
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,856	| IOT099 |	Is problem right now
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,136	| IOT099 |	You can tell you that right away so
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:12,256	| IOT099 |	Can I see Improvement and there's no additional cost for this kind of Nest does charge for
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:14,048	| IOT099 |	You know saving recordings in the cloud
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:17,888	| IOT099 |	Tanner 30 days at a time but this is all just built in in the
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,680	| IOT099 |	And available with the new update
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,472	| IOT099 |	Actually that might be good for
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,520	| IOT099 |	Fireman when they come to the house
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,056	| IOT099 |	It is
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:25,824	| IOT099 |	Burning town
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:28,896	| IOT099 |	They can actually get a visual inside the house before the cameras belt
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:32,480	| IOT099 |	And since it's all stored in the cloud Maybe
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,248	| IOT099 |	You know if there's a
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,272	| IOT099 |	Investigation after
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:36,576	| IOT099 |	Data from
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,088	| IOT099 |	Those cameras
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:38,880	| IOT099 |	I don't know yet
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,416	| IOT099 |	And I think if you would have been
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:44,512	| IOT099 |	Every home should have like an emergency plan to evacuate
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:49,376	| IOT099 |	If you can quickly pinpoint what area of the house is the problem area you need to get out
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:53,984	| IOT099 |	That may impact or help you get out quicker because you'll need to go that way so it's B
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:54,496	| IOT099 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:55,520	| IOT099 |	A few seconds
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,872	| IOT099 |	We should say the nest is owned by Google
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:07,040	| IOT099 |	Is not owned by Google but he does work for Google as a contractor but I don't work with the nest people around
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:09,088	| IOT099 |	Any other smart home initiatives at Google
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,368	| IOT099 |	Okay
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,416	| IOT099 |	Dimension
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:13,184	| IOT099 |	Thread
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:16,000	| IOT099 |	Recorded the podcast
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:18,303	| IOT099 |	Thread actually announced today that they have
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,583	| IOT099 |	Thread certified chips out
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:23,679	| IOT099 |	And the big news for the week are about
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,959	| IOT099 |	How is that
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:28,543	| IOT099 |	New thread devices will launch before the end of this year
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:29,567	| IOT099 |	In fact
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,871	| IOT099 |	I talked to somebody and
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:36,223	| IOT099 |	They told me that a new thread based device the first one will launch in May
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,527	| IOT099 |	I don't know
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,087	| IOT099 |	Well that actually jives with
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:47,487	| IOT099 |	Threadgill's kind of buried in their press release it says certified thread based products are expected enter the market in the first half of the
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:47,999	| IOT099 |	Urso
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:50,815	| IOT099 |	There could be more than just one in May
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:51,583	| IOT099 |	There we go
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,887	| IOT099 |	Looking forward
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,911	| IOT099 |	I actually am
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:59,263	| IOT099 |	We were talking about third for a couple of years and it just
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:01,311	| IOT099 |	Whiskey talkin about it but
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:03,615	| IOT099 |	We're not seeing a ton of actual progress
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,407	| IOT099 |	It was a
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,687	| IOT099 |	Rin
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:10,527	| IOT099 |	Protocol so true true they launched in 2014
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:12,831	| IOT099 |	Shred that work
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,879	| IOT099 |	Build this and so that actually me
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,159	| IOT099 |	Makes sense
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:16,927	| IOT099 |	It does take time
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:22,047	| IOT099 |	Cuz it's right
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,095	| IOT099 |	All right
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,631	| IOT099 |	So some other really
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,399	| IOT099 |	I don't know
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:28,447	| IOT099 |	This is this is cool that this could be
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:29,983	| IOT099 |	Where I want to give you guys
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:32,287	| IOT099 |	But it's CSI miss this and someone pointed it out to
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:33,567	| IOT099 |	Which
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,335	| IOT099 |	For 4
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:36,639	| IOT099 |	There's a pub called The Mix tile
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,687	| IOT099 |	Made by a Chinese company
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,991	| IOT099 |	Falcon Crest
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:45,087	| IOT099 |	And this device. We don't have pricing we don't know what it's going to be out
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,879	| IOT099 |	The cool thing about it though is
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:47,647	| IOT099 |	Hug that could
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,671	| IOT099 |	Tire home
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,719	| IOT099 |	It's tough to your Z-Wave and zigbee
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:54,559	| IOT099 |	Cuz it Doesn't it's apparently mfi certified
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:58,911	| IOT099 |	So I don't know what to say here other than I am
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,679	| IOT099 |	It comes out so I
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:04,543	| IOT099 |	It sounds cool like we said we don't know which
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,591	| IOT099 |	It's actually going to launch win cost and all that
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:09,151	| IOT099 |	So if I'm understanding it
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,431	| IOT099 |	Frankly this is a way to get
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:12,479	| IOT099 |	Essentially some non homekit
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:16,063	| IOT099 |	Devices working with homekit and the home app in your Apple
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:17,087	| IOT099 |	IPhone ER
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:18,111	| IOT099 |	Wear your iPad
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:22,975	| IOT099 |	Does that sound right because I'm going to be nice to Adnan homekit tanks
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:27,327	| IOT099 |	So it's either going to have its own app where you would actually then have to work at
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,863	| IOT099 |	Everything but I'm hoping it brings the stuff
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:31,167	| IOT099 |	IOS
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:34,751	| IOT099 |	Yeah that's that's what I'm thinking is it supposed to do
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,543	| IOT099 |	Which is good
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,847	| IOT099 |	You've got the security
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:40,127	| IOT099 |	Chip inside
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:42,687	| IOT099 |	It's hard to mix tile because it's mfi certified
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:47,295	| IOT099 |	And then hopefully that would handle any situation shoes from the non homekit devices
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:49,855	| IOT099 |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:53,439	| IOT099 |	I will say it's nice to have that option
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,463	| IOT099 |	Although what you're going to end up
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:02,655	| IOT099 |	We will see
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:05,727	| IOT099 |	It was worth every one noting
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:06,495	| IOT099 |	Will keep up on this
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:10,591	| IOT099 |	Moving away from home kit
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,359	| IOT099 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:12,639	| IOT099 |	Google
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,943	| IOT099 |	Hanson's Kevin's already given his
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:16,735	| IOT099 |	My disclaimer
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,855	| IOT099 |	When is you can actually control Smart Home devices
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:22,879	| IOT099 |	Pixel
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:23,903	| IOT099 |	You have
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:26,719	| IOT099 |	Yeah so this kind of brings
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,255	| IOT099 |	Google home
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,279	| IOT099 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,583	| IOT099 |	2 in a limited degree to a
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:34,911	| IOT099 |	Google pixel or pixel XL phone through Google Assistant
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:38,239	| IOT099 |	And it sort of makes sense cuz Google assistant is really the
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,007	| IOT099 |	The brains
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,031	| IOT099 |	Inside
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,311	| IOT099 |	Google home
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:44,127	| IOT099 |	I haven't seen any official announcements on this
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:47,199	| IOT099 |	So I didn't say anything originally when I first
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,479	| IOT099 |	Read about this last week
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:51,807	| IOT099 |	People all over our reporting it and also
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,343	| IOT099 |	I see the setting in my
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,111	| IOT099 |	On my pixel
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:57,695	| IOT099 |	If you have a pixel or pixel XL and go into your
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,231	| IOT099 |	Google Now settings
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:02,303	| IOT099 |	You should see a smart home
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,583	| IOT099 |	Teacher or devices future
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:06,399	| IOT099 |	Where you can add support for
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:06,911	| IOT099 |	WeMo
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,471	| IOT099 |	SmartThings and Philips Hue
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:12,799	| IOT099 |	And that will add voice control through your pixel 2 those
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,591	| IOT099 |	Those devices github
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,127	| IOT099 |	So I don't have
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:19,711	| IOT099 |	Hue setup I don't have smart thing so I went wink
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:22,271	| IOT099 |	But I do have some WeMo switches so course I tried it
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:28,415	| IOT099 |	And it works just like it works with my echo you know I just am not going to say the hot word but I just say the hot word so that the phone is listening
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:33,279	| IOT099 |	Can I say turn office on my office lights
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,559	| IOT099 |	There's really no
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,327	| IOT099 |	Lag
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:38,143	| IOT099 |	Or anything like that but then again that
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:44,543	| IOT099 |	Particular setup I have with the WeMo is a direct Wi-Fi connection so it should be quick there's no Cloud involved but actually there is cloud
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,847	| IOT099 |	Because the phone is going to I presume
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,895	| IOT099 |	Send that to Google servers
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:50,687	| IOT099 |	No there's no cloud
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,551	| IOT099 |	Yeah I think
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:09:01,695	| IOT099 |	I think it's I think it's straight in the case of the WeMo I think it is a straight connection over Wi-Fi because you link your wink not you
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,023	| IOT099 |	Either way it works fast
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,839	| IOT099 |	The shoe would be cloudy
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:09,119	| IOT099 |	And so
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,911	| IOT099 |	Exactly
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,679	| IOT099 |	McDonald's
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:16,287	| IOT099 |	And so you know when you go look for this you're going to go to settings on your Google assistant and
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,567	| IOT099 |	The title is called
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:21,663	| IOT099 |	I know so many different words for
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:25,247	| IOT099 |	And
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:26,271	| IOT099 |	So
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:27,807	| IOT099 |	You may be
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:30,367	| IOT099 |	Questioning why you want your phone to do this I personally
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:30,879	| IOT099 |	I think it's awesome
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:31,903	| IOT099 |	Not in the room
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,439	| IOT099 |	Device perhaps
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:36,255	| IOT099 |	But if you want to do this with the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,279	| IOT099 |	There's actually a way you
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,047	| IOT099 |	I can do that without the ra
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:39,839	| IOT099 |	Amazon doesn't ask
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,911	| IOT099 |	There is an app called me app
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,191	| IOT099 |	Download
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:46,239	| IOT099 |	And basically
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,007	| IOT099 |	You open the app
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:47,775	| IOT099 |	You press the button in
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:48,287	| IOT099 |	Can you tell
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:51,103	| IOT099 |	She Who Shall Not Be Named to do something and low and behold
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,919	| IOT099 |	That's pretty cool cuz it also works when you
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:57,247	| IOT099 |	And I still think it should be part of the
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:59,039	| IOT099 |	Official Amazon native app but that's just me
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,695	| IOT099 |	And I'm not trying to
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:09,279	| IOT099 |	Put the people at a business by any means I love what they did but
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,303	| IOT099 |	Really it should be native
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,351	| IOT099 |	All right
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,143	| IOT099 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,167	| IOT099 |	Smart watches
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:16,959	| IOT099 |	Kevin
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:18,495	| IOT099 |	It's terrible
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,287	| IOT099 |	I'm on my second cup of coffee is okay
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:22,079	| IOT099 |	Cuz I saw the Android watches
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,871	| IOT099 |	The task
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:24,895	| IOT099 |	Best casino
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,711	| IOT099 |	Gotcha so
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:34,111	| IOT099 |	So officially Android Wear 2.0 that's Google's platform for smart watches came out of developer
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:36,159	| IOT099 |	Preview it is available for
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:38,463	| IOT099 |	Device makers to use and so on
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:42,047	| IOT099 |	LG actually has two watches out already
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:46,143	| IOT099 |	They are available online and in some stores and a carriers
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,423	| IOT099 |	I just tell you that
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:49,215	| IOT099 |	Between the two there's a big difference
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,263	| IOT099 |	Some the LG watch Style
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,287	| IOT099 |	$49
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:54,847	| IOT099 |	It is thin ish
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,895	| IOT099 |	It's thinner than the second one I'll say that
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:11:00,223	| IOT099 |	But it is missing a lot of features from the second watch
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:01,247	| IOT099 |	So there's no
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:06,111	| IOT099 |	LTE dedicated LTE connection which The Logical don't really need anything
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:08,159	| IOT099 |	There's no NFC so
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:10,975	| IOT099 |	We can't do Android pay with it there's no
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:13,023	| IOT099 |	Or somewhere new GPS in it so
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:19,167	| IOT099 |	So it's not for me somebody who runs everyday and wears a sport watch outside this is not for me it does have Google Assistant
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:21,215	| IOT099 |	Raise your wrist and you can
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:22,751	| IOT099 |	You know just ask a question and
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:27,871	| IOT099 |	Presume that you should be able to control the things that we just have out with a pixel
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:29,151	| IOT099 |	Through the watch that way
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,711	| IOT099 |	I presume I don't know cuz I don't have one of these
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:37,855	| IOT099 |	The LG watch sport is $349 to a hundred bucks more and get you a dedicated LTE connection
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:41,695	| IOT099 |	There's actually a nano SIM slot inside the watch
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,975	| IOT099 |	The watch comes with a
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,255	| IOT099 |	A special wrench
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:48,863	| IOT099 |	That you take the back of the watch off with and popping a SIM cards crazy senior phone calls
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:53,215	| IOT099 |	You have a data connection you can stream whatever music and so on as long as Internet for it
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:55,263	| IOT099 |	So that's kind of interesting that could be
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,287	| IOT099 |	Used
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:59,615	| IOT099 |	How to control a home when you're out and about running maybe you
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:02,175	| IOT099 |	Need to open up the garage door for somebody for example
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,943	| IOT099 |	Right
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:05,247	| IOT099 |	Oh I was going to say or you want to set your AC down
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:06,271	| IOT099 |	I said when you get
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,807	| IOT099 |	When you get back here like
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:14,975	| IOT099 |	And then again I don't know that you can actually do that but the capability certainly there I don't see why you wouldn't be able to do that
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:17,023	| IOT099 |	Maybe in the future if not now but sub
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:22,399	| IOT099 |	But the LG watch sport is very thick in about 15 15 1/2 millimeters thick
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:23,423	| IOT099 |	Clunky and big
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:27,007	| IOT099 |	You know it's got every kind of sensor
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:29,567	| IOT099 |	Feature you would want in a smartwatch
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:34,431	| IOT099 |	And I can't think of anything that would be missing in terms of up sensors and so on so
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:37,759	| IOT099 |	That one is available through AT&T and Verizon
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,807	| IOT099 |	Either on or off contract but
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:42,623	| IOT099 |	We all know that friends don't let friends buy devices on contracts
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:48,255	| IOT099 |	That it's five or $10 to add that LTE connection to your account as well so
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:52,607	| IOT099 |	But yeah this could be a handy way to do some remote control type things
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:54,911	| IOT099 |	Yeah well I would like it just to
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:55,935	| IOT099 |	Listen to
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:56,959	| IOT099 |	Music without hearing my
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:58,495	| IOT099 |	Roundabout
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:01,311	| IOT099 |	I do that now with
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:03,871	| IOT099 |	My old Android Wear watches as well as my Apple watch
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:05,151	| IOT099 |	Because you can
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:07,455	| IOT099 |	Store almost 4 gig of Music there
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:09,503	| IOT099 |	Are you used to say when I stream music
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:10,527	| IOT099 |	No I could actually
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,039	| IOT099 |	Restore it like
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:16,927	| IOT099 |	I see Spotify is is kind of an outlier in that
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,463	| IOT099 |	Yasso
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:24,095	| IOT099 |	With apple music and Google play music you can download to your various watches depending on your platform
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:25,631	| IOT099 |	And like I
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:30,239	| IOT099 |	Cute mine up with like three hours of music so I can easily go run a half marathon
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,543	| IOT099 |	And I I just
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:33,567	| IOT099 |	Carry my music with me that way
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,359	| IOT099 |	Easily run a half
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:45,343	| IOT099 |	It's not easy but I could you know fall down a bunch of times and still cross the finish line and still have
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,111	| IOT099 |	Music list to listen to
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,951	| IOT099 |	I don't advise that
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,023	| IOT099 |	Hope you like heaven
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,583	| IOT099 |	Chow dog
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:58,143	| IOT099 |	One is bad enough we don't need more of me
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:01,983	| IOT099 |	The Mirai botnet
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:04,799	| IOT099 |	But you probably remember because we talked about it at
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,311	| IOT099 |	10 * 5
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:06,591	| IOT099 |	Late last year
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:09,407	| IOT099 |	This is a ran on
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,431	| IOT099 |	Connected
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,199	| IOT099 |	Linux
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:12,223	| IOT099 |	Devices so
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:16,063	| IOT099 |	Network DVR players were big culprits couple routers
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,111	| IOT099 |	And what it is
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,927	| IOT099 |	It was part of the big DDOS attack
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,439	| IOT099 |	Against
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:24,511	| IOT099 |	Adena systems and took down
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,535	| IOT099 |	Major websites around
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,095	| IOT099 |	Very exciting
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,375	| IOT099 |	Mariah still out
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,471	| IOT099 |	Someone has
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:34,239	| IOT099 |	Where did it
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:35,775	| IOT099 |	Windows machine
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:38,847	| IOT099 |	Oh thank you ever do that sarcasm
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:42,431	| IOT099 |	What this means basically is
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:46,527	| IOT099 |	I don't know how often you going to like your doctor's office or maybe a point-of-sale turn
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:47,807	| IOT099 |	UCD
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:52,671	| IOT099 |	He Windows prompts but that means all of those machines could now become compromised and
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:56,767	| IOT099 |	Part of the spotnet which puts a lot more power at merized
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:01,119	| IOT099 |	Scale their scaling up
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,423	| IOT099 |	It's so yes
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:05,215	| IOT099 |	Is this good news now
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:06,239	| IOT099 |	This is bad news and
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:09,311	| IOT099 |	Depending on how the technology is
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:11,359	| IOT099 |	Figured so if it has a hard-coded password
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:14,175	| IOT099 |	If the password hasn't been changed
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:16,991	| IOT099 |	Mariah even if you take it off the machine is just going to
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:17,503	| IOT099 |	Come right back
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:21,343	| IOT099 |	So some of these devices are going to be compromised forever
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:23,647	| IOT099 |	And we'll just have to take them offline
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,183	| IOT099 |	I'm in some of them probably can be
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:25,951	| IOT099 |	Text
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:26,463	| IOT099 |	So
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:28,767	| IOT099 |	Semi-good news
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:30,559	| IOT099 |	Bad news
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,351	| IOT099 |	Speaking of security
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,143	| IOT099 |	That's actually
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:40,543	| IOT099 |	This is a really interesting story so this came out this week and this is from the Verizon 2017 data breach
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,055	| IOT099 |	Digest
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,591	| IOT099 |	Which is a
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:43,615	| IOT099 |	Report
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:47,967	| IOT099 |	What happens here is a named University
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:50,015	| IOT099 |	Basically had its iot Network
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:53,343	| IOT099 |	Compromised and then turned against itself
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:55,391	| IOT099 |	So what happened is B
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:59,743	| IOT099 |	Vending machines printers and other connected objects that are kind of part of the
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:01,279	| IOT099 |	The iot for this particular
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:01,791	| IOT099 |	University
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:04,607	| IOT099 |	Basically they were hacked and then they started
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:07,935	| IOT099 |	Looking up Seafood searches which is held
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,471	| IOT099 |	People love
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:10,751	| IOT099 |	Citrus ending
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:16,639	| IOT099 |	There were over 5,000 discrete systems making hundreds of DNS lookups every 15 min
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:19,199	| IOT099 |	So this is basically grounded their Network to
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:25,343	| IOT099 |	In the button it actually was spread from device to device by brute forcing default in
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,647	| IOT099 |	Password so does the same thing that was happen
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:28,671	| IOT099 |	Mirai
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:31,487	| IOT099 |	And once it was known the mall where
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:33,279	| IOT099 |	Malware had full control a device
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:38,399	| IOT099 |	And it would basically change the devices password and locking everybody out of that system
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:41,471	| IOT099 |	So this is really nasty stuff
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:44,799	| IOT099 |	Here is kind of separate your Networks
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:48,127	| IOT099 |	This is going to be a
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:49,151	| IOT099 |	Breezy world
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:55,551	| IOT099 |	Iot devices that are systems or other
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,063	| IOT099 |	Websites
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:59,647	| IOT099 |	If there's 4 turned against themselves we're going to see
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,671	| IOT099 |	Stores that can
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,719	| IOT099 |	Curtis actions
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:06,303	| IOT099 |	Medical Center Hospital
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,327	| IOT099 |	Catastrophic
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:08,607	| IOT099 |	So
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:09,887	| IOT099 |	Do better
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,423	| IOT099 |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:15,007	| IOT099 |	We don't know that the university but the best soon as
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:21,151	| IOT099 |	You mentioned this story I'm thinking now you know my son just started college there are connected vending machines and every floor the dorms with
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:27,807	| IOT099 |	Card readers in what. He was just complaining about slow Network the other day and that's what the more the first tip-off seven issue were in
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,343	| IOT099 |	Particular report
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:34,207	| IOT099 |	And it's not my son's interest I don't think it's just you know just get me got me thinking you know
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:36,511	| IOT099 |	How many people can be impacted by
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:41,631	| IOT099 |	Such a seemingly small thing right one little thing gets into that Network and all the sudden
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,679	| IOT099 |	You know these guys
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:46,239	| IOT099 |	Texas University locked out of
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,007	| IOT099 |	5000 systems
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:49,823	| IOT099 |	What's the impact is huge
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:52,383	| IOT099 |	And there's a lot of connected stuff out there
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,663	| IOT099 |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,431	| IOT099 |	Soho
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,711	| IOT099 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:57,503	| IOT099 |	Moving from security to
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,295	| IOT099 |	Back to the echo actually
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:03,647	| IOT099 |	Play so I just thought this was an interesting stat so I thought I'd share it with Parks Associates
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,415	| IOT099 |	This week
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:09,535	| IOT099 |	Put out a report that says 2 to 4% of us Broadband households have purchased an echo
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:10,303	| IOT099 |	In the past 6 months
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:12,351	| IOT099 |	That's
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:14,143	| IOT099 |	Totally
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:18,751	| IOT099 |	Interesting and we were running we are running Friday survey
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:22,335	| IOT099 |	In of the people who responded with things they bought
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,127	| IOT099 |	Bye
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:30,271	| IOT099 |	Google home in the Amazon Echo are like 200 people
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,551	| IOT099 |	The last six months which is crazy
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:34,879	| IOT099 |	And I'm not surprised I mean it's
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,927	| IOT099 |	It's really taking off because it provides
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:40,767	| IOT099 |	That invisible voice interface to do so many different things
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,791	| IOT099 |	You know as well as getting
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:43,071	| IOT099 |	Getting information
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:45,887	| IOT099 |	To you and I may be enjoying music and so on
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:47,167	| IOT099 |	What it is
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:49,727	| IOT099 |	The poster child for the smart home these days end
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,031	| IOT099 |	In a related stat just
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:55,871	| IOT099 |	I think it was yesterday before Amazon had shared its quarterly numbers
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:59,711	| IOT099 |	They broke out their revenue for subscriptions
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:02,015	| IOT099 |	And it was like so I can
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:05,087	| IOT099 |	I don't recall the exact number but some analysts did
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,623	| IOT099 |	Some math and said you know
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:08,159	| IOT099 |	There's about
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:13,023	| IOT099 |	64 million Prime subscribers send that jumped out of
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:15,327	| IOT099 |	That's because not just for the revenue
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:16,095	| IOT099 |	But also
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:19,935	| IOT099 |	That's a huge potential user base for the echo devices because you really
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,727	| IOT099 |	Want
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,519	| IOT099 |	I think it's part of all this and
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,311	| IOT099 |	I could see a lot of prime people keep
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:27,871	| IOT099 |	Take an extra pad echosign add smart on blanks
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:32,735	| IOT099 |	So with this in mind if you are one of those people who purchased an echo they recommend
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:33,503	| IOT099 |	Couple things for you
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:34,783	| IOT099 |	Because
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,063	| IOT099 |	My far away
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:38,111	| IOT099 |	The most useful Echo skills
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,135	| IOT099 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:41,439	| IOT099 |	So
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:42,719	| IOT099 |	If you are
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,255	| IOT099 |	Kind of a nervous Nelly
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:47,583	| IOT099 |	I would say to take your first Quick Step into a smart
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:51,679	| IOT099 |	I will connect you to the Philips Hue bulbs into some lamps
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,471	| IOT099 |	Or I would say 42
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:53,983	| IOT099 |	Chipper
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,519	| IOT099 |	Experience
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:59,359	| IOT099 |	Pick up a few WeMo switches there about $35 and
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:02,431	| IOT099 |	Just connect those and then you can suddenly control your lamps
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:03,455	| IOT099 |	Voice
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:04,479	| IOT099 |	It's freaky
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:08,831	| IOT099 |	Awesome it's a starter gives you a taste of what you can do and
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:10,623	| IOT099 |	And I've said before replacing
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:12,159	| IOT099 |	Physical switches with voice
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:17,535	| IOT099 |	Interaction is just the baby steps when you start connecting things to do things based on
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:22,143	| IOT099 |	Actions that makes things smart but this is a great way to dip your toe in the water
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:22,655	| IOT099 |	Migraine
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:25,727	| IOT099 |	You're going to like it
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:28,543	| IOT099 |	Stop right there did you guys
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:31,871	| IOT099 |	Stop the presses just because you were talking about this
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:35,967	| IOT099 |	I don't know if you guys talked about it last week when I was not here apologize
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:38,015	| IOT099 |	The Amazon tap
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:38,527	| IOT099 |	Is now
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:45,951	| IOT099 |	Look at that so and I say this because the tap is cheaper than a full Echo although the
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:48,767	| IOT099 |	Echo Dot
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:50,815	| IOT099 |	But the tap which is a battery-powered
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,607	| IOT099 |	Echo device
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:55,423	| IOT099 |	Previously you had to literally tap the button
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:57,983	| IOT099 |	And then you would speak your commands and make things happen
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,007	| IOT099 |	But now
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:01,055	| IOT099 |	I said they should have done from the beginning
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:02,591	| IOT099 |	You can
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:05,663	| IOT099 |	Guest voice control setting in the
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:06,687	| IOT099 |	App that
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:08,735	| IOT099 |	Disappointed that I want to say cuz it's her name
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:10,527	| IOT099 |	That you can just enable the Wake word
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:15,647	| IOT099 |	And I tested it out works great so now I've got a tap down in my dining room where
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:16,672	| IOT099 |	Now I can just
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:19,232	| IOT099 |	Speaking control lights and do things it's a beautiful thing
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:25,632	| IOT099 |	It is plugged in for me all the time except when I take it outside on the deck but now there's winter I'm not doing that
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:27,936	| IOT099 |	I thought they should
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:31,264	| IOT099 |	Or would add this feature if and only if it was
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:32,288	| IOT099 |	Sitting on the
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:33,568	| IOT099 |	Base charging
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:39,200	| IOT099 |	But no it can be done when your on battery power it will reduce the battery life not the battery like but the actual
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:42,272	| IOT099 |	Length of time you can run on a charge they say about 8 hours
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,296	| IOT099 |	Because of the
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:45,088	| IOT099 |	Coding for always listening functionality
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:46,368	| IOT099 |	Okay that's
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:48,672	| IOT099 |	How long does it last
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:51,232	| IOT099 |	I haven't tested but they say about 8 hours
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:54,304	| IOT099 |	Which is probably only one to two hours
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:56,608	| IOT099 |	Rest and it would be without that
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:22:02,240	| IOT099 |	You don't have to use the future you couldn't save your battery life and turn the Wake word off in which case it's a manual tap
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:07,104	| IOT099 |	Let's see now we're going to get into Mobile World Congress is
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:11,712	| IOT099 |	It is such a two weeks from now
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,736	| IOT099 |	Who am I what day is it
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:18,368	| IOT099 |	So it is two weeks for now we're already starting to see a rush of news about
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:20,416	| IOT099 |	This is where Kevin
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:25,280	| IOT099 |	Bear with me because this is actually a big deal
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:28,864	| IOT099 |	So one of the things we talked a lot about are these low-power wide area
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:31,680	| IOT099 |	And basically these are
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:32,960	| IOT099 |	Networks design
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:33,472	| IOT099 |	For the internet
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:40,384	| IOT099 |	They said really tiny amounts of data but the cool thing is they send it that they cover huge areas so like cities
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:41,664	| IOT099 |	Entire
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,176	| IOT099 |	Counties
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,456	| IOT099 |	And it's
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,480	| IOT099 |	It's kind of like the cellular
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,272	| IOT099 |	But it's not always
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:47,552	| IOT099 |	That's where it gets low
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,880	| IOT099 |	AT&T is going to launch
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:51,392	| IOT099 |	And iot net
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:52,672	| IOT099 |	This
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,696	| IOT099 |	June
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:55,488	| IOT099 |	Chats which is actually pretty
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:58,048	| IOT099 |	Amazing and I use a standard called LTE
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,584	| IOT099 |	And this is
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,608	| IOT099 |	A cellular standard
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,680	| IOT099 |	Bifurcated
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:10,848	| IOT099 |	Two networks but they're going to take it to these very small
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:12,640	| IOT099 |	Verizon is also doing
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,152	| IOT099 |	An LTE
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:14,688	| IOT099 |	At 1
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:16,992	| IOT099 |	So these are going to be like
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,528	| IOT099 |	Hopefully cheaper
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:19,296	| IOT099 |	We're still waiting
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,320	| IOT099 |	Pricing on these butt
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:21,600	| IOT099 |	It should be interesting
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,160	| IOT099 |	With things like
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:26,208	| IOT099 |	Laura and sigfox
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:27,488	| IOT099 |	Some of the other
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:28,768	| IOT099 |	Networks that are out there
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:30,304	| IOT099 |	So
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,072	| IOT099 |	Also
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:32,096	| IOT099 |	On the cellular side
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:34,144	| IOT099 |	Nokia has done
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,168	| IOT099 |	I don't even know how to say
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,984	| IOT099 |	Created a network called
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:38,496	| IOT099 |	Wing
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:40,032	| IOT099 |	Which is basically
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,824	| IOT099 |	Cellular
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:42,848	| IOT099 |	It's going to have some
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:45,152	| IOT099 |	I think it's going to have some satellite yes
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:47,712	| IOT099 |	Cellular satellite
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,736	| IOT099 |	It might even have
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:51,296	| IOT099 |	Laura other networks I don't
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:52,576	| IOT099 |	Actually no
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:54,624	| IOT099 |	Nokia says are not going to be buying Spectrum
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,416	| IOT099 |	For this so
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:58,976	| IOT099 |	They're going to be grabbing Network
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:02,048	| IOT099 |	Capacity from its customers basically a service provider
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:02,560	| IOT099 |	Customers
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:06,912	| IOT099 |	Doing deals for that and then they're going to create this Global Network
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,448	| IOT099 |	Curvy large Enterprise
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:12,288	| IOT099 |	And those companies can basically go to notes
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:13,312	| IOT099 |	Kia or they can
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:14,592	| IOT099 |	It sounds like
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:17,152	| IOT099 |	Nokia will also white label this
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:19,968	| IOT099 |	For cellular providers so cellular providers
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:20,736	| IOT099 |	Can then
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:21,504	| IOT099 |	If you are like
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:24,320	| IOT099 |	A company that's doing Logistics you can actually go to you
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,088	| IOT099 |	Your carrier
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:25,856	| IOT099 |	A carrier
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:26,624	| IOT099 |	Where in say hey
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,160	| IOT099 |	Global Connect
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:33,536	| IOT099 |	And I think that's the key difference when you mention AT&T and Verizon and whatnot
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:35,072	| IOT099 |	They're not implementing anything with
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:36,096	| IOT099 |	Satellite as of yet
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:38,912	| IOT099 |	Understandable reasons given their there
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:40,448	| IOT099 |	Company focused
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:42,496	| IOT099 |	This seems to be like a
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:45,824	| IOT099 |	A solution offering where Nokia is going to say look you know
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:48,128	| IOT099 |	Doesn't matter
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:50,176	| IOT099 |	Matter what kind of data you need
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:51,456	| IOT099 |	We can offer it
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:52,736	| IOT099 |	Multiple
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:53,504	| IOT099 |	Network setup
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:55,552	| IOT099 |	What's seamless to you but
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:57,856	| IOT099 |	For us we're going to use either satellite or
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:59,648	| IOT099 |	Use cellular
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,184	| IOT099 |	So4
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:02,976	| IOT099 |	Shipping bike overseas and such
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:05,280	| IOT099 |	You know they can offer something that
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:07,840	| IOT099 |	Carriers right now don't seem to be interested in
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:10,400	| IOT099 |	Cargo ship
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:11,936	| IOT099 |	Because I think
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:12,448	| IOT099 |	It's fascinating
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:14,496	| IOT099 |	And I realize this but
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:16,288	| IOT099 |	Because the
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:17,568	| IOT099 |	Containers
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:19,360	| IOT099 |	Strapped down
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:23,200	| IOT099 |	And they're just got piled high in high seas
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:26,528	| IOT099 |	There's like a large number of them can just fall overboard
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:27,552	| IOT099 |	The shipment service
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:33,952	| IOT099 |	I was going to send this and I'm like oh
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:35,232	| IOT099 |	And you know they expected
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:36,256	| IOT099 |	Stash's Subs
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:42,912	| IOT099 |	The top of the
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,216	| IOT099 |	You could actually fight
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:46,752	| IOT099 |	Or at least see where they
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,592	| IOT099 |	Also
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:51,872	| IOT099 |	Story is
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:52,640	| IOT099 |	I tell you
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:55,200	| IOT099 |	Is also introducing
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:57,760	| IOT099 |	A network in this network is actually going to be
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:02,624	| IOT099 |	A long-distance low-power Network
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,904	| IOT099 |	It does not use cellular
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,440	| IOT099 |	It's much cheaper
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:09,536	| IOT099 |	They're working with inmarsat satellite provider in Satellite is actually
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:10,560	| IOT099 |	The backhaul for this
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:16,704	| IOT099 |	Wherever you're putting your radios
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:18,496	| IOT099 |	And then it'll talk back up to
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,776	| IOT099 |	It'll go to the internet
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,824	| IOT099 |	Through an inmarsat satellite
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:24,128	| IOT099 |	Which means you got like a Lora Network
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:24,640	| IOT099 |	Work on a ship
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:27,712	| IOT099 |	You have a Lora Network in the middle of Lake nowhere Australia
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:30,528	| IOT099 |	It's actually really cool if we actually
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:33,856	| IOT099 |	I did a story in the newsletter
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:35,904	| IOT099 |	I think it was about wiring up a volcano
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:41,024	| IOT099 |	One of the technologies that were using as Laura and
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,304	| IOT099 |	Carrabba
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,584	| IOT099 |	And
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:45,632	| IOT099 |	That might be a good solution for that
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:48,192	| IOT099 |	What's interesting is I think
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:50,240	| IOT099 |	IRT is probably one of the
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,008	| IOT099 |	Best
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:53,056	| IOT099 |	Use cases for satellite
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,592	| IOT099 |	In that
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:57,664	| IOT099 |	We've seen Satellite Communication in satellite internet
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:03,808	| IOT099 |	And so on when you're bouncing your signals up to 22,000 miles up into space and back down
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:06,624	| IOT099 |	You reduce latency right so there's a delay
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:09,696	| IOT099 |	So it's not ideal paper video conferencing
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:14,304	| IOT099 |	I might say something on a video call with you Stacy
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:17,632	| IOT099 |	And you see my lips move and then two seconds later you hear the sound
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:18,400	| IOT099 |	For example
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:21,216	| IOT099 |	But for iot it kind of doesn't matter
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,008	| IOT099 |	Right unless it's
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:27,104	| IOT099 |	Unless it's like I'm a security type thing where you need no latency
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,640	| IOT099 |	So buttfor
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:30,944	| IOT099 |	Logistics and tracking
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:32,736	| IOT099 |	Just general-purpose IBT
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:35,808	| IOT099 |	Satellite is actually probably at fantastic
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:37,344	| IOT099 |	Way to boost coverage
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:38,368	| IOT099 |	Quite honestly
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:40,672	| IOT099 |	Because there's small amounts
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:41,952	| IOT099 |	Data going
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,720	| IOT099 |	It's
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:43,488	| IOT099 |	Going to be more
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:45,792	| IOT099 |	Satellite ride terrible
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:48,352	| IOT099 |	Even easier
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:49,632	| IOT099 |	It's just
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:51,168	| IOT099 |	Function of a technology
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:52,960	| IOT099 |	I think you're right
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,776	| IOT099 |	Astute observation Kevin
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,824	| IOT099 |	That's cuz I'm on my third cup of coffee now
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:00,384	| IOT099 |	Alright let's talk
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:01,920	| IOT099 |	Let's let's move on to
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:05,760	| IOT099 |	Out of networking and let's hook up Tim Cook the CEO of Apple and how he uses
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:06,784	| IOT099 |	Homekit
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:09,600	| IOT099 |	I know that I am I'm overdue for using
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:10,624	| IOT099 |	Cancer next week
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:11,904	| IOT099 |	About that
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:12,672	| IOT099 |	But Tim Cook
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:14,720	| IOT099 |	He apparently has outfit
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:16,768	| IOT099 |	Expensive house with
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:17,280	| IOT099 |	Homekit
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,072	| IOT099 |	So he
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:20,352	| IOT099 |	He says good morning to Siri
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:21,632	| IOT099 |	And his house lights
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:23,424	| IOT099 |	And his coffee starts Brewing
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:25,984	| IOT099 |	My hunches his coffee is probably
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:27,264	| IOT099 |	We plugged into an idevice
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:32,384	| IOT099 |	I was just going to ask how you know what coffee maker is homekit compatible
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:33,152	| IOT099 |	Believe that there is
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:34,944	| IOT099 |	Do I
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:38,784	| IOT099 |	Chelsea Wenzel
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:41,088	| IOT099 |	My hunch is he's probably using a switch
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:42,880	| IOT099 |	Coffee maker is already set
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:44,672	| IOT099 |	So that's still good
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:45,952	| IOT099 |	I can't
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:47,744	| IOT099 |	Personal use that cuz I had to press a button
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:51,328	| IOT099 |	Tim Cook
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:52,096	| IOT099 |	I can probably
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:54,400	| IOT099 |	Afford it really automatically
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:57,984	| IOT099 |	I'm guessing he knows an engineer to that can help with that problem
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:00,800	| IOT099 |	Beautiful aluminium
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:02,592	| IOT099 |	Farragut
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:05,920	| IOT099 |	Jesus he's doing that he's got a
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:07,456	| IOT099 |	He sets his thermostat
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:09,760	| IOT099 |	And he also is created and I'm home command
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:11,040	| IOT099 |	Which
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:12,064	| IOT099 |	I have also created a
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:16,160	| IOT099 |	I'm his controls the lights and thermostats and window shades
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:18,976	| IOT099 |	So what I would like to see
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:20,256	| IOT099 |	Is
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:21,536	| IOT099 |	Tim Cook
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:23,328	| IOT099 |	I need to tell Siri i'm
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:25,376	| IOT099 |	Am I just going to set up a sensor
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:26,144	| IOT099 |	And when this happens
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:27,424	| IOT099 |	It's going to work
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:30,496	| IOT099 |	He does apparently use geofencing so
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:35,872	| IOT099 |	Could have that that smarts implemented at this point it's not clear from the CNET
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,896	| IOT099 |	Article interview
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:38,688	| IOT099 |	It was on
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:39,200	| IOT099 |	Conference
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:40,992	| IOT099 |	RSV
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:43,552	| IOT099 |	He's selling home
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:48,928	| IOT099 |	I use it and so should you
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:49,440	| IOT099 |	IAAI
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:53,024	| IOT099 |	All right
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:53,536	| IOT099 |	So
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:55,328	| IOT099 |	Let's get to
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:56,096	| IOT099 |	My Xperia
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:59,168	| IOT099 |	Two Networks
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:00,192	| IOT099 |	Yes
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:03,008	| IOT099 |	I talked about this a long time ago actually
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:05,056	| IOT099 |	It came up first because of the Mirai botnet
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:08,384	| IOT099 |	And I have to tell you
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:10,688	| IOT099 |	After like two and a half months and that it wasn't working
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:11,968	| IOT099 |	Religiously
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:13,760	| IOT099 |	This is not to
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:19,648	| IOT099 |	Chris AC feels the pain so you don't have to
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:21,952	| IOT099 |	So here's what I would recommend
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:23,744	| IOT099 |	Because
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:24,768	| IOT099 |	In the challenges are there
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:26,304	| IOT099 |	You don't
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:27,584	| IOT099 |	I want to control things
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:29,888	| IOT099 |	Sometimes for my smartphone
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:32,192	| IOT099 |	So my smartphone needs to be on the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:33,728	| IOT099 |	For certain
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,008	| IOT099 |	Locations to work
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:38,336	| IOT099 |	The same network that either your hub Android devices are on
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:39,616	| IOT099 |	Yes
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:42,688	| IOT099 |	So if I put everything on one network then I can't
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,200	| IOT099 |	Use my
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:44,992	| IOT099 |	My phone
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:46,784	| IOT099 |	Where if I put everything
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:52,928	| IOT099 |	Including my phone but not my computer
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,976	| IOT099 |	You could
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:59,328	| IOT099 |	If you want to put your phone on one network and a separate Network just for your
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:30:59,840	| IOT099 |	Computer
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,376	| IOT099 |	That is doable
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:03,680	| IOT099 |	You just can't use your computer frame
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:05,216	| IOT099 |	I think which is fine unless you're working
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,520	| IOT099 |	No it's actually fun
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:09,568	| IOT099 |	Unless you're pulling data
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:12,128	| IOT099 |	And that would be
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:14,432	| IOT099 |	Don't think there's
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:15,968	| IOT099 |	Else
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:16,736	| IOT099 |	If you want to login
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:25,952	| IOT099 |	So that's a possibility but then you can't do any banking or buying things on your phone you have to remember to always use your
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:26,464	| IOT099 |	Gordon quotes
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:29,536	| IOT099 |	Here's a thought you could
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:35,680	| IOT099 |	This is not ideal by any means but you could actually separate things to a point by not even having your phone on your home Wi-Fi
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:40,288	| IOT099 |	And I say that because we talked earlier about the pixel on the smart home controls
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:47,456	| IOT099 |	I actually now that I'm thinking about not have my third cup of coffee I turn my Wi-Fi off on my phone just to see if I could
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:51,040	| IOT099 |	Remotely control my WeMo switches using Voice
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:53,856	| IOT099 |	And it worked I was over in LTE network then
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:57,696	| IOT099 |	And that didn't work it was a little bit more lack of course because now you're talkin about another Network
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:32:00,256	| IOT099 |	Essentially I separated things to some degree there
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:02,560	| IOT099 |	I'm not saying this is ideal
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:03,072	| IOT099 |	Cuz it's not
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:04,352	| IOT099 |	But
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,376	| IOT099 |	But you could do it that way
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:06,400	| IOT099 |	Yes you
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:09,472	| IOT099 |	The other thing I did
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:11,008	| IOT099 |	Is
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:12,288	| IOT099 |	So so that's my idea of a guest
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:13,568	| IOT099 |	But then
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:19,200	| IOT099 |	You probably should have two guest networks you shouldn't iot Network and then your guest Network for natural gas
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:21,248	| IOT099 |	You cannot control your attitude gadgets
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:24,064	| IOT099 |	Was a terrible idea
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:24,576	| IOT099 |	And everybody
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:27,136	| IOT099 |	Yeah
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:28,928	| IOT099 |	Head okay
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:30,464	| IOT099 |	What do I most care about
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:31,232	| IOT099 |	I care about my Mikey
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:32,768	| IOT099 |	Garage door opener
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:34,304	| IOT099 |	I care about any locks
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:39,424	| IOT099 |	Z-Wave lock so I decided not to care about those but if I had like an August lock or something that talked
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:42,496	| IOT099 |	Via Bluetooth sore and then had a Wi-Fi remote
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:43,520	| IOT099 |	I might Karen
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:46,848	| IOT099 |	I care about cameras because
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:48,640	| IOT099 |	All the time
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:50,176	| IOT099 |	Manors at privacy
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:52,480	| IOT099 |	So you can
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:54,528	| IOT099 |	You can put your cameras
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:55,808	| IOT099 |	On a separate
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:02,208	| IOT099 |	You actually could put your locks I didn't try that because I don't have
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:02,720	| IOT099 |	I don't have enough
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:04,000	| IOT099 |	August Locker
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,560	| IOT099 |	Or I don't have a Wi-Fi
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:09,376	| IOT099 |	But you can't do that
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:10,912	| IOT099 |	And
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:11,680	| IOT099 |	That is
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:12,192	| IOT099 |	Les Payne
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:15,264	| IOT099 |	You're so then you would end up with
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:16,544	| IOT099 |	Basically
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:17,824	| IOT099 |	Gesnetwork
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:20,640	| IOT099 |	That has your iot devices on it
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:24,224	| IOT099 |	If you're okay with your guess having a
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:27,296	| IOT099 |	Access to the which most people would not be I wouldn't think but
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:28,832	| IOT099 |	So then you're gonna have to set up
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:33,184	| IOT099 |	Let me tell you
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:34,976	| IOT099 |	This is going to be my pro-tip
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:36,000	| IOT099 |	For everyone out there in
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:37,024	| IOT099 |	It's too late I'm sorry
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:38,304	| IOT099 |	Going forward
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:39,328	| IOT099 |	Do this
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:41,120	| IOT099 |	Use your guest Network
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:43,424	| IOT099 |	Because
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:45,984	| IOT099 |	In this day and age
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:46,496	| IOT099 |	It is silly
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:49,312	| IOT099 |	I agree
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,336	| IOT099 |	If any of your devices
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:51,360	| IOT099 |	Compromised
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:54,944	| IOT099 |	Network Bad Dudes
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:56,992	| IOT099 |	Even if it's like you're at your kids
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:59,296	| IOT099 |	I mean like I would never let my
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:01,344	| IOT099 |	Kids friends have access to my bank
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:02,624	| IOT099 |	Because oh my God
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:05,696	| IOT099 |	Their computer I barely want my daughter to have access to my
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:08,768	| IOT099 |	Computers are festering disease holes of
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:09,536	| IOT099 |	God only knows
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:14,144	| IOT099 |	Divide
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:15,936	| IOT099 |	I called this divide and fail to conquer
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:17,472	| IOT099 |	Experiment
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:17,984	| IOT099 |	Networks
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:21,312	| IOT099 |	I wonder if there is a product opportunity here
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:27,456	| IOT099 |	For improved firewalling for IRT in today's routers and War
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:28,480	| IOT099 |	A separate
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:31,552	| IOT099 |	Bridge or router specifically for IRT
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:34,624	| IOT099 |	That will only allow certain traffic to pass
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:36,928	| IOT099 |	Last week's
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:37,696	| IOT099 |	Grant night
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:38,464	| IOT099 |	What about some
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:39,232	| IOT099 |	Stuff
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:41,280	| IOT099 |	There are some routers that have
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:44,096	| IOT099 |	More transparency capabilities or the following
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:46,912	| IOT099 |	Traffic patterns of devices and then say
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:51,264	| IOT099 |	Write what I think would be really interesting
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:52,800	| IOT099 |	Is doing it at
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:54,080	| IOT099 |	Protocol
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:54,848	| IOT099 |	Also
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:57,152	| IOT099 |	Actually we've from Google is thinking about
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:01,248	| IOT099 |	It's saying hey
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:03,296	| IOT099 |	This door lock should never need to talk
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:06,880	| IOT099 |	This camera should never have to talk to
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:08,928	| IOT099 |	I actually should talk
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:09,952	| IOT099 |	Got your lights The Nest actually does
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:11,488	| IOT099 |	There's
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:13,792	| IOT099 |	A way to do it that way but it's probably kind of
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:15,072	| IOT099 |	Limited
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:20,448	| IOT099 |	I don't know
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:23,008	| IOT099 |	About that because as you were describing it
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:24,544	| IOT099 |	When I first start thinking was
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:26,848	| IOT099 |	That kind of sounds like Android app permission
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:30,688	| IOT099 |	Only it's now device level permissions from device device
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:31,712	| IOT099 |	So
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:35,808	| IOT099 |	I don't know if it would be that computer intensive I think it just needs to be done at the setup
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:36,320	| IOT099 |	Point
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:39,392	| IOT099 |	And you know and then the rules are enforced going forward
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:41,952	| IOT099 |	Yeah I'm just taking it
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:44,768	| IOT099 |	New device
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:46,560	| IOT099 |	Like let's say I set up a device
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:48,096	| IOT099 |	And it's
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:50,912	| IOT099 |	Cuz there's two way communication so
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:54,752	| IOT099 |	Then when I bring something new on the network I can set its permissions but I have to go back inside the
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:55,776	| IOT099 |	Emissions
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:57,824	| IOT099 |	I mean I can be done
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:35:59,872	| IOT099 |	One Fell Swoop I think
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:02,432	| IOT099 |	Yeah I don't I don't see why I couldn't be
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:05,504	| IOT099 |	I'm on it I'm so on it
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:08,576	| IOT099 |	I'll leave I'll need a fourth cup of coffee
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,136	| IOT099 |	Before we go
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:13,184	| IOT099 |	We should say August's has
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:16,000	| IOT099 |	Added the ability to unlock your device from your
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:18,816	| IOT099 |	Security issue
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:19,584	| IOT099 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:20,864	| IOT099 |	Holiday Inn
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:27,520	| IOT099 |	You have to tell the echo to unlock your August locks and then you have to give up
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:31,104	| IOT099 |	So
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:31,872	| IOT099 |	Simple
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:33,920	| IOT099 |	Elegant and hopefully nobody who wants to
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:35,968	| IOT099 |	Get into your house will actually
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:38,016	| IOT099 |	In the room with you when you give set
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:44,672	| IOT099 |	There is there is that but not I love this invitation I don't have an August lock
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:47,744	| IOT099 |	But I'd if I did I'd be thrilled right now because
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:51,584	| IOT099 |	I don't think any of the locks really allowed for unlocking an s
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:54,912	| IOT099 |	Again as you set a security issue udoka some anybody
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:58,240	| IOT099 |	With a voice can talk to an echo and say hey that's unlock the door
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:03,104	| IOT099 |	This ad the security Factor locking is not a problem so that's that we can all do
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:04,640	| IOT099 |	But this I think this is great
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:06,688	| IOT099 |	All right
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:07,968	| IOT099 |	Lettuce
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:10,784	| IOT099 |	Take a moment for a word from our sponsor and then after that
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:11,552	| IOT099 |	We will have
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:13,600	| IOT099 |	Jenny Fielding
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:15,136	| IOT099 |	Techstars iot accelerator
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:17,952	| IOT099 |	I want to talk about investing in the internet
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:24,864	| IOT099 |	I'll see you next week
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:31,008	| IOT099 |	Hey everyone
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:36,128	| IOT099 |	We're dropping the podcast for a message from our sponsor sponsor is spin dance
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:39,968	| IOT099 |	And I have Brian toll here who's going to tell us a little bit about spending
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:41,504	| IOT099 |	What is the thing you guys do
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:46,368	| IOT099 |	We are a full-service iot consultancy which basically means we help organization
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:47,904	| IOT099 |	Design
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:48,672	| IOT099 |	Develop
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:52,000	| IOT099 |	And manage their iot software
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:53,280	| IOT099 |	Sounds like Ford Motor Co
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:57,120	| IOT099 |	Company in Whirlpool but we also work with a lot of smaller companies and even startups
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:58,144	| IOT099 |	Okay so why would it
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:37:58,912	| IOT099 |	Company like
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:37:59,424	| IOT099 |	Ford Aurora
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:03,264	| IOT099 |	We help them develop their iot products
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:09,664	| IOT099 |	That's usually a combination of embedded cloud and mobile software it's not a typical for an organization to have one of those skills
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:13,504	| IOT099 |	But they rarely have really good iot developers in all three of those
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:16,320	| IOT099 |	And we work really hard to bring a team together that not only under
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:21,696	| IOT099 |	Stan's embedded in cloud in Mobile but knows how to work together and knows how to bring those skills into the iot
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:26,816	| IOT099 |	He space example developers aren't just great at developing apps they really
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:28,608	| IOT099 |	And how to build apps that work
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:35,008	| IOT099 |	Seamlessly with Cloud over the better software
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:36,032	| IOT099 |	The provides 24 hours
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:39,104	| IOT099 |	Yes we do have a team that provides 24/7
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:39,872	| IOT099 |	Support
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:42,432	| IOT099 |	And that's really important with with iot products
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:47,808	| IOT099 |	Cuz obviously the product is out in the field that's working want to make sure that the software that powers it
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:51,904	| IOT099 |	It is always up and running would people want to use it all right if I have software developer
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:52,416	| IOT099 |	Where is already on
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:54,208	| IOT099 |	But I still need you guys
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:56,000	| IOT099 |	Absolutely wheel of collaboration
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:58,048	| IOT099 |	We love work with other developer
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:38:59,840	| IOT099 |	We really like to work hand-in-hand
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:03,680	| IOT099 |	So just a quick story we recently developed a mobile app for a large
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:05,472	| IOT099 |	Manufacturer
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:07,008	| IOT099 |	They already had their firmware team
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:07,776	| IOT099 |	Tiemann place
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:09,568	| IOT099 |	And just needed our mobile
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:13,920	| IOT099 |	Used to work with them so we developed a great collaborative relationship to get there
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:16,736	| IOT099 |	Homekit app out the door and then into the market
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:18,784	| IOT099 |	You guys sound really smart really good
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:20,064	| IOT099 |	So you have any advice for
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:23,136	| IOT099 |	There's two common mistakes that we see a lot of organization
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:30,048	| IOT099 |	Making the first is a lot of businesses are really good about developing an iot prototype but then they don't really
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:31,840	| IOT099 |	Take the time to develop that into
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:33,888	| IOT099 |	Full-blown go-to-market app
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:36,704	| IOT099 |	Application they're forgetting things like security the forgetting
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:41,312	| IOT099 |	Software updates they haven't thought about analytics and know they're all really important things
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:43,360	| IOT099 |	To have when you go into the market
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:45,408	| IOT099 |	We take a lot of the mistakes we've seen in the
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:52,064	| IOT099 |	The Press you know the big denial-of-service attack from a couple months ago a lot of that just comes down to an experience
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:53,088	| IOT099 |	On the iot developer
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:55,136	| IOT099 |	Inside another big problem that we see
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:56,416	| IOT099 |	Is a lack of overall
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:58,976	| IOT099 |	Design we see a lot of organization
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:00,000	| IOT099 |	Dalian
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:02,048	| IOT099 |	Embedded portion of an iot app for
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:02,816	| IOT099 |	The cloud Porsche
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:04,352	| IOT099 |	Another mobile portion all in Iceland
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:06,400	| IOT099 |	And they're not thinking about the
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,424	| IOT099 |	The system design
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:09,984	| IOT099 |	That's how all these components are going to work together
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:11,008	| IOT099 |	The greatest seamless
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:12,800	| IOT099 |	Experience
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:16,896	| IOT099 |	Early everybody should that's the best way to develop iOS application
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:18,432	| IOT099 |	I'm all in
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:18,944	| IOT099 |	Your system design
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:20,224	| IOT099 |	So where can
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:20,736	| IOT099 |	People learn more

EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:47,776	| IOT099 |	We have accelerator programs which are three months
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:49,568	| IOT099 |	Mentor driven intense
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:52,384	| IOT099 |	Programs around the world so we're on
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:53,663	| IOT099 |	25 of those
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:55,199	| IOT099 |	And then we have a venture capital
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:57,247	| IOT099 |	Fondant we're on our third fun
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,015	| IOT099 |	So
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:42:00,319	| IOT099 |	We do a lot of different things that I techstars
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:02,623	| IOT099 |	And I focus on Internet of Things
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:05,951	| IOT099 |	Which means that I run accelerator program
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:08,255	| IOT099 |	An investment company is around
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:10,559	| IOT099 |	Which is awesome

EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:18,751	| IOT099 |	You just did a kind of
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:20,287	| IOT099 |	Eton College mod
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:23,359	| IOT099 |	Which means you are accepting applications for

EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:37,951	| IOT099 |	And towards the end of this interview
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:39,999	| IOT099 |	What she is
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:43,327	| IOT099 |	Specifically looking for any tips she kind of has her anyway
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:46,655	| IOT099 |	So stay tuned for that but first
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:49,215	| IOT099 |	We're going to get a sense of where we are in the
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:53,567	| IOT099 |	So what are you saying I know you've been traveling around
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:56,383	| IOT099 |	Are there big trends bubbling up
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:43:00,735	| IOT099 |	You know when we started investing in iot a few years ago
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:07,391	| IOT099 |	We were really focused on consumer because I think that that's really where the landscape was it was
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:09,183	| IOT099 |	This idea that
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:11,743	| IOT099 |	Like I like to call Tino Hardware 2.0
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:14,559	| IOT099 |	Entrepreneurs were realizing that it was
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:16,095	| IOT099 |	Buy a vault
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:19,679	| IOT099 |	But not a lot of money and not a lot of resources to actually start Hardware
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:23,007	| IOT099 |	Great rebirth
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:25,055	| IOT099 |	What are first class we had
EDL	00:43:25,055	00:43:26,335	| IOT099 |	Really cool companies
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:27,871	| IOT099 |	You might have heard of Outlet
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:29,407	| IOT099 |	Which is the baby monitor
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:34,015	| IOT099 |	Keen home which is a smart and many others we really got to understand
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:36,063	| IOT099 |	The consumer space
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:38,111	| IOT099 |	And II program
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:41,695	| IOT099 |	We decided to take some chances and really look at B2B
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:47,583	| IOT099 |	We branched out invest in a company called filament which is doing Wireless Mesh networking and
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:52,959	| IOT099 |	Chargify which is wireless charging and our last program we decided that we wanted
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:55,263	| IOT099 |	How to focus on Industrial B2B
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:56,031	| IOT099 |	We had
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:44:00,127	| IOT099 |	Companies across verticals and Healthcare construction Toc Logistics
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:01,919	| IOT099 |	But with a focus on B2B
EDL	00:44:01,919	00:44:05,759	| IOT099 |	Will be continuing that Trend in the snacks are 4th program
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:08,063	| IOT099 |	Focused again on B2B and Industrial
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:09,343	| IOT099 |	So it's
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:14,463	| IOT099 |	Breakfast down because this is something you know why I say that this is the Internet of Things podcast but
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:17,023	| IOT099 |	There is definitely the smart home I think of
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:22,399	| IOT099 |	Industrial being Factory in that sort of thing but then I also think of Enterprise and that be
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:24,191	| IOT099 |	Hill Campus building management
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:27,007	| IOT099 |	Happy Workforce things Fleet Logistics
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:28,287	| IOT099 |	And then maybe there's Medical
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:31,359	| IOT099 |	When I try to start classifying this stuff I'm like
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:34,431	| IOT099 |	So do you have a class B
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:36,479	| IOT099 |	Vacation kind of system that you're thinking of
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:37,503	| IOT099 |	And working from
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:41,855	| IOT099 |	What's a really interesting point I think you know iot
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:44,415	| IOT099 |	Is really morphing into you no internet
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:46,719	| IOT099 |	Of everything and so at you know I kind of joke
EDL	00:44:47,231	00:44:50,303	| IOT099 |	The people that I hope that I will be out of a job in
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:51,327	| IOT099 |	2 years because
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:57,983	| IOT099 |	To three years because we won't really be calling things iot anymore will just be calling them things
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:45:00,031	| IOT099 |	In the same way that you know
EDL	00:45:00,543	00:45:03,359	| IOT099 |	Mobile was a vertical oin vest
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:04,127	| IOT099 |	In Mobile
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:06,175	| IOT099 |	Now people don't really say that because everything
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:07,967	| IOT099 |	Thing is mobile so we see that as it can
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:13,599	| IOT099 |	And that iot is really in fuses all areas of our lives so
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:15,391	| IOT099 |	In fact. I also joke
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:19,999	| IOT099 |	People say well how many iot companies has techstars invested in I say
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:21,023	| IOT099 |	Well between
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:23,839	| IOT099 |	60 and 75 depending on how you
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:25,375	| IOT099 |	Define iot that day
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:27,935	| IOT099 |	What kind of go into this idea of
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:29,471	| IOT099 |	Security
EDL	00:45:29,471	00:45:31,007	| IOT099 |	Because I think it's
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:33,823	| IOT099 |	He's one of those Technologies we're still not sure how we're going to
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:35,103	| IOT099 |	Scale security
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:35,615	| IOT099 |	For the internet
EDL	00:45:36,639	00:45:40,223	| IOT099 |	So are you seeing anything particularly novel or exciting
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:40,735	| IOT099 |	Happening there
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:45,087	| IOT099 |	Well you know I think the the two barriers were
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:49,439	| IOT099 |	What's an iot you to me are around interoperability and security
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:51,231	| IOT099 |	Before we see you know why
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:52,255	| IOT099 |	Brad adoption
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:58,655	| IOT099 |	But interesting Lee I'm not seeing a ton of startups work on this and so it's it's something that I always talk about
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:45:59,935	| IOT099 |	Kind of in my newsletter when
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:03,263	| IOT099 |	I'm speaking as likes to have to be more startups that are working on
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:04,031	| IOT099 |	Security
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:05,055	| IOT099 |	So much
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:07,359	| IOT099 |	Focus on on Cyber
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:13,247	| IOT099 |	But really that intersection of actual physical product and cyber we haven't seen a ton
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:14,527	| IOT099 |	So yeah there are cement
EDL	00:46:14,527	00:46:18,367	| IOT099 |	Purchasing companies working on it there's a few in Israel that I recently met
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:22,975	| IOT099 |	But definitely not enough so I think it's a huge area of opportunity for startups
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:28,863	| IOT099 |	And then the other is the operability and I'm not sure that startups are going to figure that out or
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:31,935	| IOT099 |	If it's really about standards that larger companies
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:37,055	| IOT099 |	Whether it's Google or Amazon are going to sort out but definitely something that needs
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:38,591	| IOT099 |	To be handled I think
EDL	00:46:38,591	00:46:41,407	| IOT099 |	In order for consumers to have
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:44,223	| IOT099 |	Really seamless experience with iot
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:45,503	| IOT099 |	Right now you here a lot
EDL	00:46:46,015	00:46:48,831	| IOT099 |	People talking while it's not the smart home it's the dumb home
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:55,231	| IOT099 |	Because things aren't really working with each other and you know I think that you're going to see a continuation of that skepticism until
EDL	00:46:55,231	00:46:57,279	| IOT099 |	We sort out some of those fundamental shoes
EDL	00:46:57,791	00:46:59,839	| IOT099 |	Is true although voices Bender
EDL	00:47:00,351	00:47:01,375	| IOT099 |	Unifier for a lot of
EDL	00:47:01,887	00:47:04,447	| IOT099 |	Even though it's like an overlay on top of
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:07,519	| IOT099 |	Many many standard herbs but yes it's it's
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:09,567	| IOT099 |	I should ask you
EDL	00:47:09,567	00:47:11,359	| IOT099 |	You actually about voice because
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:13,407	| IOT099 |	Just like you were mentioning mobile like I invest
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:18,271	| IOT099 |	It feels like we went from a mobile-first and we're now moving into this concept of
EDL	00:47:18,271	00:47:19,039	| IOT099 |	Voice first
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:22,367	| IOT099 |	And that's going to affect things like how we decide
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:24,159	| IOT099 |	Build stuff
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:26,975	| IOT099 |	And I am very curious have you seen any
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:27,487	| IOT099 |	Companies
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:30,047	| IOT099 |	Doing stuff there did you guys have any
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:30,559	| IOT099 |	Companies doing stuff
EDL	00:47:31,327	00:47:37,727	| IOT099 |	You know we are actually running a program in conjunction with Amazon call the Alexa accelerator specifically
EDL	00:47:37,727	00:47:39,263	| IOT099 |	Play to explore areas
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:40,543	| IOT099 |	With invoice so
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:44,127	| IOT099 |	It's an area that I think it's about being in that we're really interested in
EDL	00:47:44,127	00:47:50,015	| IOT099 |	I think there's an overlay between the automation we've seen kind of in the bot world
EDL	00:47:50,015	00:47:52,063	| IOT099 |	And the boys world
EDL	00:47:52,063	00:47:58,463	| IOT099 |	We're seeing all of those Technologies now come together but I think you're right it is the next Evolution from
EDL	00:47:58,463	00:47:59,231	| IOT099 |	Mobility
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:05,631	| IOT099 |	So seen a lot of companies I haven't invested in any of them yet and it's definitely an area that were interested in forearm
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:08,191	| IOT099 |	Moving to a voice first world
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:09,983	| IOT099 |	What are some of the challenges
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:10,495	| IOT099 |	That you see
EDL	00:48:11,007	00:48:13,311	| IOT099 |	For example I feel like we don't really have
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:19,711	| IOT099 |	Pinch-to-zoom for Boise is how I think of it but like accepted that goes across all platforms
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:21,247	| IOT099 |	Talk to something
EDL	00:48:21,247	00:48:22,015	| IOT099 |	Which means
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:23,807	| IOT099 |	It's really hard still
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:26,111	| IOT099 |	Command things via voice cuz it's not quite natural
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:29,951	| IOT099 |	So that's one and I don't know what other kind of challenges there might
EDL	00:48:30,719	00:48:32,767	| IOT099 |	Especially if you're talking about bring it to the Enterprise
EDL	00:48:32,767	00:48:38,911	| IOT099 |	But I think that you know natural language hasn't exactly become a norm yet right and so
EDL	00:48:39,935	00:48:40,959	| IOT099 |	You're Siri
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:45,055	| IOT099 |	Isn't always giving you exactly what you need and so if I know
EDL	00:48:45,055	00:48:48,639	| IOT099 |	In the consumer space I think it's probably okay but
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:52,223	| IOT099 |	You know that those nuances with natural language processing
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:54,527	| IOT099 |	Think have to come to bear before week
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:48:58,879	| IOT099 |	Can apply them effectively in the industrial space right if you think about
EDL	00:48:59,391	00:49:01,439	| IOT099 |	Voice operating an airplane
EDL	00:49:01,439	00:49:05,023	| IOT099 |	Right you want to be pretty sure that the commands are correct
EDL	00:49:05,535	00:49:11,679	| IOT099 |	I think those are some of the challenges we'll see when it comes to us a self-driving cars or
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:13,983	| IOT099 |	Or planes are or things like that
EDL	00:49:13,983	00:49:16,287	| IOT099 |	A lack of trust
EDL	00:49:16,287	00:49:19,359	| IOT099 |	It's kind of been one of the issues that that I stay with us
EDL	00:49:22,687	00:49:23,711	| IOT099 |	Or just
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:24,479	| IOT099 |	Step 2 platform
EDL	00:49:24,991	00:49:25,759	| IOT099 |	Robust enough
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:26,271	| IOT099 |	Yeah
EDL	00:49:28,575	00:49:30,367	| IOT099 |	There's a natural Caden
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:32,159	| IOT099 |	That leads us from start to
EDL	00:49:32,159	00:49:33,439	| IOT099 |	Definition of conversation
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:35,999	| IOT099 |	And can the chat replicate that
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:39,839	| IOT099 |	Think that were close but we're not exactly there
EDL	00:49:39,839	00:49:45,983	| IOT099 |	Enzo again like in the consumer space I think we know we're probably okay for assisting our virtual assistant screw that up
EDL	00:49:46,495	00:49:49,055	| IOT099 |	But you know in the in the business
EDL	00:49:49,055	00:49:51,871	| IOT099 |	Arena I think that the implications can be
EDL	00:49:53,151	00:49:54,687	| IOT099 |	So that makes me a little bit
EDL	00:49:54,687	00:49:55,967	| IOT099 |	A little bit nervous
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:58,015	| IOT099 |	Okay so you guys are in
EDL	00:49:58,015	00:50:02,623	| IOT099 |	New York and they're iot kind of hubs all around the country and all around the world
EDL	00:50:03,135	00:50:04,415	| IOT099 |	What do you think makes a
EDL	00:50:04,415	00:50:05,183	| IOT099 |	Good
EDL	00:50:05,183	00:50:05,695	| IOT099 |	Iot
EDL	00:50:06,207	00:50:09,535	| IOT099 |	That's a great question and one I'm exploring right now I'm on a
EDL	00:50:09,535	00:50:11,839	| IOT099 |	A pretty big trip around the world
EDL	00:50:11,839	00:50:15,423	| IOT099 |	What are places that I am spending a lot of time with
EDL	00:50:15,423	00:50:17,215	| IOT099 |	These days is in Germany
EDL	00:50:17,215	00:50:20,031	| IOT099 |	And specifically in Berlin and Munich
EDL	00:50:20,031	00:50:21,055	| IOT099 |	Sing a lot
EDL	00:50:21,567	00:50:22,847	| IOT099 |	Start up there and I think
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:23,615	| IOT099 |	Part of it has
EDL	00:50:23,615	00:50:25,919	| IOT099 |	To do with you know kind of legacy
EDL	00:50:25,919	00:50:28,991	| IOT099 |	Industries in those areas right and so
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:32,063	| IOT099 |	If you're looking at industrial iot for example
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:38,463	| IOT099 |	A lot of people there who have a lot of experience in industrial sectors because of them being
EDL	00:50:38,463	00:50:41,791	| IOT099 |	So prevalent they are so whether it's Mobility weather is factories
EDL	00:50:42,303	00:50:46,655	| IOT099 |	You know we're seeing a lot of interesting companies come out of those areas so I think that's
EDL	00:50:46,655	00:50:48,447	| IOT099 |	Something to look at
EDL	00:50:48,447	00:50:51,775	| IOT099 |	That's one of the reasons that I'm excited about New York if you think
EDL	00:50:51,775	00:50:54,079	| IOT099 |	The history of manufacturing and
EDL	00:50:54,079	00:50:58,175	| IOT099 |	Everything that's happened you know in New Jersey and and places like that
EDL	00:50:59,199	00:51:01,759	| IOT099 |	Make sense that New York would bubble up
EDL	00:51:01,759	00:51:03,807	| IOT099 |	As being in a place where
EDL	00:51:03,807	00:51:05,087	| IOT099 |	Iot startups
EDL	00:51:05,087	00:51:05,855	| IOT099 |	Get some tracks
EDL	00:51:06,623	00:51:13,023	| IOT099 |	So you know PCB boards are actually built you know across the way in New Jersey so just makes a ton of sense
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:15,583	| IOT099 |	To see those communities pop up here
EDL	00:51:15,583	00:51:19,423	| IOT099 |	But you know he's obviously see large Pockets out on the West Coast
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:24,287	| IOT099 |	Or staying a little bit and where you are in Austin and indefinitely we always
EDL	00:51:24,287	00:51:26,591	| IOT099 |	I'm from the Midwest
EDL	00:51:27,871	00:51:33,503	| IOT099 |	So it sounds like you need some sort of maybe manufacturing experience or history
EDL	00:51:34,015	00:51:37,343	| IOT099 |	You probably need do you need venture capital or do you need
EDL	00:51:37,855	00:51:39,647	| IOT099 |	Big Partners to test out
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:40,159	| IOT099 |	Concept
EDL	00:51:41,183	00:51:45,023	| IOT099 |	I think that Venture when it comes to hardware and iot
EDL	00:51:45,023	00:51:51,167	| IOT099 |	Is pretty specific and yes you need you need that Capital but I don't think you need to be around that capital
EDL	00:51:51,679	00:51:52,447	| IOT099 |	Sentara Leigh
EDL	00:51:52,447	00:51:56,799	| IOT099 |	I think that Venture investors who are interested in those spaces are used
EDL	00:51:56,799	00:51:59,103	| IOT099 |	Two traveling around quite a bit
EDL	00:51:59,103	00:52:00,127	| IOT099 |	To invest in
EDL	00:52:00,127	00:52:06,527	| IOT099 |	Companies where they see it you know the good ecosystem but you know like all startups having access to engineer's and
EDL	00:52:06,527	00:52:08,319	| IOT099 |	You know if you have a hardware device
EDL	00:52:08,319	00:52:14,463	| IOT099 |	You also need electrical engineering industrial designers you know those things are pretty specific
EDL	00:52:14,463	00:52:18,559	| IOT099 |	With startups because one of the things especially as we move into Industrial
EDL	00:52:19,071	00:52:19,839	| IOT099 |	Is it
EDL	00:52:19,839	00:52:24,191	| IOT099 |	A challenge for them or how should they think about selling to these mammoth
EDL	00:52:24,191	00:52:25,471	| IOT099 |	Companies because if I am
EDL	00:52:25,983	00:52:28,287	| IOT099 |	If my job is making turbines
EDL	00:52:28,287	00:52:29,567	| IOT099 |	I want to work with the
EDL	00:52:29,567	00:52:30,335	| IOT099 |	The company that I
EDL	00:52:30,335	00:52:31,871	| IOT099 |	Entrust is supposed to
EDL	00:52:32,383	00:52:33,151	| IOT099 |	A startup
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:34,431	| IOT099 |	So how are they navigating
EDL	00:52:35,455	00:52:36,991	| IOT099 |	Bad customer acquisition
EDL	00:52:38,015	00:52:39,039	| IOT099 |	Yeah that is X
EDL	00:52:39,039	00:52:45,439	| IOT099 |	Play great question it's when we thought about you know quite a bit so we're on our first iot program
EDL	00:52:45,439	00:52:49,023	| IOT099 |	We only ran them with one corporate partner what we realized is that
EDL	00:52:49,023	00:52:54,655	| IOT099 |	Iot is very specific and has a lot of challenges especially if you're developing Hardware firmware
EDL	00:52:54,655	00:52:55,679	| IOT099 |	Software all
EDL	00:52:55,679	00:52:57,727	| IOT099 |	Solitaire elements and so
EDL	00:52:57,727	00:53:03,615	| IOT099 |	We think that surrounding startups with corporate Partners who can provide guidance to the startups and also
EDL	00:53:03,615	00:53:06,431	| IOT099 |	Partner with them early on give them a sense of
EDL	00:53:06,431	00:53:09,247	| IOT099 |	Legitimacy in the market can be super helpful
EDL	00:53:09,247	00:53:12,831	| IOT099 |	We think that partnering with corporates
EDL	00:53:12,831	00:53:19,231	| IOT099 |	One way to do it and you see a lot of the accelerators whether it's xlerator has partnered with BMW Mini
EDL	00:53:19,231	00:53:23,071	| IOT099 |	For their program or you know there's there's so many other one
EDL	00:53:23,071	00:53:25,375	| IOT099 |	And it's very complimentary
EDL	00:53:25,375	00:53:30,239	| IOT099 |	In our program one of our startups did a white paper and with PWC
EDL	00:53:30,239	00:53:31,263	| IOT099 |	Answer that brought down
EDL	00:53:32,031	00:53:35,359	| IOT099 |	Kind of a sense of credibility that then they were able to go out
EDL	00:53:35,359	00:53:38,175	| IOT099 |	An approaching very large construction companies
EDL	00:53:38,175	00:53:39,711	| IOT099 |	And during the program
EDL	00:53:39,711	00:53:44,063	| IOT099 |	This company called pillar was able to get a signed pilot
EDL	00:53:44,063	00:53:46,879	| IOT099 |	Done a lot of that
EDL	00:53:46,879	00:53:49,439	| IOT099 |	Do with the credibility that PWC was able to bring them
EDL	00:53:49,951	00:53:50,463	| IOT099 |	Nice
EDL	00:53:50,975	00:53:54,559	| IOT099 |	And I do like in this could be just strong
EDL	00:53:54,559	00:53:57,631	| IOT099 |	I feel like there's a lot more strategic investing
EDL	00:53:58,655	00:54:00,959	| IOT099 |	Kind of Enterprise in industrial iot
EDL	00:54:01,727	00:54:03,263	| IOT099 |	I think that's exactly right
EDL	00:54:03,263	00:54:03,775	| IOT099 |	Again
EDL	00:54:04,287	00:54:08,895	| IOT099 |	Very hard Industries need a lot of capital to scale
EDL	00:54:08,895	00:54:14,015	| IOT099 |	And I'm just make sense so one of our portfolio company is still a man
EDL	00:54:14,015	00:54:19,903	| IOT099 |	They had a proper venture-capital lead for their last round but they also had Verizon
EDL	00:54:19,903	00:54:20,671	| IOT099 |	Samsung
EDL	00:54:20,671	00:54:21,695	| IOT099 |	Participate
EDL	00:54:21,695	00:54:28,095	| IOT099 |	Because those Partners can really help give them the scale and the distribution so we are seeing you know a lot
EDL	00:54:28,095	00:54:28,863	| IOT099 |	A lot of that
EDL	00:54:28,863	00:54:32,703	| IOT099 |	If you look at Siemens and their Venture group next47
EDL	00:54:32,703	00:54:35,007	| IOT099 |	Bashas Venture group GE
EDL	00:54:35,007	00:54:38,079	| IOT099 |	These are very large large organizations
EDL	00:54:38,079	00:54:42,687	| IOT099 |	And it just makes a lot of sense for them to be partnering with earlier stage companies
EDL	00:54:43,711	00:54:45,759	| IOT099 |	And what about exits so
EDL	00:54:45,759	00:54:47,039	| IOT099 |	Who is buying these
EDL	00:54:47,039	00:54:47,551	| IOT099 |	Companies
EDL	00:54:48,319	00:54:53,695	| IOT099 |	And are they going public is it again int such a huge space so it could differ unlike consumers I look
EDL	00:54:53,695	00:54:54,463	| IOT099 |	Look at Fitbit and GoPro
EDL	00:54:55,231	00:54:57,023	| IOT099 |	I'm just curious your thoughts
EDL	00:54:58,815	00:55:04,959	| IOT099 |	Yeah well I mean we saw it last year was one of the best years for m&a iot in fact
EDL	00:55:04,959	00:55:09,567	| IOT099 |	IRT was help driving all of m&a activity across stack
EDL	00:55:09,567	00:55:10,335	| IOT099 |	That's really
EDL	00:55:10,335	00:55:11,359	| IOT099 |	Interesting but
EDL	00:55:11,359	00:55:17,759	| IOT099 |	You know Verizon was super busy spending billions of dollars on very Solutions everything from Smart cities
EDL	00:55:17,759	00:55:18,783	| IOT099 |	Mobility
EDL	00:55:18,783	00:55:19,551	| IOT099 |	Wifi
EDL	00:55:20,063	00:55:20,831	| IOT099 |	Hugo Boss
EDL	00:55:20,831	00:55:23,135	| IOT099 |	NGE were equally as busy
EDL	00:55:23,135	00:55:29,023	| IOT099 |	With purchases so I think that there is real opportunity on that side you know these large company is
EDL	00:55:29,535	00:55:35,679	| IOT099 |	They can't move fast enough they really need startups and then I'll take a position is the top-of-the-line for all of them
EDL	00:55:37,471	00:55:42,335	| IOT099 |	I feel like 2017 is going to be kind of maybe.
EDL	00:55:42,335	00:55:44,383	| IOT099 |	Although I like the sound of that in a headline
EDL	00:55:44,383	00:55:47,711	| IOT099 |	I think there's going to be a lot of companies that are kind of going to go by the wayside
EDL	00:55:48,479	00:55:54,879	| IOT099 |	And I think there's going to be a lot of m&a especially on the consumer side cuz we're seeing the end of a cycle that started probably in Twin
EDL	00:55:54,879	00:55:56,159	| IOT099 |	2013 and 2012
EDL	00:55:56,671	00:56:01,791	| IOT099 |	So I'm just curious what you think we'll see in 2017 for kind of m&a
EDL	00:56:02,303	00:56:04,863	| IOT099 |	Even maybe the end of some businesses
EDL	00:56:04,863	00:56:08,959	| IOT099 |	Yeah Minnesota it's a great point I think investors rushed in
EDL	00:56:08,959	00:56:15,103	| IOT099 |	About three years ago into Hardware people that had no experience investing in Hardware iot
EDL	00:56:15,103	00:56:21,247	| IOT099 |	But you know got excited by Kickstarter got excited by you know a lot of the consumer companies that were coming
EDL	00:56:21,759	00:56:24,063	| IOT099 |	And then had a little bit of a
EDL	00:56:24,063	00:56:26,623	| IOT099 |	A shock when they realized how hard
EDL	00:56:26,623	00:56:27,647	| IOT099 |	How hard it is
EDL	00:56:27,647	00:56:30,207	| IOT099 |	Hardware company how much capital
EDL	00:56:30,207	00:56:33,791	| IOT099 |	How difficult it can be coming up with new products
EDL	00:56:34,303	00:56:36,607	| IOT099 |	Betty facturing in places like China
EDL	00:56:36,607	00:56:39,935	| IOT099 |	All the difficulties in so I think we've seen a real retraction
EDL	00:56:39,935	00:56:46,335	| IOT099 |	Which is actually good like the Venture capitalists who are really focused on it and know the market will double down and
EDL	00:56:46,335	00:56:50,175	| IOT099 |	And everyone else will it will kind of go away so unfortunately for us
EDL	00:56:50,175	00:56:51,455	| IOT099 |	Nars there has been
EDL	00:56:51,455	00:56:55,295	| IOT099 |	You know somewhat less Capital especially in the seed stage
EDL	00:56:55,807	00:57:00,671	| IOT099 |	Or those early-stage hardware and iot companies as compared to a few years ago
EDL	00:57:01,183	00:57:07,327	| IOT099 |	But I think that's okay I think that we don't need tons of me-too products and useless gadgets
EDL	00:57:07,327	00:57:10,655	| IOT099 |	I'm really want to be funding on spinners that are
EDL	00:57:10,655	00:57:15,007	| IOT099 |	Breaking barriers innovating and really thinking about what snack so
EDL	00:57:15,007	00:57:19,871	| IOT099 |	In 2017 I think we're all very excited about you no autonomy and how that will impact
EDL	00:57:20,383	00:57:21,663	| IOT099 |	Things like cars
EDL	00:57:21,663	00:57:26,783	| IOT099 |	Airplanes I'm personally very excited about Healthcare I think there's still a lot to be done
EDL	00:57:26,783	00:57:28,063	| IOT099 |	In Elder Care
EDL	00:57:28,063	00:57:32,927	| IOT099 |	Excetera and I think that coyote you have a a big place to play with in that
EDL	00:57:32,927	00:57:39,327	| IOT099 |	And again you know I hope we see some more Securities company is popping up that are working with an iot because
EDL	00:57:39,327	00:57:40,863	| IOT099 |	I think there's a huge opportunity there
EDL	00:57:40,863	00:57:43,423	| IOT099 |	Which is
EDL	00:57:43,423	00:57:46,239	| IOT099 |	For your application process which again
EDL	00:57:46,751	00:57:48,287	| IOT099 |	You should remind us of the day
EDL	00:57:48,287	00:57:49,311	| IOT099 |	Tell us
EDL	00:57:49,311	00:57:50,335	| IOT099 |	What are you looking for
EDL	00:57:51,103	00:57:57,503	| IOT099 |	Yeah I mean as I said earlier we really look across vertical so we'll look at everything from Healthcare to robot
EDL	00:57:57,503	00:57:59,807	| IOT099 |	RX AR & VR
EDL	00:57:59,807	00:58:02,111	| IOT099 |	Home automation construction tok
EDL	00:58:02,879	00:58:06,207	| IOT099 |	Industry 4.0 the really crossword of goals
EDL	00:58:06,207	00:58:08,767	| IOT099 |	We're really looking for passionate entrepreneurs
EDL	00:58:09,279	00:58:13,631	| IOT099 |	If we look back at the Sphero example not everyone knows but they started
EDL	00:58:14,143	00:58:17,727	| IOT099 |	Their Journey at techstars as a garage door opener
EDL	00:58:17,727	00:58:20,031	| IOT099 |	So we know that products
EDL	00:58:20,031	00:58:25,919	| IOT099 |	Come and go and change but the entrepreneurs and the passion is what stays the same so we're just looking for awesome entrepreneurs
