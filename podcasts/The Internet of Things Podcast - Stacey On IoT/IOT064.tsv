EDL	00:00:08,704	00:00:11,264	| IOT064 |	Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:00:13,568	00:00:14,592	| IOT064 |	And this is your co-host
EDL	00:00:15,104	00:00:15,872	| IOT064 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:18,432	00:00:19,712	| IOT064 |	We are going to be talking about
EDL	00:00:20,224	00:00:21,248	| IOT064 |	Specifications
EDL	00:00:22,528	00:00:24,320	| IOT064 |	Apple's home and homekit
EDL	00:00:24,320	00:00:25,856	| IOT064 |	Changes from actually last week
EDL	00:00:26,368	00:00:29,184	| IOT064 |	Samsung investing a lot of money in The Internet of Things
EDL	00:00:29,184	00:00:29,952	| IOT064 |	In
EDL	00:00:29,952	00:00:31,232	| IOT064 |	Possibly Elon Musk
EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:32,768	| IOT064 |	Crazy new idea
EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:36,352	| IOT064 |	We're also after that going to have our guests who is Matt
EDL	00:00:36,864	00:00:38,144	| IOT064 |	A first capital
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:39,680	| IOT064 |	Talk about
EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:41,728	| IOT064 |	Finding money for your iot startup
EDL	00:00:44,288	00:00:45,056	| IOT064 |	Supposed to be
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:45,568	| IOT064 |	Enthusiastic
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:51,200	| IOT064 |	Extremely difficult after Korean BBQ and karaoke in New York City
EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:53,248	| IOT064 |	Goldie got half of
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:57,600	| IOT064 |	Fairy guy
EDL	00:00:57,600	00:00:58,112	| IOT064 |	I'm pretty sure
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:00,160	| IOT064 |	Let's hope so
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:04,768	| IOT064 |	There will be no singing on the show don't worry
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:07,072	| IOT064 |	No I'm all sung out trust me
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:08,352	| IOT064 |	What's your go-to
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:16,032	| IOT064 |	I don't have one because I don't do karaoke so I got roped into this last night and fairness that the team did
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:17,824	| IOT064 |	Choose several Beatles songs in
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:18,848	| IOT064 |	On my behalf
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:19,872	| IOT064 |	Appreciate that immensely
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:22,176	| IOT064 |	Next I still can't sing but I do appreciate
EDL	00:01:22,688	00:01:23,200	| IOT064 |	I also
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:25,504	| IOT064 |	I'm with you I do not have a
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:27,552	| IOT064 |	So all right
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:28,576	| IOT064 |	Let's talk about Pluto
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:30,368	| IOT064 |	Yes
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:30,880	| IOT064 |	Last
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:32,416	| IOT064 |	They
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:33,184	| IOT064 |	Announce
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:34,976	| IOT064 |	Said they were going to do their Bluetooth
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:36,000	| IOT064 |	Five Points
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:36,512	| IOT064 |	Oh
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:38,048	| IOT064 |	Beijing the Sig
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:39,584	| IOT064 |	The special in
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:44,704	| IOT064 |	There's a respect you special interest groups that actually
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:45,984	| IOT064 |	Like is a special entry
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:48,800	| IOT064 |	But my interests align with these guys soap
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:49,824	| IOT064 |	I like this
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:50,848	| IOT064 |	I don't know
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:51,872	| IOT064 |	Some of the standard things
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:55,200	| IOT064 |	Is that really good for us what will that mean for users
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:58,528	| IOT064 |	Let's go
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:00,576	| IOT064 |	A little bit
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,416	| IOT064 |	4.
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:08,000	| IOT064 |	To I believe and so they decided that
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:08,512	| IOT064 |	The four dots
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,816	| IOT064 |	We're done with the forced removal
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:11,840	| IOT064 |	So
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:16,960	| IOT064 |	This is also Bluetooth low energy so the Bluetooth 5 is going to work over Bluetooth low energy
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:17,984	| IOT064 |	Which is
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:20,288	| IOT064 |	Good in that used to be called Bluetooth
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,056	| IOT064 |	Smart in case any
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,104	| IOT064 |	Oh
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:27,456	| IOT064 |	A couple name changes yeah
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:32,064	| IOT064 |	And we all kept calling a Bluetooth low energy cuz I was supposed to
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:32,832	| IOT064 |	Feature in Fallujah
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:34,624	| IOT064 |	Mysmartmove
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:35,648	| IOT064 |	Exactly
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:38,464	| IOT064 |	You're at least three-quarters of a
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,744	| IOT064 |	Mostly I mostly
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,536	| IOT064 |	Alright so
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,048	| IOT064 |	Here's what you need to know
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:43,328	| IOT064 |	Basically
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,120	| IOT064 |	Increase the distance
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,168	| IOT064 |	So now we're talking about from
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,960	| IOT064 |	Right now it's about 30 to 50
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:51,264	| IOT064 |	And it's going to go to 200
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:57,920	| IOT064 |	Enough to cover your house cuz right now at last week when we talk about these light bulbs that ran Bluetooth
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:02,016	| IOT064 |	You know if I'm downstairs in the light bulbs on my roof
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,040	| IOT064 |	I don't have the mesh Network
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:08,160	| IOT064 |	That's like theoretical best possible case
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:12,256	| IOT064 |	Strangers I don't I wouldn't want people thinking you can literally be 200 meters away
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:14,816	| IOT064 |	Maybe in an open field with no other radio interference
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:21,728	| IOT064 |	Eat while you're going through that's going to hurt your signal cell rearrange
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:23,776	| IOT064 |	It's still good though
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:29,408	| IOT064 |	The other thing is speed
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:32,224	| IOT064 |	We conferred sending one megabit per second data rate
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:33,248	| IOT064 |	To 2 megabits per
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,064	| IOT064 |	Which means you can send more information over
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,624	| IOT064 |	You're still need to be able to transfer
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,392	| IOT064 |	Free HD movie
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,440	| IOT064 |	Yuan
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:41,952	| IOT064 |	Do that
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:43,744	| IOT064 |	Try but you
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:45,536	| IOT064 |	So
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:48,608	| IOT064 |	That's good news I think that more is like a
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,376	| IOT064 |	Kokua file sharing
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,728	| IOT064 |	Yeah I mean it's
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,520	| IOT064 |	Obviously iot devices
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:59,616	| IOT064 |	She has small bits of data are obviously covered here so
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,408	| IOT064 |	I'm trying to think of a smart home
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,432	| IOT064 |	Perspective
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:03,712	| IOT064 |	For maybe and I am
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:06,784	| IOT064 |	Industrial perspective what you might want to be sunny
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,600	| IOT064 |	Good chunk of pipe there
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:12,416	| IOT064 |	It is I mean you probably going to send
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:13,440	| IOT064 |	Video but maybe
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:14,720	| IOT064 |	Still
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,512	| IOT064 |	Yeah that that could work
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:18,303	| IOT064 |	You know just images
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:20,351	| IOT064 |	Snapshots you know a JPEG file
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:23,935	| IOT064 |	Not super high-resolution yeah
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,215	| IOT064 |	That would happen in a second or two
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:26,239	| IOT064 |	So
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,055	| IOT064 |	We'll see how people
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:29,823	| IOT064 |	Use it
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:32,895	| IOT064 |	Is in this is the big deal thing
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,687	| IOT064 |	I'm just saying is
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:37,247	| IOT064 |	When you're broadcasting data over Bluetooth
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,527	| IOT064 |	It supports more data
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,063	| IOT064 |	So
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:44,159	| IOT064 |	What's Happening Here is instead of just like it's it's mostly for Beacon
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,183	| IOT064 |	So instead of saying
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:49,791	| IOT064 |	Now it's going to say things like
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,815	| IOT064 |	Here's a URL
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:52,607	| IOT064 |	I'm here you're so other day that you might
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:53,887	| IOT064 |	Your side still that I can
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,703	| IOT064 |	Physical Webster
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,471	| IOT064 |	Physical web
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,519	| IOT064 |	Is kind of the first thing I thought of
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:01,311	| IOT064 |	Is Google is Google actually isn't ever
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:04,895	| IOT064 |	We should mention that Kevin works for Google
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,407	| IOT064 |	Yes
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,431	| IOT064 |	Chrome
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:11,295	| IOT064 |	At work on Android for work but I will mention
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:17,183	| IOT064 |	Yesterday as I was walking around the office in New York City I did get a little pop up about Peter the physical web next
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:17,951	| IOT064 |	Nearby
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:20,767	| IOT064 |	I couldn't find it so I must walk too fast or too far but
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:22,559	| IOT064 |	Devastating
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:31,519	| IOT064 |	I should have just went retraced my steps and everything else was on the way to a meeting in like I missed it.
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,287	| IOT064 |	That I don't know I'll never know
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,103	| IOT064 |	Inside
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,639	| IOT064 |	The idea is
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:40,479	| IOT064 |	He would walk by something like maybe you're waiting for a train or
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:41,503	| IOT064 |	You know an office
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:46,367	| IOT064 |	It'll pop up hey there's a physical weathering and you click on the link
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:50,719	| IOT064 |	And it'll give you information so if it's a train station it's going to send you to like
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:54,047	| IOT064 |	Oh you're next trains could be at this time here's all this other relevant information
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:06:00,959	| IOT064 |	So it's just an easy way to give you information about the world around you that you may not otherwise be able to fight
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:05,311	| IOT064 |	Dad's in this is one of the key things I've always said with iot and smart devices it has contacts
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:08,127	| IOT064 |	Use your walking past something you may not even know that you're walking
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:08,895	| IOT064 |	Cast it
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:13,503	| IOT064 |	Something may get pushed to you to let you know that you're walking past something that may be interesting
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,527	| IOT064 |	Are useful to you
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:16,319	| IOT064 |	Now the downside to all of this
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,087	| IOT064 |	This is advertisers
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:20,159	| IOT064 |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,207	| IOT064 |	There's pros and cons
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:24,255	| IOT064 |	We'll have to see much like the internet
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:27,839	| IOT064 |	We will just have to see how people use this because
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:30,143	| IOT064 |	I really don't want
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:31,423	| IOT064 |	To be bombarded with
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:33,727	| IOT064 |	All these ads now you do have to have an app
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,007	| IOT064 |	That reads
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,799	| IOT064 |	You know the beacons
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:39,103	| IOT064 |	So this isn't like your phone is suddenly going to
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,663	| IOT064 |	Well
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:44,223	| IOT064 |	You're mostly right I think but see
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:48,319	| IOT064 |	I'm just using Chrome in my Android phone and I've allowed
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:50,879	| IOT064 |	Prone to have access to the locations
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:51,903	| IOT064 |	Permissions
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:55,231	| IOT064 |	And that's what triggered when I walk past the physical web Beacon
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:57,279	| IOT064 |	That's what triggers there was no action
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:59,071	| IOT064 |	Strap in that particular case
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,119	| IOT064 |	I'm thinking like
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:03,167	| IOT064 |	The retail case but you're right so
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:04,959	| IOT064 |	Maybe we should
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:10,591	| IOT064 |	Check was supposed to see if we can get someone from Eddystone to talk about like how they're going to control for things like that cuz
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:15,455	| IOT064 |	We don't want Minority Report or whatever
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:18,271	| IOT064 |	Total Recall I guess it was worth me to walk past often
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,039	| IOT064 |	Personal ads
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,831	| IOT064 |	Cameron do you know
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,623	| IOT064 |	I do not want that
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:23,903	| IOT064 |	Do not want
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,439	| IOT064 |	No alright
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:26,975	| IOT064 |	In the finals
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:29,791	| IOT064 |	You get all of
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:30,815	| IOT064 |	And it
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,607	| IOT064 |	2.5 *
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,143	| IOT064 |	Less energy
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:37,471	| IOT064 |	Basically better power consumption with all that which is
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:42,847	| IOT064 |	Quite nice for everyone building things that run off batteries so ye Bluetooth Sig
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:47,711	| IOT064 |	This is expected in about 2017 the sit the Sig
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:51,807	| IOT064 |	Is basically said hey this what we're going to do so now they got to finalize the standard
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,087	| IOT064 |	What should happen later this year
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,111	| IOT064 |	Early next
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:57,951	| IOT064 |	And then the chipmaker's actually have to build new hardware to support all this so
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:02,559	| IOT064 |	Which means your current devices are not going to get all these G whiz-bang features
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:03,071	| IOT064 |	Right
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,095	| IOT064 |	Monogram
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:10,495	| IOT064 |	That's that's all part of the cycle we know that we may not like it but we
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,007	| IOT064 |	We know that
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,799	| IOT064 |	And this is all
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:14,847	| IOT064 |	And talk about Bluetooth Mesh networking this is separate from the
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,663	| IOT064 |	Here's the update on the match
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,943	| IOT064 |	Mesh Network
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,223	| IOT064 |	King stuff is actually
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:22,271	| IOT064 |	For 4 and 5 but
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,551	| IOT064 |	That's expected
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,343	| IOT064 |	It's on a separate development track
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:27,135	| IOT064 |	So they're going to have a
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:29,695	| IOT064 |	Detailed update sometime in the September timeframe
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:31,743	| IOT064 |	Deployed
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,767	| IOT064 |	In 2017
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,815	| IOT064 |	Like on the earlier side
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,095	| IOT064 |	They said
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:36,863	| IOT064 |	So
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,655	| IOT064 |	Pay attention to September
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,167	| IOT064 |	For the mesh
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:43,007	| IOT064 |	Will be part of you can add that
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,335	| IOT064 |	To Bluetooth 5 and they're also planning out at 2
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:47,615	| IOT064 |	4
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,919	| IOT064 |	So the mesh Network
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:52,223	| IOT064 |	Wingstop actually compete in your existing Bluetooth
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:53,503	| IOT064 |	Devices
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,831	| IOT064 |	So that's the mess
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,111	| IOT064 |	It's a little
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,671	| IOT064 |	There's a lot going on
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:03,231	| IOT064 |	It's gone from just being a
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:07,583	| IOT064 |	Almost like a single-use case kind of thing to a lot of different things and
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,607	| IOT064 |	Super important iot
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,959	| IOT064 |	Alright let's move on to
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,239	| IOT064 |	This is last
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:15,775	| IOT064 |	Switch big news but Kevin and I had to
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,567	| IOT064 |	Early
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:21,407	| IOT064 |	Before WWDC yes
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,687	| IOT064 |	It's totally worth talking about
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,455	| IOT064 |	Because we were like
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:25,759	| IOT064 |	What's happening with homekit
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:26,783	| IOT064 |	Sad sad sad
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,575	| IOT064 |	Apple basically said
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,111	| IOT064 |	Alright here's what's happening
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:31,903	| IOT064 |	I'm going to give you
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,183	| IOT064 |	Home
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,463	| IOT064 |	Which has its own application
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:37,023	| IOT064 |	Group all of your homekit stuff together
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:41,119	| IOT064 |	Basically added support for video
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:41,887	| IOT064 |	Which was a big deal
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,191	| IOT064 |	And
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:44,703	| IOT064 |	Announced
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:46,751	| IOT064 |	New devices that are
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:50,591	| IOT064 |	Along with that home app the IOS app
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:53,407	| IOT064 |	Home where you can control your devices
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:55,711	| IOT064 |	Like I said they proved everything all your controls
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,479	| IOT064 |	Babe
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:10:01,855	| IOT064 |	Front and center in iOS now have an install the iOS 10 beta but once I do
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:04,415	| IOT064 |	I will be able to drag up from the bottom of my screen
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:06,207	| IOT064 |	Just like I do today with control center
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:08,767	| IOT064 |	And then swipe over and there is my presets
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,791	| IOT064 |	For my home app
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,327	| IOT064 |	So we are much quicker access
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:13,887	| IOT064 |	And all those presets and such
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,655	| IOT064 |	And controls
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:18,751	| IOT064 |	Will also be available in the home app for the Apple watch so
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:23,103	| IOT064 |	They make it a lot easier to control things which is what one of the things they needed to do
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,639	| IOT064 |	Yes and
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,663	| IOT064 |	It's also going to be sick
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,431	| IOT064 |	Supported
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:31,295	| IOT064 |	With the Apple TV which means you when you leave your house this was a big
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,575	| IOT064 |	Question mark for every
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,855	| IOT064 |	Not for me
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,903	| IOT064 |	Aeropostale a year ago
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,695	| IOT064 |	Yes
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,975	| IOT064 |	With apple you never know
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:44,095	| IOT064 |	That's true in furnace it was only Apple never announce this
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:46,655	| IOT064 |	Until just this year so you are correct the last year
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:49,727	| IOT064 |	They updated the Apple TV support page to say that it would be
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,287	| IOT064 |	A Gateway for your home kit
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,055	| IOT064 |	Teresa soap
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:55,103	| IOT064 |	Kevin do
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,639	| IOT064 |	Now the rest of us
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,663	| IOT064 |	Saul
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:59,199	| IOT064 |	If you didn't believe Kevin
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,735	| IOT064 |	Cherokee
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,807	| IOT064 |	Not always not after karaoke
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:07,647	| IOT064 |	I should also add that it's not the only Gateway device
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,415	| IOT064 |	I don't know if you called this
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,951	| IOT064 |	IPad
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:12,767	| IOT064 |	Yes that's correct so you do not need an apple
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:16,863	| IOT064 |	TV to remotely access your homekit devices when away from home
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:19,167	| IOT064 |	If you have an iPad which I guess has to be
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,703	| IOT064 |	On in your house and
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:22,239	| IOT064 |	Can I get to your network while you're away
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:23,775	| IOT064 |	You know what's interesting here
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,567	| IOT064 |	Is a lot of
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,847	| IOT064 |	Cydia type Developers
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,639	| IOT064 |	They actually will
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,943	| IOT064 |	Retrofit and iPad in
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,711	| IOT064 |	Pappadeaux's
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:33,503	| IOT064 |	Your wall in your wall so
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,271	| IOT064 |	That's actually kind
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:34,783	| IOT064 |	Never really smart
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,063	| IOT064 |	Yes it is
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,599	| IOT064 |	Penguin
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:39,391	| IOT064 |	Be bad on iPad sales
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:42,463	| IOT064 |	That would be like another use case
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:45,535	| IOT064 |	We actually have two iPads
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:49,119	| IOT064 |	If we were better they would all run the same apps but that's kind of impossible
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:49,631	| IOT064 |	And how many things
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:53,215	| IOT064 |	I'm in and out of my house but parkour apps
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,239	| IOT064 |	It's nice
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,263	| IOT064 |	Because everyone
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:59,103	| IOT064 |	You can always find something and when I have gas I just give him one of the iPads and I'm like here
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:07,039	| IOT064 |	So now I mean I could somebody in a cup of coffee or a drink 66 here would you like an iPad when somebody comes to visit
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:10,111	| IOT064 |	What is there hot
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,183	| IOT064 |	This is Terraria
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:17,535	| IOT064 |	I am not just any of the keys to my home I'm heading you
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,815	| IOT064 |	My smart home
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,375	| IOT064 |	What day would I have better
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:22,143	| IOT064 |	I'd like more of a budget
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:25,983	| IOT064 |	Or maybe just a die
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:33,919	| IOT064 |	I can play their music
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:35,199	| IOT064 |	I am I am a nice
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:38,527	| IOT064 |	I would say that you should open up like a smart home B&B
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:42,879	| IOT064 |	Alright so
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,415	| IOT064 |	I have not played with this yet
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,183	| IOT064 |	Because
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,207	| IOT064 |	Hey I don't have
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:51,583	| IOT064 |	Might my husband's not like him to hand over his stuff to be so I'm going to have to do it on the iPad
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:53,631	| IOT064 |	So it's going to be a slightly different user experience
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:56,959	| IOT064 |	But in watching the videos that people are making
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:57,983	| IOT064 |	This
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,055	| IOT064 |	Apples
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:02,335	| IOT064 |	Worldview on this
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,103	| IOT064 |	Sister give you the
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,895	| IOT064 |	Away in Homestead
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:06,687	| IOT064 |	What's I could buy
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:08,735	| IOT064 |	Good morning the modes is what a lot of
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,039	| IOT064 |	Companies call this and then they give you the things
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:12,063	| IOT064 |	To control
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:14,111	| IOT064 |	And that is a very
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:14,623	| IOT064 |	Xiamen
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:17,439	| IOT064 |	Kind of architecture for building these apps
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:20,255	| IOT064 |	And I was a little disappointed because
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:23,327	| IOT064 |	I didn't see anything like truly innovative
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,095	| IOT064 |	On the
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:28,959	| IOT064 |	Making automations controlling individual devices it felt like apple just kind of looks like
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:30,751	| IOT064 |	Capitulated to the status quo
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,799	| IOT064 |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:33,311	| IOT064 |	You're like no
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:35,103	| IOT064 |	No no
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,919	| IOT064 |	Did but that doesn't surprise me and the reason being
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:42,527	| IOT064 |	Apple standard operating procedure is typically to wait for a market to develop
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:43,807	| IOT064 |	Watch
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,599	| IOT064 |	How people react to it
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:49,951	| IOT064 |	See how manufacturers and device makers kind of screw things up either through UI or
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:51,231	| IOT064 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,767	| IOT064 |	Or instability
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:58,655	| IOT064 |	And then they come in and say we're here to save the day we can fix this it did with the MP3 Market they did it with the phone market
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:05,311	| IOT064 |	Even you could say tablets good tablets have been around hello PCS first one and two thousand one so yeah I'm not surprised that they did
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:07,359	| IOT064 |	Well you so to speak
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:09,151	| IOT064 |	But what they done is made it
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:09,919	| IOT064 |	Intuitive
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,967	| IOT064 |	Easy and hopefully stabling
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,991	| IOT064 |	Simple to use
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:15,551	| IOT064 |	I think what struck me is how none
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,063	| IOT064 |	Intuitive
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:19,135	| IOT064 |	Things are because this isn't
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,439	| IOT064 |	It's actually not that into
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:24,511	| IOT064 |	It's intuitive if you were familiar with
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,279	| IOT064 |	With the space
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:27,327	| IOT064 |	Is a normal person coming in
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:28,095	| IOT064 |	I feel like
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:29,631	| IOT064 |	I'm not saying that's apples
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:31,423	| IOT064 |	Fault I'm just thinking
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:37,823	| IOT064 |	A truly intuitive interface by play with a lot of these software things would actually ask you probably a few
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:38,847	| IOT064 |	The questions and then
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:40,895	| IOT064 |	Start trying to do
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:46,271	| IOT064 |	Right and I think there's like a big divide between I want to
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:46,783	| IOT064 |	Control it
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,319	| IOT064 |	Just kind of the early adopter
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:48,831	| IOT064 |	DIY
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:56,255	| IOT064 |	True and then and I don't know how apple is educating a
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,023	| IOT064 |	Customers
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:59,327	| IOT064 |	In regards to homekit in the new home app
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:01,631	| IOT064 |	I don't have a homekit any homekit devices
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,911	| IOT064 |	Avenues the home app
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,935	| IOT064 |	So
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:08,543	| IOT064 |	I guess I should get one and go through this person see maybe there's some guided bits that
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:10,847	| IOT064 |	Trying to explain the magic you know
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:14,431	| IOT064 |	Here's what you can't have that happen automatically and here's why that helps yuan
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:17,247	| IOT064 |	So I'm usually there messaging is very good
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,807	| IOT064 |	It could just be the
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:22,367	| IOT064 |	I haven't used it and I do have good messaging I don't know
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,647	| IOT064 |	Yes but I am also going
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:26,719	| IOT064 |	We'll get there probably
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:32,607	| IOT064 |	I won't get there for the next show is next after that cuz I don't have any device
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:34,143	| IOT064 |	And I'm moving all next week
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:36,447	| IOT064 |	Nope I'm not assigning
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:38,239	| IOT064 |	Nope not this time
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:40,031	| IOT064 |	I will choose not to accept it if you do
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,567	| IOT064 |	All right
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,591	| IOT064 |	Quit music
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,359	| IOT064 |	So Samsung
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:46,175	| IOT064 |	Who said this week that it plans to
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:47,455	| IOT064 |	To invest one
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,223	| IOT064 |	Point to
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:50,015	| IOT064 |	Weatherby
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:50,783	| IOT064 |	With a B
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:53,343	| IOT064 |	In the US over the next 4 years
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:55,391	| IOT064 |	Boost the iot vision
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:58,207	| IOT064 |	A lot of money
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:00,511	| IOT064 |	It is a lot of money
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,791	| IOT064 |	And I guess the biggest
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:03,071	| IOT064 |	News
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:05,375	| IOT064 |	Part of that investment they've purchased joint
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,655	| IOT064 |	Yes
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:09,215	| IOT064 |	Giants yes
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,263	| IOT064 |	So what we got here is it looks like
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:13,311	| IOT064 |	Samsung is getting serious
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:15,103	| IOT064 |	About 4 minutes
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:18,175	| IOT064 |	We've seen kind of like was it bought smart things back
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:18,687	| IOT064 |	2014
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,991	| IOT064 |	Twitter million dollar acquisition
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:24,831	| IOT064 |	I thought it was a great move because SmartThings was so open in Samsung 8
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,647	| IOT064 |	CSN 2014 hit just got
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,183	| IOT064 |	Through telling us how Lake
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:30,463	| IOT064 |	Amazingly open it was going to
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:38,655	| IOT064 |	You and I went to the Consumer Electronics Show and they touted Anastasia to Kino and that was going to say 2015
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,423	| IOT064 |	15
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:39,935	| IOT064 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:43,007	| IOT064 |	Open
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:47,615	| IOT064 |	Samsung kid actually a couple months ago announced it
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:48,127	| IOT064 |	Arctic
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,407	| IOT064 |	Cloud
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:51,199	| IOT064 |	What are they doing with art
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:55,807	| IOT064 |	That's like a whole that's hardware that's a bunch of pieces
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:56,319	| IOT064 |	So there's
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:59,391	| IOT064 |	Vegan Arctic
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,463	| IOT064 |	A cloud called Sammy
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,743	| IOT064 |	Saami
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:06,047	| IOT064 |	Which basically was like a data
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:07,583	| IOT064 |	Data Lake like a place where you can put
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,375	| IOT064 |	Your data escrow
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,911	| IOT064 |	I just edited
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,191	| IOT064 |	Corporation
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,215	| IOT064 |	Someone's hosted on
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:16,543	| IOT064 |	Cloud you just throw all your data here and you can share it
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,823	| IOT064 |	It's got all kinds of policies
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,615	| IOT064 |	And then
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:21,663	| IOT064 |	They built on top of that article
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:22,687	| IOT064 |	Which is
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,967	| IOT064 |	The cloud
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:25,759	| IOT064 |	It start to Cloud it's
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,039	| IOT064 |	Going to have
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:31,903	| IOT064 |	And it's unclear how much of this already has a good iot Cloud should have a way to
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,927	| IOT064 |	Get devices
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,207	| IOT064 |	Sending data
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:34,975	| IOT064 |	The cloud
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,999	| IOT064 |	It should have
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:37,791	| IOT064 |	Ways to manage those devices at
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,071	| IOT064 |	Scalable easy
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:40,863	| IOT064 |	It should have
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,143	| IOT064 |	Ways to control
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,423	| IOT064 |	Those devices like
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,191	| IOT064 |	Wasted
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:46,239	| IOT064 |	Connect to other clouds
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:47,519	| IOT064 |	Control other devices
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,383	| IOT064 |	I'm not sure
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:54,175	| IOT064 |	What all the Arctic
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:55,455	| IOT064 |	Cloud House of those thing
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:59,039	| IOT064 |	But that's what he's trying to build with choice
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:03,903	| IOT064 |	Basically it gets a massively distributed architecture to the
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:05,695	| IOT064 |	Dildos
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,999	| IOT064 |	I'm enjoying it has
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:13,631	| IOT064 |	They're a bunch of old son guys in a few remember son history you know distributed computing was
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,143	| IOT064 |	Like they're bad
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:19,007	| IOT064 |	We'll see
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:21,055	| IOT064 |	What happens here at the outside the arch
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:21,567	| IOT064 |	Modules
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:23,103	| IOT064 |	Is a specialty
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,383	| IOT064 |	That's
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:30,015	| IOT064 |	That's what I'm looking at right now there are three modules the one the five and the Ten of various sizes and capabilities
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:34,879	| IOT064 |	And the basic saying this is Sino everything you need from Harbor perspective to get started
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:37,951	| IOT064 |	Developer documentation online tons of it as ice
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,719	| IOT064 |	Scan through here
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:43,071	| IOT064 |	You know developer guys on connectivity and audio video and
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,863	| IOT064 |	Wireless networks USB
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:45,887	| IOT064 |	So
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,727	| IOT064 |	Tons going on
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:52,799	| IOT064 |	We can try to get Samsung to come on the show and talk about all of that if that's something
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:54,335	| IOT064 |	39
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:58,687	| IOT064 |	Well considering how much they're spending and how much of a player they want to be in this market
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:03,295	| IOT064 |	I would love to hear more when they're done
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:04,575	| IOT064 |	Samsung TV mod
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:10,975	| IOT064 |	Player in a TV is a great place to Papa Hub they actually already did SmartThings on their smart
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:11,999	| IOT064 |	TVs
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:14,303	| IOT064 |	And they added a zigbee and Z-Wave dongle
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,071	| IOT064 |	Just plug it in and
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:20,703	| IOT064 |	And all the TVs run their own Mouse at their own butt
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,727	| IOT064 |	Generally open source
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,239	| IOT064 |	Kaizen
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,799	| IOT064 |	Tizen platform and that's
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:27,359	| IOT064 |	What's going to tie everything together they say so
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:30,687	| IOT064 |	Yeah I'd be very interested to hear more about this from them
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:31,199	| IOT064 |	Alright we'll see
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:33,503	| IOT064 |	I'm a little fun thing
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,271	| IOT064 |	Is Elon Musk
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:39,135	| IOT064 |	Crazy wheel
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,415	| IOT064 |	So many of them
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,463	| IOT064 |	Fungi
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:43,999	| IOT064 |	Tesla
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:47,583	| IOT064 |	Type with rockets in space
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,607	| IOT064 |	SpaceX I can't remember if you
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:52,447	| IOT064 |	I hate V Rockets into space is what I tell my kids
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:55,263	| IOT064 |	The key part is he
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:55,775	| IOT064 |	Lance them
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,311	| IOT064 |	Intact
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,591	| IOT064 |	So most the time
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,103	| IOT064 |	Some of the time
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:01,663	| IOT064 |	He
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:04,479	| IOT064 |	Is on the board of a company called SolarCity that makes solar panels
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,015	| IOT064 |	And
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:10,623	| IOT064 |	Has his crazy bottle for financing solar panels and making solar panels more accessible to everyone
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:14,975	| IOT064 |	And his cousin is actually the CEO and what happened is on Tuesday
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:15,743	| IOT064 |	Elon says
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:16,255	| IOT064 |	You know what
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:19,583	| IOT064 |	Cuz we can
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:25,983	| IOT064 |	Well it does make sense and the finances are going to be very interesting cuz I thought
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:28,031	| IOT064 |	This is like a 2 and a quarter billion dollar deal
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:30,591	| IOT064 |	I don't have the numbers in front of me but it was a big number
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:35,199	| IOT064 |	But it makes sense I mean solar energy and I can I can attest this personal you know
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:39,551	| IOT064 |	We have 41 solar panels in the current house I will miss you when I'm gone solar panels but
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:42,879	| IOT064 |	We also had an electric vehicle and it was just a perfect marriage
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,927	| IOT064 |	To just plug in our car and
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:48,255	| IOT064 |	You know recharge from the Sun are everyday and
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:49,023	| IOT064 |	Save money
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:51,583	| IOT064 |	Just make sense
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,863	| IOT064 |	Just sits a good integration
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:55,423	| IOT064 |	For everyone who's thinking about this
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,703	| IOT064 |	And it's a 2.52
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:57,727	| IOT064 |	3 billion dollar deal
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:58,495	| IOT064 |	Right on the money
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:04,127	| IOT064 |	This makes sense this is actually very similar to what GE is doing with its current spinner
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:06,687	| IOT064 |	The idea is it's creating a truly connected
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,991	| IOT064 |	Supply chain for energy is
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:11,295	| IOT064 |	Think about it
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:13,087	| IOT064 |	It is trying to work with
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:14,111	| IOT064 |	Power generation
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:14,879	| IOT064 |	Companies
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,928	| IOT064 |	It's also thinking about rechargeable battery
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:20,768	| IOT064 |	And Dennis working on the demand side with
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,560	| IOT064 |	Sensors and Lighting in
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:23,840	| IOT064 |	Commercial areas
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:28,192	| IOT064 |	And basically trying to help manage the flow of information in the
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:28,960	| IOT064 |	Control
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:31,264	| IOT064 |	How much people are paying
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:32,544	| IOT064 |	2
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:33,824	| IOT064 |	Use electricity
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,104	| IOT064 |	So
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:38,176	| IOT064 |	When you apply this electric cars are one of the
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:39,200	| IOT064 |	Going to be a
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,224	| IOT064 |	Huge draw
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:40,736	| IOT064 |	On the electric grid
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:43,040	| IOT064 |	And if you think about it that way
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:44,576	| IOT064 |	Pouting
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:45,600	| IOT064 |	Insight into
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:52,256	| IOT064 |	When to charge them based on the availability of solar power because again solar power is not constant we haven't been
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:22:00,704	| IOT064 |	Most people have solar panels do not have battery back-ups and such I tried but I couldn't do it and then I did try to get in
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:02,240	| IOT064 |	The Powerball thing with Tessa
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:04,288	| IOT064 |	Which is a battery destroy that energy
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:07,616	| IOT064 |	But because of my system though it's configured I actually couldn't do it
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:08,896	| IOT064 |	So
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:13,248	| IOT064 |	It may make sense right now a lot of people charge their cars over
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:15,040	| IOT064 |	Goodnight but it makes more sense
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:21,952	| IOT064 |	It to have that intelligence right now
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:22,976	| IOT064 |	Electric car
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:24,000	| IOT064 |	In
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,024	| IOT064 |	I think that's going to be
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:27,584	| IOT064 |	An essential piece of info
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:28,352	| IOT064 |	Information
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:29,632	| IOT064 |	For kind of building like
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:32,192	| IOT064 |	Some people called the internet of electricity
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:35,008	| IOT064 |	A real toy
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:41,920	| IOT064 |	You have to shift the demand or the supply because let's face it solar power is awesome
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,688	| IOT064 |	For half of the day
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,992	| IOT064 |	Thrift near at night
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,272	| IOT064 |	Skinesis oh
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:49,600	| IOT064 |	They've got to figure it out they got the tools to do it with the powerwall
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:53,696	| IOT064 |	SolarCity installing the panels and then you got the car for your demand
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:55,232	| IOT064 |	Thinking intelligently
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:56,000	| IOT064 |	Shipt
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:56,768	| IOT064 |	When
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:58,304	| IOT064 |	Are you charged or when
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,584	| IOT064 |	Power is available to you and
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,376	| IOT064 |	It sells the whole problem of
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:04,448	| IOT064 |	Quote about using solar power at night
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:10,848	| IOT064 |	I maybe they'll just you know jet your new Tesla over to you on a rock at night

EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:14,688	| IOT064 |	More energy

EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:35,936	| IOT064 |	We're breaking into the iot podcast
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:41,056	| IOT064 |	From our sponsor I've got with me Todd Alice got the CTO of wolf SSL

EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,944	| IOT064 |	Toddy is here today to tell us
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:50,272	| IOT064 |	Why you should use SSL for securing The Internet of Things
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:52,576	| IOT064 |	The short answer is
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:56,672	| IOT064 |	It is the web security protocol Congress currently used
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:58,720	| IOT064 |	Everything for you

EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:16,640	| IOT064 |	Forgery by messages on you and most importantly
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:27,904	| IOT064 |	Does it cost extra to add
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:29,952	| IOT064 |	SSL from a processing overhead
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:37,376	| IOT064 |	It does a little bit and that's been an excuse in the past not to do it but then things I talked about integrity
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:39,680	| IOT064 |	I think those things out way
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:43,776	| IOT064 |	The slight increase in a resource processing
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:44,800	| IOT064 |	All right and how can we
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:49,664	| IOT064 |	Best place to eat
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:25:02,208	| IOT064 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is matter

EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:11,424	| IOT064 |	I am super excited to have you
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:15,264	| IOT064 |	Thanks for coming because the end of March
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:15,776	| IOT064 |	Awesome
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:18,080	| IOT064 |	A survey of the iot industry
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:20,640	| IOT064 |	I think I saw past me like 18
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:29,088	| IOT064 |	Let's get started with the status
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:31,648	| IOT064 |	Venture Capital Industries
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:33,440	| IOT064 |	That's who you are for the internet
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:37,024	| IOT064 |	What has changed since you publish that
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:44,960	| IOT064 |	I think they c2f think we are in an uncertain cycle for the ventricles
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:45,984	| IOT064 |	Going to stream General
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:48,032	| IOT064 |	Can we hold strength of your ads
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:51,616	| IOT064 |	What is happening in some of it is rated to the ups and downs
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,640	| IOT064 |	David Natural Market
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:54,176	| IOT064 |	That's it
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:26:00,576	| IOT064 |	So pretty clear that the market has cool down quite significantly since Maybe
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,600	| IOT064 |	Las Palmas
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,160	| IOT064 |	Menu for 4 months
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:07,488	| IOT064 |	The impacts of the general
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:12,608	| IOT064 |	Cooling down on the internet 06 industry is
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:13,888	| IOT064 |	Significance
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:20,800	| IOT064 |	TV internet of things like many other emerging areas and maybe that includes other wolves
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:23,360	| IOT064 |	You know Bitcoin and blockchain for example
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:29,760	| IOT064 |	Internet of Things was a an emerging area that in some ways I think was little bit of an acquired taste
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:30,784	| IOT064 |	Four letter v
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:34,368	| IOT064 |	PCS meaning that people wear curious and
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:36,416	| IOT064 |	People were excited
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:37,184	| IOT064 |	2
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:37,952	| IOT064 |	Look at
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:39,488	| IOT064 |	New iot Ventures
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:41,280	| IOT064 |	And we're willing to
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:42,048	| IOT064 |	Experiments
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:46,400	| IOT064 |	But that thing is the market closed down people tend to Natural retreats
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:46,912	| IOT064 |	Towards
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:48,960	| IOT064 |	What areas of Tallahassee
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:50,240	| IOT064 |	Experimental
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,520	| IOT064 |	Berkeley what's happening
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:54,080	| IOT064 |	Right now so if you're venture-backed startup
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:57,152	| IOT064 |	Or any startup so we'll start with people who've already raised some money
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,456	| IOT064 |	People who are they
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:01,504	| IOT064 |	What do I do
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:03,296	| IOT064 |	What would your advice be
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,320	| IOT064 |	Companies who
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,600	| IOT064 |	Have raised money
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:06,624	| IOT064 |	And are trying to get their products
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:12,768	| IOT064 |	Companies that have raised money in the name of the game is quite often to get
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:14,560	| IOT064 |	More money and the
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:16,864	| IOT064 |	You're very practical by theories
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,632	| IOT064 |	2
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:20,704	| IOT064 |	Take money from wherever
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:27,104	| IOT064 |	1 Cam and that means that one should not have to leave the focus.
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,384	| IOT064 |	Getting money from
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:34,784	| IOT064 |	The brand name VC me that happens with so many great and by all means they are as chilling number of tough name
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:35,808	| IOT064 |	Beaches.
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:37,088	| IOT064 |	Storage space
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:40,416	| IOT064 |	The same time the great news for the space I thank you
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:43,744	| IOT064 |	What's the corporate investors and stretchy investors that beat
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:44,256	| IOT064 |	Reactive
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:48,864	| IOT064 |	And quite frankly compared to a lot of your
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:53,728	| IOT064 |	Average BC some of the Strategic investors can bring almost mold value
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:59,360	| IOT064 |	Especially those investors I was catching investors are in areas that are immediately accretive
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:01,152	| IOT064 |	2 startups whether they are
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:02,944	| IOT064 |	Manufacturing
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:04,224	| IOT064 |	Or insurance
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:08,832	| IOT064 |	I think those are great sources of money in one should actively engaged
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,600	| IOT064 |	Wizards players
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:13,696	| IOT064 |	I think he knew the Shinto strategy can corporate investors
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:15,232	| IOT064 |	Contra Dance
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:17,536	| IOT064 |	Can be interesting as long as they did
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,560	| IOT064 |	Amused
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:19,840	| IOT064 |	4
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:23,168	| IOT064 |	To finance your inventory in knots
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:24,448	| IOT064 |	You just financed
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:25,728	| IOT064 |	Extension of your Runway
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:29,824	| IOT064 |	You have the key learning hero the key lesson
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:33,152	| IOT064 |	Is that one should be overdramatic and state rate
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:35,456	| IOT064 |	How to get money from Whataburger
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:38,016	| IOT064 |	They can't they are still sources of my
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:39,040	| IOT064 |	Okay
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:43,392	| IOT064 |	Thinking of starting what if I feel like oh my God no one's made a connected
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:44,416	| IOT064 |	Shopping
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:45,696	| IOT064 |	Don't actually do
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:48,000	| IOT064 |	If I'm looking for money
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:49,024	| IOT064 |	Where
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:50,560	| IOT064 |	Should I give up hope for what should I do
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:54,400	| IOT064 |	I think one consequence of the Venture Capital markets
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:56,704	| IOT064 |	Cooling down at 1 should be
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:58,240	| IOT064 |	Stickley careful
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:01,568	| IOT064 |	Insult for when starting a new venture
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:03,872	| IOT064 |	Indeed there is a question
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:06,944	| IOT064 |	Around availability of the product
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:10,272	| IOT064 |	And the business model that one cheats
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:11,040	| IOT064 |	Think through
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:12,832	| IOT064 |	Perhaps more than
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:13,600	| IOT064 |	In the past
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:15,136	| IOT064 |	I think there is less
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:16,416	| IOT064 |	Solvay
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:19,232	| IOT064 |	Immediate needs to rush to create a new product
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:22,048	| IOT064 |	Recent you got completely excited about
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:27,424	| IOT064 |	New products in Indonesia and the potential of the products
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:29,216	| IOT064 |	I think you should
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:31,264	| IOT064 |	Work very hard time getting the best
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,288	| IOT064 |	Possible
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:32,800	| IOT064 |	Team
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,848	| IOT064 |	There was
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:38,176	| IOT064 |	During the last couple of years maybe more
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,200	| IOT064 |	Torrentz4
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:42,272	| IOT064 |	Teams that have never done Hardware before
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:46,112	| IOT064 |	But so I could to the figure it out especially with the help of some
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:48,672	| IOT064 |	Third-party provider
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:49,696	| IOT064 |	Some incubator
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:55,840	| IOT064 |	Because the bar is hiring now you should definitely optimize for
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:57,120	| IOT064 |	Getting the rights
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:30:00,704	| IOT064 |	People on the team that includes the people who've done Hardware before
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:05,056	| IOT064 |	Funding is a very viable option
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:07,872	| IOT064 |	I think we have all learnt in the last couple of years back
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:09,664	| IOT064 |	I want to be careful with crowdfunding
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:16,832	| IOT064 |	Because creates a lot of pressure on the entrepreneurs and I think the time to launch applied funding campaign
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:20,416	| IOT064 |	He's probably much closer to actual shipping date
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:22,208	| IOT064 |	Other people stop before
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:27,072	| IOT064 |	It looks like about exits because they've actually been a lot of exits
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:28,352	| IOT064 |	In the last
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:29,632	| IOT064 |	Gears 4
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:33,472	| IOT064 |	Comedies that had started really early and I'm curious
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:37,056	| IOT064 |	A lot of them are small they're not very well publicized
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:37,568	| IOT064 |	Some of them look like
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:39,872	| IOT064 |	Sears Buy
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:43,712	| IOT064 |	Airbnb
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:44,992	| IOT064 |	Sproutlings
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:46,016	| IOT064 |	Acquired by Mattel
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:47,552	| IOT064 |	What is this tell us about
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:48,832	| IOT064 |	The exit Market
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:55,744	| IOT064 |	The market has been somewhat confusing so there was a first wave of very large acquisition
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:58,816	| IOT064 |	Send Hangouts Dropcam and
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:05,984	| IOT064 |	In the first place that the very beginning of the cyclic rate of the excitement because the
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:11,872	| IOT064 |	The time between Christian of the company and then and then very large exciting exit was very short
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:15,200	| IOT064 |	That was the first wave and that was some of the head fade because
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:20,320	| IOT064 |	Just that created more and more excitement than the market probably warranted
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:24,160	| IOT064 |	I think we now in that second phase of the closest Market Square
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:28,512	| IOT064 |	So
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:34,912	| IOT064 |	Whole wave of companies that are funded maybe in the last couple of years that raise the AC ground or
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:35,936	| IOT064 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:36,704	| IOT064 |	Small
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:39,520	| IOT064 |	To reserve that are now getting to the stage where
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:49,504	| IOT064 |	The market or defend a position in the market
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:55,648	| IOT064 |	That makes for interesting checking acquisition from water companies that also feel the need
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:32:01,792	| IOT064 |	To play in the space but I know Natalie willing to invest hundreds of millions or billions
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:04,096	| IOT064 |	In the company so we sing that that whole wave
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:04,864	| IOT064 |	Now
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:08,192	| IOT064 |	I think the next logical wave he's probably
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:13,568	| IOT064 |	234 years away that's when the larger companies by
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,104	| IOT064 |	Startups that have grown in a
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:19,456	| IOT064 |	Quizlet revenues large teams
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:22,016	| IOT064 |	X 1 2 or 3 products allowed
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:23,296	| IOT064 |	That will take
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:24,832	| IOT064 |	Another
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:26,624	| IOT064 |	That's a good cutting from a nap
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,648	| IOT064 |	Acquisition stand for in
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:30,208	| IOT064 |	I think the
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:32,768	| IOT064 |	Pool of potential acquirers is
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,048	| IOT064 |	Large
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:35,328	| IOT064 |	Not afraid
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:36,608	| IOT064 |	Type of acquired
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:40,960	| IOT064 |	Suggest yes but that was one of the always one of the questions for Hardware
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:47,872	| IOT064 |	How companies is who buys you and what was interesting to see in the last two or three years was that some of the large
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:51,200	| IOT064 |	Internet companies which so far I've been
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:53,760	| IOT064 |	Completely software companies
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:33:00,160	| IOT064 |	Showed an interest in the in buying our company so specifically Google for example that
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:00,672	| IOT064 |	You can think of
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:04,256	| IOT064 |	Companies like Amazon that I'm starting to play
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:05,280	| IOT064 |	In this case as well
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:07,840	| IOT064 |	In addition to the large
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:14,240	| IOT064 |	Companies the traditional industrial and manufacturing companies
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:15,008	| IOT064 |	Also stunning
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:16,032	| IOT064 |	To show
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:18,848	| IOT064 |	Plug in chest into space a because
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:21,408	| IOT064 |	They don't come from a good nav
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:22,688	| IOT064 |	Are we going to have
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:26,272	| IOT064 |	To buy a little bit of some companies to bring in
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:26,784	| IOT064 |	Challenge
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:28,320	| IOT064 |	And products
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:34,208	| IOT064 |	And graduates was formed themselves into companies that will be one more software
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:34,976	| IOT064 |	Bass
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:36,512	| IOT064 |	EQ project
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:38,816	| IOT064 |	2 3 4 5 years old
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:43,936	| IOT064 |	Then my guess is that you'll see a lot of non-traditional Lee soft
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:44,704	| IOT064 |	Square
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:45,728	| IOT064 |	Bass companies
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:47,776	| IOT064 |	Hardware
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:49,824	| IOT064 |	So I just filled in a device companies
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:51,104	| IOT064 |	Buying one more
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:51,616	| IOT064 |	Tech companies
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:57,504	| IOT064 |	Yes I've seen a lot of people in the retail people in the entertainment space getting here
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:58,784	| IOT064 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:00,320	| IOT064 |	The industrial internet
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:05,696	| IOT064 |	Versus kind of the smart home and maybe some of the other connected-car somebody's other trends
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:08,768	| IOT064 |	Where do you want to place your money now
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:10,816	| IOT064 |	What's growing what's the
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:11,328	| IOT064 |	The status of
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:15,424	| IOT064 |	Guess what I'm personally
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:19,520	| IOT064 |	More excited by the Enterprise and Industrial side of things
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:23,104	| IOT064 |	I am in Smyrna I'll explain the wife in a second but
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:23,872	| IOT064 |	From my perspective
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:30,016	| IOT064 |	Enterprise energy spiritual includes both the actual and present industrial plays
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:32,064	| IOT064 |	A whole range of
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:34,112	| IOT064 |	Enabling Technologies developed to play
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,392	| IOT064 |	Data plays
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:39,488	| IOT064 |	Elite Enterprise in additional time for example
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:42,304	| IOT064 |	Helium which is a full stack
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:43,584	| IOT064 |	Intuitive Solutions
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:44,608	| IOT064 |	For the Enterprise
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:46,144	| IOT064 |	They provide a very modern
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:47,168	| IOT064 |	Take on the
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:49,216	| IOT064 |	Surprisingly insult problemos
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:51,520	| IOT064 |	Keypoint sensors and getting
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:52,288	| IOT064 |	Data
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:55,360	| IOT064 |	Are things in a way that is very developer-friendly
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:56,640	| IOT064 |	And Best of You scalable
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:35:00,224	| IOT064 |	But you know that thing is going to be a whole range of
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:02,272	| IOT064 |	Signs to go vertical specific
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:03,040	| IOT064 |	Platforms
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:06,368	| IOT064 |	Two Souls comparable problems for example in oil and gas
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:09,696	| IOT064 |	I also think there's going to be your whole
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:11,232	| IOT064 |	What range of Appleton key you around
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:14,048	| IOT064 |	Security plays for the Internet of Things
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:17,632	| IOT064 |	Turn around data plays I think this whole set of Interest
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:19,424	| IOT064 |	Things are possible when
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:24,800	| IOT064 |	One industry that I am excited about Vivitrol drone
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:28,384	| IOT064 |	Industry which I think he's part of into the other things if you think of it.
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,152	| IOT064 |	Connected
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:35,552	| IOT064 |	Hardware I think they are going to be about the casements around collecting you forms of
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:37,088	| IOT064 |	Data using
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,112	| IOT064 |	Drones
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:42,464	| IOT064 |	Agricultural data of utilities data organelle pipeline inspection
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:44,512	| IOT064 |	And this whole range of
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:48,352	| IOT064 |	Enabling Technologies for drones but also for robots
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:52,448	| IOT064 |	Did you offer some general that
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:55,008	| IOT064 |	Okay let's talk about the consumer friend
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:36:00,128	| IOT064 |	So MD consumer from that personally find the category of bit more tricky
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:01,408	| IOT064 |	At least as of right now
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:05,248	| IOT064 |	As is at least to me it feel so bit more like a hit
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:05,760	| IOT064 |	Business
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:09,600	| IOT064 |	GRCC Detroit area that I look for in
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:11,648	| IOT064 |	Consumer iot plays
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:14,464	| IOT064 |	Three of them
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:17,024	| IOT064 |	First one is that I like
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:19,328	| IOT064 |	Show me plays that
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:20,352	| IOT064 |	Are mission critical
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:23,936	| IOT064 |	Which doesn't mean it's only mean that they are mission for
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:29,568	| IOT064 |	Nicole to everyone at all times but I believe the product should be mission-critical and I must have
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:32,128	| IOT064 |	For a large enough category of people
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:33,664	| IOT064 |	At least at certain points
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,688	| IOT064 |	In the life
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,456	| IOT064 |	So
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:38,528	| IOT064 |	Mission critical categories for ground pool
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:39,296	| IOT064 |	Include
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,832	| IOT064 |	From my perspective
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:41,344	| IOT064 |	Security
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:42,624	| IOT064 |	Who's health
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:43,648	| IOT064 |	Although
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:49,536	| IOT064 |	Not health care of because it's tricky because of the fda's involved and because pairs involved
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:50,816	| IOT064 |	Let's go digital health
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:54,400	| IOT064 |	Believe the family category is interesting
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:56,448	| IOT064 |	Meaning selling products
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:57,728	| IOT064 |	Two parents
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:36:58,496	| IOT064 |	That

EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:06,944	| IOT064 |	I'm so products around babies are interesting because
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:13,088	| IOT064 |	People become temporarily price insensitive around the time to have babies and are willing to change the consumer
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:15,392	| IOT064 |	That's a nice way of saying insane
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:21,792	| IOT064 |	That bad happens to
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:24,864	| IOT064 |	As a parent I'm like I went through that

EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:33,824	| IOT064 |	Sorry
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:37,920	| IOT064 |	What you mean mission-critical also includes products where
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:40,736	| IOT064 |	One of these days in the early obsessive Behavior

EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:52,000	| IOT064 |	I'm so over this for me is isthmus
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:52,768	| IOT064 |	Pretty cool

EDL	00:37:57,120	00:38:01,216	| IOT064 |	Icing sold first world problems and that's my perspective
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:06,848	| IOT064 |	Timber Products in the connected home category which I think is an otherwise very interesting category but there are a number of products that
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:08,640	| IOT064 |	Fall in that category
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:09,408	| IOT064 |	Pennsylvania
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:10,432	| IOT064 |	Problems that

EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:18,880	| IOT064 |	Consumer products that I
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:19,648	| IOT064 |	Really better
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:22,208	| IOT064 |	Because of their internet connectivity
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:24,000	| IOT064 |	And even better alike
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:26,304	| IOT064 |	A consumer product that simply cannot exist
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:27,584	| IOT064 |	If they were

EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:35,008	| IOT064 |	I look for products

EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:50,368	| IOT064 |	I think it's been a little tricky with bad luck categories that takes a long time
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:53,440	| IOT064 |	Gets to the stage where you have interesting data plays
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:54,464	| IOT064 |	And
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:56,512	| IOT064 |	It's been one of these shoes that I think
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:58,816	| IOT064 |	Investors I've been grappling with
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:39:00,352	| IOT064 |	Hey it's your because

EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:09,824	| IOT064 |	What's the shipping then to get critical mass
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:12,128	| IOT064 |	By the time you have a

EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:37,216	| IOT064 |	And let's talk about the difference between
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:37,984	| IOT064 |	Products
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:40,288	| IOT064 |	And infrastructure
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:41,056	| IOT064 |	Terms of building credible
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:46,688	| IOT064 |	I think we still in the early days of think the
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:48,992	| IOT064 |	Core connectivity problem is
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:52,832	| IOT064 |	Surprisingly unresolved committee that he will be resolved

EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:04,864	| IOT064 |	Somewhat souls for long-distance connectivity which
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:07,168	| IOT064 |	Sounds like it's going to be increasingly
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:07,936	| IOT064 |	Cellular

EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:18,176	| IOT064 |	I think this whole range of connectivity issues in
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:18,944	| IOT064 |	Between
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:21,248	| IOT064 |	Delivery near connectivity and the

EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:36,352	| IOT064 |	You know if there are number different circumstances where I need your contacts where there are temperature

EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:50,688	| IOT064 |	Amvets
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:54,528	| IOT064 |	He's going to be a very important need at the same time for meeting.
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:55,296	| IOT064 |	Respective
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,832	| IOT064 |	Impurity have
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:57,600	| IOT064 |	2
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:40:59,136	| IOT064 |	Believe in the market because
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:01,440	| IOT064 |	The current security needs
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:02,208	| IOT064 |	AR
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:02,976	| IOT064 |	Just
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:04,512	| IOT064 |	Emerging
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:07,328	| IOT064 |	Security in many cases for
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:08,864	| IOT064 |	IG blockers
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:11,424	| IOT064 |	To look it up an afterthought
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:15,776	| IOT064 |	So is investor insecurity plays you have to believe that the problem is going to
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:18,848	| IOT064 |	To be a merchant very quickly and in a very drastic way
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:25,248	| IOT064 |	And you have to be willing to invest in companies that quite frankly don't have traction just yet because they don't
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:27,552	| IOT064 |	Have no a very large and
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:28,320	| IOT064 |	Well founded
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:29,600	| IOT064 |	Customer base
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:33,440	| IOT064 |	I also think it's Securities interesting because
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:35,232	| IOT064 |	It feels like we need a new sim
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:36,768	| IOT064 |	For the internet
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:40,096	| IOT064 |	And it's still up in the air how we're going to actually do
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:42,144	| IOT064 |	Do it so it's awesome
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:43,680	| IOT064 |	But if you don't
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:48,288	| IOT064 |	12
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:51,104	| IOT064 |	No no no
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:53,407	| IOT064 |	He's coming to the territory of
EDL	00:41:53,407	00:41:56,223	| IOT064 |	Inari station Vassar you have to
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:58,783	| IOT064 |	Do cows have some sense of
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:42:03,903	| IOT064 |	Where did you take having a season surround its and then you have to be fortunate enough
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:05,951	| IOT064 |	Define debris
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:06,975	| IOT064 |	Best people
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:13,631	| IOT064 |	In the specific segments so I'm trying to solve that problem and that the end of the day you have to
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:18,239	| IOT064 |	Lyrics intellect and their ability to adapt to changing market conditions
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:22,335	| IOT064 |	Quite frankly and support them as much as
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:25,919	| IOT064 |	You can't but that's a that's a life of an artist Asian dresser
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:26,687	| IOT064 |	I would never be able to do
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:30,015	| IOT064 |	I can barely I can barely trust myself
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:33,343	| IOT064 |	No face
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:33,855	| IOT064 |	No face
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:38,207	| IOT064 |	Alright what Matt thank you so much
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:41,023	| IOT064 |	I really appreciate you coming on the show I have learned a lot
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:42,047	| IOT064 |	It kind of makes me
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:42,815	| IOT064 |	Feel good about not being
EDL	00:42:43,839	00:42:44,863	| IOT064 |	So
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:46,911	| IOT064 |	Any final words of wisdom
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:51,007	| IOT064 |	Stepping into short-term life
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:53,311	| IOT064 |	For Internet of Things entrepreneurs
EDL	00:42:53,311	00:42:59,455	| IOT064 |	And the VC's bad back them he's going to be a little tricky and challenging at the same time
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:05,855	| IOT064 |	That's what encouraged everyone to continue to be enthusiastic and certainly not lose faith I think the
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:12,767	| IOT064 |	Can you teach self continues to be gigantic and exciting I continue to think that it is a
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:14,815	| IOT064 |	A fundamental paradigm shift
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:15,839	| IOT064 |	Happening in
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:17,119	| IOT064 |	Computing in general
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:21,215	| IOT064 |	I absolutely believe that the world is going in the general direction to work
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:24,031	| IOT064 |	Everything will be connected to the internet
EDL	00:43:24,031	00:43:25,311	| IOT064 |	One way or another and that open
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:33,247	| IOT064 |	Teas to build large infrastructure companies but also to build new consumer companies that
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:37,599	| IOT064 |	Will essentially becomes a new branch of tomorrow so I think the the reality of the approaching the
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:40,415	| IOT064 |	Continues its are going to happen over the next 10 years
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:43,487	| IOT064 |	Cleansing markets go up go down
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:47,327	| IOT064 |	But if you end of the day great companies are created in Old Cycles
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:49,887	| IOT064 |	So what I've been crate show everyone to
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:52,703	| IOT064 |	Just to keep the face
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:55,007	| IOT064 |	Thanks for having me Stacy and really enjoyed it
