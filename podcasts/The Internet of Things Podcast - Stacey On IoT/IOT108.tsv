EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:12,960	| IOT108 |	Arctic and easy interoperable and secure iot platform lets you focus on building your business
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:19,360	| IOT108 |	Rather than worrying about technology provides fully integrated Hardware cloud and services
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:22,944	| IOT108 |	Interoperability with other devices and service clouds and
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:29,344	| IOT108 |	System-wide security Samsung artik is how iot gets down to business for more information
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:34,208	| IOT108 |	Visit Arctic. IO that's a r t i k. IO
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:36,512	| IOT108 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:42,400	| IOT108 |	Last week you were sick so we're glad to have you back although I have to say Richard Gunther was super helpful
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:44,192	| IOT108 |	He's over at the home on podcast
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:45,216	| IOT108 |	So
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:46,752	| IOT108 |	I don't know
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:50,336	| IOT108 |	But I know that's great I'm glad you found a great
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:56,224	| IOT108 |	Co-host it which was sort of last minute so thank you Richard cuz I was really sick I'm still sick but at least I can
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:57,760	| IOT108 |	Jumping around these days
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,808	| IOT108 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:02,624	| IOT108 |	Are you guys he was willing to drive himself and
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,392	| IOT108 |	The break up.
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:03,904	| IOT108 |	Just to talk
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:06,976	| IOT108 |	Just in case I said I'd be here
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:11,328	| IOT108 |	What is Richard came through which I appreciate so that's awesome
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,352	| IOT108 |	It was awesome
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:17,472	| IOT108 |	Now I'm going to say that you did miss our big discussion which is I had a week with the Google home
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:19,008	| IOT108 |	In my own little
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:22,592	| IOT108 |	I did not go back and listen to show yet so
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:25,664	| IOT108 |	Give me the skinny if you can so quick
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:29,248	| IOT108 |	Take was it's not quite ready for a couple reasons
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:32,576	| IOT108 |	Biggest one for me was how the Google home
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:33,856	| IOT108 |	Divide
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:36,672	| IOT108 |	Rooms it asks you to do a room for every
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,720	| IOT108 |	Device doesn't have another set of
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,256	| IOT108 |	Relation
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:42,048	| IOT108 |	Something I like having
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,584	| IOT108 |	All of my lights for like
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,352	| IOT108 |	My living room
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,376	| IOT108 |	To be called the living room
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,424	| IOT108 |	And that is rightfully possible
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:47,936	| IOT108 |	With the Google home
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:51,264	| IOT108 |	But then in my Amazon Echo I have another set of categories
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:53,056	| IOT108 |	Gory switches downstairs
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,872	| IOT108 |	And in the Echo you can put
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:58,176	| IOT108 |	Devices in a double categories
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:58,944	| IOT108 |	In the home you cannot
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:08,672	| IOT108 |	Another limitation yet another reason Kevin does not have a Google home
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:13,280	| IOT108 |	This is something I just started playing with we hooked our Netflix account to it
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:19,680	| IOT108 |	And I'm actually seeing some really good stuff with the Chromecast stick in your Chromecast in with your Google home
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:22,752	| IOT108 |	TV is important to you
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:25,056	| IOT108 |	You can actually do a lot of things that are
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,616	| IOT108 |	Pretty compelling pigs for the Google Assistant
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,896	| IOT108 |	I don't know how much of it
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:31,200	| IOT108 |	The Netflix stuff does go over the Google home
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,504	| IOT108 |	Turn on
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:34,784	| IOT108 |	And watch
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,832	| IOT108 |	Try to take a show that's on
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,392	| IOT108 |	Stranger things
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:39,904	| IOT108 |	Sure
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:43,232	| IOT108 |	Watch stranger things it'll actually pull
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,512	| IOT108 |	All the way to
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,024	| IOT108 |	Stranger thing
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:46,816	| IOT108 |	Right
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,096	| IOT108 |	That was one of the
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:51,936	| IOT108 |	More compelling features on Google home was announced how you could use it to cast
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:53,728	| IOT108 |	Audio or video
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:56,800	| IOT108 |	Be a voice right so I suspect that
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:58,592	| IOT108 |	If a third party
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:00,640	| IOT108 |	Service or provider
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:06,016	| IOT108 |	Supports chromecasting it probably will work fine with Google home as long as long as you have a
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,808	| IOT108 |	25 $35 Chromecast
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:12,160	| IOT108 |	Hook up to a TV or speakers at the Chromecast audio so that's actually a
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,952	| IOT108 |	One of the biggest selling points
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:18,047	| IOT108 |	As opposed to an echo because for you to voice control your TV
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:20,863	| IOT108 |	You have your Echo working with that via the
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:23,935	| IOT108 |	Logitech write a Logitech home Harmony which
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:26,495	| IOT108 |	Second $90 Edition uses IR
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:27,775	| IOT108 |	If I'm not mistaken
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:31,615	| IOT108 |	I also have a controlling my Roku
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,895	| IOT108 |	So it actually brings him
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,455	| IOT108 |	So it's unlikely that Google
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:38,783	| IOT108 |	But
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:41,087	| IOT108 |	Yeah yeah I mean that
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,623	| IOT108 |	Yeah gif
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:44,415	| IOT108 |	If you do look at
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,719	| IOT108 |	The integrated services
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:50,303	| IOT108 |	With home it is very Google Centric obviously so that that is a good point
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,351	| IOT108 |	Disclosure time
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:56,447	| IOT108 |	Don't just close your time thank you see I'm still sick so I forget that
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:05:00,543	| IOT108 |	I forget to tell people that I do work for Google as a consultant it's my full-time job
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:04,895	| IOT108 |	I don't work with them on the IRT type products in such a word with chrome in Android so
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,431	| IOT108 |	There we go
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:07,455	| IOT108 |	Let's be quick
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:11,807	| IOT108 |	Experience with one other thing that you can do that I thought was pretty cool
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:14,879	| IOT108 |	You can actually if you're using
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:15,647	| IOT108 |	Google photos
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,183	| IOT108 |	Like I am
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:19,999	| IOT108 |	Yep
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:23,071	| IOT108 |	My dog
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,119	| IOT108 |	On living room TV
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,679	| IOT108 |	And holy cow it shoots photos of your dog
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:28,703	| IOT108 |	And Olivia
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:29,983	| IOT108 |	Which is pretty
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:30,495	| IOT108 |	You're like
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,287	| IOT108 |	Computer yeah
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,847	| IOT108 |	That's actually one of those
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:37,407	| IOT108 |	Most impressive
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:43,807	| IOT108 |	Recent software apps that come out of Google in my opinion I even use it on my iPhone on my my SIM card currently in an iPhone
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:45,087	| IOT108 |	To be honest and
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:51,999	| IOT108 |	Google photos I use that too for the free storage because backs everything up into the cloud but the search capability
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,791	| IOT108 |	Image recognition I really
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:56,095	| IOT108 |	Impressive and then when you're tied into
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:06:00,191	| IOT108 |	That search functionality to voice and casting that information to a screen
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:02,495	| IOT108 |	That's pretty cool I agree
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:03,263	| IOT108 |	It's magic
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:04,287	| IOT108 |	It's magic
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:09,663	| IOT108 |	What do you still say but you still real quick but you still say the home listens better than your Echo as well
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:13,247	| IOT108 |	Amazes me
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:15,807	| IOT108 |	You know something
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:22,975	| IOT108 |	No probably probably but no not in this nothing relevant to this
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:25,791	| IOT108 |	It just amazes me because I was always very impressed by the
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:28,351	| IOT108 |	The microphone array in the original Echo
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:29,631	| IOT108 |	And
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:35,775	| IOT108 |	I know Google home has an array I don't think it has seven microphones I don't recall the exact specs
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:38,591	| IOT108 |	And I'm just I'm just really surprised that
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:42,175	| IOT108 |	Pitbull listens well you're not the only person I've told me that so
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:45,247	| IOT108 |	And maybe it's got to do with the timber of my voice survey
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:49,343	| IOT108 |	Maybe Amazon listens better at certain frequencies
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,367	| IOT108 |	Google listens better at others
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:54,207	| IOT108 |	This is a Christian actually into some big news
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,231	| IOT108 |	Wichita
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:57,023	| IOT108 |	The Amazon
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,303	| IOT108 |	Folks
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,327	| IOT108 |	Have released
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,863	| IOT108 |	A madam
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:01,887	| IOT108 |	Hardware development
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:04,191	| IOT108 |	People which includes
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,727	| IOT108 |	The seven mic array
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,775	| IOT108 |	And basically if you want to build
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:11,359	| IOT108 |	Exactly an Amazon Echo
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:13,151	| IOT108 |	You can you can
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:16,735	| IOT108 |	Pop that Hardware into your particular device
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:20,319	| IOT108 |	And you can have the matinees voice services
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:21,343	| IOT108 |	And Wallah
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,879	| IOT108 |	There is
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:23,647	| IOT108 |	An echo
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,927	| IOT108 |	So that
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:26,463	| IOT108 |	Brings the question
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:32,095	| IOT108 |	How were people building Echo like devices before or were they doing it with
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:35,423	| IOT108 |	Fewer features like they couldn't have seven microphones there's an apple
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,447	| IOT108 |	They had one
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:37,983	| IOT108 |	2 microphone
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:38,751	| IOT108 |	Phone so Lake
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,519	| IOT108 |	The nucleus
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:43,615	| IOT108 |	They have
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,151	| IOT108 |	I think it's just one
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:45,919	| IOT108 |	1 FedEx
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:46,943	| IOT108 |	A secret
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:49,503	| IOT108 |	But they just put it in the Amazon voice services
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:51,807	| IOT108 |	What race really is is
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,087	| IOT108 |	A better listener
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,879	| IOT108 |	Device
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:57,951	| IOT108 |	It's also I look at this and I'm like
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,719	| IOT108 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:03,071	| IOT108 |	Basically Amazon so I can't voice is going to be an essential UI of the future and we want people getting
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,351	| IOT108 |	Used to using
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:06,143	| IOT108 |	Our voice system
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,167	| IOT108 |	Sure
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,727	| IOT108 |	Just to add to what you had said about
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:10,751	| IOT108 |	How that can now make
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:17,151	| IOT108 |	Devices with the 7 Mike's it also supports beamforming noise reduction Echo cancellation so
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,431	| IOT108 |	Something like a nucleus
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,455	| IOT108 |	Probably don't need that
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,735	| IOT108 |	But
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:23,551	| IOT108 |	Home assistant type devices which
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,599	| IOT108 |	Seem to be cropping up every week now
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:27,135	| IOT108 |	That I could see why
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:29,951	| IOT108 |	Harbor makers would want you know the full feature set
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,511	| IOT108 |	No I'm
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,279	| IOT108 |	Curious bee
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,303	| IOT108 |	Because I don't know if this has it
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,095	| IOT108 |	Amazon has
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:39,423	| IOT108 |	I feel like after Google announced
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:41,215	| IOT108 |	Because Google has something that basically
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:45,823	| IOT108 |	Pics when you are in a room and you talked to something at picks the closest available
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,871	| IOT108 |	Assistant device that can
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,639	| IOT108 |	Panda lyrics
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:52,735	| IOT108 |	Quest so Amazon has something called ESP in that stands for
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,015	| IOT108 |	Echo spatial
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:54,527	| IOT108 |	Perception
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,319	| IOT108 |	That's basically
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:09:00,415	| IOT108 |	So if you have a multiple Echo devices are. Surround
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:00,927	| IOT108 |	Your house
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:02,719	| IOT108 |	The closest one
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:05,023	| IOT108 |	Bright and
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,071	| IOT108 |	I don't know I assume that the
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:11,167	| IOT108 |	If it's a software update but I assume that your Hardware
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:17,567	| IOT108 |	Implementation would have this in the reason we bring this up is because holy cow we're putting Madame egg
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,079	| IOT108 |	And everything
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,359	| IOT108 |	Right
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:21,407	| IOT108 |	Just real quick I don't think
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:25,759	| IOT108 |	I don't know if Google has something similar like if you had multiple homes and the only reason I say that
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:28,319	| IOT108 |	I don't have a home so I can't say for sure
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,367	| IOT108 |	I keep hearing from multiple people
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:35,999	| IOT108 |	When I say the Wake word for Google home then my phone which is also set for the same wake word
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:39,071	| IOT108 |	Is firing up in responding and then I have
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:42,655	| IOT108 |	Seen that with multiple Android phones that I have so
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:45,727	| IOT108 |	I'm not sure if there's a similar Solution on the Google sign
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,007	| IOT108 |	You don't
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,543	| IOT108 |	I talked about having something
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:51,359	| IOT108 |	But I have had that problem I actually talked to her
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,175	| IOT108 |	Weeks ago cuz I was trying to
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,711	| IOT108 |	Get something started and I
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:57,247	| IOT108 |	I had to leave my phone elsewhere to get it
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:58,271	| IOT108 |	But
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:02,367	| IOT108 |	Pretty sure they talked about having a way to do that other than and I should say
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:04,159	| IOT108 |	You can always use
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,951	| IOT108 |	Okay g
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:07,999	| IOT108 |	For one device and Haji
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:08,511	| IOT108 |	Pretty
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,559	| IOT108 |	True
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:17,215	| IOT108 |	Well that's a thing and then I don't want to do that because I don't want to have to remember it sounds stupid but
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:19,007	| IOT108 |	Eventually you know when you have like
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:21,823	| IOT108 |	Today I have four five things listening all the time
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:25,663	| IOT108 |	I would imagine I have double that number in a year
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:29,247	| IOT108 |	I don't want to remember their names I can barely remember the names of my two kids so
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,527	| IOT108 |	I don't want to
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,807	| IOT108 |	Popular wake words for everything
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:34,111	| IOT108 |	Yeah well that actually so
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:36,927	| IOT108 |	What are the news items that were talking about this week
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,951	| IOT108 |	Because our buddy
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:40,255	| IOT108 |	Steve's at work
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:43,071	| IOT108 |	Who despite having a
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,607	| IOT108 |	A young child is still
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,375	| IOT108 |	Breaking stories
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:49,215	| IOT108 |	He found that the next version of ecobee 4
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,007	| IOT108 |	It's going to have
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:57,151	| IOT108 |	Metal May hanging out in there he actually found this information out prior we weren't sure about
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:00,735	| IOT108 |	Vehicle before I think it was another FTC filing
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:03,807	| IOT108 |	I'm sorry FCC find my phone
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:05,087	| IOT108 |	Camping difference there
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:05,599	| IOT108 |	But now
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:08,927	| IOT108 |	He's actually got a picture of the a blue light
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:11,487	| IOT108 |	Bar on the top of ecobee4 Witchwood
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,767	| IOT108 |	Simulate the blue
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:15,071	| IOT108 |	Light ring of an echo for example
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:20,703	| IOT108 |	We already saw the potential for speaker on the back of it I would say obviously there's a speaker on the back of it now
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,471	| IOT108 |	So
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,775	| IOT108 |	It's interesting I don't know we don't
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:25,823	| IOT108 |	Knowing anything about pricing or than cuz
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:28,383	| IOT108 |	Ecobee has an announcement so it's just this is just
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,663	| IOT108 |	Foundry ICC testing
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:32,479	| IOT108 |	You know what that's going to add in terms of cost
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,271	| IOT108 |	Do people who already have
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,807	| IOT108 |	Echo devices
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,575	| IOT108 |	Are they going to
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:40,415	| IOT108 |	Buy this and have another microphone and speaker that they need any
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:42,975	| IOT108 |	So it feels
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:43,999	| IOT108 |	Additive
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,047	| IOT108 |	Person
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,327	| IOT108 |	Who's like
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:49,887	| IOT108 |	Oh maybe I want to get the smart home to try
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:51,679	| IOT108 |	I'd love to save money on my air conditioning
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:54,751	| IOT108 |	And this Adele also has
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,287	| IOT108 |	Diego
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,055	| IOT108 |	And it's so
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:59,615	| IOT108 |	Maybe in depending on the price point
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,383	| IOT108 |	You know
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:03,455	| IOT108 |	Havasu mean it's more than 250 which is the
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:06,527	| IOT108 |	Kind of Baseline for the high-end
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:12,415	| IOT108 |	If you don't have either of these devices maybe this looks good if you have one of these devices
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:14,207	| IOT108 |	I don't see it because
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:18,815	| IOT108 |	You can already control these devices through what you already have right
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:24,447	| IOT108 |	And it's not like you're going to buy this is your first Echo device and play music on all day because of speakers not
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,215	| IOT108 |	Going to be loud
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:28,031	| IOT108 |	But if you are getting into the smart
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,079	| IOT108 |	This might be a tree
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:32,383	| IOT108 |	Interesting way to do it cuz you could just buy
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,943	| IOT108 |	A smart thermostat + a light bulb
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:37,247	| IOT108 |	You know you've got
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,039	| IOT108 |	We talked about
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:41,343	| IOT108 |	Buying someone a. Plus a little
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:42,623	| IOT108 |	Switch module and how
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,439	| IOT108 |	So now you can buy them
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,463	| IOT108 |	Two connected
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,255	| IOT108 |	Devices the thermostat and the connect
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:50,047	| IOT108 |	Are the connected
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:50,559	| IOT108 |	Switch module
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,863	| IOT108 |	You know why I can see
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:53,887	| IOT108 |	Especially if you don't
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:54,911	| IOT108 |	Want
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,959	| IOT108 |	Speaker in your house
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:58,751	| IOT108 |	Like
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:00,799	| IOT108 |	45 Blackstone
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:07,711	| IOT108 |	I'm pretty keen on that personally but okay
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:13,599	| IOT108 |	Oh thank you so I can see that but
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:16,927	| IOT108 |	If there's other plans
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,975	| IOT108 |	GE has that weird glowing light
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:22,303	| IOT108 |	You know I can see pudding
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:25,375	| IOT108 |	The Temptation and the goal is clearly to put the echo
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:25,887	| IOT108 |	So in everything
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:27,679	| IOT108 |	Where to put Madam and
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:31,519	| IOT108 |	What do I really want to talk to
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:33,311	| IOT108 |	Do I want to talk to
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:36,383	| IOT108 |	Every single individual device or do I want to talk to like a butler
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,175	| IOT108 |	Lakeside Grill
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,711	| IOT108 |	Exactly
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:41,503	| IOT108 |	That's the key right there and I
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,783	| IOT108 |	And that's why I think
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:44,319	| IOT108 |	And I can put it very well be wrong
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:46,111	| IOT108 |	I think this'll
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:48,159	| IOT108 |	Probably not be as big as sellers
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:48,927	| IOT108 |	Oaks my
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,695	| IOT108 |	Extinct
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:53,023	| IOT108 |	Because if you already have the cylinders around your house
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:56,607	| IOT108 |	You're not going to buy this version of an ecobee4
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:57,887	| IOT108 |	I don't think
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:58,911	| IOT108 |	I agree with you
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:03,007	| IOT108 |	And so the big question is is this is the echo
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,031	| IOT108 |	Orem anime
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:08,383	| IOT108 |	Compelling feature that pushes someone over the edge into a smart home
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,919	| IOT108 |	I think it's probably however
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,735	| IOT108 |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,783	| IOT108 |	Let me put it to you this way you have multiple homes
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,831	| IOT108 |	That goes I keep doing that
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,695	| IOT108 |	Is not home
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:25,535	| IOT108 |	You have multiple echos as do I
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:28,607	| IOT108 |	Throughout the house every week pretty much outfit at our homes
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,887	| IOT108 |	With echoes
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:31,679	| IOT108 |	So would you
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:34,239	| IOT108 |	If you need a thermostat would you buy they go before with
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:37,567	| IOT108 |	Voice and speaker
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,591	| IOT108 |	I'm guessing not
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:40,639	| IOT108 |	Hohhot
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,735	| IOT108 |	3x speaking of ecobee
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:47,551	| IOT108 |	They just did a deal where they
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:52,159	| IOT108 |	Now that you could be late which sells for about $170
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:54,207	| IOT108 |	It works now with external sensor
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:57,279	| IOT108 |	So the reason that the light was late is because I didn't have this
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,071	| IOT108 |	Sensors
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:02,911	| IOT108 |	But now for 80 bucks you can buy a sensor Pack 4
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:03,935	| IOT108 |	Toby in that kitchen
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:06,495	| IOT108 |	Koala
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:07,775	| IOT108 |	You now have
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,311	| IOT108 |	It's not lighted
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:15,199	| IOT108 |	So just in case you guys are looking out there for the
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:15,967	| IOT108 |	Smart thermostat work
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,783	| IOT108 |	Maybe go that way and
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,319	| IOT108 |	Keep your
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,087	| IOT108 |	I go I don't know
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:22,623	| IOT108 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:25,695	| IOT108 |	So that's that's a little little bit of each of the news there
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:27,743	| IOT108 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:31,583	| IOT108 |	Should we talk about developer trans or should we keep going on thermostat
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:35,679	| IOT108 |	Let's keep going on thermostat sticking up thermostats
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,215	| IOT108 |	Why not temperature
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:38,239	| IOT108 |	Control is so exciting
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:44,127	| IOT108 |	Anna and I have a temperature control story from my weekend so
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:46,175	| IOT108 |	I like it
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:49,759	| IOT108 |	OKC were planning to hear you're watching the sausage get made right here
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:56,415	| IOT108 |	Yo I installed two weeks ago a Honeywell T5 thermostat
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:58,975	| IOT108 |	Breaking the great thermostat band
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:01,791	| IOT108 |	Of I think it was like 2813
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,351	| IOT108 |	No more no more
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:07,679	| IOT108 |	Big deal
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,447	| IOT108 |	So
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,983	| IOT108 |	I had some thoughts about
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:12,543	| IOT108 |	And I installed the T5i also
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,823	| IOT108 |	Got a version
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:14,591	| IOT108 |	Of the lyrics
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:16,127	| IOT108 |	Which is there voice control
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:16,895	| IOT108 |	Round
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,687	| IOT108 |	Thermostat what was interesting here
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:20,479	| IOT108 |	Is
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:22,271	| IOT108 |	Honeywell makes a universal
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:26,367	| IOT108 |	Plate that you install with your wiring against the wall
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:28,671	| IOT108 |	So you can actually pop any Honeywell
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,183	| IOT108 |	Well thermostat
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:30,719	| IOT108 |	Just write on
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:34,815	| IOT108 |	Which is really cool cuz as long as you're the Honeywell ecosystem
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,143	| IOT108 |	So
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:39,167	| IOT108 |	My call is
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:39,935	| IOT108 |	By God
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,959	| IOT108 |	Let's get a stand for
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:41,471	| IOT108 |	Call thermostat
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:43,775	| IOT108 |	We might be off
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,335	| IOT108 |	It would be very nice if
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:48,127	| IOT108 |	Because you know when I left my home
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:52,479	| IOT108 |	When I sold it last year and I had the The Nest down there I took the nest off
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:57,855	| IOT108 |	And like well because I painted around the plate and now they're going to have different colored different size plates
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:01,951	| IOT108 |	Are there thermostat I just I just left the nest I made such a hassle
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:05,791	| IOT108 |	I would be so mad if I showed up at the house and they taking the
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,559	| IOT108 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,095	| IOT108 |	Billiard
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:12,191	| IOT108 |	I suppose you're not supposed to listen to this technically wired to the house
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:14,239	| IOT108 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:17,055	| IOT108 |	This is a big debate
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,359	| IOT108 |	Oh no it's not making bag
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:22,687	| IOT108 |	I'd like that now I will say
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,991	| IOT108 |	That I've installed an ecobee
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:26,271	| IOT108 |	I've installed
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,039	| IOT108 |	The
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:27,807	| IOT108 |	Nest
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:31,647	| IOT108 |	The Honeywell was the least forgiving in terms of having Room 2
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,671	| IOT108 |	Pop my wires in
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:36,767	| IOT108 |	So I was doing some serious jam and some wires back into the wall
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,791	| IOT108 |	And some fairy
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:40,095	| IOT108 |	Delicate folding to try to just
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:42,143	| IOT108 |	Get that on there
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:43,679	| IOT108 |	But
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,215	| IOT108 |	The experience with the thermostat
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,007	| IOT108 |	Was good
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:48,543	| IOT108 |	I did call support
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:52,383	| IOT108 |	I'm at one point in their support was just bang on
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:52,895	| IOT108 |	Awesome
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:56,223	| IOT108 |	Good
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:18:01,087	| IOT108 |	Am I tip for anybody who's installing a thermostat because it's been awhile since I had done it
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:06,207	| IOT108 |	Is how the information about your existing HVAC system available to you
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:10,815	| IOT108 |	I feel like in the instructions for all of these devices they should actually put
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,095	| IOT108 |	A little questionnaire like
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,119	| IOT108 |	You have a heat pump
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:17,983	| IOT108 |	Debra, Dwyer yeah that forces you to go through this
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:19,007	| IOT108 |	Because
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:22,335	| IOT108 |	Every thermostats going to ask you these questions and if you have it if
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,359	| IOT108 |	If you answer wrong
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:25,151	| IOT108 |	You're probably going to
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:26,431	| IOT108 |	End up like spewing
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:27,199	| IOT108 |	Hot air when you want
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:28,991	| IOT108 |	And another tip
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:32,063	| IOT108 |	When you take your old thermostat off
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:33,855	| IOT108 |	Before you remove the wiring
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:37,183	| IOT108 |	Take a photo of how it is connected via the wires
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:43,327	| IOT108 |	Adidas for two reasons one it makes it easy to transition the wires to the new thermostat so you can measure everything up
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:47,935	| IOT108 |	It sometimes the colored wires are not the correct colors and someone other than that label correctly
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:49,471	| IOT108 |	What to if you
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:52,543	| IOT108 |	For some reason can get your new thermostat working to get up hook up the alarm again
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,335	| IOT108 |	Is there any easy to redo it
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:55,615	| IOT108 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:58,431	| IOT108 |	And actually in the Honeywell install
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:59,455	| IOT108 |	They actually give you
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:01,247	| IOT108 |	I took my picture
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:03,807	| IOT108 |	But they actually give you a checklist where you
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:05,599	| IOT108 |	You're supposed to match your wires like
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,903	| IOT108 |	Before you do anything exactly
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:09,183	| IOT108 |	Where does your yellow wire
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,231	| IOT108 |	It goes to the White
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:16,095	| IOT108 |	You know you're coming about standardized
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,631	| IOT108 |	Plate System
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:20,191	| IOT108 |	Ashley resonates with me because
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:25,055	| IOT108 |	As I mentioned selling the old house it was a hassle with an S do I keep it to another what do I do with it
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,871	| IOT108 |	Imagine how many people
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:29,919	| IOT108 |	Don't buy these things
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:33,503	| IOT108 |	Or don't invest in Smart Home Products in general because they're
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,271	| IOT108 |	They may be
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,063	| IOT108 |	Continue moving in next couple of years
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:41,439	| IOT108 |	Well if you have a standardized Plate System you can make the investment and not worry
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:45,023	| IOT108 |	In a sense that the other the new people can be kind of screwed or whatever
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,119	| IOT108 |	Exactly
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:53,983	| IOT108 |	Really want it once a month
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:58,079	| IOT108 |	Said that bad but it's cool
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:00,639	| IOT108 |	Thermostat probably every two years but like
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:03,199	| IOT108 |	Every five years may make sense for
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:07,295	| IOT108 |	People in this is a really good thing that this would be great for the industry I don't
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:08,319	| IOT108 |	Bakery
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:11,135	| IOT108 |	This is this is a way to
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:12,671	| IOT108 |	To resolve
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,439	| IOT108 |	Boats
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:15,999	| IOT108 |	Industry if you're listening this is a good idea
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:16,511	| IOT108 |	Take it
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:17,791	| IOT108 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:20,351	| IOT108 |	Let's see the other Honeywell device that I had
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,887	| IOT108 |	So I did the T5
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,399	| IOT108 |	And
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:27,519	| IOT108 |	I did the water sensor we talked about this is an $80 Wi-Fi power
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,543	| IOT108 |	Water and leaked it
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,335	| IOT108 |	That has
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,359	| IOT108 |	Both the sensor
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:33,407	| IOT108 |	Module things
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:34,175	| IOT108 |	Square
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:36,223	| IOT108 |	It also comes with this for footlong
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:42,367	| IOT108 |	That you can wrap around a pipe or just extend along so it gives you more surface area to detect
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,135	| IOT108 |	Weeks cell
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:44,415	| IOT108 |	Apple
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,951	| IOT108 |	It is I love this sensor
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:48,511	| IOT108 |	So I got that I installed that
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,559	| IOT108 |	And you can daisy chain actually
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,327	| IOT108 |	Four of the
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,095	| IOT108 |	The cords together
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,631	| IOT108 |	Sulekha July 6th
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:56,191	| IOT108 |	That's a lot
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:01,567	| IOT108 |	So there's two things to know about this one is because it's Wi-Fi and battery powered
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:04,127	| IOT108 |	You have to actually spend
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:07,967	| IOT108 |	It only checks in once a day to see if it's a check like temperature and other
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:11,039	| IOT108 |	You can set it for more often but then your battery is going to
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:12,575	| IOT108 |	Diminished
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,343	| IOT108 |	Broccoli
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:13,855	| IOT108 |	But
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,391	| IOT108 |	When it gets wet
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:18,720	| IOT108 |	Only way to shut it off is basically reset the device
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:19,744	| IOT108 |	Batteries out
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:23,584	| IOT108 |	As a as a tester this sucked
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:27,168	| IOT108 |	Because I was like how much water does it take not a lot
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:27,936	| IOT108 |	That's great
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:30,240	| IOT108 |	I got to be added to my
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:33,056	| IOT108 |	But
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:36,384	| IOT108 |	It does make sense because presumably this is not a device it's actually gonna
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:39,712	| IOT108 |	What it does go off you're probably like
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:40,480	| IOT108 |	Oh crap
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:41,248	| IOT108 |	My house is leaking
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:42,272	| IOT108 |	You know
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:45,344	| IOT108 |	You'll take it you'll shut that off and then you'll deal with your leak and then
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:50,208	| IOT108 |	That's true I wish I hope that in the future they caught up
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:52,256	| IOT108 |	I would like a beauty
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,048	| IOT108 |	They say they have
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:57,632	| IOT108 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:58,912	| IOT108 |	So
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:03,008	| IOT108 |	So this all ties into where I visited this weekend which I did not plan to visit
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:04,800	| IOT108 |	But I'm glad I did
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:08,128	| IOT108 |	Because this place could really use some of the stuff we talked about on the show
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:12,224	| IOT108 |	I went I went out in Arizona for the weekend we were visiting colleges
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:16,576	| IOT108 |	And on a win we drove two hours from Phoenix to Tucson
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:18,112	| IOT108 |	And then the answer to Tucson
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,904	| IOT108 |	In Oracle Junction
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:20,672	| IOT108 |	At work like
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:23,232	| IOT108 |	Is the biosphere
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,256	| IOT108 |	To which
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:27,072	| IOT108 |	For younger people you may not
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:29,120	| IOT108 |	Remember this but I do remember
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:34,752	| IOT108 |	People living in the biosphere for two full years like 1991 to 1993
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:37,568	| IOT108 |	Which at that time was it completely closed
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,104	| IOT108 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:45,248	| IOT108 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,552	| IOT108 |	It was noted there was no Netflix
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,320	| IOT108 |	No
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:50,112	| IOT108 |	No it would life was tough kids
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:56,512	| IOT108 |	This is an amazing place I highly recommend you visit if this is your thing it's just
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:59,328	| IOT108 |	Interesting science experiment and they still run
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,632	| IOT108 |	Lots of science experiments to determine
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:05,216	| IOT108 |	The impact of CO2 on climate and so on and what not because
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:08,288	| IOT108 |	It is literally it can be a completely closed
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:09,824	| IOT108 |	System
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:14,176	| IOT108 |	Meaning no outside air or water or anything get in
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:16,224	| IOT108 |	And none of the stuff is inside gets out
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:16,992	| IOT108 |	Right
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:17,504	| IOT108 |	So
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:20,832	| IOT108 |	What was interesting and relevant to the show however
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,112	| IOT108 |	Was
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:29,024	| IOT108 |	I got a tour and we got to go underneath the biosphere which is multiple I mean a couple hundred acres this place you know
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:31,072	| IOT108 |	Glass domes and whatnot
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:31,840	| IOT108 |	Because there is
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:35,168	| IOT108 |	A rainforest room there's a desert room then there's there's a
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:38,752	| IOT108 |	Literally you think you're in a desert or the rainforest could they be simulated
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:39,520	| IOT108 |	And they paid
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,800	| IOT108 |	They actually built it that way
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:46,432	| IOT108 |	But to do that they have to control all of the air the water
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:47,968	| IOT108 |	Everything else is air pressure
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:53,088	| IOT108 |	And it's all done by computer controls through a control an energy center that's
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:56,416	| IOT108 |	Obviously to attach via wires but it's a separate building
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:58,464	| IOT108 |	And a single person
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:00,512	| IOT108 |	Because it's all computerized can actually
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:03,328	| IOT108 |	Monitor and change things so
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:05,632	| IOT108 |	They could use they have some
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:11,264	| IOT108 |	I'll call Early industrial iot stuff because up there a lot of computer control valves and such to do all this
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:15,360	| IOT108 |	I can easily see the meeting water sensors and maybe they have them and just didn't show them
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,128	| IOT108 |	Because
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:19,712	| IOT108 |	All the water inside the biosphere is already there
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,480	| IOT108 |	It literally
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:27,392	| IOT108 |	They put water into their ocean room and evaporates and then they condense the air and they recapture the the water
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:29,440	| IOT108 |	And the recirculated and solids
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:30,720	| IOT108 |	Auburn
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:33,536	| IOT108 |	750000 gallon tanks of water in this place
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:37,376	| IOT108 |	I got two prisoners water leak sensors in there but again I did not see any
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:39,168	| IOT108 |	In any case
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:42,496	| IOT108 |	It's just it was really amazing to see what I would
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:45,312	| IOT108 |	Consider early industrial iot on such a scale
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:48,896	| IOT108 |	For an interesting project like that so
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,688	| IOT108 |	Just something that
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:53,248	| IOT108 |	Kind of tied in with the show I thought I mentioned
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:54,784	| IOT108 |	That's like old school
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:56,320	| IOT108 |	Yes it is
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:56,832	| IOT108 |	Yes it is
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:58,880	| IOT108 |	Today would be less custom
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:00,672	| IOT108 |	Cheaper I don't know
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:04,768	| IOT108 |	Snooze beds
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:06,048	| IOT108 |	Logitech pop
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,072	| IOT108 |	They make a
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:07,840	| IOT108 |	Button
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:09,376	| IOT108 |	It is literally a fun button
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:12,192	| IOT108 |	Or $60 they now make a
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:12,960	| IOT108 |	Homekit
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:13,472	| IOT108 |	Button
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:16,800	| IOT108 |	August
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:19,360	| IOT108 |	The original Legend
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:19,872	| IOT108 |	Might be
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:26,784	| IOT108 |	And you can do three commands on this thing and I think there's a 1-tap a to tapping a person hold
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:30,112	| IOT108 |	Press and hold
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,976	| IOT108 |	All right
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:35,744	| IOT108 |	Messi
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:36,768	| IOT108 |	August locks
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:41,632	| IOT108 |	Has done a deal with HomeAway which is one of those vacation rental places
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:43,424	| IOT108 |	And now you can
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:44,704	| IOT108 |	Basically if you stick a
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:46,240	| IOT108 |	August lock on your door you can
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:50,336	| IOT108 |	Do an integration it's kind of like the integration they've done with Airbnb
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:56,736	| IOT108 |	So when someone signs up and they're running an app they can get into the house using the August lock
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:26:02,880	| IOT108 |	Handy funny that you say that because while I was away this weekend in Arizona I had my front door painted here my townhouse
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:06,464	| IOT108 |	And I didn't know I was getting it painted needed a second coat
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:08,768	| IOT108 |	And I didn't realize that I was coming back this weekend so
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:11,328	| IOT108 |	Literally as I'm having breakfast in Arizona
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,864	| IOT108 |	He sent me an email says
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:16,960	| IOT108 |	Hey I'll be over 20 minutes to paint front door and give it a second coat in like no I'm not there
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:22,080	| IOT108 |	Sure enough I was like just text me when you get there cuz I want to give my code
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:24,384	| IOT108 |	Cuz I have a keypad code as well
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:28,224	| IOT108 |	And I'm like I'm just going to go into my Wink app and
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:31,040	| IOT108 |	Slide little slider and unlock the door when he gets there he was awesome
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:36,160	| IOT108 |	He knew about that already
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:37,184	| IOT108 |	Cuz I told him
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:40,256	| IOT108 |	When was painting the first time I gave to the lock locks on you
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,280	| IOT108 |	Your painting don't freak out
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:48,448	| IOT108 |	If anything was behind the nest cam going as well so I could see that he got in and didn't do anything nefarious to the house
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:50,240	| IOT108 |	And why not
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:53,056	| IOT108 |	It was a nice application biote
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:55,360	| IOT108 |	Yuriko IRT guys
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,128	| IOT108 |	All right
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:57,152	| IOT108 |	We should let see
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:27:00,224	| IOT108 |	Let's talk about the iot developer Trends survey
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:02,272	| IOT108 |	Cuz that
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:03,552	| IOT108 |	That's
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:06,112	| IOT108 |	I thought so they do this
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,392	| IOT108 |	Every year
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,416	| IOT108 |	Well they did last year
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:14,560	| IOT108 |	2015-16 and 17
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:21,216	| IOT108 |	So the big thing that I thought was probably most interesting for our listeners is that Amazon is the top
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:24,032	| IOT108 |	Cloud is the top iot Cloud platform
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:26,080	| IOT108 |	MRSA when you're hosting your iot stuff
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:27,872	| IOT108 |	You're hosting an AWS
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:31,200	| IOT108 |	Let's see 42.7% of the time
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:33,760	| IOT108 |	I'm actually not surprised by that
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:35,040	| IOT108 |	I'll tell you why
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:37,600	| IOT108 |	And it's actually has to do with what I do at work
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:39,136	| IOT108 |	Because I work with the Google Cloud team
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:41,440	| IOT108 |	And I'm often looking at
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:45,792	| IOT108 |	Who is cloud is being used the most for what purposes and it is
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:50,400	| IOT108 |	AWS without a doubt is bleeder in just about every area that I have researched so far
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:52,960	| IOT108 |	Microsoft is a strong second with Google being third
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:54,496	| IOT108 |	Microsoft is big in the
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,800	| IOT108 |	Yes
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:58,080	| IOT108 |	So that's that
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:27:59,872	| IOT108 |	They also had
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,920	| IOT108 |	IBM bluemix was still hanging out in there
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:04,736	| IOT108 |	GE predix is way down the list
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:06,016	| IOT108 |	So
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:10,112	| IOT108 |	The other thing that I thought was really interesting is they looked at
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:11,904	| IOT108 |	Connectivity protocols
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:12,928	| IOT108 |	And
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:13,952	| IOT108 |	Thread
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:15,232	| IOT108 |	Is seem like
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,512	| IOT108 |	Nothing
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:22,656	| IOT108 |	Tiny tiny tiny adoption at 6.4%
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:26,496	| IOT108 |	It was just this year I feel like that it really came out with their actual
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:30,080	| IOT108 |	It's definitely does not have first-mover status
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:32,896	| IOT108 |	The biggest protocol is TCP IP
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:34,432	| IOT108 |	Which
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:36,480	| IOT108 |	Makes total sense followed by Wi-Fi
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:40,064	| IOT108 |	Cellular is actually
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:40,832	| IOT108 |	The next most common
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:41,856	| IOT108 |	And
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:43,904	| IOT108 |	Way down there is like
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:48,256	| IOT108 |	Zigbee which makes sense cuz there's a lot of light bulbs running zigbee out there
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:48,768	| IOT108 |	And then
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:50,560	| IOT108 |	We get into like cereal
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:53,120	| IOT108 |	Lora sigfox and all that
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:56,192	| IOT108 |	Those aren't those are way down
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:58,752	| IOT108 |	It will include a link to the actual
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:28:59,776	| IOT108 |	Report in the show notes
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:02,592	| IOT108 |	And then security is the top concern
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:06,944	| IOT108 |	Still good if it wasn't as high as I would have thought though
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:10,272	| IOT108 |	Not about security
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:15,136	| IOT108 |	But it is in the follow that's followed by interoperability
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:16,928	| IOT108 |	So we're still not there at
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:17,440	| IOT108 |	Fertility
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:22,304	| IOT108 |	We do have lots of middleware options were going to see some more stuff coming actually there
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:29,728	| IOT108 |	In the security technology cuz I asked about the top security related technologies that were being used for iot
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:33,568	| IOT108 |	One was basically TLS and dtls is the
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:35,616	| IOT108 |	The top option which makes sense
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,640	| IOT108 |	Skip test
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:37,920	| IOT108 |	Everybody I know is like yes
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:39,200	| IOT108 |	Start there
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:40,736	| IOT108 |	In data encryption followed that
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:42,272	| IOT108 |	In a pretty closely
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:44,576	| IOT108 |	What I did think was
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:48,416	| IOT108 |	We're talking about is Hardware oriented Security Solutions were less
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,440	| IOT108 |	Popular
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:53,024	| IOT108 |	Yeah that's surprising to me too
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:53,792	| IOT108 |	Now
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:55,840	| IOT108 |	Homekit uses Ace Hardware
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:57,888	| IOT108 |	Oriented security solution yes
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:58,400	| IOT108 |	It does
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:29:59,680	| IOT108 |	And
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:02,496	| IOT108 |	Now I will say so I talked to the head of
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:07,360	| IOT108 |	Now he's got a crazy title but he's at nxp and he's head of he basically works on security platform
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:11,712	| IOT108 |	He said that they have like they have secure element
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,480	| IOT108 |	It is one of their that's there
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:14,528	| IOT108 |	Where based security
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:19,136	| IOT108 |	You said they put that on there if people buy it and they think they're using it
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:23,744	| IOT108 |	But in a lot of cases the way they're writing their firmware or their OS
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:25,536	| IOT108 |	It doesn't take advantage of
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:30,912	| IOT108 |	Because the software developers working on somebody's project don't know how to tie it back to the heart
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:35,520	| IOT108 |	Okay so I can see to things here one is what you mentioned in that
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:40,384	| IOT108 |	There is some level of effort required to integrate your software to work with a secure Hardware
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:44,992	| IOT108 |	And to I would imagine any Hardware security solution would also add cost
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:50,112	| IOT108 |	I wonder if these are part of the reasons why this adoption other usage is lower
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:56,512	| IOT108 |	So cost is coming down I actually so it's about $0.50 to a dollar so I talked to another chip
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:59,328	| IOT108 |	Person I talk to someone at silicon Labs who's working on the iot
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:02,656	| IOT108 |	And he said it's 2017 he anticipates
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,936	| IOT108 |	The cost to come down
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:04,960	| IOT108 |	Quite significant
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:06,496	| IOT108 |	Because security
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:07,520	| IOT108 |	Such a concern
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:10,080	| IOT108 |	So I think that's going to go away but I do think
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:12,384	| IOT108 |	The knowledge required to connect these two
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:13,664	| IOT108 |	It's going to
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:14,688	| IOT108 |	I have to work on
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:18,272	| IOT108 |	It sounded like like when
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:20,576	| IOT108 |	You say he would talk to the CEOs of these
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:22,368	| IOT108 |	Company
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:23,904	| IOT108 |	We got a hardware element
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:24,928	| IOT108 |	And they think they're
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:25,440	| IOT108 |	Can you sing it
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:27,232	| IOT108 |	Imagineers think they're you
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:29,280	| IOT108 |	But they're not actually
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:31,328	| IOT108 |	That's that's actually pretty scary
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:34,144	| IOT108 |	It is
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:34,912	| IOT108 |	He's a call we work with him
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:38,240	| IOT108 |	But so
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:39,264	| IOT108 |	Yeah take that is
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:41,056	| IOT108 |	Scary
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:42,592	| IOT108 |	Which is why I actually Microsoft
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:47,968	| IOT108 |	Comedies like electric imp are looking at a platform approach that actually tie those things together
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:49,248	| IOT108 |	Which
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:50,784	| IOT108 |	I wouldn't that actually
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:54,624	| IOT108 |	Yeah cuz security
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:56,672	| IOT108 |	Yeah
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:58,464	| IOT108 |	Feel like we
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:00,512	| IOT108 |	I talked about a lot of things this show
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:02,048	| IOT108 |	And
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:06,400	| IOT108 |	Feel like we should probably get to our sponsor message and our guests for this week
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:08,192	| IOT108 |	Which is
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:08,960	| IOT108 |	The CEO of
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:09,984	| IOT108 |	Bitmark
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:13,568	| IOT108 |	We are going to talk about creating digital property rights
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,360	| IOT108 |	And how we have perhaps
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:17,920	| IOT108 |	Done everything with the internet
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,688	| IOT108 |	Wrong
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,200	| IOT108 |	In the past
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:21,248	| IOT108 |	So yeah I know
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:28,416	| IOT108 |	So stay tuned for that because it's actually really fun and interesting conversation hey everyone this
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:34,816	| IOT108 |	Stacy breaking into the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:37,376	| IOT108 |	And I have Linden Tibbets here
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:39,168	| IOT108 |	Taylor Swift
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:41,472	| IOT108 |	Lyft allow
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:41,984	| IOT108 |	Anyone
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:45,312	| IOT108 |	To get their services and devices to work together
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:47,872	| IOT108 |	We want to be the standard
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:48,896	| IOT108 |	Or data access
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:52,480	| IOT108 |	Can I use it all the time so thank you
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:56,320	| IOT108 |	When did you're in a unique position to see so many iot devices
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:58,368	| IOT108 |	Are there any Trends you can share with
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:01,184	| IOT108 |	Absolutely what's really fast music
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:04,000	| IOT108 |	If we seen from talking about hardware and devices
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:07,072	| IOT108 |	The talking about services in API every device
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:07,584	| IOT108 |	To the service
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:10,400	| IOT108 |	Whether it's your phone your car your watcher
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:13,472	| IOT108 |	Thermostat refrigerator from our perspective
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:15,520	| IOT108 |	That Hardware that physical device is just
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:16,544	| IOT108 |	The starting point
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:17,824	| IOT108 |	First service
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:19,360	| IOT108 |	Experience that you can have
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:20,384	| IOT108 |	With your cuss
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:22,432	| IOT108 |	Whatever the internet touches
EDL	00:33:22,432	00:33:23,968	| IOT108 |	It tracks in it empowers
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:25,504	| IOT108 |	I'm changing all of our stuff
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:26,784	| IOT108 |	Every noun
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:28,320	| IOT108 |	Into a verb
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:32,160	| IOT108 |	Software is truly eating the world and see the World in a really good way
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:33,440	| IOT108 |	Experiences are getting
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:34,464	| IOT108 |	Much much better
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:35,232	| IOT108 |	Overtime
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:37,024	| IOT108 |	For all of these new services
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:38,304	| IOT108 |	Where should they be trying to reach
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:41,888	| IOT108 |	What's your bet on the next interface
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:42,400	| IOT108 |	Sza voice
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:47,776	| IOT108 |	Two voices going to elderly be a huge deal if it's already
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:49,824	| IOT108 |	We're still just kind of in this almost like this
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:53,152	| IOT108 |	Free iPhone remote for voice imagine in 10 years
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:54,944	| IOT108 |	It's going to be one of the primary ways
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:55,456	| IOT108 |	Which we interact
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,760	| IOT108 |	With the internet in our services
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:59,296	| IOT108 |	But what's so fascinating
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:01,600	| IOT108 |	Is that interfaces are really additive
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:05,184	| IOT108 |	She didn't kill the radio and in fact we're on a podcast right now
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:10,048	| IOT108 |	Free free right there every new interface is really a new way in addition
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:16,448	| IOT108 |	Call the current ways that we interact with the internet and we have this huge wave of potential new interface
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:21,568	| IOT108 |	Is coming down the pipeline voices one of us but there is everything related to arbr
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:22,592	| IOT108 |	We talked about chatbots
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:24,640	| IOT108 |	Your TVs are becoming more
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:29,248	| IOT108 |	What services and in devices
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:30,784	| IOT108 |	Think about
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:31,808	| IOT108 |	How do they have
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:32,576	| IOT108 |	Presents
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:33,344	| IOT108 |	How
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,112	| IOT108 |	Does Derek
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:37,696	| IOT108 |	Experience extend across kind of this never-ending March
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:38,976	| IOT108 |	Interfaces
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:42,304	| IOT108 |	How do I set themselves up for successful experiences
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:43,072	| IOT108 |	Given that
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:44,864	| IOT108 |	New interfaces apartments.com
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:48,448	| IOT108 |	So then what's your advice for iot companies trying to stand out
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:55,616	| IOT108 |	Try and see this future of more more devices more interfaces more data as a huge opportunity
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:57,408	| IOT108 |	From the get-go develop an integration
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:35:00,992	| IOT108 |	Unless you're the very first serve it that your customers invested in
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:03,040	| IOT108 |	It's very likely that your customers are going to have a
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:08,928	| IOT108 |	Big question as they're making a purchasing decision or whether or not your product is going to work with all the stuff they already have
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:09,696	| IOT108 |	Still working
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:10,464	| IOT108 |	Incredibly

EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:10,624	| IOT108 |	What is kind of cool
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:11,904	| IOT108 |	Cool idea about property
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:14,464	| IOT108 |	And digital ownership and I was like
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:14,976	| IOT108 |	Hello
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:16,768	| IOT108 |	Let's not keep people in suspense
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,816	| IOT108 |	Let's talk about kind of
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:20,608	| IOT108 |	Your thoughts about
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:21,632	| IOT108 |	How we're treating
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:22,400	| IOT108 |	Property
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:23,680	| IOT108 |	In a digital era
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:26,496	| IOT108 |	So on today's internet and this involves also Internet of Things
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:29,824	| IOT108 |	It's individuals that are creating all the value
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:32,896	| IOT108 |	But we're giving away almost all of these assets for free
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:36,224	| IOT108 |	The two companies that then take these and use them for
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:37,760	| IOT108 |	Quote-unquote Big Data
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:38,784	| IOT108 |	Which is really
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:41,344	| IOT108 |	Selling the analytics to other companies for profit
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:46,720	| IOT108 |	Okay and you're talking about my content like the things I'm creating on Facebook or
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:48,000	| IOT108 |	Maybe it's my
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:49,024	| IOT108 |	Camera data that
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:50,048	| IOT108 |	Submitting
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:51,328	| IOT108 |	Two-ness
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:54,400	| IOT108 |	Yea or it's your playlist to make on Spotify
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,168	| IOT108 |	Like if you just look
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,448	| IOT108 |	Kind of
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:37:00,544	| IOT108 |	Completely analytically at any one of the evaluations of these big companies
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:03,616	| IOT108 |	And you say what does it cost to license all of the world's music
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:09,504	| IOT108 |	And what is the valuation of say Spotify for example and there's a massive gap between the two
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:15,136	| IOT108 |	And then you go to a school where is that value coming from that justify such a high valuation
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:16,416	| IOT108 |	End
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:17,952	| IOT108 |	We believe that it's because
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:21,280	| IOT108 |	The accounting so the value that's being created by individuals
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:22,048	| IOT108 |	Is off the books
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:23,584	| IOT108 |	Yet
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:26,656	| IOT108 |	In the eyes of a adventure capitalist it's absolutely on the
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:31,776	| IOT108 |	Okay so your thought is as a user of all these services
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:35,360	| IOT108 |	My data is worth something and we should figure out how to act
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:39,456	| IOT108 |	Account for it yes so our vision if you will the perspective is that
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:41,760	| IOT108 |	Data is the next major asset class
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:42,528	| IOT108 |	And
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:46,368	| IOT108 |	Until individuals can assert ownership rights over their data
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:53,280	| IOT108 |	That on the power that can come out of that asset class in terms of freedom in terms of wealth in terms of privacy
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:53,792	| IOT108 |	Realized
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:56,864	| IOT108 |	Okay so how do you propose we do that
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:38:03,776	| IOT108 |	So this requires like a really brief history lesson right until property is this kind of strange abstract things
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:05,056	| IOT108 |	Michael's back hundreds of years
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:06,336	| IOT108 |	Property came out of
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:07,872	| IOT108 |	Land ownership
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:10,688	| IOT108 |	And something known as the enclosure movement
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:12,224	| IOT108 |	Square Farmers
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:13,504	| IOT108 |	Literally he said
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:14,528	| IOT108 |	I'm going to start
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:16,064	| IOT108 |	Boxing in my land
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:20,416	| IOT108 |	Before this happens only kings and queens in churches could own land and so there was this
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:24,256	| IOT108 |	Not very smooth in a very radical process.
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:28,096	| IOT108 |	Came to a conclusion in 1801 when Parliament created
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:30,656	| IOT108 |	The notion of individual private property
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:34,752	| IOT108 |	A very similar thing happened with knowledge with ideas with patents and trademarks
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:36,032	| IOT108 |	End
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:36,800	| IOT108 |	After
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:39,360	| IOT108 |	The democratization if you will
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:42,944	| IOT108 |	The ownership of land as an asset or knowledge as an asset
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:47,808	| IOT108 |	The moment individuals could own that it was a very short period of time before
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:50,112	| IOT108 |	The Agricultural Revolution happened
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:51,904	| IOT108 |	The Industrial Revolution happen
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:54,464	| IOT108 |	And so it's this theme if you will of
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:57,536	| IOT108 |	Democratizing who can own what an out of that
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:38:58,304	| IOT108 |	Comes
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:38:59,584	| IOT108 |	A massive growth
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:00,096	| IOT108 |	In Market
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:02,144	| IOT108 |	And so we look at
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:03,680	| IOT108 |	The 3rd
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:05,728	| IOT108 |	I'm stuck if you will is
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:07,520	| IOT108 |	Data as an asset class
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:09,568	| IOT108 |	And if individuals could own that
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:10,848	| IOT108 |	Then
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:12,128	| IOT108 |	You could have
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:17,760	| IOT108 |	I don't actually know what this name is called sometimes we call it information revolution but people think that's what I've already happened
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:24,160	| IOT108 |	But there's going to be something that will happen once individuals can assert ownership over their data and it becomes an asset
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:25,696	| IOT108 |	Class that generates wealth for them
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:30,048	| IOT108 |	This idea that is transferring this concept of old-school title Spacek
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:30,816	| IOT108 |	2
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:32,096	| IOT108 |	My data
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:32,864	| IOT108 |	Yeah that's right
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:34,400	| IOT108 |	I feel like
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:37,984	| IOT108 |	We shouldn't be talking about property rights at all we should be talking about
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:41,056	| IOT108 |	Ownership of data which
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:42,336	| IOT108 |	You're saying should be treated like
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:44,896	| IOT108 |	But it's really not
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:46,176	| IOT108 |	About property
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:47,200	| IOT108 |	It's really just about owning
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:53,856	| IOT108 |	Let me come back to it this way right so if this this relationship between titling assets
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:57,952	| IOT108 |	Ownership property property rights are all intertwined and
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:58,464	| IOT108 |	I think the
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:01,024	| IOT108 |	Simplest way to think about this is that
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:01,792	| IOT108 |	You need
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:05,376	| IOT108 |	A record of who owns white and from that record
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,400	| IOT108 |	You have
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:09,728	| IOT108 |	Titles that are being stored in a property as a title plus an acid
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:11,776	| IOT108 |	And now you want to say okay what what are the rights to
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:14,336	| IOT108 |	Talk about water rights are rights whatever you want
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:16,640	| IOT108 |	At the end of the day what we're talking about is
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:23,040	| IOT108 |	The ability for an individual to assert ownership over something such that they could then transfer the ownership of that in a way
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:23,552	| IOT108 |	Play it safe
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:26,112	| IOT108 |	Respect their privacy
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:27,136	| IOT108 |	That they can
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:28,416	| IOT108 |	Capture some of the values
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:31,232	| IOT108 |	The things that they create or they generate
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:32,256	| IOT108 |	Solo printing
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:35,328	| IOT108 |	Renting my data you can run your data you can lease your data
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:39,424	| IOT108 |	You can donate your data actually I think that donating side is particularly
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:40,192	| IOT108 |	Strong
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:43,520	| IOT108 |	All right we're going to get into that but first because you keep mentioning
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:44,032	| IOT108 |	The distributed
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:47,360	| IOT108 |	We should probably talk about how you do this
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:48,128	| IOT108 |	Everybody
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:48,896	| IOT108 |	Who's listening
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:51,200	| IOT108 |	Yes we are about to talk about
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:53,248	| IOT108 |	All right
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:55,040	| IOT108 |	Yasso
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:57,344	| IOT108 |	Without digging into the weeds too deeply
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:40:58,624	| IOT108 |	A blockchain is
EDL	00:40:58,624	00:41:01,952	| IOT108 |	A really new technology that allows two individuals
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:05,792	| IOT108 |	To exchange something of value without going through a central intermediary
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:08,352	| IOT108 |	And why that's important for property system
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:10,912	| IOT108 |	If we think about how
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:11,680	| IOT108 |	Humans
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:14,240	| IOT108 |	Behave in terms of exchanging property
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:15,520	| IOT108 |	I can sell you my car
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:19,616	| IOT108 |	That's a really a peer-to-peer transaction it's a decentralized transaction now
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:22,944	| IOT108 |	You could argue you have to take the title go to the DMV they update it
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:23,712	| IOT108 |	Fine
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:27,040	| IOT108 |	But I'm Toyota is not going to complain if I sell you my car
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:30,624	| IOT108 |	They have no right to complain if I sell you the car whereas
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:36,000	| IOT108 |	In the digital environment if I try to sell you the software that runs on my phone Apple could say no
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:38,304	| IOT108 |	Adobe could say no there's all of these people that
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:41,888	| IOT108 |	Have structured the digital environment to wear
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:43,424	| IOT108 |	The transfer of things
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:45,472	| IOT108 |	Do not look like property they look like
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:48,288	| IOT108 |	License agreements in renting which
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:49,824	| IOT108 |	From the perspective of
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:52,895	| IOT108 |	Somebody that purchases something is radically different than owning something
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:59,295	| IOT108 |	Ideal you're saying here is we should have some mechanism of ownership cuz right now we don't actually have
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:00,575	| IOT108 |	Even wait a license
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:09,023	| IOT108 |	Stacy in some ways we are granting license all day long to our data so when you use Facebook when you used to
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:10,815	| IOT108 |	Twitter when you use these different services
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:15,423	| IOT108 |	Within the terms of service is some Clause that resemble something like you are granting
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:21,567	| IOT108 |	That platform and non-exclusive royalty-free irrevocable license to use your data to
EDL	00:42:22,079	00:42:24,383	| IOT108 |	Create derivative Works your data to sell your data
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:28,735	| IOT108 |	Big knock against creating individual datamark
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:29,503	| IOT108 |	Places
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:30,527	| IOT108 |	Has been
EDL	00:42:30,527	00:42:32,575	| IOT108 |	Individually my data is
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:35,903	| IOT108 |	It is only an aggregate that it becomes
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:36,671	| IOT108 |	Worth something too
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:40,767	| IOT108 |	Yeah so how does what you guys are doing
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:43,071	| IOT108 |	Supply chain
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:45,119	| IOT108 |	Give my individual data is some sense of
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:46,143	| IOT108 |	Value to
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:51,263	| IOT108 |	I'm revisit this from like a historical perspective
EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:55,103	| IOT108 |	On land also had no value before
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:57,919	| IOT108 |	There were titling of land and individuals could
EDL	00:42:58,431	00:43:00,735	| IOT108 |	Could assert their property rights to land
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:02,783	| IOT108 |	So it's like the Indians trading Manhattan
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:07,647	| IOT108 |	Yes
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:10,719	| IOT108 |	Yeah
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:12,511	| IOT108 |	I don't know if you want to yes
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:14,815	| IOT108 |	Strike we are giving up our
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:15,583	| IOT108 |	Freedom
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:16,607	| IOT108 |	Without knowing it
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:20,959	| IOT108 |	Cuz we have bought into this argument that our data is not valuable
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:23,263	| IOT108 |	But our perspective is that
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:24,543	| IOT108 |	That's totally wrong
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:27,615	| IOT108 |	Your data is super valuable and the reason it's not
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:31,967	| IOT108 |	Economically valuable right now is because there's no way to assign property rights to it
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:32,479	| IOT108 |	Okay
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:37,087	| IOT108 |	What is this look like in practice and I think you mentioned that donations
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:40,159	| IOT108 |	Yeah probably the place that this was going to start
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:41,695	| IOT108 |	So can I
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:42,975	| IOT108 |	Walk me through an example of
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:45,023	| IOT108 |	Best example of this
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:46,815	| IOT108 |	A public health researcher
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:49,119	| IOT108 |	That would like access to
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:52,959	| IOT108 |	Tell me if your photos and your location data and what's interesting is that
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:56,287	| IOT108 |	You can run algorithms on photos now to
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:43:57,055	| IOT108 |	Figure out what the
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:59,103	| IOT108 |	Pollution levels are in certain places
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:00,383	| IOT108 |	The number of
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:04,479	| IOT108 |	Really interesting applications that you could do for public health benefits if you could
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:05,759	| IOT108 |	Crowdsource
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:06,783	| IOT108 |	If you will
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:09,599	| IOT108 |	I'm photos with locations with individuals consent
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:13,951	| IOT108 |	Can use that data and Anonymous way for
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:16,511	| IOT108 |	Tracking pollution or air quality levels a lot better
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:17,535	| IOT108 |	So how would that work
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:19,583	| IOT108 |	A researcher would broadcast
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:20,863	| IOT108 |	A study
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:22,399	| IOT108 |	You as an individual
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:23,167	| IOT108 |	Wood
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:24,703	| IOT108 |	Opt-in using your phone
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:31,103	| IOT108 |	And you would be able to donate your data and so technically what we're doing there's a company in Silicon Valley who are partnering
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:33,407	| IOT108 |	If Tom if this then that
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:35,199	| IOT108 |	And they provide ways
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:35,967	| IOT108 |	Is of automating
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:40,063	| IOT108 |	Date of rule so like if you upload a photo to Instagram when you can
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:42,111	| IOT108 |	Save that photo in Dropbox
EDL	00:44:42,111	00:44:48,511	| IOT108 |	And so we have something going on with them where you could say if you have a new location Point than bitmark that or if you haven't
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:49,023	| IOT108 |	New photo
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:53,375	| IOT108 |	Then didn't want that or if you have new sleep data or Fitness data
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:55,167	| IOT108 |	Then bitmark that end
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:56,703	| IOT108 |	Now there's an index
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:57,983	| IOT108 |	Pics of who has what
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:00,543	| IOT108 |	Indexes the blockchain as a database
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:03,871	| IOT108 |	And researchers now would be able to
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:04,639	| IOT108 |	Have
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:06,943	| IOT108 |	Structured information of who has what data
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:09,503	| IOT108 |	And individuals could donate that data
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:15,391	| IOT108 |	And do so in a way that the consent is automated the privacy of the individual is respect
EDL	00:45:16,415	00:45:17,183	| IOT108 |	No
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:20,511	| IOT108 |	Go with us because I have connected if
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:21,023	| IOT108 |	All kinds of
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:22,559	| IOT108 |	Looks like Michael Pitt
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:24,863	| IOT108 |	And I already signed
EDL	00:45:24,863	00:45:26,399	| IOT108 |	So I can't not retroactive
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:26,911	| IOT108 |	What do you like
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:32,799	| IOT108 |	Or can I see this is this is where things get like who this is fun in theory but when it meets
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:33,311	| IOT108 |	The road what happen
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:35,103	| IOT108 |	Yeso
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:39,967	| IOT108 |	You wouldn't be retroactively going back and getting all your data off that site again
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:41,759	| IOT108 |	What you would be doing is that
EDL	00:45:41,759	00:45:44,063	| IOT108 |	If can extract the data from Fitbit
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:45,343	| IOT108 |	Write on your behalf
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:47,391	| IOT108 |	And that is entirely legal
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:51,487	| IOT108 |	What you're granting again in the terms of service is a non-exclusive
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:53,279	| IOT108 |	Royalty-free license
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:54,047	| IOT108 |	Stew what you're creating
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:55,327	| IOT108 |	What your generating
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:45:57,631	| IOT108 |	You're not actually transferring ownership
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:45:59,935	| IOT108 |	Of all the abilities
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:00,447	| IOT108 |	Create
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:01,983	| IOT108 |	Additional licenses
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:03,007	| IOT108 |	Haha
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:05,311	| IOT108 |	Tesla in their contracts
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:07,871	| IOT108 |	With buyers of cars with autopilot
EDL	00:46:07,871	00:46:10,175	| IOT108 |	They say you can't use their cars
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:11,967	| IOT108 |	Or that service
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:13,247	| IOT108 |	For your own kind of
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:13,759	| IOT108 |	Rideshare
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:16,063	| IOT108 |	Cramps which is very smart
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:20,159	| IOT108 |	We're looking ahead and saying hey we want to do this ourselves
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:22,207	| IOT108 |	That feels kind of like something
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:23,487	| IOT108 |	It is
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:26,303	| IOT108 |	Moving is more towards this subscription model
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:29,119	| IOT108 |	Unless towards an ownership model so I wonder if we're like
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:30,655	| IOT108 |	Too late
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:31,935	| IOT108 |	Kind of pull this back a little
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:39,103	| IOT108 |	The good thing is right now all of this stuff looks like the Wild Wild West and that's why companies can
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:39,871	| IOT108 |	Claim
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:41,151	| IOT108 |	Statements like that
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:42,175	| IOT108 |	High-end
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:43,455	| IOT108 |	So it's so early
EDL	00:46:43,455	00:46:49,855	| IOT108 |	The way that we live in the digital environment for so many people is still so unclear what are those rights
EDL	00:46:49,855	00:46:50,879	| IOT108 |	What's what's going on there
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:54,719	| IOT108 |	How does the Constitution how does the rule of law protect me when I'm in
EDL	00:46:55,231	00:46:56,767	| IOT108 |	Environments where
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:46:58,303	| IOT108 |	The data the assets
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:46:59,327	| IOT108 |	Global
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:01,119	| IOT108 |	So these are all
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:03,167	| IOT108 |	Really early really unanswered questions
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:06,239	| IOT108 |	And so we just kind of try to look back at
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:07,007	| IOT108 |	Historical
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:08,031	| IOT108 |	Perspective end
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:10,591	| IOT108 |	Yes there were plenty of times where
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:12,895	| IOT108 |	Companies kings queens churches whatever
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:13,919	| IOT108 |	Unclaimed
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:18,271	| IOT108 |	Ownership over a comment claimed ownership over a lot of different
EDL	00:47:18,271	00:47:20,063	| IOT108 |	Things that arguably
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:22,623	| IOT108 |	Should be owned by citizens in all should be owned by the
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:24,671	| IOT108 |	Nobody individuals were creating them
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:26,207	| IOT108 |	End
EDL	00:47:26,207	00:47:27,999	| IOT108 |	Time and time again the courts
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:29,023	| IOT108 |	Side with individuals
EDL	00:47:29,535	00:47:32,095	| IOT108 |	I feel like Sean that I should be a lawyer
EDL	00:47:32,095	00:47:34,399	| IOT108 |	And we should have a conversation based on like
EDL	00:47:35,167	00:47:37,471	| IOT108 |	Entries of case law that I could say
EDL	00:47:37,471	00:47:42,079	| IOT108 |	For most of history in Outlook a book printing that resembles
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:43,359	| IOT108 |	Copyright copying
EDL	00:47:43,359	00:47:48,735	| IOT108 |	Throughout most of History the average person never ever ever hit up against copyright law and this is
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:50,783	| IOT108 |	Predominately because none of us are book
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:55,903	| IOT108 |	In the internet the way that technology works this is Internet Internet of Things
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:56,415	| IOT108 |	Same thing
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:47:58,975	| IOT108 |	Our devices are constantly making coffee
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:02,047	| IOT108 |	Copies in the cloud copies into local memory
EDL	00:48:02,559	00:48:06,911	| IOT108 |	And each of these copies interacts if you will with copyright law
EDL	00:48:06,911	00:48:07,423	| IOT108 |	And so
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:12,543	| IOT108 |	Whereas nobody ever hit up against copyright law and now all day long were brought up against it
EDL	00:48:12,543	00:48:13,055	| IOT108 |	All over the
EDL	00:48:13,567	00:48:14,335	| IOT108 |	End
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:15,615	| IOT108 |	Our perspective is that
EDL	00:48:16,127	00:48:18,943	| IOT108 |	Copyright law never should have been applied
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:19,711	| IOT108 |	2
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:21,759	| IOT108 |	Things like data things like
EDL	00:48:21,759	00:48:26,879	| IOT108 |	That the binary outputs of programs of musics of movies these sorts of media
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:29,183	| IOT108 |	Once you apply copyright
EDL	00:48:29,183	00:48:29,695	| IOT108 |	Right to it
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:35,327	| IOT108 |	The ownership of that goes away it gets Stripped Away so the freedoms of an individual in terms of
EDL	00:48:35,327	00:48:37,887	| IOT108 |	Things like for sale your ability to sell something
EDL	00:48:37,887	00:48:41,471	| IOT108 |	Your ability to share it with somebody your ability to use it to create new works
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:43,519	| IOT108 |	All of these get removed
EDL	00:48:43,519	00:48:45,311	| IOT108 |	When something looks like renting
EDL	00:48:45,311	00:48:46,335	| IOT108 |	As opposed to ownership
EDL	00:48:48,383	00:48:49,407	| IOT108 |	So this
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:51,455	| IOT108 |	This is a big philosophical thing
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:52,735	| IOT108 |	It kind of scares
EDL	00:48:52,735	00:48:57,343	| IOT108 |	Bejesus out of me so my big concern with iot is everything is becoming a subscription
EDL	00:48:58,111	00:48:59,391	| IOT108 |	We don't own this
EDL	00:48:59,391	00:49:02,719	| IOT108 |	Yes what are the repercussions of this and so what you're saying
EDL	00:49:02,719	00:49:04,255	| IOT108 |	Right here is
EDL	00:49:04,255	00:49:06,303	| IOT108 |	When is we won't be able to
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:08,351	| IOT108 |	Generator wealth we won't be able to
EDL	00:49:08,351	00:49:10,911	| IOT108 |	Accumulate stuff over time pass it on etcetera
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:13,727	| IOT108 |	Yep and we can go really
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:16,799	| IOT108 |	Kind of far in this direction but there is
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:17,823	| IOT108 |	What is the number of books
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:20,383	| IOT108 |	6 famous book that says that
EDL	00:49:20,895	00:49:22,687	| IOT108 |	Making money with property
EDL	00:49:23,199	00:49:25,759	| IOT108 |	Generate a lot more money than making money with labor
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:29,343	| IOT108 |	If you don't have the ability to assert ownership over something
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:31,135	| IOT108 |	Then you are a renter
EDL	00:49:31,135	00:49:33,183	| IOT108 |	And with renting you are right
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:35,487	| IOT108 |	To create wealth are just
EDL	00:49:36,255	00:49:38,303	| IOT108 |	How much is create wealth but your
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:39,071	| IOT108 |	Privacy rights
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:40,607	| IOT108 |	Are also
EDL	00:49:40,607	00:49:41,887	| IOT108 |	Incredibly Limited
EDL	00:49:41,887	00:49:43,935	| IOT108 |	You don't have a right to privacy in public
EDL	00:49:44,447	00:49:45,471	| IOT108 |	In public places
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:47,007	| IOT108 |	This is what you do have a right to private
EDL	00:49:47,007	00:49:47,775	| IOT108 |	Mercy in your home
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:48,799	| IOT108 |	Because you own your own
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:49,823	| IOT108 |	Because it's your private property
EDL	00:49:50,335	00:49:52,127	| IOT108 |	But you don't necessarily have a right to
EDL	00:49:52,127	00:49:52,895	| IOT108 |	Privacy on your Facebook
EDL	00:49:53,663	00:49:54,687	| IOT108 |	Which is you
EDL	00:49:55,455	00:49:56,735	| IOT108 |	Yep
EDL	00:49:56,735	00:49:57,503	| IOT108 |	End
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:58,527	| IOT108 |	We think that
EDL	00:49:58,527	00:50:00,575	| IOT108 |	As these two environments look
EDL	00:50:00,575	00:50:03,135	| IOT108 |	It's not fair to say anymore somebody is online or offline
EDL	00:50:03,647	00:50:04,415	| IOT108 |	We're always
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:09,535	| IOT108 |	And the digital environment is intersecting completely with the physical environment
EDL	00:50:09,535	00:50:15,935	| IOT108 |	And it's just no longer possible to separate these too and to look at okay in the physical world we have these
EDL	00:50:15,935	00:50:16,959	| IOT108 |	Liberties we have these freedoms
EDL	00:50:17,471	00:50:18,495	| IOT108 |	In the digital world
EDL	00:50:18,495	00:50:19,519	| IOT108 |	Everything is different
EDL	00:50:19,519	00:50:20,543	| IOT108 |	It's just not right
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:21,567	| IOT108 |	So this is an
EDL	00:50:21,567	00:50:22,847	| IOT108 |	Awesome intellectual argument
EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:26,431	| IOT108 |	But because you are starting a company I have to ask you
EDL	00:50:26,943	00:50:28,479	| IOT108 |	How are you guys planning to make money
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:30,527	| IOT108 |	The way we'll make money is
EDL	00:50:31,295	00:50:32,575	| IOT108 |	By giving you
EDL	00:50:32,575	00:50:33,855	| IOT108 |	Simple ways hopefully
EDL	00:50:34,367	00:50:36,671	| IOT108 |	To monetize your digital assets
EDL	00:50:36,671	00:50:37,439	| IOT108 |	Demonetized
EDL	00:50:38,463	00:50:39,231	| IOT108 |	And then you take a cut
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:40,511	| IOT108 |	That's right
EDL	00:50:40,511	00:50:41,023	| IOT108 |	Or I pay for
EDL	00:50:42,303	00:50:45,375	| IOT108 |	That's right so we would take a commission when you sell your data
EDL	00:50:46,399	00:50:47,167	| IOT108 |	So it's like
EDL	00:50:47,167	00:50:47,679	| IOT108 |	A real estate
EDL	00:50:49,215	00:50:50,751	| IOT108 |	Yeah or Merrill Lynch
EDL	00:50:50,751	00:50:51,263	| IOT108 |	Stock broker
EDL	00:50:51,775	00:50:55,615	| IOT108 |	You know you're going to sell some assets that you own we're going to help you find a buyer
EDL	00:50:55,615	00:50:57,407	| IOT108 |	We're going to make that transaction
EDL	00:50:57,407	00:50:58,687	| IOT108 |	Painless for you
EDL	00:50:58,687	00:50:59,967	| IOT108 |	And I like it
EDL	00:50:59,967	00:51:01,759	| IOT108 |	And we're going to take a small piece
EDL	00:51:01,759	00:51:03,295	| IOT108 |	So to see how far this
EDL	00:51:03,295	00:51:05,855	| IOT108 |	This analogy extends let's talk about liquidity
EDL	00:51:05,855	00:51:07,135	| IOT108 |	Because any good Market has
EDL	00:51:07,135	00:51:08,671	| IOT108 |	Liquidity and right now
EDL	00:51:09,695	00:51:10,207	| IOT108 |	You got zero the
EDL	00:51:11,231	00:51:13,023	| IOT108 |	You have no market and
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:14,815	| IOT108 |	How do you make Market swell
EDL	00:51:14,815	00:51:15,583	| IOT108 |	Marketsource
EDL	00:51:16,351	00:51:17,631	| IOT108 |	First made through
EDL	00:51:18,143	00:51:20,703	| IOT108 |	What are known as like over the counter transaction
EDL	00:51:20,703	00:51:21,471	| IOT108 |	So you
EDL	00:51:22,495	00:51:24,799	| IOT108 |	Transfer ownership of something to
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:25,311	| IOT108 |	Another party
EDL	00:51:26,847	00:51:28,895	| IOT108 |	And over time you'll see
EDL	00:51:28,895	00:51:31,199	| IOT108 |	Exchanges you'll see marketplaces
EDL	00:51:31,711	00:51:32,479	| IOT108 |	But
EDL	00:51:32,479	00:51:34,015	| IOT108 |	Until the property rights
EDL	00:51:34,783	00:51:35,807	| IOT108 |	To the offsets
EDL	00:51:35,807	00:51:38,367	| IOT108 |	The property rights to the data is clear
EDL	00:51:38,367	00:51:40,927	| IOT108 |	And people can assert ownership over that end
EDL	00:51:40,927	00:51:42,975	| IOT108 |	Courts can look at that and they can say yes
EDL	00:51:42,975	00:51:44,767	| IOT108 |	Stacey homes.org
EDL	00:51:44,767	00:51:45,791	| IOT108 |	Shawna
EDL	00:51:46,559	00:51:48,095	| IOT108 |	Unless that's clear
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:50,143	| IOT108 |	You can't have these sort of
EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:50,911	| IOT108 |	Economic models
EDL	00:51:51,679	00:51:53,727	| IOT108 |	Alright so what you feel to the titling system
EDL	00:51:54,239	00:51:57,823	| IOT108 |	To test this kind of titling system for my personal data
EDL	00:51:59,103	00:52:03,455	| IOT108 |	Need both Embark it or I need something to go awry so there's a court case about
EDL	00:52:04,223	00:52:07,295	| IOT108 |	And nothing that you've described to me makes me feel like there's
EDL	00:52:07,295	00:52:09,599	| IOT108 |	An opportunity for a court case because I'm
EDL	00:52:10,623	00:52:15,743	| IOT108 |	I'm granting these non-exclusive rights and I'm talking to companies that are going to pay me buddy I'm just donating it to
EDL	00:52:17,791	00:52:21,887	| IOT108 |	Court case would come about if you wanted to revoke some of those
EDL	00:52:21,887	00:52:24,191	| IOT108 |	Rights that you've granted to the parties
EDL	00:52:24,191	00:52:25,471	| IOT108 |	And so that's not what we're at
EDL	00:52:25,471	00:52:26,495	| IOT108 |	Where after

EDL	00:52:38,015	00:52:42,367	| IOT108 |	Photos down to your children in a digital estate so these are things that
EDL	00:52:42,367	00:52:44,927	| IOT108 |	Right now are incredibly difficult
EDL	00:52:44,927	00:52:46,463	| IOT108 |	To do if you can do them at all
EDL	00:52:46,975	00:52:49,023	| IOT108 |	Okay so walk me through this

EDL	00:52:51,071	00:52:56,447	| IOT108 |	To pass down to my children as part of a digital estate email is probably a really good exam
EDL	00:52:56,447	00:52:57,983	| IOT108 |	Or maybe a Facebook
EDL	00:52:57,983	00:52:58,495	| IOT108 |	Wallpaper
EDL	00:52:59,263	00:53:05,663	| IOT108 |	Yeah you know all of these ones are really good examples because they're behind terms of service or something no one dies
EDL	00:53:05,663	00:53:10,783	| IOT108 |	Fiduciary duty where if you die or if you become incapacitated then
EDL	00:53:10,783	00:53:12,319	| IOT108 |	The court can appoint a lawyer
EDL	00:53:12,831	00:53:14,111	| IOT108 |	The process is known as probate
EDL	00:53:14,111	00:53:15,391	| IOT108 |	And the lawyer can
EDL	00:53:15,903	00:53:20,255	| IOT108 |	Get access to your assets they can call if your bank if it's Bank of America they can say hey
