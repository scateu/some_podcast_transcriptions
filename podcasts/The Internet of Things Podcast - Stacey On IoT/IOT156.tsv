EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,536	| IOT156 |	It is not the first day of spring
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:12,864	| IOT156 |	What about you
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:18,496	| IOT156 |	I'm feeling tired because we're getting pounded with snow and we shovel like every 2 hours
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:21,824	| IOT156 |	Where is our smart snow plow version of
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:22,336	| IOT156 |	The snow plow
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:30,528	| IOT156 |	Let's talk about data protection because
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,808	| IOT156 |	Because this week's big story
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:39,232	| IOT156 |	Misuse of
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:41,792	| IOT156 |	By Cambridge Analytics
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:42,560	| IOT156 |	US election
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:43,584	| IOT156 |	And this is
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:48,192	| IOT156 |	Use of Facebook data so they actually use data that they didn't have permission to you
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:50,496	| IOT156 |	Used to Target people
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:51,520	| IOT156 |	Well
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:58,944	| IOT156 |	A lot of people originally said this was a data breach it was not a data breach the system
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:02:59,712	| IOT156 |	Facebook system
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:02,016	| IOT156 |	Platform work as intended
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:02,784	| IOT156 |	However
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,576	| IOT156 |	Cambridge analytica
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:06,368	| IOT156 |	Putting out like a quiz app
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:09,696	| IOT156 |	That approximately 270000 people took
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,000	| IOT156 |	It got data from
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:12,768	| IOT156 |	Friends of
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:13,792	| IOT156 |	Yours
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:20,192	| IOT156 |	And as a result the report is it actually was able to creep
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:22,752	| IOT156 |	Profiles of 50 million people
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:25,824	| IOT156 |	Even though not technically people use the quiz app
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:27,104	| IOT156 |	And again that is
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:28,128	| IOT156 |	Within Facebook
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,200	| IOT156 |	Acceptable
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:35,040	| IOT156 |	Or technically possible Facebook
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:36,320	| IOT156 |	For many people
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,088	| IOT156 |	Think about
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:40,160	| IOT156 |	Your craziest Facebook friend probably your aunt
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:42,976	| IOT156 |	Who you're just like
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:44,512	| IOT156 |	What are you doing
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,560	| IOT156 |	That person
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,608	| IOT156 |	Is opening you up to all kinds of craziness
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,912	| IOT156 |	And also Cambridge Analytics
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:54,240	| IOT156 |	They did live right about saying
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:55,008	| IOT156 |	When they had
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:55,776	| IOT156 |	Correct
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:04:02,176	| IOT156 |	Correctamente
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:02,944	| IOT156 |	For you is
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:04,224	| IOT156 |	4 very specific
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:06,528	| IOT156 |	Targeting of Facebook ads
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,064	| IOT156 |	And
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:12,160	| IOT156 |	The targets were built on the profiles that they created for everybody
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,440	| IOT156 |	Also Those ads
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:17,791	| IOT156 |	Well well say steak using Those ads but then again political ads
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:18,559	| IOT156 |	Often have
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:21,375	| IOT156 |	Information that is questionable or
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,167	| IOT156 |	It's designed to sway
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,191	| IOT156 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:25,727	| IOT156 |	The dark
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,007	| IOT156 |	Did you know
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,543	| IOT156 |	That candidate X
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:30,591	| IOT156 |	Let murderers loose early
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:39,039	| IOT156 |	What look like legitimate news stories in that same tone
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:39,807	| IOT156 |	Witches
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,111	| IOT156 |	It's harder for
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,951	| IOT156 |	The reason we're talking about this isn't
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:46,719	| IOT156 |	Because
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,743	| IOT156 |	Facebook
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:50,303	| IOT156 |	It's because we think the story helps
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:54,911	| IOT156 |	It helps legitimize what has been a long-standing concern that we had about
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,191	| IOT156 |	All of the dated it
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:00,031	| IOT156 |	Uart connected devices
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:02,591	| IOT156 |	Everything from Cars to light bulbs to
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:08,735	| IOT156 |	If you're at home if you're not when you typically leave the house so on so forth you
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:10,015	| IOT156 |	We don't have
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:15,903	| IOT156 |	Good protections for this and a lot of data is
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:16,927	| IOT156 |	Please
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:20,511	| IOT156 |	So this story presents a really calm
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,791	| IOT156 |	Concrete evidence of
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,327	| IOT156 |	Why that's
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,607	| IOT156 |	Something we should be looking at
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:27,935	| IOT156 |	Tell that much
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:29,215	| IOT156 |	But they can actually tell us
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:31,519	| IOT156 |	And they can I share this with a lot of pee
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:35,359	| IOT156 |	And so Kevin and I were talking about our Smart Home
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:35,871	| IOT156 |	Kevin was like
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,919	| IOT156 |	So they
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:39,967	| IOT156 |	Are the Camp Hill Democrat
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,479	| IOT156 |	Profiles
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,295	| IOT156 |	Pretty interesting
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:47,135	| IOT156 |	Kashmir Hill actually did a story about
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,671	| IOT156 |	I have some of that might develop
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:57,887	| IOT156 |	Kind of Lifestyle
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:07,615	| IOT156 |	Most of the devices we do talk about you can't use unless you are willing to provide that information to
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,895	| IOT156 |	Whoever the service provider is
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:10,431	| IOT156 |	That is true
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:13,503	| IOT156 |	And that's one of those things like the gdpr that European
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:15,807	| IOT156 |	Regulations about privacy
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,087	| IOT156 |	Actually talked about
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:17,855	| IOT156 |	If
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:18,879	| IOT156 |	You are providing
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:22,207	| IOT156 |	A device or service indeed
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,231	| IOT156 |	Is part of that
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:25,279	| IOT156 |	The person has to be able to opt out
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:25,791	| IOT156 |	In some reason
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,863	| IOT156 |	And I think that's going to be
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:31,935	| IOT156 |	I really enjoy I'm interested to see how they actually improve
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,983	| IOT156 |	You put something on a package before
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:36,543	| IOT156 |	By the way that we're going to collect
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:39,615	| IOT156 |	I guess because I would like
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,895	| IOT156 |	Actually I would think
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:41,407	| IOT156 |	I really easily
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:42,943	| IOT156 |	Understandable
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,223	| IOT156 |	Sharing
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:45,503	| IOT156 |	Sticker
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:46,783	| IOT156 |	On the device
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,063	| IOT156 |	Helpful
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,367	| IOT156 |	And then I'd be like
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:51,903	| IOT156 |	I don't want to buy this
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:55,487	| IOT156 |	It's one thing for Google to say
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,535	| IOT156 |	But it's pretty easy to switch over some
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,583	| IOT156 |	Purses
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,399	| IOT156 |	Once I've installed something I brought it home and packed it from
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:05,215	| IOT156 |	And then I see that they want
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:07,007	| IOT156 |	All this extra data
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:09,311	| IOT156 |	Restocking fee
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,103	| IOT156 |	Aha
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:17,247	| IOT156 |	Yeah it's definitely tougher with physical devices to know that in advance
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,039	| IOT156 |	What happens
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:20,575	| IOT156 |	And this is a really interesting
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,111	| IOT156 |	Because it might become relevant for life
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:24,415	| IOT156 |	I bought my
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:24,927	| IOT156 |	In terms of service
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:28,255	| IOT156 |	When Nest peking
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,815	| IOT156 |	Google Google
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:32,863	| IOT156 |	Those receipts
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,143	| IOT156 |	But
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:36,447	| IOT156 |	Let us know if it changes
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,471	| IOT156 |	If they change it
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,519	| IOT156 |	How likely are people
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,287	| IOT156 |	Jack to this
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:43,359	| IOT156 |	Thermostat off
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:44,127	| IOT156 |	Off the wall
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:46,175	| IOT156 |	It's basically a
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,711	| IOT156 |	The barriers of change
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:52,575	| IOT156 |	New updated terms of service
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:55,903	| IOT156 |	Art
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:57,183	| IOT156 |	Now that's what I call them
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,207	| IOT156 |	Amazon
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:05,119	| IOT156 |	Just a few weeks ago on that and like
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:05,887	| IOT156 |	Oh well
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,423	| IOT156 |	Dice clicked yes but
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:12,031	| IOT156 |	Took them for my wall several months later and try to return
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:15,359	| IOT156 |	I would like to see these companies along with the
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:20,735	| IOT156 |	Neely's of a terms of service provide a simple checklist of what's new compared to what
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,783	| IOT156 |	You know what the original tale as well as
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:24,831	| IOT156 |	Get on it dies
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,111	| IOT156 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:28,415	| IOT156 |	So there
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:31,999	| IOT156 |	And let's move to another anti-consumer
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,535	| IOT156 |	Qual work while we're on this
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:34,559	| IOT156 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:35,839	| IOT156 |	Lockn
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:41,727	| IOT156 |	Kevin this is a really good article over on Fast Company that willing to in the show notes
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:46,847	| IOT156 |	Jared Newman wrote it and he knows his stuff.
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:54,271	| IOT156 |	Google and Amazon in the past and he talks about why that is
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:09:00,415	| IOT156 |	And it has to do with standards and such she has to do with apis which article on last week one of his
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:01,695	| IOT156 |	Key
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:03,487	| IOT156 |	Areas in Antarctica
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:06,559	| IOT156 |	You can talk to me but I won't talk to you
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:09,119	| IOT156 |	It's interesting how the approaches that different
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:10,143	| IOT156 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:15,263	| IOT156 |	IPhones have taken like will provide you can talk to us but we're not going to send you anything back
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:17,055	| IOT156 |	It's really rather interesting
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:21,919	| IOT156 |	Jared has spoken weapons in the Articles you can read it but he has spoken with some of the
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:24,223	| IOT156 |	Standards groups that we have
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:28,831	| IOT156 |	How about we talk about a new one which kind of poo poo in butt
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:34,719	| IOT156 |	No it's an option in that was the network of intelligent camera ecosystem nice the alliance that just came about
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:39,327	| IOT156 |	But also the OCS we talked about before the open to be Foundation
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,631	| IOT156 |	They're all in here and they're trying to
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,143	| IOT156 |	Can do
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:48,287	| IOT156 |	To try and make this a better and easier so that way we do have standards and we don't have lock-in
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:53,663	| IOT156 |	You know
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:57,503	| IOT156 |	Say with homekit I think it's the most lockdownd ecosystem and that's why
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,831	| IOT156 |	Devices to choose from because the manufacturers
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:04,159	| IOT156 |	Don't want to just Target a certain demographic
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:11,583	| IOT156 |	Sonic racing
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:15,423	| IOT156 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:16,703	| IOT156 |	Change it
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:17,727	| IOT156 |	Your device
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:19,775	| IOT156 |	The capabilities of your device switch
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,311	| IOT156 |	Probably frustrating
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:25,151	| IOT156 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,455	| IOT156 |	Something a Google effort that kind of reduces
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:29,759	| IOT156 |	I will call it
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,039	| IOT156 |	Strong
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:37,695	| IOT156 |	Competitor a strong service provider in the sales everywhere talk about that
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:42,559	| IOT156 |	One of the things in this article they did a lot on the ocf
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,071	| IOT156 |	Which is
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:48,447	| IOT156 |	Connectivity Foundation
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:52,799	| IOT156 |	Where they're trying to focus
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:55,871	| IOT156 |	There which I think is really good so get
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:59,455	| IOT156 |	This is what a light bulb is so every light bulb will come
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,223	| IOT156 |	Basic
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:02,527	| IOT156 |	I would like
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,831	| IOT156 |	I have dimming capabilities maybe it'll
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:07,135	| IOT156 |	Encompass the color capabilities
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:09,951	| IOT156 |	And that'll all be standardized across all of them
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:14,303	| IOT156 |	Something like Google or Amazon
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,583	| IOT156 |	Or any of the other plants
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,607	| IOT156 |	Pomsky just tired to that
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,655	| IOT156 |	I would love to see that
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:20,191	| IOT156 |	I've been wanting this
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:20,959	| IOT156 |	Or
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:25,055	| IOT156 |	Decades
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:25,823	| IOT156 |	But it's
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:26,591	| IOT156 |	It's incredibly
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:29,663	| IOT156 |	It's a device capabilities
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,967	| IOT156 |	And I wonder
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:33,247	| IOT156 |	I wonder how
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:36,831	| IOT156 |	Don't know this will happen I wonder if that will obviate the need for a
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:39,391	| IOT156 |	In the Smart Hub
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:41,695	| IOT156 |	Theoretically
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:45,023	| IOT156 |	But yes will it well actually I don't know
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:48,351	| IOT156 |	I think you always need a hug because you'll need the extra
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:50,655	| IOT156 |	Shooting because this isn't going to solve the issue of life
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,679	| IOT156 |	Like reading like this Unified
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:54,495	| IOT156 |	Platform everything that you should have power
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,799	| IOT156 |	So you're still going to want a hug for local cab
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:58,335	| IOT156 |	Computing of tasks prop
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,103	| IOT156 |	Automation
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,151	| IOT156 |	Which
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:02,431	| IOT156 |	Kevin you wrote about last
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:04,991	| IOT156 |	So
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,527	| IOT156 |	Yes so you're still going to need
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,063	| IOT156 |	Which is fine
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:08,831	| IOT156 |	But you don't need 20
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,367	| IOT156 |	Thank goodness
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,927	| IOT156 |	Ziggy does have some
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:13,695	| IOT156 |	Call.
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:15,487	| IOT156 |	Ocf is working on something
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:17,279	| IOT156 |	We was going to do this but
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:19,839	| IOT156 |	More so
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,911	| IOT156 |	Maybe maybe there's an OCS
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,191	| IOT156 |	Standardized
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,775	| IOT156 |	What they put their seal of approval on
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,311	| IOT156 |	Ocf
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,359	| IOT156 |	But you would also have to buy ocf
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:32,639	| IOT156 |	Lights for
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,015	| IOT156 |	You know they said they were going to have stuff
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:38,527	| IOT156 |	Last year
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,063	| IOT156 |	They didn't
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:44,671	| IOT156 |	So there are no but this year supposedly we are promised ocf products
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,975	| IOT156 |	Coming out so we'll start seeing this and we'll see
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,279	| IOT156 |	Actually works
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:50,815	| IOT156 |	Will let you know
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:51,839	| IOT156 |	Because
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,119	| IOT156 |	Right now
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,655	| IOT156 |	It sucks
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:13:01,055	| IOT156 |	My criteria for connected devices now is it needs to work with Amazon Echo
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:02,335	| IOT156 |	The Google Assistant
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:04,639	| IOT156 |	If I were a iPhone user
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,687	| IOT156 |	I probably wanted to work with
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:08,479	| IOT156 |	Trinidad
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:11,039	| IOT156 |	That's like very low on the totem pole since then
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,343	| IOT156 |	Homekit implementation is not awesome
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,647	| IOT156 |	Also I don't have a knife
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:20,511	| IOT156 |	I'm getting from the station isn't bad it's actually
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:24,095	| IOT156 |	Quite good baking really kept it simple by staying with just Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:26,399	| IOT156 |	Because
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:28,959	| IOT156 |	Device makers and not put all their products out
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:29,727	| IOT156 |	4
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:30,239	| IOT156 |	It support
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,287	| IOT156 |	That's true
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,823	| IOT156 |	Kevin is going to be a resident
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:35,615	| IOT156 |	Kiddush home
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,151	| IOT156 |	Good luck Kevin
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:43,807	| IOT156 |	All right if you're I I want to talk about this cuz this is something I
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,087	| IOT156 |	I am in the middle of
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:49,695	| IOT156 |	Probably talk a little bit more about this but I am doing an iot Smart Home Spring
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:55,327	| IOT156 |	And I'm going to recommend that if you're like me test a lot of Criterion capabilities
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,607	| IOT156 |	Did you look at this
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:14:00,703	| IOT156 |	So I've noticed in the last couple months that things are just
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:04,287	| IOT156 |	There are things that just don't work there devices on my network
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,847	| IOT156 |	So what I did is I went through
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:09,919	| IOT156 |	I looked at what I had in my house
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,735	| IOT156 |	Anything we didn't have
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:14,015	| IOT156 |	Like that was
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,551	| IOT156 |	Anything we weren't using
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,575	| IOT156 |	I deleted the app
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,623	| IOT156 |	I deleted my in when I delete the app I delete
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,159	| IOT156 |	Authorized every
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:24,511	| IOT156 |	Everything I try to delete as much data as possible if it's possible
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,583	| IOT156 |	And took a device unplugged
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:31,935	| IOT156 |	Set it aside so once I have done all that
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:32,959	| IOT156 |	Appleton East
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:34,239	| IOT156 |	That wasn't working
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,079	| IOT156 |	Write this down
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,663	| IOT156 |	Deleted all my devices for the Amazon
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:42,943	| IOT156 |	I deleted all my devices in
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,223	| IOT156 |	Google
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:44,735	| IOT156 |	And
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,319	| IOT156 |	It is part of re-adding them
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:53,439	| IOT156 |	Implemented I spent like four hours doing some routines on both systems
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,719	| IOT156 |	To make life a little bit more
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,743	| IOT156 |	More fun for people
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:58,303	| IOT156 |	And it's been kind of a sucky
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:00,607	| IOT156 |	But necessary process it's taking a while
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:03,423	| IOT156 |	Have two more things that don't work even
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:05,727	| IOT156 |	Through the massive reboot a couple things actually did come back
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,287	| IOT156 |	Because
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,847	| IOT156 |	You may be asking
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:12,127	| IOT156 |	Maybe moving stuff around
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:12,639	| IOT156 |	In
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,687	| IOT156 |	It's kind of nice to have a fresh slate
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,015	| IOT156 |	I don't disagree with a question though
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:22,879	| IOT156 |	Did you hard reset the physical devices that you took off even light bulbs
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:23,903	| IOT156 |	If I took
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:27,231	| IOT156 |	Them off and there was a hard reset button
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:31,327	| IOT156 |	I did the order of operations for this was I looked at the app
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,375	| IOT156 |	IDI Thrice the app
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,655	| IOT156 |	I did a hard reset
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,935	| IOT156 |	I deleted the app
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:40,799	| IOT156 |	Okay I'm just thinking because even a lightbulb
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:41,311	| IOT156 |	She don't
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,871	| IOT156 |	Oh yes you can
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:49,759	| IOT156 |	I don't have any Philips Hue but like my Cree bulbs
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:52,319	| IOT156 |	Am I awesome bulb there is a process to reset them
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:16:00,767	| IOT156 |	Oh yeah yeah yeah
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:06,143	| IOT156 |	Would any device still have say my Wi-Fi credentials somewhere
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:09,471	| IOT156 |	Buy some device providers don't take
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:10,495	| IOT156 |	Your Wi-Fi
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:13,311	| IOT156 |	Information
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:19,199	| IOT156 |	So deleting the account or removing a device from the provider should do that
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:25,599	| IOT156 |	It's a reminder concerned I just wouldn't want somebody having like the MAC address of my router you know by poking around somehow and
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,647	| IOT156 |	You can poke around in the code of the bulbs
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:36,351	| IOT156 |	So if you have the
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,887	| IOT156 |	Google how to reset
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:38,655	| IOT156 |	AG smart light
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:43,519	| IOT156 |	Sometimes you can reset them by accident
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,055	| IOT156 |	Can children because
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:45,567	| IOT156 |	Most of the receptor
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:48,639	| IOT156 |	Put the lights on and off really rapidly 6 times
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:50,431	| IOT156 |	Do it again
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,967	| IOT156 |	Amazingly
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:52,735	| IOT156 |	My child
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,319	| IOT156 |	A couple times
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,391	| IOT156 |	It's possible rare
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:01,951	| IOT156 |	Smart home screen
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:05,535	| IOT156 |	Clean
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,815	| IOT156 |	Couple hours and
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:08,095	| IOT156 |	Your home is not going to work
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:08,607	| IOT156 |	Like it should
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,655	| IOT156 |	Family or set aside
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:12,703	| IOT156 |	And
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:13,471	| IOT156 |	At the end
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,775	| IOT156 |	You will have a brand-new shiny
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,799	| IOT156 |	Less glitchy smart
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,079	| IOT156 |	That's what you're working
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:20,383	| IOT156 |	Anything you don't have glitches right now
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:21,663	| IOT156 |	You don't need to do it
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:24,479	| IOT156 |	I ready
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:26,015	| IOT156 |	Speaking of
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:28,063	| IOT156 |	My first thing I added after all my routines
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,111	| IOT156 |	Amazon
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:30,879	| IOT156 |	Echoes
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:31,391	| IOT156 |	Barismo
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:40,095	| IOT156 |	Yeah you might have heard of its record as a follow-up mode and what it does is if you enable it when you
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:42,655	| IOT156 |	Speak a command to madam she will chords
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,935	| IOT156 |	Do not come in
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:48,543	| IOT156 |	But if this mode is enabled she will also listen for additional 5 Seconds
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,055	| IOT156 |	So you can just
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:52,383	| IOT156 |	Say another command without saying the Wake word I think it's
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:56,479	| IOT156 |	Super handy some people may not want it to continue to listen for 5 seconds
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:18:01,343	| IOT156 |	Because of privacy concerns I totally get that so Choose Or Not choose this mode based on your preferences
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:06,207	| IOT156 |	You do this in the app there's in your device settings in the united pay app
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:08,767	| IOT156 |	But interesting what you did it in the app
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:09,791	| IOT156 |	This morning Stacy
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,583	| IOT156 |	I didn't do it in the app
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:17,983	| IOT156 |	What freaked me out when this went live when I went out to go for a run at 9 one night nobody was
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:24,127	| IOT156 |	Awake so I just told me today to turn the family room lights down 50% I didn't even at full Blair because
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:25,407	| IOT156 |	Nobody was in the living room
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:26,943	| IOT156 |	And she said to me
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:28,735	| IOT156 |	I have a new follow-up mode
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:31,551	| IOT156 |	Would you like to enable and she explained what it was to me
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,831	| IOT156 |	And I enable it by choice
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:37,951	| IOT156 |	Yeah I love that
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:42,047	| IOT156 |	I must be special
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:44,863	| IOT156 |	Please to her
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:49,471	| IOT156 |	Maybe somebody Will Smith
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,239	| IOT156 |	She knows that I'm spitting
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,335	| IOT156 |	But it works really well
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:19:00,479	| IOT156 |	I have it on.
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:03,039	| IOT156 |	So I don't think it's being held back
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:07,903	| IOT156 |	Specifically to Amazon bill devices obviously it's not because the sun has has it so
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:09,695	| IOT156 |	It's in there you can enable if you like
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:13,279	| IOT156 |	Awesome alright speaking voice assistance
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,303	| IOT156 |	IBM
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:16,863	| IOT156 |	Has a new smart assistant it is
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,447	| IOT156 |	Watson assistant
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,215	| IOT156 |	Go figure
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:26,847	| IOT156 |	Talk about
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:30,687	| IOT156 |	Emma Watson
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:35,039	| IOT156 |	No but it's actually pretty good name if I had like
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:36,319	| IOT156 |	Holmes and Watson
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,975	| IOT156 |	So what this is is this is an ID
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,255	| IOT156 |	Voice assistant
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:48,095	| IOT156 |	I didn't have a ton of cool Watson and
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:52,447	| IOT156 |	Products
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:52,959	| IOT156 |	Conference
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:53,983	| IOT156 |	IBM news
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,775	| IOT156 |	Watson is not
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:57,055	| IOT156 |	Design for
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:58,335	| IOT156 |	Consumer-facing stuff
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:03,455	| IOT156 |	It's going to be mostly operate behind the scenes for other companies so
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:07,551	| IOT156 |	Which is working with Watson Kindle
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:09,087	| IOT156 |	Commands for cars
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:11,135	| IOT156 |	And Watson also wants to do it now
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:12,415	| IOT156 |	Hotel rooms
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,183	| IOT156 |	Stores
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:15,231	| IOT156 |	The store in retail setting
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,255	| IOT156 |	It's a little confusing for
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,119	| IOT156 |	A Watson
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:25,471	| IOT156 |	Store assistant master store planner
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:27,263	| IOT156 |	What engine do I have
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:28,287	| IOT156 |	In Spring
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:33,151	| IOT156 |	So I think this is kind of interesting
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:37,247	| IOT156 |	Hockey
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,015	| IOT156 |	Two people
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:44,159	| IOT156 |	And probably
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:50,303	| IOT156 |	Really unlimited even though it's trying to do Amazon for business
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,839	| IOT156 |	Business on the side
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:56,447	| IOT156 |	Right cuz there's a lot of things you think about like admin access was access to certain
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,727	| IOT156 |	Information
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,519	| IOT156 |	You know anyone can walk into a room and asked
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:02,591	| IOT156 |	So I'm sure as hell
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,615	| IOT156 |	RPM sticking
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,407	| IOT156 |	About the architecture of the back
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:06,687	| IOT156 |	People access
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,479	| IOT156 |	Emission control circuit
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:08,991	| IOT156 |	Isis
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:11,039	| IOT156 |	Interesting to see what comes of it
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:14,367	| IOT156 |	Yeah I don't want like my passenger like sometimes you know you're driving
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,135	| IOT156 |	Time with your kids and I
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:17,440	| IOT156 |	Friends
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:18,976	| IOT156 |	My car
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:22,560	| IOT156 |	A lot of types
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:23,584	| IOT156 |	All the time
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:29,728	| IOT156 |	Maybe doing a voice assistant in the car letting them change stuff or painted cooler
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,496	| IOT156 |	Nope
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,520	| IOT156 |	Air condition is just fine
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:35,616	| IOT156 |	IBM also announced
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:39,200	| IOT156 |	Type
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:42,016	| IOT156 |	Chip that is designed to
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:44,832	| IOT156 |	As part of its crypto anchor program so
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:51,232	| IOT156 |	It's basically like a digital birth certificates digital watermarks for devices the quilting here isn't that a
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:52,000	| IOT156 |	Super super tiny
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:52,512	| IOT156 |	Although it is
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:57,120	| IOT156 |	The cool thing is that they're talking about it's selling for what is like $0.10 a piece
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:00,192	| IOT156 |	Which does put it in the realm of
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,984	| IOT156 |	Many applications
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:05,568	| IOT156 |	Call zlata X
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:06,336	| IOT156 |	You should
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,616	| IOT156 |	A5x the cost of
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,152	| IOT156 |	For the hardware is
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:10,432	| IOT156 |	Just Fur
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:13,248	| IOT156 |	All that stuff that goes around the hardware integrated
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:13,760	| IOT156 |	Get into
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:15,552	| IOT156 |	But that's still
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:19,136	| IOT156 |	Let's go back to the home for a little bit
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,672	| IOT156 |	Because you can now
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,464	| IOT156 |	We got details about how
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:24,512	| IOT156 |	Google is thinking about shopping
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,816	| IOT156 |	And I was going to respond to the Amazon
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:31,936	| IOT156 |	Which is pretty huge and Google already got some big retailers lineup because
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:34,752	| IOT156 |	Amazon is the scariest thing ever
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,288	| IOT156 |	Shopping
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:38,080	| IOT156 |	Assistant
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:44,736	| IOT156 |	Yeah I think this is brilliant it's a very defensive play on Google's part against Amazon
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:49,088	| IOT156 |	Search Google for products to buy
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:53,952	| IOT156 |	Apparently 72 80% of those searches need you to Amazon where people make
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:59,328	| IOT156 |	Purchase so since Google
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:03,680	| IOT156 |	Antitrust concerns and such what they've done is they've integrated
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,216	| IOT156 |	Google Assistant shopping
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:07,008	| IOT156 |	With Google Express
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:13,664	| IOT156 |	Interesting way if you do say to your assistant I like to buy whatever I'll coffee cup
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:15,968	| IOT156 |	Amazon results are little scarce there
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:19,552	| IOT156 |	Very interesting so what Google doing as they work with
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,576	| IOT156 |	Retail Partners
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:21,856	| IOT156 |	2
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:23,392	| IOT156 |	Show up in a search results
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:25,440	| IOT156 |	And then use Google expressed actually
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:26,208	| IOT156 |	Complete the purchase
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:27,744	| IOT156 |	I think it's
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:31,840	| IOT156 |	Super super smart because obviously for using an Amazon Echo
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:35,168	| IOT156 |	Or any matinee device to search for Crocs to buy
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:36,192	| IOT156 |	Where is it going to rain
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:39,776	| IOT156 |	Amazon
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:45,920	| IOT156 |	Can't do that with Google Now you can I just I think it's a brilliant brilliant move on Google
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:48,224	| IOT156 |	Yes I do too so
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:51,040	| IOT156 |	Do you want to talk to people like I was a little fish trying to figure out how
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:52,576	| IOT156 |	Because
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:24:02,304	| IOT156 |	Well I mean you do a search through Google Assistant for a product and you'll get various results and she like you can add any of those
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:04,352	| IOT156 |	Google Express card
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:07,424	| IOT156 |	It doesn't look to me like you can actually complete the purchase
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,448	| IOT156 |	Google assistant
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:18,176	| IOT156 |	What happens if you
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:18,944	| IOT156 |	It gives you tells you
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,992	| IOT156 |	After you've selected something
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:22,784	| IOT156 |	You can slide in your life that's pretty cool
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:25,600	| IOT156 |	You can add it to your cart and then it gives it says
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:27,648	| IOT156 |	Okay this is in your cart you can find it
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:30,976	| IOT156 |	At this URL or it gives you the option to check out if
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:34,816	| IOT156 |	Except checkout is going to send you to the Google assistant app
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:36,096	| IOT156 |	The express app
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:36,864	| IOT156 |	Where you can't
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:43,520	| IOT156 |	It's not a fool and then purchase implementation yet but I got to believe that that's the next step
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:44,544	| IOT156 |	Which is good because
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:52,736	| IOT156 |	He just bought five things that you really don't need
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:57,600	| IOT156 |	Women's short sleeve red t-shirt
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:25:00,160	| IOT156 |	The first result actually was from Amazon
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,696	| IOT156 |	And it told me that
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:03,744	| IOT156 |	Periodically
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:06,816	| IOT156 |	Search result is from Amazon.
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:10,656	| IOT156 |	Which was unlike any of the other search results
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:11,680	| IOT156 |	Interested
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:15,264	| IOT156 |	Maybe it mean depend on the product
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:17,824	| IOT156 |	In which case they don't have a retailer with a grape
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:20,640	| IOT156 |	Deal or or stock or who knows what
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:23,456	| IOT156 |	I don't think they're locking Amazon out
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:26,016	| IOT156 |	I think that would be a problem
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:29,088	| IOT156 |	Yes alright also in Google News late last week after
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:30,368	| IOT156 |	Done
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,392	| IOT156 |	Recording the show
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:36,256	| IOT156 |	Is now available
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:40,096	| IOT156 |	The video doorbell
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:42,912	| IOT156 |	Is the nest hello doorbell it is going to be 200
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,680	| IOT156 |	$30
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:47,008	| IOT156 |	So much money for a doorbell
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:49,824	| IOT156 |	You also will have to pay for nest aware cloud
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:51,360	| IOT156 |	If you
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:53,920	| IOT156 |	That it is a wired doorbell
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:54,432	| IOT156 |	So
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:56,480	| IOT156 |	Note that
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:57,248	| IOT156 |	Not battery power
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:26:01,344	| IOT156 |	Does the service fee does that count with your nest aware
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:04,672	| IOT156 |	Or he has to pay extra
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,952	| IOT156 |	IMG
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:10,048	| IOT156 |	So what will happen is I will ask
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:11,840	| IOT156 |	So whenever we talk about
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:14,656	| IOT156 |	Hello doorbell which should be either next week or the week after depending
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:17,216	| IOT156 |	When it arrives when I get it installed
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:17,984	| IOT156 |	I shall have it answer
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:19,776	| IOT156 |	Also
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,056	| IOT156 |	The clock is come
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:22,592	| IOT156 |	Well
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:25,664	| IOT156 |	A little sad because this particular version of the Yale lock
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:26,432	| IOT156 |	Will not work with
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:31,040	| IOT156 |	So it's not like the August lock which works with
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:31,552	| IOT156 |	All of the
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:32,576	| IOT156 |	All of the
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:36,928	| IOT156 |	Yeah I'm seeing the same lock come out for different plaster
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:41,280	| IOT156 |	It's the worst absolutely the worst
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:42,560	| IOT156 |	Don't
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:49,472	| IOT156 |	Try that and we'll be able to look at the Google Assistant smart display stuff
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,240	| IOT156 |	We're out in the market
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,032	| IOT156 |	Because I'd love to be able to
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:53,824	| IOT156 |	So I guess I could try to
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:57,152	| IOT156 |	You certainly could because I tell my
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,432	| IOT156 |	Nvidia Shield
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:02,528	| IOT156 |	TV which is an Android TV and Chromecast
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,552	| IOT156 |	Assistant built-in
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:06,112	| IOT156 |	Show my Nest Cam and it just started up on my TV
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:15,840	| IOT156 |	Because the Chromecast devices can actually turn the TV on so you can if you're not
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,376	| IOT156 |	Watching TV at the time you can just
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:21,984	| IOT156 |	Letv model and show it
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:22,752	| IOT156 |	OMG
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:27,360	| IOT156 |	Also going to break all the sprinkler
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:29,664	| IOT156 |	I did probably but that's okay
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:32,992	| IOT156 |	Because that's my life
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,296	| IOT156 |	Stay tuned for
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:38,880	| IOT156 |	But if you don't want to wait for us to talk about it you can just go and buy it cuz they are
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:42,208	| IOT156 |	Alright let's move into the
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:46,304	| IOT156 |	Quick
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:47,584	| IOT156 |	My stuff
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:48,608	| IOT156 |	And we talked for a really
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:52,192	| IOT156 |	So here's an interesting Google Project Pat
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:54,752	| IOT156 |	Sidewalk Labs which alphabet
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:57,824	| IOT156 |	Smart City effort
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:28:01,152	| IOT156 |	Map of San Francisco's parking rules
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:06,272	| IOT156 |	What you be like will why did they do that well if you need to know where you can
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:12,672	| IOT156 |	Stop for deliveries or maybe you're an Uber driver need to know where you can sit for a few minutes and not have to pay
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:13,440	| IOT156 |	Pay for parking
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:16,256	| IOT156 |	It's all there in this information
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:17,024	| IOT156 |	Unique
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:18,304	| IOT156 |	Because normally
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:19,840	| IOT156 |	Disable apps tell you
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:23,168	| IOT156 |	Has spots available
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:25,728	| IOT156 |	This is not that
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:27,264	| IOT156 |	Could help fill with City
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:28,288	| IOT156 |	Planning for
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:30,080	| IOT156 |	Different parking rules in areas
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:31,616	| IOT156 |	Speaking of
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:35,200	| IOT156 |	Cars we would be remiss if we didn't talk about Uber self-driving
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,736	| IOT156 |	Car killing a woman
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:37,248	| IOT156 |	This week
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:38,784	| IOT156 |	In Arizona
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:40,064	| IOT156 |	So we don't have a lot
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:40,832	| IOT156 |	To say about this but
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:44,672	| IOT156 |	Well you know obviously so very sad statue
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:51,328	| IOT156 |	And for that individual in the family so far the preliminary results
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:55,936	| IOT156 |	There was no way for the car to avoid this pedestrian
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:29:02,336	| IOT156 |	There was a driver in the car not driving a car they were in the driver seat in Uber person
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:04,640	| IOT156 |	So far based on the information
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:07,200	| IOT156 |	Not even the smart technology of The Economist
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:10,272	| IOT156 |	Vehicle could have avoided this point would be
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:13,600	| IOT156 |	We can't just assume autonomous vehicles will
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:15,392	| IOT156 |	Completely eradicate these type of
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:16,160	| IOT156 |	Of incidence
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:23,072	| IOT156 |	It's unfortunate but we can't do that because some things just happened so fast that not even the computing power in the car
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:26,144	| IOT156 |	I can handle it to make a change of swerve etcetera so
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:30,752	| IOT156 |	I don't want people to think of time this car will make everything safer 100% of the time
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:32,288	| IOT156 |	Right there real world physics
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:35,872	| IOT156 |	A car going is going around 40 miles an hour
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:37,920	| IOT156 |	If you step in front of any car
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:40,736	| IOT156 |	Going at it will try to break which this car did not
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:45,600	| IOT156 |	But there's a bunch of random this in the world that cannot be predicted and anticipated and
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:50,976	| IOT156 |	Yep all right moving to Industrial iot
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:52,000	| IOT156 |	Shofar horn
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:56,608	| IOT156 |	Startup has partnered with Google's iot core
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:58,400	| IOT156 |	To do stream
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:01,728	| IOT156 |	Data processing at the edge
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:03,776	| IOT156 |	All Google Solutions
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:04,800	| IOT156 |	Basically so
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:07,872	| IOT156 |	Does have Partnerships with Microsoft azure
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:11,200	| IOT156 |	And AWS this is a little deeper integration
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,224	| IOT156 |	Basically
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:18,368	| IOT156 |	And it's important to note Foghorn systems does so it has built a complex event processing engine
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:21,184	| IOT156 |	For the edge it's kind of like Apache Spark
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:22,720	| IOT156 |	Only instead of
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,512	| IOT156 |	Run across so many
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:26,816	| IOT156 |	Compute nodes it's designed to run in
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:27,840	| IOT156 |	One-place Solana Center
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:29,376	| IOT156 |	And
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:33,472	| IOT156 |	Bunch of different machine learning models
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:35,008	| IOT156 |	On the Foghorn software
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:38,080	| IOT156 |	It's nice
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:39,616	| IOT156 |	I believe GE is a customer
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:41,664	| IOT156 |	Incel
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,944	| IOT156 |	The partnership with
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:46,016	| IOT156 |	Google basically makes girls offering
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:46,784	| IOT156 |	A little bit
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:49,088	| IOT156 |	Deeply integrated
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:50,880	| IOT156 |	With for industrial
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:53,696	| IOT156 |	Clients in this is a big deal for Google cuz right now
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:54,976	| IOT156 |	It feels like
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:55,744	| IOT156 |	Very few
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:57,792	| IOT156 |	Industrial players are using
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:58,560	| IOT156 |	Google's iot
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:04,704	| IOT156 |	Yeah we talked about Google's iot strategy and how it's a mishmash of products that don't
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:06,496	| IOT156 |	Are presented well as a
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:08,544	| IOT156 |	Has one solution
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:11,104	| IOT156 |	This actually is I hope Google is talking about
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:15,712	| IOT156 |	They're using Cloud vaping Foghorn they're using Cloud iot Core
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:17,248	| IOT156 |	To gather information
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:19,040	| IOT156 |	But then Google Cloud pubsub
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:24,672	| IOT156 |	Is Kathryn dating
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:28,000	| IOT156 |	Data studio is all used for the analytics to make sense of that data
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:30,816	| IOT156 |	So this is a whole bunch of Google products
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:34,656	| IOT156 |	That please Google should be shouting off the rooftops
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:37,472	| IOT156 |	Yeah it's basically Google's got all the smarts in the cloud
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:41,056	| IOT156 |	Certain types of smarts at the edge that need
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:43,360	| IOT156 |	We've all talked Ad nauseam about the
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:45,408	| IOT156 |	Right so
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:46,944	| IOT156 |	Google doesn't really have much of a
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:47,712	| IOT156 |	Play here
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:48,224	| IOT156 |	Yet
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:49,760	| IOT156 |	This gets it
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:51,296	| IOT156 |	Joshua
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,112	| IOT156 |	So
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:58,208	| IOT156 |	In other Industrial iot
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:31:59,744	| IOT156 |	Has
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:03,328	| IOT156 |	Put out a piece of Hardware now this is a company resume software
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:07,424	| IOT156 |	It allows you to run containers at the edge so things like docker
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:09,984	| IOT156 |	Can run on laser-based systems
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:11,520	| IOT156 |	What day did the original
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:13,568	| IOT156 |	People got excited
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:14,080	| IOT156 |	About the stuff
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:16,384	| IOT156 |	And it basically lets you
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:20,992	| IOT156 |	Easy to implement software across hundreds or thousands of
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:22,784	| IOT156 |	Devices which is really important
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,576	| IOT156 |	And really hard so it makes it worse
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:25,344	| IOT156 |	Cloudlex
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:26,624	| IOT156 |	Brake calipers
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,392	| IOT156 |	Yay
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:29,696	| IOT156 |	Necessary what they've done is a hardware
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:31,744	| IOT156 |	They have created projects
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:36,096	| IOT156 |	It is a board that stacks on top of a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,632	| IOT156 |	Compute module 3 Lite
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:39,680	| IOT156 |	And basically it gives it
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:40,704	| IOT156 |	Industrial
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:41,472	| IOT156 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:43,776	| IOT156 |	So some of those capabilities are
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:45,056	| IOT156 |	Separate
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:49,664	| IOT156 |	Bluetooth processor that can send data even without waking up the main
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:50,944	| IOT156 |	Model so it's low power
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:56,064	| IOT156 |	It is designed to work in industrial environments which is
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,600	| IOT156 |	You salty cuz these are
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:59,136	| IOT156 |	Crappy environments there loud
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:00,160	| IOT156 |	Vibration
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:00,672	| IOT156 |	Hot
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:01,952	| IOT156 |	All kinds of stuff
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:05,024	| IOT156 |	It will take an external antenna for WiFi
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:08,608	| IOT156 |	And you can have power from 6 volts or 30 volts
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:09,888	| IOT156 |	Titus Industrial
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:17,056	| IOT156 |	There's even a SIM card slot seafood and I got a cellular modem not something you can easily do on a Raspberry Pi buy sell
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:19,360	| IOT156 |	So lots of cool stuff
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:21,408	| IOT156 |	They will still work on a bunch of other
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:24,736	| IOT156 |	They just wanted to offer this because they saw companies
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:25,504	| IOT156 |	Meeting
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:27,040	| IOT156 |	A different solution
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:29,344	| IOT156 |	Customized solution for industrial
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:30,880	| IOT156 |	Without having to spend
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,392	| IOT156 |	And a lot more
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:34,464	| IOT156 |	In Industry already
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:36,512	| IOT156 |	Put out Raspberry Pi's throughout
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:42,912	| IOT156 |	It might be limited by their capabilities this whole beef up those capabilities and be an add-on to their resistance
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:44,448	| IOT156 |	Solution which is actually rather smart
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:48,032	| IOT156 |	A lot of companies develop
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:51,872	| IOT156 |	Achieve3000
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:53,152	| IOT156 |	It helps a little bit
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:54,688	| IOT156 |	Possibly
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:58,528	| IOT156 |	Can one really interesting thing that I noticed
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:00,576	| IOT156 |	The processor
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:05,696	| IOT156 |	For the sin is actually an Arctic o-200 to model made by Samsung
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:07,488	| IOT156 |	How much is a sponsor
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:13,888	| IOT156 |	Thought it was interesting cuz he don't see Arctic mentioned in in products that often
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:15,168	| IOT156 |	That's true
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:15,680	| IOT156 |	So
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:22,336	| IOT156 |	We'll keep our eyes open
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:23,872	| IOT156 |	All right
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:27,200	| IOT156 |	Industrial Enterprise
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:27,968	| IOT156 |	Jose Enterprise

EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:32,832	| IOT156 |	We talked about getting into
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,368	| IOT156 |	Lorawan Networks
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:37,952	| IOT156 |	And these are low power wide area Networks
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:40,768	| IOT156 |	They're usually for like
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:42,048	| IOT156 |	Private
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:44,608	| IOT156 |	That works for like warehouses or made
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,960	| IOT156 |	Personal
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:50,496	| IOT156 |	Works as opposed to like a cellular network
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:53,056	| IOT156 |	Comcast announced a bunch of
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:54,080	| IOT156 |	Science
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:58,432	| IOT156 |	For their machine to Laura when Network including my favorite
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:34:59,456	| IOT156 |	Example of
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,224	| IOT156 |	Connector products
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:00,992	| IOT156 |	Which is a smart
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:01,504	| IOT156 |	Mouse trap
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:05,600	| IOT156 |	This is actually really cool because
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:06,624	| IOT156 |	I've encountered
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:08,160	| IOT156 |	Connected Pest Control
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:12,256	| IOT156 |	Three different use cases so basically this is something that says
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:14,304	| IOT156 |	Hey
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:16,864	| IOT156 |	In your Warehouse in the middle of nowhere. Something
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:25,312	| IOT156 |	You can do that without checking
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:28,896	| IOT156 |	Which actually is really cool
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:33,760	| IOT156 |	Company using Comcast Comcast
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:37,600	| IOT156 |	Whether it's about 2 years old but
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:39,648	| IOT156 |	It's getting a lot more attention
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:40,416	| IOT156 |	Now
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:41,184	| IOT156 |	Customers

EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,824	| IOT156 |	Where cars are
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:36:00,384	| IOT156 |	So these are just too quick examples
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:07,040	| IOT156 |	One option
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,576	| IOT156 |	Cars with the likes of

EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,392	| IOT156 |	And even
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:12,416	| IOT156 |	Startups we're doing
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:15,232	| IOT156 |	These guys want to provide the network
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:17,792	| IOT156 |	Work with systems integrators but
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:23,168	| IOT156 |	Yay
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:25,984	| IOT156 |	Okay let's go

EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:59,264	| IOT156 |	Is Claire and I'm calling from Portland Oregon to question about how I can make my smart home
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:00,800	| IOT156 |	You're awesome for my
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:01,824	| IOT156 |	6 month old baby
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:05,920	| IOT156 |	So far I have the August Smart Lock
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:10,528	| IOT156 |	I have Sonos speakers in his room but I would love any suggestion
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:12,064	| IOT156 |	Since you have on how I
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:18,208	| IOT156 |	Suggest
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:19,744	| IOT156 |	And what we can do
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:21,792	| IOT156 |	Thank you so much I look forward to your answer
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:24,096	| IOT156 |	Where are you
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,376	| IOT156 |	Love this question
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:27,424	| IOT156 |	Because I love
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,704	| IOT156 |	Peoples were actually thinking of
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:29,728	| IOT156 |	Cool things to do
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,776	| IOT156 |	Connected devices in
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:32,800	| IOT156 |	Real life scenarios so
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:34,336	| IOT156 |	Apus
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:35,104	| IOT156 |	Is a great singer
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:39,968	| IOT156 |	Here's some crazy idea since you're just
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:40,992	| IOT156 |	Santa visit ideas
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:42,272	| IOT156 |	Face it sounds like
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,808	| IOT156 |	Kevin's first idea
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:44,576	| IOT156 |	I think it's a good one
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:45,088	| IOT156 |	1 for where your
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:47,392	| IOT156 |	Where your kid is now at 6 months old
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:48,928	| IOT156 |	So Kevin you want to talk about the.
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,208	| IOT156 |	Yeah I would
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:56,352	| IOT156 |	Pinterest the only Amazon Echo device you have in your house
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:38:01,984	| IOT156 |	The reason I would do this is because you could use the Amazon app on your smartphone
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:04,288	| IOT156 |	To drop in and listen to
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:06,080	| IOT156 |	The baby boy even talk to the baby
EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:07,616	| IOT156 |	And you can
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:09,920	| IOT156 |	Insane anime
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:10,944	| IOT156 |	Play
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:17,088	| IOT156 |	You know if you want some soothing music in there for the baby
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:17,856	| IOT156 |	Hands-free
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:24,256	| IOT156 |	However this know that even with the volume on your Echo dot turn down
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:26,560	| IOT156 |	When you drop in on something
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:27,840	| IOT156 |	You get an audible charge
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:30,144	| IOT156 |	And the green light
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:32,704	| IOT156 |	So if you're trying to check on your baby when
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:33,984	| IOT156 |	It's sleep
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:34,496	| IOT156 |	That may not be
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:37,312	| IOT156 |	Okay so what
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:42,432	| IOT156 |	I also think this is. Is a great
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:46,528	| IOT156 |	Take because you can play sound like what does a dog say
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:48,576	| IOT156 |	And there's a ton of skills that
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:49,600	| IOT156 |	You know kids will enjoy
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,160	| IOT156 |	Play Silly Songs
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:56,000	| IOT156 |	When the child gets a little bit older
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:59,584	| IOT156 |	Probably like 18 months to two years in your thinking about things like
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:02,912	| IOT156 |	Hey now that you can sleep and handle things on your own
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:04,704	| IOT156 |	Tell your toddler you want to get out of bed
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:06,496	| IOT156 |	There's a device that they sell for
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:07,776	| IOT156 |	Called
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:09,312	| IOT156 |	Like an alarm clock
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:11,104	| IOT156 |	Turns different colors
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:11,872	| IOT156 |	When
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:13,152	| IOT156 |	It hits a certain time
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:16,736	| IOT156 |	This is design for parents who want to get their kids to stay in the room
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:17,504	| IOT156 |	So they can sleep in
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:22,112	| IOT156 |	These devices are fun but you could do the same thing
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:24,672	| IOT156 |	You could set it so
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:26,464	| IOT156 |	At 6:30 in the morning
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:29,280	| IOT156 |	Or 6 the light bulb turns yellow
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:32,096	| IOT156 |	The light mobile stay on and stay yellow
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:33,376	| IOT156 |	Up until like 7 a.m.
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:34,656	| IOT156 |	At which point it will turn
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:42,336	| IOT156 |	Sounds Draconian if you don't believe in this sort of thing but we did it with our daughter and it was awesome
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:43,104	| IOT156 |	We did
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:44,384	| IOT156 |	Get a little bit more sleep that way
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,432	| IOT156 |	So we always seem like
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:47,200	| IOT156 |	This light is on
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:48,992	| IOT156 |	It better be
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:50,528	| IOT156 |	Emergency
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:54,368	| IOT156 |	The others since you got a son
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:55,904	| IOT156 |	When you start potty training
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:57,184	| IOT156 |	A really useful thing to do
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:39:58,976	| IOT156 |	Do is stick a water sensor
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:39:59,744	| IOT156 |	By your toilet
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:02,816	| IOT156 |	Yes
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:04,608	| IOT156 |	It's actually really handy
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,656	| IOT156 |	I would use one of these
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:07,424	| IOT156 |	Corded
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:07,936	| IOT156 |	Watersense
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:09,984	| IOT156 |	Rinse it off
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:14,848	| IOT156 |	As opposed to
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:16,640	| IOT156 |	Some of the others which
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:17,408	| IOT156 |	May not react well to
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:20,736	| IOT156 |	This sounds disgusting that all parents know
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:23,552	| IOT156 |	And
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:27,904	| IOT156 |	I think those are probably some good things to start with also wants you have the echo dot UK
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:30,720	| IOT156 |	Can put in things like connected doorbells and you can tell
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:32,256	| IOT156 |	Hey Ma
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:34,304	| IOT156 |	Turn off the chime on this doorbell
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:36,608	| IOT156 |	And then you don't have the doorbell
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:37,120	| IOT156 |	Bringing drinks
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:41,216	| IOT156 |	You can have it all
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:43,264	| IOT156 |	Tell you stories are read audiobooks to you
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:43,776	| IOT156 |	And baby
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:46,336	| IOT156 |	Those are all options
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:48,384	| IOT156 |	Those are all good baby things to have
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:51,712	| IOT156 |	And hopefully that gives you some fun ideas
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:53,760	| IOT156 |	OneNote on that sensor
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:55,296	| IOT156 |	You're going to need a Smart Hub
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:57,088	| IOT156 |	How'd that you work with that sensor
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:58,624	| IOT156 |	To my knowledge right now there are no
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:00,416	| IOT156 |	Dedicated sensors
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:01,696	| IOT156 |	The Amazon
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:05,024	| IOT156 |	But then you can just get the whole house or tomorrow
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:06,048	| IOT156 |	And then once you're doing that
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:11,168	| IOT156 |	Like you're going to want to set up motion detector outside their door so
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:12,704	| IOT156 |	Wander around in the middle of the night
EDL	00:41:13,216	00:41:14,752	| IOT156 |	You know all sorts of
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:17,824	| IOT156 |	So that is our suggestion
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:19,872	| IOT156 |	Remember if
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:22,176	| IOT156 |	You have an iot question for us
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:23,968	| IOT156 |	Call Santa Hotline

EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:40,352	| IOT156 |	Camera and we'll just ship that out you have to be in North America
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:41,632	| IOT156 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:43,168	| IOT156 |	Next month we'll do a different giveaway
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:47,776	| IOT156 |	And just to do that just leave your email as part of your

EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:49,824	| IOT156 |	That sounds crazy
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:51,104	| IOT156 |	We won't run your email on there
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:52,384	| IOT156 |	And
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:55,455	| IOT156 |	And now
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:56,991	| IOT156 |	I feel like we've talked a lot
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:58,271	| IOT156 |	Let's move to our
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:42:00,575	| IOT156 |	Cast David kaiserman
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:05,439	| IOT156 |	And from Lennar Homes talking about what they're putting in their smart the future
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:07,231	| IOT156 |	And why they decided
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:13,631	| IOT156 |	To go with Matt of a as opposed to Siri
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:20,031	| IOT156 |	Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Samsung artik and I have John Jefferies of Samsung
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:23,871	| IOT156 |	Arctic here to talk about the identity of things
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:27,199	| IOT156 |	So remind us really quickly what it is that Samsung art
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:30,015	| IOT156 |	Samsung artik is a complete
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:31,807	| IOT156 |	Edge to Cloud platform
EDL	00:42:31,807	00:42:35,647	| IOT156 |	That delivers holistic security from the device
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:37,695	| IOT156 |	To the cloud and makes it so that
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:40,255	| IOT156 |	Device manufacturers don't have to learn
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:42,303	| IOT156 |	The Depths and intricacies of
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:43,071	| IOT156 |	Security
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:44,095	| IOT156 |	To the point
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:45,375	| IOT156 |	Secure IT solutions
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:46,143	| IOT156 |	Got it
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:46,911	| IOT156 |	So
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:48,447	| IOT156 |	Why does identity 4
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:49,215	| IOT156 |	Devices
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:52,287	| IOT156 |	Matter for the rule of identity and access management
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:53,567	| IOT156 |	Is expanding rapidly
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:55,359	| IOT156 |	Because it's no longer just about identifying
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:57,919	| IOT156 |	People in the New iot World Order
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:43:00,479	| IOT156 |	I am too. Oh must be able to identify
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:02,527	| IOT156 |	Devices sensors monitor
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:04,575	| IOT156 |	And be able to manage the access to the
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:06,367	| IOT156 |	Data and you guys are calling this
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:06,879	| IOT156 |	The identity of
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:08,671	| IOT156 |	What is that
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:14,303	| IOT156 |	The Diary of things is the ability to firmly and definitively identify a device on the net
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:16,607	| IOT156 |	The identity of things matter
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:17,119	| IOT156 |	For several reasons
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:19,935	| IOT156 |	First of all you need to be able to trust
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:23,263	| IOT156 |	The identity of the device to be able to trust the data that it produces
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:26,335	| IOT156 |	Furthermore you must be able to identify the device
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:28,127	| IOT156 |	As it's accessing your cloud
EDL	00:43:28,127	00:43:29,919	| IOT156 |	And sharing data in the cloud
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:34,527	| IOT156 |	You and I talked about this and you think that public key infrastructure is the best solution
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:36,063	| IOT156 |	Why
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:38,111	| IOT156 |	Public key infrastructure pki
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:40,415	| IOT156 |	Is proven technology
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:43,999	| IOT156 |	That creates and unforgeable cryptographic key
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:47,583	| IOT156 |	That firmly identifies its device in the same way
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:48,863	| IOT156 |	That publican
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:51,935	| IOT156 |	Is universally used to identify insecure websites
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:56,287	| IOT156 |	We are now using that to universally identify and secure iot devices
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:43:58,591	| IOT156 |	And their data why is it the best
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:00,895	| IOT156 |	Because it has been
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:04,479	| IOT156 |	Developed and proven overtime to be uncrackable and Unbreak
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:07,295	| IOT156 |	How does Samsung artik pull
EDL	00:44:07,295	00:44:08,831	| IOT156 |	Pki and
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:09,855	| IOT156 |	The identity of things
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:13,439	| IOT156 |	By building Hardware backed identity of things
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:16,255	| IOT156 |	Technology and tki management into the Arctic
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:21,119	| IOT156 |	You make it easy for Enterprises to enjoy the benefits of DKI all of our devices

EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:33,663	| IOT156 |	And rotate their keys
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:35,967	| IOT156 |	As may be necessary by their screw cost
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:38,271	| IOT156 |	To find out more about Samsung artik

EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:15,135	| IOT156 |	And I am super great I am sitting here in a linear model home and I've just been taken on a tour and seeing
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:16,927	| IOT156 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:17,951	| IOT156 |	Lutron

EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:20,255	| IOT156 |	Philip stuff
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:23,071	| IOT156 |	Amazon all kinds of crazy things where to find out
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:25,375	| IOT156 |	What your future new home
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:25,887	| IOT156 |	Might look like
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:27,167	| IOT156 |	Alright David
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:28,703	| IOT156 |	Talk to me about
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:29,983	| IOT156 |	Why when are
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:30,751	| IOT156 |	Is getting into the smart
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:32,031	| IOT156 |	And they protrude
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:33,311	| IOT156 |	Sure
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:34,079	| IOT156 |	Soyo
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:35,871	| IOT156 |	I think at the simplest level
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:37,407	| IOT156 |	We build a brand new home
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:38,943	| IOT156 |	And new really means
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:40,735	| IOT156 |	Is best-of-breed state-of-the-art
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:44,319	| IOT156 |	And so what a perfect place from a blank canvas to actually construct
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:45,855	| IOT156 |	A home that
EDL	00:45:45,855	00:45:47,391	| IOT156 |	Works seamlessly.
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:48,415	| IOT156 |	Wireless
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:50,207	| IOT156 |	It has all these devices connect
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:51,743	| IOT156 |	Get together for manufacturers
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:53,023	| IOT156 |	Entrust
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:53,791	| IOT156 |	Into
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:45:55,583	| IOT156 |	Feels like a
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:45:56,607	| IOT156 |	Combat under the hood
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:58,399	| IOT156 |	Really operates like a fine
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:45:58,911	| IOT156 |	Sports car
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:03,007	| IOT156 |	I9 Sports Car I cannot say that about my smartphone
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:04,287	| IOT156 |	All right
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:05,055	| IOT156 |	So
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:09,663	| IOT156 |	Throughout this process you've been talking to me about experience as opposed to the technology but
EDL	00:46:10,175	00:46:13,247	| IOT156 |	My listeners are super into the technology so just run down
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:16,319	| IOT156 |	Some of the devices and things that you thought was important
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:18,367	| IOT156 |	Introduce the rest of the world to the
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:23,999	| IOT156 |	Trick to it starts with a wireless infrastructure and we're proud to work with a company called Ruckus Wireless
EDL	00:46:23,999	00:46:27,071	| IOT156 |	A trillion RV was in the Bentley at access points
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:29,119	| IOT156 |	In the much more Enterprise in Byram
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:31,679	| IOT156 |	And it brought that into the residential environment
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:34,495	| IOT156 |	And include a wireless solution with Ruckus access
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:36,031	| IOT156 |	Appoint as a standard feature of all the homes
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:40,127	| IOT156 |	We've also worked very closely with the Wi-Fi Alliance
EDL	00:46:40,127	00:46:43,199	| IOT156 |	Which is the international standard-setting body for Wi-Fi
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:43,967	| IOT156 |	In
EDL	00:46:43,967	00:46:46,271	| IOT156 |	Cheap mapping our homes like you wouldn't office
EDL	00:46:46,271	00:46:49,087	| IOT156 |	To ensure that we have sufficient coverage that there are no dead Spa
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:51,391	| IOT156 |	The base of the home
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:54,975	| IOT156 |	Is an incredible Wireless environment that allows things to interconnect
EDL	00:46:54,975	00:47:00,351	| IOT156 |	And then we put together best of Ray products from companies like Honeywell and their lyric thermostat
EDL	00:47:00,351	00:47:02,655	| IOT156 |	Lutron and Erika Sato lighting product
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:03,679	| IOT156 |	Sonos
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:05,983	| IOT156 |	Ring video doorbell
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:09,567	| IOT156 |	Kwikset and their new Kevo lock that's embedded in Baldwin
EDL	00:47:10,079	00:47:10,847	| IOT156 |	Is the higher end
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:11,615	| IOT156 |	Form factor
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:12,895	| IOT156 |	Among other things
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:17,247	| IOT156 |	And really put them all together such that you can control them seamlessly from button
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:23,647	| IOT156 |	Better on the wall or maybe Pecos that are remotes to applications like the Samsung SmartThings application to your
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:24,671	| IOT156 |	Your voice by using
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:25,439	| IOT156 |	Alexa
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:26,719	| IOT156 |	And so for us
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:30,559	| IOT156 |	The ability to indistinguishably work across
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:31,839	| IOT156 |	Voice button
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:32,607	| IOT156 |	And
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:33,631	| IOT156 |	Applications of soup
EDL	00:47:34,911	00:47:36,703	| IOT156 |	Guys he just said off Madam a
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:38,495	| IOT156 |	That's good
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:42,079	| IOT156 |	Actually want you to a little bit more basic like lights they're really important
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:45,151	| IOT156 |	People so we thought we were going to prioritize connected lighting
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:47,199	| IOT156 |	The door is important so we priority like
EDL	00:47:47,711	00:47:50,015	| IOT156 |	So for people who may not have the chance
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:56,159	| IOT156 |	Maybe if they're like trying to create the biggest bang for their Buck how should they think about approaching a small
EDL	00:47:56,927	00:47:58,463	| IOT156 |	I think it starts with
EDL	00:47:58,463	00:47:58,975	| IOT156 |	Great Wireless
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:00,255	| IOT156 |	And I think
EDL	00:48:00,255	00:48:01,791	| IOT156 |	You can't think about the way you
EDL	00:48:01,791	00:48:04,095	| IOT156 |	Live your life and you mirror that so
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:05,887	| IOT156 |	The front door super important
EDL	00:48:05,887	00:48:06,911	| IOT156 |	A door lock
EDL	00:48:06,911	00:48:08,447	| IOT156 |	That can be controlled both
EDL	00:48:08,447	00:48:10,239	| IOT156 |	Remotely and Power
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:11,007	| IOT156 |	Your voice
EDL	00:48:11,007	00:48:14,335	| IOT156 |	A video doorbell that lets you know who's at your front door whether you're at work
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:16,383	| IOT156 |	Or whether you're in bed
EDL	00:48:16,383	00:48:17,151	| IOT156 |	My wife
EDL	00:48:17,151	00:48:17,919	| IOT156 |	Love's
EDL	00:48:17,919	00:48:21,247	| IOT156 |	Because it's technical or because it
EDL	00:48:21,759	00:48:22,527	| IOT156 |	Connected
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:25,599	| IOT156 |	She loves it because she tells me it makes her look good in her jeans
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:28,671	| IOT156 |	When she goes out if no bulge in her pocket
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:30,463	| IOT156 |	Alex Supertramp
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:32,511	| IOT156 |	On the flip side my wife
EDL	00:48:32,511	00:48:35,071	| IOT156 |	I always wonder what would happen
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:37,375	| IOT156 |	If we needed to open the door in the middle of the night
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:39,167	| IOT156 |	Maybe our kids were sick and
EDL	00:48:39,167	00:48:40,703	| IOT156 |	We need to let somebody in
EDL	00:48:40,703	00:48:43,519	| IOT156 |	Would we have to go downstairs and open that door but now we don't have to
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:47,615	| IOT156 |	So the technology is really faded into the background
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:53,247	| IOT156 |	But more importantly the stories of how it impacts in your life there's so many of them and we hear them customers
EDL	00:48:53,247	00:48:53,759	| IOT156 |	All the time
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:57,343	| IOT156 |	People have now been moving into these homes with this package
EDL	00:48:58,111	00:49:00,671	| IOT156 |	With this all of your homes have this it's not even
EDL	00:49:01,439	00:49:04,255	| IOT156 |	So what are the bumps that they found in then
EDL	00:49:04,255	00:49:05,023	| IOT156 |	What are the
EDL	00:49:05,535	00:49:08,095	| IOT156 |	Experiences that you're like oh my God I never thought of it
EDL	00:49:08,095	00:49:11,935	| IOT156 |	So the bumps clearly have been in and around how you activate
EDL	00:49:11,935	00:49:13,983	| IOT156 |	The products and how you make it work
EDL	00:49:13,983	00:49:16,031	| IOT156 |	For you and one of the things we announced
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:17,823	| IOT156 |	In June of last year with a partnership
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:18,591	| IOT156 |	With Amazon
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:21,151	| IOT156 |	Where they will come to everyone our home
EDL	00:49:21,151	00:49:23,967	| IOT156 |	And spend hours with every one of our customers
EDL	00:49:24,479	00:49:25,759	| IOT156 |	Chalk everything up
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:27,039	| IOT156 |	Customize it for the wave
EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:29,855	| IOT156 |	Cancel service has been
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:31,647	| IOT156 |	By far the most in
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:32,671	| IOT156 |	Important factor
EDL	00:49:32,671	00:49:34,463	| IOT156 |	People's excitement and actually
EDL	00:49:34,463	00:49:35,487	| IOT156 |	10 using the product
EDL	00:49:35,999	00:49:37,023	| IOT156 |	And then the products
EDL	00:49:37,023	00:49:39,071	| IOT156 |	Some cells in terms of be like a door lock
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:40,863	| IOT156 |	Echo Show in the
EDL	00:49:40,863	00:49:44,191	| IOT156 |	Music the notion of how they all work together seamlessly
EDL	00:49:44,191	00:49:44,959	| IOT156 |	So that
EDL	00:49:44,959	00:49:45,983	| IOT156 |	One voice command
EDL	00:49:46,751	00:49:48,287	| IOT156 |	Trigger a bunch of different things
EDL	00:49:48,287	00:49:50,335	| IOT156 |	People have been much more interested in
EDL	00:49:50,335	00:49:51,871	| IOT156 |	How do you set up a voice command
EDL	00:49:51,871	00:49:53,151	| IOT156 |	How does everything how to work
EDL	00:49:53,151	00:49:53,919	| IOT156 |	Together so
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:54,943	| IOT156 |	We've been very
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:55,967	| IOT156 |	Focused on
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:57,247	| IOT156 |	Establishing
EDL	00:49:57,247	00:49:58,015	| IOT156 |	Suggestion
EDL	00:49:58,015	00:50:01,599	| IOT156 |	Write up voice commands like movie time or party time
EDL	00:50:01,599	00:50:07,231	| IOT156 |	Or who's at the front door or lock my front door and getting people awareness around
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:09,023	| IOT156 |	What they can do not how it works
EDL	00:50:09,791	00:50:13,375	| IOT156 |	Does Amazon dildos or do the residents build them after they move in
EDL	00:50:13,887	00:50:14,655	| IOT156 |	And you together
EDL	00:50:14,655	00:50:16,703	| IOT156 |	So we had a list of recommendations
EDL	00:50:16,703	00:50:18,495	| IOT156 |	Amazon sits down with our customers
EDL	00:50:18,495	00:50:20,799	| IOT156 |	They share a starting list
EDL	00:50:20,799	00:50:25,407	| IOT156 |	And then they sit down together and they customize for what they need so if you're a working mom you met
EDL	00:50:25,407	00:50:27,199	| IOT156 |	Want to be able to give someone access
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:29,247	| IOT156 |	List your home during certain times of the day
EDL	00:50:29,247	00:50:31,551	| IOT156 |	That may be different than an active adults
EDL	00:50:31,551	00:50:32,319	| IOT156 |	Cool watch
EDL	00:50:32,319	00:50:36,415	| IOT156 |	How to get their grandkids access less frequently than a millennial
EDL	00:50:36,415	00:50:39,487	| IOT156 |	Who wants to be able to let nobody in unless they bring the
EDL	00:50:40,255	00:50:41,023	| IOT156 |	Until
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:42,303	| IOT156 |	We show them the
EDL	00:50:42,303	00:50:45,119	| IOT156 |	Tools that they have and then we listen to their life
EDL	00:50:45,119	00:50:47,679	| IOT156 |	And we have a real human conversation about what you need
EDL	00:50:47,679	00:50:50,751	| IOT156 |	You know what we can provide and we trade a custom solution
EDL	00:50:50,751	00:50:51,263	| IOT156 |	Every single
EDL	00:50:52,031	00:50:55,615	| IOT156 |	Is this the future of Home Building the future of life
EDL	00:50:55,615	00:50:57,151	| IOT156 |	And I think if you look around
EDL	00:50:57,151	00:50:58,175	| IOT156 |	When's the last time
EDL	00:50:58,175	00:50:58,943	| IOT156 |	People put a
EDL	00:50:58,943	00:51:00,991	| IOT156 |	Key in their car door to open it
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:01,759	| IOT156 |	It's just
EDL	00:51:01,759	00:51:03,551	| IOT156 |	Some are expected today that
EDL	00:51:03,551	00:51:04,575	| IOT156 |	Cars have
EDL	00:51:04,575	00:51:05,343	| IOT156 |	Keyless entry
EDL	00:51:05,343	00:51:06,111	| IOT156 |	I think homes
EDL	00:51:06,623	00:51:09,695	| IOT156 |	It will be expected if they have keyless entry automated lights
EDL	00:51:10,463	00:51:11,231	| IOT156 |	Technology
EDL	00:51:11,231	00:51:13,535	| IOT156 |	And I also think that people will expect
EDL	00:51:13,535	00:51:14,047	| IOT156 |	Home builders
EDL	00:51:14,559	00:51:18,143	| IOT156 |	Not only focus on the mechanical systems of the home the electrical
EDL	00:51:18,655	00:51:19,423	| IOT156 |	Plumbing Systems
EDL	00:51:19,935	00:51:21,727	| IOT156 |	The Architects will begin to
EDL	00:51:21,727	00:51:22,751	| IOT156 |	Provide Wireless
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:26,079	| IOT156 |	Just like they do mechanical electrical and plumbing plan
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:27,359	| IOT156 |	I'm at
EDL	00:51:27,359	00:51:28,895	| IOT156 |	Homes going forward
EDL	00:51:28,895	00:51:30,687	| IOT156 |	Won't use extenders in
EDL	00:51:30,687	00:51:31,455	| IOT156 |	Peters
EDL	00:51:31,455	00:51:33,503	| IOT156 |	Go use really architected
EDL	00:51:33,503	00:51:36,319	| IOT156 |	Wireless solutions that will come down in price as they have
EDL	00:51:36,319	00:51:38,111	| IOT156 |	And provide this experience where you
EDL	00:51:38,623	00:51:39,135	| IOT156 |	Whatsapp
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:41,951	| IOT156 |	Sometimes even faster inside the network
EDL	00:51:41,951	00:51:42,975	| IOT156 |	In the public internet
EDL	00:51:44,511	00:51:46,815	| IOT156 |	You guys did with the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:51:46,815	00:51:48,863	| IOT156 |	You guys did the Wi-Fi certified home Stan
EDL	00:51:49,887	00:51:51,935	| IOT156 |	Clearly this is the Bedrock
EDL	00:51:51,935	00:51:55,775	| IOT156 |	For your home but why choose Wi-Fi
EDL	00:51:55,775	00:52:00,127	| IOT156 |	Over maybe some of the other standards that are familiar in the smart home and does that preclude using
EDL	00:52:00,895	00:52:04,991	| IOT156 |	Sacre question it doesn't preclude it at all in fact Lutron use as an internal
EDL	00:52:04,991	00:52:06,527	| IOT156 |	Proprietary Network clear connect
EDL	00:52:07,039	00:52:08,831	| IOT156 |	But the ability to access
EDL	00:52:08,831	00:52:11,391	| IOT156 |	Those devices from outside of the home
EDL	00:52:11,391	00:52:13,695	| IOT156 |	Is dependent on Wi-Fi so there are
EDL	00:52:13,695	00:52:14,719	| IOT156 |	Many different
EDL	00:52:14,719	00:52:16,255	| IOT156 |	Marriage is a different
EDL	00:52:16,255	00:52:16,767	| IOT156 |	Standards
EDL	00:52:17,279	00:52:17,791	| IOT156 |	I think
EDL	00:52:18,303	00:52:20,351	| IOT156 |	We pick WiFi for two reasons
EDL	00:52:20,863	00:52:22,143	| IOT156 |	One it's brand
EDL	00:52:22,143	00:52:24,959	| IOT156 |	And it clearly the world over is recognized
EDL	00:52:24,959	00:52:26,239	| IOT156 |	Half of the internet traffic
EDL	00:52:26,239	00:52:28,031	| IOT156 |	We know today is over Wi-Fi
EDL	00:52:28,031	00:52:29,823	| IOT156 |	And I think the second reason to is
EDL	00:52:29,823	00:52:30,591	| IOT156 |	We seen
EDL	00:52:30,591	00:52:31,359	| IOT156 |	Most manufacturer
EDL	00:52:32,383	00:52:33,407	| IOT156 |	Most manufacturer
EDL	00:52:33,407	00:52:36,991	| IOT156 |	Adopt some form of Wi-Fi integration whether it's
EDL	00:52:36,991	00:52:39,807	| IOT156 |	Remotely controlling it from the outside or even internally
EDL	00:52:40,319	00:52:43,135	| IOT156 |	The network include things like BL
EDL	00:52:43,647	00:52:45,695	| IOT156 |	Wicker front door lock Odyssey uses
EDL	00:52:45,695	00:52:46,719	| IOT156 |	Or clear connector
EDL	00:52:46,719	00:52:48,255	| IOT156 |	Tricare standard light
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:49,279	| IOT156 |	Lutron system
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:50,815	| IOT156 |	We think the unifying
EDL	00:52:50,815	00:52:53,119	| IOT156 |	Thread throughout all of those is Wi-Fi
EDL	00:52:53,631	00:52:55,167	| IOT156 |	And then on top of that layers different standard
EDL	00:52:56,703	00:53:00,287	| IOT156 |	This was a hugely controversial move for you guys I remember reading in
EDL	00:53:00,287	00:53:03,871	| IOT156 |	Ice Pro oh my God
EDL	00:53:03,871	00:53:05,663	| IOT156 |	Do you get better everything over wires
EDL	00:53:05,663	00:53:06,175	| IOT156 |	So
EDL	00:53:06,687	00:53:13,087	| IOT156 |	Practice how has that played out and then also how you convinced you know the CD of community and other people who are
EDL	00:53:13,087	00:53:13,599	| IOT156 |	Hardwired
EDL	00:53:15,391	00:53:18,719	| IOT156 |	I think a couple things one is we have not thrown out the wires in the
EDL	00:53:19,231	00:53:20,767	| IOT156 |	I know that's been reported but
EDL	00:53:20,767	00:53:22,559	| IOT156 |	That's not true we have
EDL	00:53:22,559	00:53:25,119	| IOT156 |	Continue to provide a balance
EDL	00:53:25,119	00:53:26,655	| IOT156 |	Amount of structured wiring
EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:28,447	| IOT156 |	With a much more robust Wireless in my
EDL	00:53:29,215	00:53:32,287	| IOT156 |	And from a consumer perspective which I think ultimately defines
EDL	00:53:32,799	00:53:34,335	| IOT156 |	Many people's perspectives
EDL	00:53:34,335	00:53:36,383	| IOT156 |	When's the last time you took your laptop in
EDL	00:53:36,383	00:53:36,895	| IOT156 |	And plugged it into
EDL	00:53:37,919	00:53:39,711	| IOT156 |	I do it every week but I record a show
EDL	00:53:39,711	00:53:40,991	| IOT156 |	So so
EDL	00:53:40,991	00:53:42,015	| IOT156 |	Ever the app
EDL	00:53:42,015	00:53:44,575	| IOT156 |	Everyone else mini-computers don't even have any
EDL	00:53:44,575	00:53:45,855	| IOT156 |	My computer doesn't have an Ethernet
EDL	00:53:46,367	00:53:47,135	| IOT156 |	That's right
EDL	00:53:47,135	00:53:50,463	| IOT156 |	I think we're finding that it's not one or the other
EDL	00:53:50,463	00:53:53,279	| IOT156 |	But it's a healthy marriage about that we still have cable Jackson
EDL	00:53:53,791	00:53:57,119	| IOT156 |	Coax in our rooms were pulling out things where we're going
EDL	00:53:57,119	00:53:59,423	| IOT156 |	Super extreme environment
EDL	00:53:59,423	00:54:01,727	| IOT156 |	Work cry and Ice balance but we do now
EDL	00:54:01,727	00:54:04,799	| IOT156 |	Is that people come think of their home at the place that they make their memory
EDL	00:54:05,311	00:54:07,871	| IOT156 |	Whether family grows up where they have parties where they do things
EDL	00:54:08,383	00:54:14,783	| IOT156 |	I'll be in their minds forever and the technology that they have around them if it different in the home then it isn't
EDL	00:54:14,783	00:54:16,319	| IOT156 |	Every other aspect of their life
EDL	00:54:16,319	00:54:17,343	| IOT156 |	Brings the home down
EDL	00:54:17,855	00:54:20,159	| IOT156 |	And what we want to do is kind of bring the home back up to
EDL	00:54:20,159	00:54:20,927	| IOT156 |	Speed
EDL	00:54:20,927	00:54:24,767	| IOT156 |	Your car is super technology-enabled it still drives like a car
EDL	00:54:25,279	00:54:26,303	| IOT156 |	Just like the office
EDL	00:54:26,303	00:54:28,095	| IOT156 |	Is super technological
EDL	00:54:28,095	00:54:31,935	| IOT156 |	Still your office your home is just kind of falling behind it so you look at
EDL	00:54:32,447	00:54:35,519	| IOT156 |	Companies like apple and Amazon and Google and Samsung
EDL	00:54:35,519	00:54:38,079	| IOT156 |	They're all making huge bets on home
EDL	00:54:38,079	00:54:38,847	| IOT156 |	Because it's that
EDL	00:54:39,359	00:54:40,639	| IOT156 |	Can a gaping hole
EDL	00:54:40,639	00:54:41,919	| IOT156 |	In the world where
EDL	00:54:41,919	00:54:43,967	| IOT156 |	Life is different inside your home that it is
EDL	00:54:43,967	00:54:44,735	| IOT156 |	Almost every
EDL	00:54:45,247	00:54:47,295	| IOT156 |	Let's talk about Security in
EDL	00:54:47,295	00:54:47,807	| IOT156 |	Privacy
EDL	00:54:48,319	00:54:50,623	| IOT156 |	Because you guys set this up and
EDL	00:54:50,623	00:54:51,647	| IOT156 |	Do you manage it
EDL	00:54:51,647	00:54:53,439	| IOT156 |	So we allow eats
EDL	00:54:53,439	00:54:55,999	| IOT156 |	Persons Network to be managed by themselves
EDL	00:54:55,999	00:54:57,535	| IOT156 |	Provide them access
EDL	00:54:57,535	00:55:01,119	| IOT156 |	Simply to Amazon if you have any questions for adjustments or
EDL	00:55:01,119	00:55:04,191	| IOT156 |	We actually provide a 90-day happiness guarantee that
EDL	00:55:04,191	00:55:05,215	| IOT156 |	If I need tweaks
EDL	00:55:05,215	00:55:07,775	| IOT156 |	The first 90 days Amazon will continue to come out in
EDL	00:55:07,775	00:55:08,799	| IOT156 |	Do that for them
EDL	00:55:08,799	00:55:10,079	| IOT156 |	But their home is their home
EDL	00:55:10,079	00:55:12,639	| IOT156 |	We're not managing it we're not listening in on it
EDL	00:55:13,919	00:55:17,247	| IOT156 |	But we're not a technology company and we partnered with people
EDL	00:55:17,247	00:55:21,087	| IOT156 |	We take these matters really really seriously and we place a lot of stock
EDL	00:55:21,087	00:55:23,391	| IOT156 |	In their level of Neo scrutiny
EDL	00:55:25,183	00:55:28,255	| IOT156 |	Security but what we do is build we have a canvas
EDL	00:55:28,767	00:55:30,303	| IOT156 |	From which people can actually
EDL	00:55:30,303	00:55:32,863	| IOT156 |	Bring all these pieces together now it's more than just
EDL	00:55:32,863	00:55:34,143	| IOT156 |	People who live in our home
EDL	00:55:34,143	00:55:35,167	| IOT156 |	Turn many people
EDL	00:55:35,167	00:55:36,959	| IOT156 |	Come by our model home centers
EDL	00:55:36,959	00:55:38,239	| IOT156 |	Want to
EDL	00:55:39,263	00:55:44,127	| IOT156 |	Decorating ideas we have a bit of floor plan ideas we have maybe the home automation
EDL	00:55:44,127	00:55:49,247	| IOT156 |	We're starting to see that the influence is not just directly to people that are buying home
EDL	00:55:49,247	00:55:50,271	| IOT156 |	The people are
EDL	00:55:50,271	00:55:51,039	| IOT156 |	Curious
EDL	00:55:51,039	00:55:53,087	| IOT156 |	About how all these things work together
EDL	00:55:53,087	00:55:55,647	| IOT156 |	Until you go to Best Buy it's very very hard
EDL	00:55:55,647	00:55:57,695	| IOT156 |	Understand how the whole system works together
EDL	00:55:58,207	00:56:01,023	| IOT156 |	You sit in the couch down our living room you say movie time
EDL	00:56:01,535	00:56:02,559	| IOT156 |	And all the subsystem
EDL	00:56:03,071	00:56:04,607	| IOT156 |	Scarifier at once
EDL	00:56:04,607	00:56:07,679	| IOT156 |	And you get that experience and people are beginning to see that
EDL	00:56:07,679	00:56:10,239	| IOT156 |	You know it's about the sum of the parts and not the end of it
EDL	00:56:10,751	00:56:11,775	| IOT156 |	Okay
EDL	00:56:11,775	00:56:14,335	| IOT156 |	And what about Security in terms of
EDL	00:56:14,335	00:56:15,615	| IOT156 |	He put all the stuff in here
EDL	00:56:16,127	00:56:17,151	| IOT156 |	Let's say
EDL	00:56:17,151	00:56:18,687	| IOT156 |	My Lutron lights get hacked
EDL	00:56:19,199	00:56:19,711	| IOT156 |	So far not
EDL	00:56:20,223	00:56:20,991	| IOT156 |	However
EDL	00:56:20,991	00:56:22,527	| IOT156 |	Let's say there's a vulnerability that
EDL	00:56:22,527	00:56:23,039	| IOT156 |	Discovered
EDL	00:56:23,551	00:56:25,855	| IOT156 |	How do you ensure that Lutron does this so people
EDL	00:56:26,367	00:56:28,415	| IOT156 |	Where's the responsibility first off
EDL	00:56:28,927	00:56:29,695	| IOT156 |	And what are you doing
EDL	00:56:29,695	00:56:31,487	| IOT156 |	In the beginning
EDL	00:56:31,487	00:56:36,607	| IOT156 |	And I think we've been very careful to pick people that have demonstrated to us
EDL	00:56:36,607	00:56:40,191	| IOT156 |	Significant resources behind not only security
EDL	00:56:40,191	00:56:41,727	| IOT156 |	Customer service
EDL	00:56:41,727	00:56:43,007	| IOT156 |	Liability in everything
EDL	00:56:44,543	00:56:48,639	| IOT156 |	And instead of having 30 different manufacturers in this home
EDL	00:56:48,639	00:56:50,943	| IOT156 |	What heater 9 but will have very
EDL	00:56:50,943	00:56:51,967	| IOT156 |	Deep levels of
EDL	00:56:51,967	00:56:55,039	| IOT156 |	Conversations in relationships all the way to the senior levels
EDL	00:56:55,039	00:56:56,319	| IOT156 |	To make sure
EDL	00:56:56,319	00:56:58,111	| IOT156 |	That what they put in our homes
EDL	00:56:58,623	00:57:01,695	| IOT156 |	You not only works but it's supported and they're aligned
EDL	00:57:01,695	00:57:02,719	| IOT156 |	Towards that with us
EDL	00:57:03,231	00:57:04,255	| IOT156 |	Because as they
EDL	00:57:04,255	00:57:05,279	| IOT156 |	Look to sell their products
EDL	00:57:05,791	00:57:07,839	| IOT156 |	And they look at the deficiencies of retail
EDL	00:57:07,839	00:57:10,143	| IOT156 |	When I say reach I mean that aisle at Best Buy
EDL	00:57:10,655	00:57:11,167	| IOT156 |	Retail
EDL	00:57:11,679	00:57:15,007	| IOT156 |	They want to be able to tell a story about how their product works
EDL	00:57:15,007	00:57:16,287	| IOT156 |	As much as anybody
EDL	00:57:16,287	00:57:19,359	| IOT156 |	Lennar has more model homes in Target actually has stores
EDL	00:57:19,359	00:57:21,919	| IOT156 |	Until the notion of being able to
EDL	00:57:21,919	00:57:23,455	| IOT156 |	Having to get it right
EDL	00:57:23,455	00:57:23,967	| IOT156 |	Is
EDL	00:57:24,479	00:57:25,247	| IOT156 |	Bo tables
EDL	00:57:26,015	00:57:29,087	| IOT156 |	And supporting it when things go wrong and they will go wrong
EDL	00:57:29,087	00:57:30,367	| IOT156 |	Play Everything Is Not Perfect
EDL	00:57:30,879	00:57:32,671	| IOT156 |	Having the infrastructure in place
EDL	00:57:32,671	00:57:33,951	| IOT156 |	Really defines the universal
EDL	00:57:35,231	00:57:40,095	| IOT156 |	Okay and then what kind of things do you suggest to your users when they
EDL	00:57:40,095	00:57:41,375	| IOT156 |	Common in terms of setting up
EDL	00:57:41,887	00:57:44,447	| IOT156 |	Like the commissioning and let's talk about the decommissioning of a
EDL	00:57:45,215	00:57:46,239	| IOT156 |	How does that process take
EDL	00:57:47,007	00:57:48,287	| IOT156 |	Who just started this sub
EDL	00:57:48,799	00:57:49,823	| IOT156 |	Decommissioning
EDL	00:57:49,823	00:57:51,359	| IOT156 |	Isn't something different
EDL	00:57:51,359	00:57:52,127	| IOT156 |	Experience
EDL	00:57:52,127	00:57:54,175	| IOT156 |	How to take the commissioning of the home
EDL	00:57:54,175	00:57:55,967	| IOT156 |	It's something that we actually wanted
EDL	00:57:55,967	00:57:56,735	| IOT156 |	Take away
EDL	00:57:57,247	00:57:58,527	| IOT156 |	From the
EDL	00:57:58,527	00:58:01,087	| IOT156 |	Perspective of the consumer and do for them
EDL	00:58:01,087	00:58:03,903	| IOT156 |	And we want to do it for them in a branded way so
EDL	00:58:03,903	00:58:07,231	| IOT156 |	Amazon has just launched its new experts business which is
EDL	00:58:07,231	00:58:09,279	| IOT156 |	Amazon employees that come in
EDL	00:58:09,279	00:58:11,583	| IOT156 |	To help both activate devices that we
EDL	00:58:11,583	00:58:12,607	| IOT156 |	Include with our home
EDL	00:58:12,607	00:58:14,143	| IOT156 |	And sell you more devices
EDL	00:58:14,143	00:58:15,423	| IOT156 |	That you want to add on to your home
EDL	00:58:15,935	00:58:18,239	| IOT156 |	They are super trained
EDL	00:58:18,239	00:58:21,567	| IOT156 |	In not only how each device works but how they
EDL	00:58:21,567	00:58:22,591	| IOT156 |	Can grow
EDL	00:58:22,591	00:58:26,687	| IOT156 |	And we believe that a white glove approach is absolutely essential
EDL	00:58:26,687	00:58:29,759	| IOT156 |	At least now even though these are DIY products
EDL	00:58:29,759	00:58:31,039	| IOT156 |	They can get very complicated
EDL	00:58:31,551	00:58:34,367	| IOT156 |	And so in order for them to work reliably
EDL	00:58:34,367	00:58:36,927	| IOT156 |	Together and for the experience really to shine through
EDL	00:58:36,927	00:58:38,975	| IOT156 |	We think has to be done in all white clubwear
EDL	00:58:38,975	00:58:40,255	| IOT156 |	Okay
EDL	00:58:40,255	00:58:41,791	| IOT156 |	Tell me you do have a plan for Deke
EDL	00:58:42,815	00:58:44,095	| IOT156 |	Surely you may not have done it
EDL	00:58:44,607	00:58:47,423	| IOT156 |	Like what I move out what happens when I move out of your smart
EDL	00:58:47,423	00:58:48,191	| IOT156 |	So
EDL	00:58:48,191	00:58:49,471	| IOT156 |	Our plan is
EDL	00:58:49,471	00:58:51,775	| IOT156 |	Probably the same which is Amazon or
EDL	00:58:51,775	00:58:56,383	| IOT156 |	Some bread Partnership of people that have dedicated experts available to you
EDL	00:58:56,383	00:58:57,151	| IOT156 |	To do so
EDL	00:58:57,151	00:58:59,199	| IOT156 |	Intercourse can people live in their homes for
EDL	00:58:59,199	00:59:00,223	| IOT156 |	789 years
EDL	00:59:00,735	00:59:01,503	| IOT156 |	Things are going to change
EDL	00:59:02,015	00:59:03,551	| IOT156 |	They're going to be new technologies
EDL	00:59:03,551	00:59:06,623	| IOT156 |	Our homes today don't include things like Wireless blood pressure
EDL	00:59:06,623	00:59:09,951	| IOT156 |	I put the code in the future or maybe Wireless medical devices
EDL	00:59:10,463	00:59:12,255	| IOT156 |	There are going to be things that are going to be
EDL	00:59:12,255	00:59:13,279	| IOT156 |	Added change
EDL	00:59:13,791	00:59:15,071	| IOT156 |	Take it away from the system
EDL	00:59:15,071	00:59:18,399	| IOT156 |	And again our belief is that with those changes comes
EDL	00:59:18,399	00:59:19,935	| IOT156 |	Sphere and uncertainty
EDL	00:59:19,935	00:59:23,263	| IOT156 |	Doubt that should be best delayed by
EDL	00:59:23,263	00:59:24,031	| IOT156 |	Sardis
EDL	00:59:24,031	00:59:25,311	| IOT156 |	White Glove service
EDL	00:59:25,311	00:59:26,079	| IOT156 |	Branzino
EDL	00:59:27,103	00:59:31,455	| IOT156 |	So in this model because I mean a granite countertop for example is going to last
EDL	00:59:31,455	00:59:32,479	| IOT156 |	Gosh probably forever
EDL	00:59:34,783	00:59:38,367	| IOT156 |	I might eventually I might get tired of it and I'll renovate my kitchen but
EDL	00:59:38,367	00:59:42,207	| IOT156 |	There is no equivalent yet for renovating your smartphone
EDL	00:59:42,207	00:59:43,999	| IOT156 |	Pulling out your old Gear in
EDL	00:59:43,999	00:59:45,279	| IOT156 |	Adding new gear
EDL	00:59:45,279	00:59:47,839	| IOT156 |	So it's just it's an interesting thought
EDL	00:59:47,839	00:59:51,167	| IOT156 |	I spend a lot of time with his I've got devices my home for like 5 years
EDL	00:59:51,167	00:59:51,679	| IOT156 |	Json like
EDL	00:59:52,703	00:59:56,031	| IOT156 |	These are predictions are not sure that would rather be right or wrong
EDL	00:59:56,031	00:59:57,823	| IOT156 |	But I believe the world is a wireless
EDL	00:59:58,335	01:00:00,639	| IOT156 |	And that in order for us to
EDL	01:00:01,151	01:00:01,919	| IOT156 |	Change
EDL	01:00:01,919	01:00:02,943	| IOT156 |	Sayings
EDL	01:00:02,943	01:00:03,967	| IOT156 |	Bike locks and lights
EDL	01:00:05,247	01:00:05,759	| IOT156 |	Is the fable
EDL	01:00:06,271	01:00:10,367	| IOT156 |	You have to think whether it would be a wired world or a wireless World in respect of those
EDL	01:00:10,879	01:00:12,415	| IOT156 |	If you believe it's a wireless
EDL	01:00:12,927	01:00:13,695	| IOT156 |	Which is the premise
EDL	01:00:13,695	01:00:14,463	| IOT156 |	We're starting from
EDL	01:00:14,463	01:00:16,767	| IOT156 |	Then you look at the Box
EDL	01:00:16,767	01:00:19,071	| IOT156 |	That's on the ceiling that's a Wi-Fi box
EDL	01:00:19,583	01:00:20,351	| IOT156 |	The Rock
EDL	01:00:20,351	01:00:22,143	| IOT156 |	And you say what what about
EDL	01:00:22,911	01:00:23,935	| IOT156 |	What is the radio frequency
EDL	01:00:24,959	01:00:26,239	| IOT156 |	What if the
EDL	01:00:26,239	01:00:26,751	| IOT156 |	Software
EDL	01:00:27,775	01:00:30,591	| IOT156 |	There's a combination of hardware and over the air updates
EDL	01:00:30,591	01:00:32,127	| IOT156 |	Can be put together
EDL	01:00:32,127	01:00:33,407	| IOT156 |	That will change
EDL	01:00:33,407	01:00:34,687	| IOT156 |	Wireless signals that made
EDL	01:00:35,199	01:00:38,015	| IOT156 |	But it won't change the nature of what you
EDL	01:00:38,015	01:00:39,039	| IOT156 |	Which is Wireless
EDL	01:00:39,551	01:00:40,319	| IOT156 |	And it's all
EDL	01:00:40,319	01:00:43,391	| IOT156 |	And then you also think about things like the control center
EDL	01:00:43,391	01:00:45,183	| IOT156 |	Are the panels where we put all the
EDL	01:00:45,183	01:00:47,487	| IOT156 |	Relevant pieces of Technology like the hubs
EDL	01:00:47,487	01:00:49,023	| IOT156 |	And we think about things like
EDL	01:00:49,023	01:00:50,047	| IOT156 |	Should I be metal
EDL	01:00:50,047	01:00:52,095	| IOT156 |	Historically does a Bento Box
EDL	01:00:52,095	01:00:54,143	| IOT156 |	Metal and wireless don't, go together
EDL	01:00:54,143	01:00:54,911	| IOT156 |	We have a plastic one
EDL	01:00:56,191	01:00:57,471	| IOT156 |	Do you have enough room inside of
EDL	01:00:58,239	01:01:01,567	| IOT156 |	Do you have enough structured wiring run to other places in the home edit
EDL	01:01:01,567	01:01:05,151	| IOT156 |	If you had to attach some sort of wireless device to the network
EDL	01:01:05,919	01:01:07,455	| IOT156 |	Those are all things
EDL	01:01:07,455	01:01:08,223	| IOT156 |	We think about
EDL	01:01:08,223	01:01:10,271	| IOT156 |	And while there's no Assurance of a
EDL	01:01:10,271	01:01:11,039	| IOT156 |	Will be perfect
EDL	01:01:11,039	01:01:11,807	| IOT156 |	Going down
EDL	01:01:12,319	01:01:13,087	| IOT156 |	Future
EDL	01:01:13,087	01:01:14,623	| IOT156 |	We got as much as we can
EDL	01:01:14,623	01:01:15,135	| IOT156 |	Future-proof
EDL	01:01:15,647	01:01:17,951	| IOT156 |	Right to accommodation Not Just Wireless
EDL	01:01:17,951	01:01:19,743	| IOT156 |	Wireless infrastructure
EDL	01:01:19,743	01:01:20,255	| IOT156 |	To the end devices
EDL	01:01:20,767	01:01:21,791	| IOT156 |	Wired into
EDL	01:01:21,791	01:01:22,559	| IOT156 |	Structure
EDL	01:01:22,559	01:01:23,583	| IOT156 |	To various
EDL	01:01:24,607	01:01:25,375	| IOT156 |	Awesome
EDL	01:01:25,375	01:01:29,727	| IOT156 |	And if I am a company and I really like this idea and want to work with you
EDL	01:01:29,727	01:01:31,263	| IOT156 |	How does that happen how do you pick your part
EDL	01:01:31,775	01:01:33,311	| IOT156 |	So the first thing we've done is we've
EDL	01:01:33,311	01:01:34,591	| IOT156 |	Partners
EDL	01:01:34,591	01:01:35,359	| IOT156 |	Have
EDL	01:01:35,359	01:01:37,919	| IOT156 |	The depth of resources to support their cause
EDL	01:01:38,687	01:01:40,735	| IOT156 |	Security customer care
EDL	01:01:40,735	01:01:42,271	| IOT156 |	Replacements manufacturer
EDL	01:01:42,271	01:01:44,831	| IOT156 |	That really limits the world
EDL	01:01:44,831	01:01:45,599	| IOT156 |	People that we have work
EDL	01:01:45,599	01:01:47,647	| IOT156 |	Because there's so many cool interesting
EDL	01:01:48,159	01:01:49,439	| IOT156 |	Technologies out there
EDL	01:01:49,439	01:01:50,207	| IOT156 |	But
EDL	01:01:50,207	01:01:53,023	| IOT156 |	They don't have the maturity of the industrial manufacturer
EDL	01:01:54,047	01:01:55,583	| IOT156 |	And so for us in order to have
EDL	01:01:56,095	01:02:01,727	| IOT156 |	Some reliability in this market today restricted ourselves to those industrial manufacturers
EDL	01:02:01,727	01:02:03,519	| IOT156 |	All those resources in place
EDL	01:02:04,031	01:02:09,151	| IOT156 |	I'm at overtime as people want to bring in their own Technologies that's where Amazon comes
EDL	01:02:09,151	01:02:10,431	| IOT156 |	Seldom different things
EDL	01:02:10,943	01:02:14,271	| IOT156 |	So will give you the base but sort of the infrastructure that we think is
EDL	01:02:14,271	01:02:15,551	| IOT156 |	Solid and reliable
EDL	01:02:16,063	01:02:18,111	| IOT156 |	You got to change it as you want
EDL	01:02:19,135	01:02:21,951	| IOT156 |	To be clear I could buy it from someplace other than Amazon and bring it in
EDL	01:02:23,231	01:02:25,279	| IOT156 |	Okay and final question for you because
EDL	01:02:25,791	01:02:29,631	| IOT156 |	Many many many months ago you guys were working with apple and homekit
EDL	01:02:29,631	01:02:31,167	| IOT156 |	When are we going to be at home kit come
EDL	01:02:31,167	01:02:31,679	| IOT156 |	And then
EDL	01:02:32,959	01:02:33,983	| IOT156 |	Les Paul
EDL	01:02:33,983	01:02:35,007	| IOT156 |	No I guess it was June
EDL	01:02:35,519	01:02:36,287	| IOT156 |	You said
EDL	01:02:36,287	01:02:37,055	| IOT156 |	Amazon
EDL	01:02:37,055	01:02:39,103	| IOT156 |	Madam is the way to go
EDL	01:02:39,103	01:02:42,943	| IOT156 |	So we have a lot of regard for apple and their engineering Carlos and we've been
EDL	01:02:42,943	01:02:43,967	| IOT156 |	The products of a plethora
EDL	01:02:44,479	01:02:47,807	| IOT156 |	Our decision in moving forward with Amazon was really based on things that app
EDL	01:02:48,831	01:02:49,599	| IOT156 |	A service work
EDL	01:02:50,623	01:02:53,695	| IOT156 |	The ability to retail additional products of real size
EDL	01:02:54,719	01:02:55,487	| IOT156 |	Greater scope
EDL	01:02:56,255	01:02:58,047	| IOT156 |	The ability to work cross
EDL	01:02:58,559	01:03:00,607	| IOT156 |	Multiple different devices
EDL	01:03:00,607	01:03:02,911	| IOT156 |	And still work together with like a Samsung
EDL	01:03:03,423	01:03:07,263	| IOT156 |	Right kind of together the strategy of matinee as you call her
EDL	01:03:07,263	01:03:11,103	| IOT156 |	Be incorporated into Sonos speakers and incorporate into other devices
EDL	01:03:11,615	01:03:13,919	| IOT156 |	We looked at those principles and he said
EDL	01:03:13,919	01:03:18,015	| IOT156 |	As we try to sell a different way of living of reimagine way of living
EDL	01:03:18,527	01:03:21,087	| IOT156 |	The degree of flexibility that allowed for
EDL	01:03:21,087	01:03:22,111	| IOT156 |	Alegria service
EDL	01:03:22,623	01:03:24,159	| IOT156 |	That's being provided for
EDL	01:03:24,159	01:03:24,927	| IOT156 |	Was very different
EDL	01:03:25,439	01:03:26,207	| IOT156 |	Apple was
EDL	01:03:27,999	01:03:30,559	| IOT156 |	There's nothing in our homes that couldn't be hooked up the home
EDL	01:03:30,559	01:03:31,839	| IOT156 |	Many of the devices we have
EDL	01:03:31,839	01:03:32,351	| IOT156 |	Happy happiness
EDL	01:03:33,375	01:03:34,143	| IOT156 |	Compatible
EDL	01:03:34,143	01:03:37,215	| IOT156 |	But we believe you have to sell a single way of living
EDL	01:03:37,727	01:03:38,751	| IOT156 |	A single brand
EDL	01:03:38,751	01:03:39,263	| IOT156 |	Partnership
EDL	01:03:39,775	01:03:40,799	| IOT156 |	And one that's
EDL	01:03:40,799	01:03:42,335	| IOT156 |	Able to kind of stand
EDL	01:03:42,335	01:03:43,359	| IOT156 |	Service all the way
EDL	01:03:43,359	01:03:44,127	| IOT156 |	Pair device
EDL	01:03:44,127	01:03:47,199	| IOT156 |	Awesome alright David thank you so much for coming on the show today
EDL	01:03:47,967	01:03:51,807	| IOT156 |	That's it for this week thanks so much for listening
