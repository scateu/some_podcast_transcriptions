EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:40,192	| episode6 |	Speaking of Apple
EDL	00:00:40,192	00:00:41,216	| episode6 |	Kevin got a
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:44,544	| episode6 |	Present in the mail today he's waving it around like you guys can
EDL	00:00:44,544	00:00:45,312	| episode6 |	See it
EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:47,104	| episode6 |	Kevin this is a podcast
EDL	00:00:47,616	00:00:48,896	| episode6 |	I know I know
EDL	00:00:48,896	00:00:51,712	| episode6 |	You can see it though and isn't this pretty its beak
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:53,248	| episode6 |	38 mm
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:54,272	| episode6 |	Apple watch
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:57,600	| episode6 |	In space gray aluminum with black sports band
EDL	00:00:57,600	00:00:58,880	| episode6 |	Yeah I've only had it for an hour
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:01,952	| episode6 |	I'm already noticed a couple things though
EDL	00:01:02,464	00:01:06,304	| episode6 |	I know I've talked about the watch from going to the launch events
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:09,888	| episode6 |	And I think I said oh yeah work really fine really quick everything else
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:13,984	| episode6 |	It's not quite as quick in real life those can demo Zara
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:19,872	| episode6 |	Contra reason I think I'm not saying it's like super sluggish but it's noticeably slower at certain things so
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:22,176	| episode6 |	I am shocked
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:23,968	| episode6 |	I mean shocked shocked
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:25,760	| episode6 |	Do they have
EDL	00:01:25,760	00:01:27,040	| episode6 |	May have manipulated
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:28,320	| episode6 |	It's demos
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:33,440	| episode6 |	Well I mean they're not the only company to do so by any means
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:35,232	| episode6 |	And yeah I mean
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:38,048	| episode6 |	It's again it's not slow but it's slower
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:44,960	| episode6 |	It's also interesting the few apps that I put on here literally white just before the show started put the dark sky app with
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:46,240	| episode6 |	The absolute love cuz it's like
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:49,056	| episode6 |	Pinpoints of a minute when you're in a precipitation of some kind
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:50,848	| episode6 |	I was using the app
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,640	| episode6 |	And you know
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:54,944	| episode6 |	Going to the screens and there's a
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:57,504	| episode6 |	I'll add you use swiping if they wait a second
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:59,808	| episode6 |	Because it's got to get its data from your phone
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,600	| episode6 |	So there's a
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,624	| episode6 |	I'm interesting
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,904	| episode6 |	Aspects to it here
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:05,696	| episode6 |	Very interesting aspects Twitter
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:12,096	| episode6 |	And then decide to Stacey again before the shell sure there's everybody there's a lot going on here from user interface
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,120	| episode6 |	Standpoint
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:13,888	| episode6 |	BC was it
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:20,800	| episode6 |	I wonder to shows ago you had somebody on there talking about the user interface challenges
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:21,824	| episode6 |	Mark Rolston who is
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:25,152	| episode6 |	The chief creative officer of argodesign
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:27,712	| episode6 |	And this man knows you I
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,224	| episode6 |	So he was
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:29,504	| episode6 |	He was saying that
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:30,528	| episode6 |	He felt it
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:35,136	| episode6 |	One that there was a lot to learn but to he felt it
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:37,952	| episode6 |	The Apple watch spends a lot of time
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:39,232	| episode6 |	Conserving battery in that
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:40,256	| episode6 |	Affected
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,792	| episode6 |	It affects the user
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:42,560	| episode6 |	Experience
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,840	| episode6 |	To the user's detriment
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:50,496	| episode6 |	And I think I understand where he was going because as I get notifications in from my connected iPhone
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:55,872	| episode6 |	You know if you don't take action on them right away they kind of Disappearing like one or two seconds and
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,920	| episode6 |	NyQuil where to go how do I get it back
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:02,272	| episode6 |	You just turn off the screen because you want to save battery life I can get that but
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:07,392	| episode6 |	You know which of these two buttons do I press turn tablet or touch the screen do I swipe
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:10,720	| episode6 |	Little learning curve involving not I'm trying not trying to
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,512	| episode6 |	Dismiss this as a
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:15,584	| episode6 |	Part that's too complex or difficult to use time will tell
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,608	| episode6 |	But it's not
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:19,424	| episode6 |	Clearly not to me a product that you're going to take out of the box
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:22,240	| episode6 |	And in an hour or two or four even
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:26,592	| episode6 |	Really have a good understanding of how to navigate around through all the glances to notifications
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,616	| episode6 |	The apps
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,384	| episode6 |	The
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:34,528	| episode6 |	Friends bit where you have your favorite people showing so you can quickly send them a text or a call
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:40,416	| episode6 |	So there's there's a lot going on at the store the best way to say it
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,184	| episode6 |	Not that
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:44,512	| episode6 |	Not trying to throw this out here to get on the Apple train
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,280	| episode6 |	Are the watch train
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:48,096	| episode6 |	Even my Pebble I still
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:51,168	| episode6 |	Mess up and hit the wrong button to go forwards or backwards
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:52,960	| episode6 |	It's
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:56,032	| episode6 |	Navigate on a small screen when you have limited options
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:57,824	| episode6 |	Buttons that you're not used
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:04,224	| episode6 |	It and that's it right there right you know we were trying to cram a lot of interaction into a small device
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,504	| episode6 |	And there's
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,528	| episode6 |	Multiple
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,808	| episode6 |	Touchpoints
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:11,136	| episode6 |	No pun intended there's you know that the touchscreen itself that you can
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:12,672	| episode6 |	You can tap you can also
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:15,744	| episode6 |	Press down even harder for the force press to do something else
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:19,839	| episode6 |	You got the digital Crown to spin around and also functions as a button
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:21,119	| episode6 |	You got another button
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:24,703	| episode6 |	You got voice interaction so there's there's a lot going on here
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,751	| episode6 |	And again because of the battery management
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:29,567	| episode6 |	Some of these things don't even work when the screen is not active
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:33,663	| episode6 |	Right now the screen is inactive so if I were to say hey Siri
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,991	| episode6 |	Nothing happens if I lift up my wrist
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:40,575	| episode6 |	Now now it's inactive mode and hey Siri would do something
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:43,391	| episode6 |	Interesting Lee you and I just tested a phone call
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:47,999	| episode6 |	Which I was a little skeptical on how it would work but I've done two phone calls now
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:53,119	| episode6 |	The one I just did with you I initiated by saying Hey Siri call Stacy and
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,655	| episode6 |	It went right through and then
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:56,703	| episode6 |	It's a Bluetooth headset to my phone
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:05:00,799	| episode6 |	Whose symbol is quick
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:02,847	| episode6 |	Probably what a foot from your face
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:03,871	| episode6 |	And it sounded
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:08,735	| episode6 |	It sounded like you were far away but it was no worse than taking call from someone who's in their cars
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,295	| episode6 |	Right at the Atwood
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:13,343	| episode6 |	Say it's more like a speakerphone type
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,367	| episode6 |	Experience
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:17,951	| episode6 |	And if you're in a quiet environment like I was in my home office talking to my son
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:21,535	| episode6 |	As soon as the watch arrived he was on the school bus actually coming home
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:26,143	| episode6 |	You can hear me just fine I could hear him just fine because I was in my quiet office
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,679	| episode6 |	If I was out and about
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:31,263	| episode6 |	The one thing I don't really want people hear my conversation but to
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,799	| episode6 |	I probably wouldn't be able to hear so well so
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:36,895	| episode6 |	So I again only an hour with it I'm not going to say too much
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:39,967	| episode6 |	You like that yeah you got to have it or no don't buy one
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:41,759	| episode6 |	Maybe we can revisit that
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:44,831	| episode6 |	We're totally going to revisit that cuz I actually sent
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:50,719	| episode6 |	Kevin some work more homework system I sent him some
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,255	| episode6 |	Summer media work
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:54,815	| episode6 |	I sent him some Hue bulbs
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:57,375	| episode6 |	So hopefully he'll install those and he can play with
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,167	| episode6 |	CSM connect a device
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,447	| episode6 |	With his watching
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:00,959	| episode6 |	Look at him
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:02,751	| episode6 |	Is test out
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:04,543	| episode6 |	What it feels like
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:06,335	| episode6 |	Talk to a wife
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,151	| episode6 |	Play with that
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:13,247	| episode6 |	Yeah absolutely I mean you're giving me summer school homework already but
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,783	| episode6 |	In my defense I time
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:16,575	| episode6 |	Literally I've been taking my
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:20,927	| episode6 |	Comp sci class at night school so that's over this week so I have no more excuses
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:24,255	| episode6 |	I will get the Hue installed at the bulbs I will get things down installed
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:26,303	| episode6 |	And I will play with the watch as these things all connect
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:31,167	| episode6 |	Yes because the thread is what I'm going to fire you from the podcast heaven
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,959	| episode6 |	I will do it
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:34,495	| episode6 |	So
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:35,775	| episode6 |	Other big news
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:38,591	| episode6 |	In the kind of smart home front
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:39,359	| episode6 |	When is
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,639	| episode6 |	Comcast
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:44,223	| episode6 |	Comcast which most people probably think of as
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:45,247	| episode6 |	The cable company
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,575	| episode6 |	That did not get a chance to buy Time Warner and make
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:50,623	| episode6 |	More more Americans lives possibly
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,927	| episode6 |	Miserable
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:55,487	| episode6 |	We'll just go with it everybody hates the cable company
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:58,047	| episode6 |	I'm not going to sugarcoat it I'm sorry Comcast
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:58,815	| episode6 |	But
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,583	| episode6 |	They have
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,911	| episode6 |	A connected home and home automation product called Xfinity home
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,191	| episode6 |	Earnings call this week
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,983	| episode6 |	They said that they have
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:11,103	| episode6 |	Play 500 thousand subscribers which is a really good number that is a lot of people
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,127	| episode6 |	That's a good start
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:14,687	| episode6 |	Ya adtpulse probably has a bit more
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:16,991	| episode6 |	And they haven't actually released numbers but
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:17,759	| episode6 |	I'm pretty confident
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,039	| episode6 |	Armoire
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:21,855	| episode6 |	I feel like alarm.com probably has about a million
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,623	| episode6 |	Is what they said
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:23,647	| episode6 |	So
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,439	| episode6 |	Good start for them
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:26,975	| episode6 |	And today
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:27,999	| episode6 |	Brian Roberts

EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,103	| episode6 |	Xfinity home system
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:49,919	| episode6 |	And I think this is brilliant for Comcast
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,199	| episode6 |	And also for these startups
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:54,015	| episode6 |	So Jason Johnson the CEO of August
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,063	| episode6 |	Told me that this was
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,879	| episode6 |	A no-brainer for his company because
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,671	| episode6 |	Comcast has
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:01,695	| episode6 |	Massive
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,207	| episode6 |	Marketing muscle
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:03,743	| episode6 |	Comcast is going to
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,791	| episode6 |	Mark at the heck out of all these
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,303	| episode6 |	Startups
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:08,863	| episode6 |	Through actually I think it's a little over
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:10,655	| episode6 |	21 million subscribers
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,423	| episode6 |	Across the US
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:13,727	| episode6 |	And they pass a lot more homes
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:14,751	| episode6 |	So
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:17,567	| episode6 |	They send out mailers all the time and can you imagine
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,359	| episode6 |	Imagine getting your
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:22,431	| episode6 |	You're cool connected device it features one of those that's awesome
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:29,599	| episode6 |	There's a lot of reach are formed for these startups in terms of Comcast marketing as you said subscriber base and saw
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,367	| episode6 |	Salon
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:33,951	| episode6 |	And when I like on the flip side is Comcast isn't just
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:39,071	| episode6 |	Saying we got home automation service that we can offer you and here's a switch and here's a door lock
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:43,679	| episode6 |	There's a wide range of products that are which I really like such a smart smart play
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:48,031	| episode6 |	Exactly and later this year Comcast is going to open up a nest
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,567	| episode6 |	BK a software developer
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,335	| episode6 |	Make it for
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,639	| episode6 |	Other companies who want to
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,919	| episode6 |	Get in on the Comcast
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,431	| episode6 |	Beecosystem
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:57,503	| episode6 |	And this is this is nothing but good for Comcast
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,039	| episode6 |	Cuz they've had kind of a lot of these
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:09:59,551	| episode6 |	Solder device
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,367	| episode6 |	But it's been very closed as a Neko
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,159	| episode6 |	And I get it
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:04,671	| episode6 |	I mean
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:07,231	| episode6 |	They've got to support all these customers
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:07,743	| episode6 |	Is who
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,791	| episode6 |	These aren't DIY
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:12,095	| episode6 |	Customer sees our customers are calling up Comcast
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:16,447	| episode6 |	You're calling of your cable provider and saying I really want the smart home stuff
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:19,263	| episode6 |	You're not the kind of customer that's going to be like
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:22,079	| episode6 |	Like me who's going to spend hours
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,359	| episode6 |	Yeah playing in tweaking West
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,919	| episode6 |	Another
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:28,991	| episode6 |	DIY person I'm typically not a fan of
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,271	| episode6 |	These
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:36,159	| episode6 |	Companies that will provide monitoring services and such for a fee when I know I can do this myself and
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:39,743	| episode6 |	But you know why I realize that you and I were definitely the minority here
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:41,791	| episode6 |	The way for this Market to grow
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:45,119	| episode6 |	Is through this type of approach so I think it's
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:45,887	| episode6 |	Good for
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,447	| episode6 |	Both sides you know the DIY people
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:51,007	| episode6 |	Because it will eventually bring more products to the market
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:53,567	| episode6 |	And then for the people who don't want to go with the complications and stuff
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:58,431	| episode6 |	It brings you know a simple way for them to have their their services monitor
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:02,015	| episode6 |	Comcast Comcast is providing space a service then
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,831	| episode6 |	They are so what they do is
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:05,855	| episode6 |	Typical canoe
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:08,159	| episode6 |	Service business model
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:11,231	| episode6 |	Comcast send out installers now right now
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:13,023	| episode6 |	They will not install
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:19,679	| episode6 |	Between the hours of 2 and 5 or I'm sorry I had to go there
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,727	| episode6 |	No okay
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:23,775	| episode6 |	So they they have installers
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:24,543	| episode6 |	To do there
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,567	| episode6 |	The current lineup
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:27,359	| episode6 |	They don't install the new products
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:31,455	| episode6 |	Yet the plan is eventually they will which is another great thing
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,503	| episode6 |	Because
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:35,551	| episode6 |	Some people find installing an asteroid
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:40,159	| episode6 |	Like my guess is they'll subcontract a lot of that out and it's
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:44,511	| episode6 |	Here's an interesting tidbit I actually was almost an installer
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:47,327	| episode6 |	It consultant type installer for Comcast

EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:57,567	| episode6 |	Do quite well for yourself back in the day it was something like $100 for an install
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:59,359	| episode6 |	And this goes back to the 90s
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,663	| episode6 |	Wow
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:06,271	| episode6 |	Wasn't that like there's a company was actually here in town motive communication
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,039	| episode6 |	They lived in Austin
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,831	| episode6 |	They actually like

EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,615	| episode6 |	It depends
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:35,711	| episode6 |	It always depends and there's fine print and there's fees
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,759	| episode6 |	The basic is
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:40,831	| episode6 |	If you just want to do like the DIY stuff there's like a package

EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:53,119	| episode6 |	And with a 2-year contract
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:53,631	| episode6 |	They do all the

EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:57,727	| episode6 |	And then there's
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,775	| episode6 |	A monitor there's two levels of monitor
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,615	| episode6 |	The cheaper version cost $40 a month
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:05,663	| episode6 |	That has

EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:23,071	| episode6 |	And both of those are monitored 24 so
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:25,119	| episode6 |	And they have like a different level of
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,911	| episode6 |	Insurance and assurance
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,423	| episode6 |	Associated
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,727	| episode6 |	And those are
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:30,751	| episode6 |	Professionally installed
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:35,359	| episode6 |	There is a DIY installation option on the cheaper version
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,639	| episode6 |	If you want
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:38,687	| episode6 |	Or you can have the Comcast people
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,711	| episode6 |	Come out and install it nothing
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:46,111	| episode6 |	Terrible not terrible. I mean
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:50,463	| episode6 |	It just depends on how you view your time and then you could buy additional sensor
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,487	| episode6 |	And stuff like that
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,791	| episode6 |	And I don't know how their pricing
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:54,815	| episode6 |	Works on that stuff
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:14:00,447	| episode6 |	Well now I know what the pinging iPhone bit on the Apple watch does sorry about that
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:06,847	| episode6 |	We're keeping that in here Kevin now it's now you know what that sound is alright so so that's the Comcast news
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:07,871	| episode6 |	Is it a big deal
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,663	| episode6 |	And I think it's at those also
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:13,503	| episode6 |	The home automation markets going mainstream
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:18,367	| episode6 |	So we're getting there tell your friends they should be totally listening to the show
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,159	| episode6 |	They could be even smarter
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,975	| episode6 |	And next in the big news
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:23,999	| episode6 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:26,815	| episode6 |	Everybody's favorite Gadget or maybe it's just fine
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,119	| episode6 |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:34,495	| episode6 |	I think it's just yours and now I'm kicking myself that I didn't get in on it for $99
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:40,895	| episode6 |	If you can believe this I've actually just reapplied for an invite to buy the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:44,223	| episode6 |	And I'm going to pay 149 for it because of my
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:45,503	| episode6 |	Stupidity I guess
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:48,575	| episode6 |	But here's what got me interested in it
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:49,599	| episode6 |	All of a sudden
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:55,999	| episode6 |	I saw on the if this then that log over the weekend they have introduced the Amazon Alexa Channel
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:15:00,607	| episode6 |	It's funny that they're calling it the Amazon Alexa Channel when it's really Amazon Echo but I
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,887	| episode6 |	I guess I get it
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:05,471	| episode6 |	So basically you can now connect your Echo
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:09,567	| episode6 |	Two up to it was 116 and 117 channels
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:13,919	| episode6 |	So you can set up trigger events with if this then that and have things happen when you talk to Alexa
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:20,063	| episode6 |	But there's a bit of a caveat as Stacey explain to me right before the show
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,623	| episode6 |	So it's a bit Limited
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,135	| episode6 |	And
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:26,207	| episode6 |	You basically when you create an if this then that channel
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,559	| episode6 |	You get what's called triggers and the triggers are the way that you
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:34,399	| episode6 |	Create your recipe they're the things that they're the
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:37,215	| episode6 |	Third event is this
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:38,495	| episode6 |	Or the bad part
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,263	| episode6 |	So
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:41,055	| episode6 |	For Alexa that if this
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,591	| episode6 |	Is all shopping list release
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:44,127	| episode6 |	So Alexa has
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:44,895	| episode6 |	Two features
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,687	| episode6 |	That you can do that are kind of
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:49,247	| episode6 |	And basically you can
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:52,319	| episode6 |	Be a voice add things to a shopping list so
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,599	| episode6 |	I walk around like
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,367	| episode6 |	Oh
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:56,927	| episode6 |	Alexa add wrapping paper to my shopping list
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:16:01,279	| episode6 |	Or Alexa add make a doctor's appointment for my daughter
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:02,303	| episode6 |	To my to do list
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:05,631	| episode6 |	Those are actually the only triggers right now
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:08,703	| episode6 |	That the assistant that channel allows
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:12,543	| episode6 |	So anything you want to do with Alexa
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:14,335	| episode6 |	You have to do it through those which
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:17,407	| episode6 |	Has created some crazy hacks
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:17,919	| episode6 |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:22,527	| episode6 |	So they are really useful ones actually around the to-do list like
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:29,951	| episode6 |	Beforehand your to-do list in your shopping list actually only appeared in Amazon's app which was a stoop
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:30,975	| episode6 |	The place for them because
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,535	| episode6 |	I don't know about you but I don't create a grocery list
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:39,935	| episode6 |	ICarly would like you to trust me
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:43,775	| episode6 |	But you know my grocery list is actually it's actually a piece of paper but let's pretend I do it in
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:46,079	| episode6 |	Now I can actually just send
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:49,151	| episode6 |	All of that and mailed it with my grocery list on Evernote
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:49,663	| episode6 |	Which is cool
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:54,015	| episode6 |	It is so that that could be happening all the time in the background and that's it
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:58,111	| episode6 |	That is cool but then there's the smarthome aspecting
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:02,719	| episode6 |	What you did Stacey actually share their screen with me before the show
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:07,583	| episode6 |	He showed me how to create a recipe to control her nest with the Alexa
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,863	| episode6 |	So explain that one
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:13,215	| episode6 |	Sure so if I wanted to create a recipe to make my nest
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:14,751	| episode6 |	It's a little bit
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:17,823	| episode6 |	It's super hacking no no sane person would actually
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:19,615	| episode6 |	I would have to
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:21,151	| episode6 |	Decide that my to do list
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,943	| episode6 |	Would be mostly useful
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:25,503	| episode6 |	Most useful as controlling my dad
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,527	| episode6 |	And I would say
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:27,807	| episode6 |	If I ask
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,343	| episode6 |	Alexa
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,623	| episode6 |	What's on my to-do list
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,695	| episode6 |	It's going to set my temperature
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,207	| episode6 |	For my nest
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:35,487	| episode6 |	And so
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,791	| episode6 |	Whenever I'd say Alexa
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:38,815	| episode6 |	What's on my to-do list
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:41,119	| episode6 |	My recipe would automatically
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:41,887	| episode6 |	Play turn my nest
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,423	| episode6 |	275 degree
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:49,055	| episode6 |	Or whatever you can figure it in the recipe but that's the key you can only configure to one temperature
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:49,823	| episode6 |	Right
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:51,871	| episode6 |	Self super super happy here
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:53,151	| episode6 |	Is super hacky
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:54,687	| episode6 |	It's super Limited
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:57,503	| episode6 |	And it's the same thing for any other smart home device
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:01,855	| episode6 |	And because there's only probably there's about nine triggers
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:05,183	| episode6 |	Because they're all equally hockey
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:08,255	| episode6 |	You have to remember like if I wanted it to be like setting at
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:09,535	| episode6 |	275 degrees
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:12,095	| episode6 |	If I want to do smart things to turn off a series of Lights
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,631	| episode6 |	I have to remember that
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,423	| episode6 |	If I'm asking
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:16,447	| episode6 |	What's on my to-do list
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:21,311	| episode6 |	Control my nest if I'm saying add to my to do list that controls my living room lights
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:25,407	| episode6 |	It's not logical here not not logical at all but
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:26,943	| episode6 |	Hiatus start
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,711	| episode6 |	I give
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:29,503	| episode6 |	You know I give him some credit for
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:35,903	| episode6 |	Figuring out how to do this and we know that the SDK for sale except for the echo came out
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:38,207	| episode6 |	I want to say February early October or early March
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:43,327	| episode6 |	It's early days yet and I think once that is official and
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:44,863	| episode6 |	Make some progress
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:48,447	| episode6 |	Maybe we'll see more trigger events or just better integration
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:49,471	| episode6 |	I expect so
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:51,775	| episode6 |	Amazon's got to prove these
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:54,847	| episode6 |	They're being very careful about it I know a lot of people have
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:58,687	| episode6 |	Apps in the works right now and some of them seem really cool
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:18:59,711	| episode6 |	So
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:02,527	| episode6 |	I'm really excited so far
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:06,111	| episode6 |	So far it's great and you know I don't know if you saw this
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:09,695	| episode6 |	You probably didn't see this because you're not using an echo
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:13,279	| episode6 |	But they added the ability to talk to it and ask it about sports scores
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,047	| episode6 |	So
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:16,095	| episode6 |	My husband's walking through all the time asking
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,911	| episode6 |	Alexa how are the Cardinals doing today
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,703	| episode6 |	How are the St Louis Cardinals
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:26,335	| episode6 |	Searching out my Arizona
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:29,663	| episode6 |	Factual clarification
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:33,503	| episode6 |	I mean if I had said the real Cardinals that would have been
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:36,319	| episode6 |	So
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:38,623	| episode6 |	It's just it's getting better
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,391	| episode6 |	It's very exciting
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:46,047	| episode6 |	It is it is and they just added too and I know we talked about in the past one or two shows they've added official support for
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:48,095	| episode6 |	WeMo and some other things so
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,119	| episode6 |	It's it's
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:52,959	| episode6 |	It's starting to Intrigue me I didn't want to buy into it for the
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:54,495	| episode6 |	Potential that it had
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:57,055	| episode6 |	I want to buy a product that was
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:20:00,639	| episode6 |	More useful at the time and I already see that it's getting more useful so
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,687	| episode6 |	So is it now worth it
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:04,479	| episode6 |	A 50 extra dollars
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:08,575	| episode6 |	And with this if this and that caveat I don't know
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,343	| episode6 |	Which is
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:09,855	| episode6 |	Maybe you should
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:16,767	| episode6 |	Wait on honestly maybe I will wait at all I've done so far is asked requested an invite
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:17,535	| episode6 |	To repurchase
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:18,559	| episode6 |	Just so you know so
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:19,583	| episode6 |	And even
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:23,423	| episode6 |	If and when I get that which could be weeks away for all I know
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:28,031	| episode6 |	I know they're Backwater for months so maybe I just let it be
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,055	| episode6 |	See a lot of this
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:32,895	| episode6 |	It's too early to say for sure a lot of this can actually be done right on my
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:33,919	| episode6 |	My new watch
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:36,479	| episode6 |	I could just say hey Siri
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:41,087	| episode6 |	And there's Integrations there with a lot of these smart home type of things already so
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:41,855	| episode6 |	Maybe redundant
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,671	| episode6 |	Well speaking of your watch
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:45,951	| episode6 |	We should go there for
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:46,719	| episode6 |	Brief moment
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:49,023	| episode6 |	My sources are telling me
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:52,095	| episode6 |	That homekit maybe
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:54,399	| episode6 |	Longer in the coming than we expected
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:57,471	| episode6 |	I know I am expecting
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:21:00,799	| episode6 |	Sometime in June that we should see something
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:03,103	| episode6 |	But it's not the full on
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:05,407	| episode6 |	The full-on roll out that we're expecting
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:06,687	| episode6 |	It's much smaller
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,503	| episode6 |	So
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,271	| episode6 |	So
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:13,087	| episode6 |	You know that
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:17,696	| episode6 |	I've been at this may sound stupid but that bit that doesn't terribly surprised me and here's why
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:19,744	| episode6 |	I know how long is a platform
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:22,304	| episode6 |	However I also know that
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:24,608	| episode6 |	Apple wants to make some of its own devices
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:29,984	| episode6 |	And I think it's not just going to put the platform out there without its own devices so if they're not ready
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:34,592	| episode6 |	If Apple Hardware isn't ready I don't think you're going to see a lot of movement
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,896	| episode6 |	On third-party Hardware support just yet
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,432	| episode6 |	Well
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:41,248	| episode6 |	We had that means we got a whole lot of weight and going on
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:41,760	| episode6 |	I'm so
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:42,784	| episode6 |	Soap
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,832	| episode6 |	Get that insteon Gear Up
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:51,744	| episode6 |	Screw in. We'll see how that works for you I can guarantee you that I will be able to screw in
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:52,512	| episode6 |	Green light bulbs
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:55,328	| episode6 |	By the time we have our next show cuz the lightbulbs are on their way to my house
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,608	| episode6 |	They are there
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,376	| episode6 |	Should be there tomorrow
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,656	| episode6 |	Okay so
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:00,448	| episode6 |	I guarantee you
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:04,800	| episode6 |	I will be able to talk about light bulbs and controlling them from my Apple watch and other ways
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,568	| episode6 |	Next week
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:08,128	| episode6 |	Excellent well that's a good Segway for a scab
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:09,920	| episode6 |	Because
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:12,480	| episode6 |	Our next big news stories are lighting related
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:14,528	| episode6 |	It's right now in New York City
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:16,064	| episode6 |	Is light fare
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:16,832	| episode6 |	Which
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:18,368	| episode6 |	I wish I were there
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:19,392	| episode6 |	I really do
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,952	| episode6 |	Yes because
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:24,256	| episode6 |	Everybody who has a light bulb

EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:50,880	| episode6 |	They have an LED light bulb
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:51,392	| episode6 |	That
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,184	| episode6 |	It cost between
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:54,208	| episode6 |	100 +
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:55,488	| episode6 |	130 bucks
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,512	| episode6 |	Purple
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,536	| episode6 |	So expensive
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:59,840	| episode6 |	Mostly for high-end residential in
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:00,864	| episode6 |	Commercial markets
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:02,400	| episode6 |	You can find it in
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,424	| episode6 |	Auto dealers
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:04,960	| episode6 |	MGM hotels
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:08,544	| episode6 |	The Tiffany store in New York the Art Institute of Chicago
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:10,592	| episode6 |	The cool thing about these bulbs
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:11,360	| episode6 |	What is
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,640	| episode6 |	The LED light
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,664	| episode6 |	Inside
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:15,456	| episode6 |	The semiconductor part the LED
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:19,552	| episode6 |	It not only emits light like a light emitting diode
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,576	| episode6 |	It also
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:24,416	| episode6 |	Receive some of the light some of the receptors actually turn into sensors
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:27,232	| episode6 |	So it's self Tunes itself itself calibrated
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,000	| episode6 |	To self
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,280	| episode6 |	Which is kind of cool
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:34,400	| episode6 |	So that is pretty cool actually can be tuned to like different Pantone colors
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:37,472	| episode6 |	It checks itself throughout the day
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:39,008	| episode6 |	Basically
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:43,104	| episode6 |	But it's still running along the right software program so it's incredibly consistent
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:44,384	| episode6 |	And
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,432	| episode6 |	Just kind of super fancy
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:48,736	| episode6 |	Apparently all these other companies that is like tested it
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:49,760	| episode6 |	Love it
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:51,552	| episode6 |	I have
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:53,856	| episode6 |	I've seen it a demo over a
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:57,440	| episode6 |	A computer which is a terrible way to evaluate like
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:24:00,000	| episode6 |	Play Kai yes over my webcam that lights
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:00,512	| episode6 |	Looks amazing
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:02,304	| episode6 |	Indiana
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:10,752	| episode6 |	I'm in tree go by there the self calibration in the end more smarts as opposed to just a radio for communications that's
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:14,080	| episode6 |	Essentially a wireless switch right
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:17,152	| episode6 |	Putting in more smarts in these things makes them far more interesting to me
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:22,272	| episode6 |	So we'll see I'm actually going to pop by and check them out when they're not at like Fair
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:23,296	| episode6 |	Because they are in my home
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:24,064	| episode6 |	Downtown
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,344	| episode6 |	And check out the quality of the light
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:26,624	| episode6 |	And
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:29,952	| episode6 |	I will not be able to put them in my house they guesstimate that it
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:32,000	| episode6 |	It's going to be about a thousand bucks per room
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:32,768	| episode6 |	So
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:34,816	| episode6 |	Yeah if you're feeling fancy though
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:36,352	| episode6 |	And you want to invest in these
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:39,168	| episode6 |	Papa man let me know what you think
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:39,680	| episode6 |	Because
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:40,960	| episode6 |	I'm intrigued
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:44,544	| episode6 |	They have some amazing software patterns obviously everybody's got them
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:46,592	| episode6 |	Which brings me to another announcement
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:48,128	| episode6 |	GE
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:52,736	| episode6 |	Also that G's lighting division they announced a partnership yesterday
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:54,784	| episode6 |	Monday with Apple
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:59,136	| episode6 |	Did they are going to bring out a new consumer light bulb that will work with homekit
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:02,720	| episode6 |	It will be later this year it is a tunable white light
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:03,744	| episode6 |	Which means
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:06,304	| episode6 |	Runs up and down the White
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,328	| episode6 |	Color spectrum
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:09,888	| episode6 |	I love that because I've often bought
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:13,984	| episode6 |	Bob's without paying attention to the light or the white color and
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,264	| episode6 |	I've gotten
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:17,824	| episode6 |	They're just you know either soft white when I want a natural
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:18,592	| episode6 |	Sunlight
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:20,128	| episode6 |	Eyeballs or vice versa
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:22,432	| episode6 |	Yeah that's very good
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:23,456	| episode6 |	So
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:24,992	| episode6 |	I don't know
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:29,344	| episode6 |	I feel like if you're going to go tunable you might as well go all in on full color but
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:33,696	| episode6 |	It depends on how much they
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:35,232	| episode6 |	I mean yeah
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:37,024	| episode6 |	Obviously it's all about
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:38,304	| episode6 |	Standard consumer
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:41,376	| episode6 |	I don't get out much like the sunlight
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:46,240	| episode6 |	Type bulbs will the GE they're playing at their circadian rhythm there is natural sunlight thing
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:50,848	| episode6 |	But you know the way they were playing it up though I was kind of like does no one else
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:55,200	| episode6 |	There's no one else did she realize it every other light bulb has a circadian rhythm pattern
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:57,248	| episode6 |	Do they think this is new
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:59,040	| episode6 |	It's very
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:05,952	| episode6 |	It felt very much like she was very excited about stuff that people were excited about like a year-and-a-half ago
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:06,464	| episode6 |	I don't know
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:07,744	| episode6 |	Well
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:12,608	| episode6 |	I mean they have to sell their product I got to build the hype just like everybody else I don't really have a problem with that
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:14,400	| episode6 |	You're so you're so generous
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:18,240	| episode6 |	They also did a deal with Qualcomm
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:19,264	| episode6 |	Jeeves like
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:21,824	| episode6 |	All over this are like lightning we're on it
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:24,128	| episode6 |	Qualcomm
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:28,224	| episode6 |	To put something that is not a beacon but sounds just like a beacon in retail
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:30,016	| episode6 |	It's called
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:31,552	| episode6 |	Visible light communication
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:32,064	| episode6 |	VLC
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,600	| episode6 |	Basically
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:36,928	| episode6 |	It uses the camera in your smartphone
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:41,024	| episode6 |	In encodes in the light to the LEDs omitting information that
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,304	| episode6 |	Can be read by an app that
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:43,840	| episode6 |	It's running on a consumer's smartphone
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,120	| episode6 |	And this
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:46,656	| episode6 |	This app uses
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:48,192	| episode6 |	That
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:50,496	| episode6 |	To basically triangulate your position in the
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:51,008	| episode6 |	Store
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:52,544	| episode6 |	Based on the lights
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:53,824	| episode6 |	And that
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:55,872	| episode6 |	Tells the app where you
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:56,640	| episode6 |	You are
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:57,152	| episode6 |	So
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:59,456	| episode6 |	It's not a beacon but it behaves like a bee
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:01,504	| episode6 |	Beacon in GE thinks this is amazing
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:07,648	| episode6 |	I think it's a little weird because I don't know if I'm going to be walking through the store with my phone out
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:13,536	| episode6 |	The technologist behind it said that you don't they're still going to be using radios to pinpoint you
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:15,328	| episode6 |	In the store and then
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,352	| episode6 |	Ideas
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:22,752	| episode6 |	If you're going to pull out your phone to look up for more information that's when it would pop up and get it to you which is the perfect
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:23,776	| episode6 |	What time to do so make sense
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:25,824	| episode6 |	But I'm still kind of like
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:32,480	| episode6 |	I know so many things are vying for attention now and sometimes it don't want that you just want to
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:34,528	| episode6 |	Just want to go walk around the store and
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:36,576	| episode6 |	I don't want things pinging me off all the time
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:43,488	| episode6 |	Yeah it is like this way it doesn't ping you because it won't know where you are so I was like oh that's nice he's like so if you're standing there
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,256	| episode6 |	Front of the toothbrush
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:48,352	| episode6 |	Are the toothpaste aisle inside of your like there are 30 options here which one do I choose
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:51,168	| episode6 |	Maybe you pull out your phone to research it and suddenly
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:51,936	| episode6 |	It says
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:52,960	| episode6 |	Oh look
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:57,312	| episode6 |	I see you're standing in front of the toothpaste do you want some more information and then you can be like
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,848	| episode6 |	Why yes vote I do
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:27:59,616	| episode6 |	I don't know
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:02,944	| episode6 |	I mean in Subway's I'm like oh that could make sense I just
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:04,224	| episode6 |	I don't know
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:08,320	| episode6 |	So that's that's the kind of that's how GE plans to take on lighting and make it awesome
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:10,368	| episode6 |	And let's see
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:10,880	| episode6 |	I think
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,416	| episode6 |	That's a lot of stuff
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:14,208	| episode6 |	Do we have any other stuff
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:18,560	| episode6 |	There's some there's a little bit about we know they re up there if this then that channel
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:25,984	| episode6 |	The connected Cree LED bulbs that are so awesome and cheap those now actually work with the WeMo system
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:27,264	| episode6 |	So that brings
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:30,080	| episode6 |	That means your Cree light bulbs will work with
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:31,872	| episode6 |	Philips Hue system
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,152	| episode6 |	And with the WeMo system
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:35,968	| episode6 |	Yeah it's a nice way to get those
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:37,504	| episode6 |	Kinkos light bulbs are like
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:38,784	| episode6 |	15 bucks
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:41,856	| episode6 |	So they're cheap connected
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:42,368	| episode6 |	And
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:43,904	| episode6 |	They work with law
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:45,184	| episode6 |	Lots of different system so
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:47,232	| episode6 |	Don't get some cuz yeah
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:48,768	| episode6 |	Why not
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:54,656	| episode6 |	Alrighty well this week we don't have a guest on the show's given there so much news and I'm trying to wrap up
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:56,192	| episode6 |	Figure out
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:59,008	| episode6 |	Some editing things in getting the show on iTunes
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:01,568	| episode6 |	So
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:04,640	| episode6 |	Stay tuned for all of that and
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:05,920	| episode6 |	More
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:10,272	| episode6 |	And with that we'll call it a wrap and we will see you next time on the iot podcast
