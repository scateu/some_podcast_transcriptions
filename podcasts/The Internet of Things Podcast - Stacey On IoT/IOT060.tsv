EDL	00:00:48,640	00:00:49,152	| IOT060 |	Google
EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:50,176	| IOT060 |	Home
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:51,456	| IOT060 |	Yeah
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:59,392	| IOT060 |	No I've no I want to hear what you have to say cuz I was excited to see it and I know that you were two
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:01,184	| IOT060 |	Super excited
EDL	00:01:01,952	00:01:03,488	| IOT060 |	So here's my
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:04,000	| IOT060 |	Quick summary
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:05,280	| IOT060 |	Last week
EDL	00:01:05,280	00:01:07,072	| IOT060 |	If you were not paying attention
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:09,376	| IOT060 |	Google announced
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:11,424	| IOT060 |	Competitors Amazon Echo competitor
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:14,240	| IOT060 |	Is it called Google home
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:18,592	| IOT060 |	It is called Google home and if you go to home. Google.com you can sign up and get
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:22,176	| IOT060 |	No updates on it yes which I'm sure you probably did I pray
EDL	00:01:23,456	00:01:23,968	| IOT060 |	You make it updates
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:26,528	| IOT060 |	But so
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:27,808	| IOT060 |	What this is is
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:29,856	| IOT060 |	It is a speaker
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:33,440	| IOT060 |	Link to Google Assistant
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:34,976	| IOT060 |	Which is also new
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:36,000	| IOT060 |	Which is also new
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:37,280	| IOT060 |	And
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:38,048	| IOT060 |	Unlike
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:38,816	| IOT060 |	The echo
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:40,864	| IOT060 |	It doesn't have a name that I
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:43,168	| IOT060 |	I'm aware of yet so there's no lady that you
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:44,960	| IOT060 |	To call out to and say
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:51,360	| IOT060 |	I think in the demo they said Hey Google but there is a video that they show that we can always go back or linked to in a shirt
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,896	| IOT060 |	People can see because
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:55,456	| IOT060 |	They show a video of a family using this device so
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:57,760	| IOT060 |	How they use it I presume would be how you would use it
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,552	| IOT060 |	Which is so exciting
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:01,856	| IOT060 |	So there are two features that are really
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,880	| IOT060 |	Freaking awesome
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,160	| IOT060 |	1
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:04,928	| IOT060 |	Multicast
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:09,024	| IOT060 |	So if you have a bunch of these you can actually linked to them just like your Sonos
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:11,072	| IOT060 |	Play the same thing in every room
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:12,352	| IOT060 |	Twerk
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,120	| IOT060 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:15,424	| IOT060 |	Yes you can you can tell
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:18,752	| IOT060 |	You can say hey Google and I think they're going to use hey Google I'll tell you why
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:20,032	| IOT060 |	Cuz a lot of phones
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:21,824	| IOT060 |	Ucok
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:23,616	| IOT060 |	Google and I pause on purpose
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:28,480	| IOT060 |	So I didn't stop everybody's phones some people have it set for always listening so if you were to say that
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,272	| IOT060 |	Which device you're talking to right
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:31,552	| IOT060 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:33,344	| IOT060 |	Should I point
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:35,904	| IOT060 |	I wish they went with something a little
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,208	| IOT060 |	More human benefits with Google
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:41,792	| IOT060 |	The others
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:43,584	| IOT060 |	Multicast
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:46,912	| IOT060 |	Well I just want to mention
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:52,288	| IOT060 |	Google home and they said this in the keno is built on the same technology that they that Google uses for
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,824	| IOT060 |	The Chromecast products
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:03:00,224	| IOT060 |	That is important right so the multicast for example
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:01,760	| IOT060 |	If you had multiple Google homes
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,040	| IOT060 |	You could say
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:08,672	| IOT060 |	Hey Google Play Rihanna in the living room hey Google play in all rooms
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:09,696	| IOT060 |	Play
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:15,584	| IOT060 |	Sachin Sachin a different room so yes you can multi casting control it by voice per room so it's a saunas like experience
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,352	| IOT060 |	Via voice
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:18,400	| IOT060 |	But it's also
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,168	| IOT060 |	Again because it's
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,728	| IOT060 |	Tied into the Chromecast Technologies
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:22,496	| IOT060 |	You can
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:29,408	| IOT060 |	Stream things to a connected TV from it via voice which is something I want so badly
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:32,480	| IOT060 |	On my echo and my Amazon Fire TV but I don't have right now
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,272	| IOT060 |	Yes
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:34,784	| IOT060 |	So that is key
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,368	| IOT060 |	And this this is actually a
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:39,648	| IOT060 |	A bigger differentiator in my house
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,440	| IOT060 |	Which is
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:42,720	| IOT060 |	In the video
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:45,792	| IOT060 |	They showed the home device
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,328	| IOT060 |	Beeping at the woman
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:50,144	| IOT060 |	Wandering around the room
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,704	| IOT060 |	Hey Google I'm listening
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:56,032	| IOT060 |	Talk to her it gave her a notification
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:58,848	| IOT060 |	To me this was like killer
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,616	| IOT060 |	Because
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,152	| IOT060 |	Right now my phone
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,944	| IOT060 |	I run Google Now on my phone
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:04,480	| IOT060 |	It tells me great
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:05,760	| IOT060 |	Pieces of information like
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,552	| IOT060 |	You should leave in 5 minutes
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,832	| IOT060 |	It's to make this appointment
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,904	| IOT060 |	Write contextual information get surface to you
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:12,416	| IOT060 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,000	| IOT060 |	That's because I wrote about it in
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:18,047	| IOT060 |	Before the Android Wear watches came out
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:20,607	| IOT060 |	When I said contacts this King and I want Google Now on my wrist
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:23,679	| IOT060 |	There you go so this could be Google Now
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,215	| IOT060 |	In any room that you have
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:25,983	| IOT060 |	This device
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:26,495	| IOT060 |	Which
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:27,519	| IOT060 |	Awesome sauce
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:29,567	| IOT060 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,615	| IOT060 |	I'm super excited about this now
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,663	| IOT060 |	The thing that I
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:36,223	| IOT060 |	I wrote about it actually the newsletter but I'm a surface it here too
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:37,503	| IOT060 |	Is
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,295	| IOT060 |	I'm really disappointed
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:39,807	| IOT060 |	In a couple thing
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:43,647	| IOT060 |	I'm disappointed that Sonos every time I
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:44,159	| IOT060 |	I can't talk to it
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:45,695	| IOT060 |	I just like what
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,463	| IOT060 |	I stopped using my
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:47,999	| IOT060 |	Almost completely
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,047	| IOT060 |	Leafar really subpar speakers
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:50,559	| IOT060 |	Because they're easier
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,631	| IOT060 |	Every time one of these comes out
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,655	| IOT060 |	I'm just more irritated
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,983	| IOT060 |	I don't actually
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:00,543	| IOT060 |	Want to buy a device
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:01,055	| IOT060 |	To tie into
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:04,639	| IOT060 |	Because white pictures
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,407	| IOT060 |	Because
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:07,711	| IOT060 |	I really want it to be more of a like
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:10,015	| IOT060 |	And here's where Sonos still has me it's
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,831	| IOT060 |	It's okay will provide a really good speaker
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,879	| IOT060 |	You can
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:17,183	| IOT060 |	Put whatever software you want
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:21,279	| IOT060 |	Timmy is where the world
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:21,791	| IOT060 |	Should be going
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,327	| IOT060 |	Because I
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,887	| IOT060 |	May want to Google device in one room
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:32,543	| IOT060 |	I may want an echo and another and I don't really want to replace my speakers again this is an early adopter thing
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:33,311	| IOT060 |	Right right
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,359	| IOT060 |	But this is actually going to
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,127	| IOT060 |	Cause people
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:40,479	| IOT060 |	Pain that financial aid will call it that
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:44,575	| IOT060 |	Income slow adoption because it's a lot harder to say I'm going to commit to this
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:48,159	| IOT060 |	Whole ecosystem then it is to say I am going to buy another
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:51,487	| IOT060 |	Bluetooth light speaker that has these
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:53,279	| IOT060 |	Escapeability on the back end
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:54,303	| IOT060 |	And this is abacus
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:54,815	| IOT060 |	Can product
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:57,631	| IOT060 |	Yeah because this is why I mentioned
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:01,727	| IOT060 |	I said Google assistant is also knew because the whole back end
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:03,519	| IOT060 |	Is this new Google Assistant which
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:07,615	| IOT060 |	Is I guess the next evolution of Google now so to speak
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:08,895	| IOT060 |	It was
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:11,199	| IOT060 |	Touted onstage how
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,479	| IOT060 |	Google can do
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:16,831	| IOT060 |	You know this type of contacts better than anybody because it knows more about
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,855	| IOT060 |	People in
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:20,415	| IOT060 |	You know the algorithms we have any idea aviata
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:23,231	| IOT060 |	And In fairness I I actually do agree with that be
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:27,327	| IOT060 |	Because when I look at the echo what does Amazon really know about me well
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,607	| IOT060 |	It definitely is my purchases
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:32,959	| IOT060 |	It definitely some of my consumption habits based on what music I listen to
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:35,007	| IOT060 |	Emma Cleary's I asked
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:35,775	| IOT060 |	Black
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,823	| IOT060 |	Knows where I live
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:38,591	| IOT060 |	But
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:43,967	| IOT060 |	Amazon itself doesn't have that relational database of all of my contextual information some of it like
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,527	| IOT060 |	It knows my search history but it's not
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:49,343	| IOT060 |	The results are not coming from it and they're coming from
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:53,439	| IOT060 |	Maybe you will from Alfred or you know Wikipedia or being
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,743	| IOT060 |	And whatnot what Google is saying is
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:59,839	| IOT060 |	We provide you all that information yeah we don't just get your search and
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:04,447	| IOT060 |	And your consumption areas we actually have the information we can tie it all together
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:06,239	| IOT060 |	So you getting
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:09,567	| IOT060 |	You're right Google home is a front-end to the Google Assistant
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,079	| IOT060 |	Back-end
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:16,479	| IOT060 |	Do you want to tie into that ecosystem I mean it's a personal choice and personas users I totally get it
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:19,039	| IOT060 |	You invested money you want to stick with what you have your happy with it
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:22,879	| IOT060 |	This website is a lot people don't have a Sonos and
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:25,695	| IOT060 |	Chromecast the whole idea was userland on speaker
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:29,279	| IOT060 |	I don't care what speakers you use just plugging this little dongle you know what
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:29,791	| IOT060 |	You can
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:32,607	| IOT060 |	Use that with Google home
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:35,423	| IOT060 |	And use the speakers already have so to speak so
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:41,823	| IOT060 |	I think you're right I think there's going to be a lot of people like no I'm not going into this because I have a Sonos or be there still a big mistrust
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:45,407	| IOT060 |	How Google uses data what it knows how much it knows so
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:49,247	| IOT060 |	There are people who would just say I don't use any Google probably cuz I don't want Google to know everything about me
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:52,575	| IOT060 |	I think that's true and I would also say
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,879	| IOT060 |	When comparing the two ecosystem
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,415	| IOT060 |	Honestly it might be nice to
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,439	| IOT060 |	To do both because
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:59,231	| IOT060 |	Who is banking on
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,791	| IOT060 |	The back end in the knowledge
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,583	| IOT060 |	That it has a
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,351	| IOT060 |	Right
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:08,191	| IOT060 |	What we haven't heard yet
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:10,495	| IOT060 |	The echo
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:13,567	| IOT060 |	An Amazon has built in this very open
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:16,127	| IOT060 |	So what they don't know about you
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:19,455	| IOT060 |	You can actually pull from just about anywhere
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:22,015	| IOT060 |	And just say hey I want to enable these skills
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,783	| IOT060 |	I have all
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,063	| IOT060 |	Apus access to things
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,087	| IOT060 |	If you combine the two
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:27,391	| IOT060 |	Man that would be amazing
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:35,327	| IOT060 |	Cuz you brought the skills and I agree with your and I think Amazon is in a great job I mean I have the Echo and a DOT
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:38,143	| IOT060 |	Right now and we talked about a bazillion times in the show and I love them
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,703	| IOT060 |	And you're right you can plug in if your
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:43,007	| IOT060 |	I mean you are I could write a skill
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,287	| IOT060 |	Create our own little skill
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,823	| IOT060 |	Or the echo
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,615	| IOT060 |	If there is someone out there that meets our needs
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,151	| IOT060 |	But
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,199	| IOT060 |	I think Google took a different
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:52,479	| IOT060 |	Approach in that
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:55,295	| IOT060 |	It makes it easy for developers to tap into
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:56,575	| IOT060 |	IT services
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:59,647	| IOT060 |	A little bit easier as opposed to skills on the echo
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,439	| IOT060 |	They seem like a
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:03,487	| IOT060 |	I want to say I hacked because they're not
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,791	| IOT060 |	It's just it seems more clingy to me
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,303	| IOT060 |	So
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:08,095	| IOT060 |	Yes
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:10,399	| IOT060 |	They also have and I'm sorry everybody
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,423	| IOT060 |	They have
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:13,983	| IOT060 |	Voice services
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:17,055	| IOT060 |	Yes I do yes which means
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:23,199	| IOT060 |	If you don't want something kludgy you can actually again this is a dedicated device but in this case the dedicated device doesn't have to be
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:26,015	| IOT060 |	Speaker it could just have
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,063	| IOT060 |	Access to the bank
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,367	| IOT060 |	And we haven't even
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,415	| IOT060 |	Apple
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:40,351	| IOT060 |	It apparently is working on something similar and it plans to open up the SD
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,375	| IOT060 |	Dk4 Siri
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,911	| IOT060 |	Or at least
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:45,215	| IOT060 |	We're not 100% sure
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:45,727	| IOT060 |	Because at Apple
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:49,055	| IOT060 |	Where it's going with this but it wants to give developer
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:50,591	| IOT060 |	Siri which
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,127	| IOT060 |	Yay
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,151	| IOT060 |	Yay
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:59,807	| IOT060 |	Siri came out I want to say in 2011 and I say came out meaning it came out on the iPhone 4 commercial or
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,087	| IOT060 |	Consumer use
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:03,647	| IOT060 |	Technology in the company actually existed before that
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,927	| IOT060 |	An apple purchased it
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:07,743	| IOT060 |	But the implemented into the into iOS
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:08,767	| IOT060 |	I think 2011
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:12,351	| IOT060 |	I don't really see what they've done too much on that
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:16,703	| IOT060 |	What's inside and I've said this a couple times and post and podcast
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:19,007	| IOT060 |	Kenneth Siri, got stagnant
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:22,591	| IOT060 |	And it's it's almost past time I think for
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:24,639	| IOT060 |	This to happen but it's still very good
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,175	| IOT060 |	It will make a lot of people
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,199	| IOT060 |	Happy once
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:29,503	| IOT060 |	Apps are fully integrated into Siri
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:30,783	| IOT060 |	Our with Siri I should say
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:34,111	| IOT060 |	Yeah no I mean I've I've started using
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,903	| IOT060 |	Anxiety
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:36,415	| IOT060 |	Like I
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,207	| IOT060 |	Say okay
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:38,719	| IOT060 |	And then I say
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:42,047	| IOT060 |	Google and I can do a lot with my phone
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,351	| IOT060 |	Yeah opening up other apps
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,655	| IOT060 |	Everything Zen
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:48,447	| IOT060 |	So it's kind of my husband sometimes
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:50,239	| IOT060 |	Siri
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,543	| IOT060 |	And you're right it did come out
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,055	| IOT060 |	2011
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:55,871	| IOT060 |	Faurecia
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,151	| IOT060 |	So
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,687	| IOT060 |	That's that
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:03,295	| IOT060 |	Pictures of pulling one last thing I'm
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:05,087	| IOT060 |	Siri unless you're in a Tyler Moore
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:07,903	| IOT060 |	I'm wondering what they're going to do with that and homekit
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,207	| IOT060 |	Will Siri does control homekit
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,279	| IOT060 |	You can do things with it
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:17,119	| IOT060 |	And I forget cuz I am not as good with numbers time is a
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:17,887	| IOT060 |	A fluid thing
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:20,959	| IOT060 |	With the always-on Siri that
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,727	| IOT060 |	What's in the iPhone
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:24,543	| IOT060 |	5S
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:30,687	| IOT060 |	It came out maybe a year ago for plugs in devices but now the newer devices don't need to be plugged in for it to work
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,967	| IOT060 |	Certain on plugged in
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:35,807	| IOT060 |	Having until they have that it was kind of
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,575	| IOT060 |	I thought silly
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:41,183	| IOT060 |	Of course the fact that home kid is not really fully baked yet
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:41,951	| IOT060 |	Is
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,719	| IOT060 |	You know kind of
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:43,487	| IOT060 |	Arella hurt
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,535	| IOT060 |	It makes it almost irrelevant
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:47,583	| IOT060 |	You can say
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:48,863	| IOT060 |	Whatever they
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:52,703	| IOT060 |	Wake up word for serious you know turn on the lights in living room
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,471	| IOT060 |	And it should
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:53,983	| IOT060 |	Nice
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:58,079	| IOT060 |	That's there I haven't played with it
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:59,871	| IOT060 |	Recently enough that I can tell you what the
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,663	| IOT060 |	Sure
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:03,711	| IOT060 |	Sure
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:06,015	| IOT060 |	All-in-all I mean what I really like is
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:06,527	| IOT060 |	All of these
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,831	| IOT060 |	Are advancing
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:12,159	| IOT060 |	You know that the user interface for your home weather
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:16,767	| IOT060 |	Lights or whether it's energy things or whatever it may be TVs
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:19,071	| IOT060 |	And that's really the key to me and end
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,351	| IOT060 |	I think you're going to see a lot of
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:22,911	| IOT060 |	I said more competition in the space now
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:26,495	| IOT060 |	It seems like it's gaining traction the market has been proven
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:28,543	| IOT060 |	Mainly I think by the echo
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,311	| IOT060 |	Which
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:32,895	| IOT060 |	The CEO of Google Sundar pichai actually give a shout out on stage saying
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,431	| IOT060 |	No thanks Amazon for
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:35,967	| IOT060 |	You're showing
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,991	| IOT060 |	The world that
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,015	| IOT060 |	This can be done
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,807	| IOT060 |	And people are enjoying it
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,087	| IOT060 |	So
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,903	| IOT060 |	You know it doesn't matter to me which platform you use I think
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:46,975	| IOT060 |	All of them are going to get them immensely better over the next
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:48,767	| IOT060 |	6 to 18 months as a result of all this
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:51,071	| IOT060 |	This is why you don't want to hardware
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,655	| IOT060 |	Well
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:04,383	| IOT060 |	Yeah you need you need some kind of Hardware you need microphones and need speakers and you need something to capture and
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:06,943	| IOT060 |	Something to send to the capture text to the
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:10,527	| IOT060 |	Web services that translate the natural language processing and
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:13,599	| IOT060 |	Sorry I hear you but I don't know how else you
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,623	| IOT060 |	Could do it yet
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,135	| IOT060 |	I like
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:22,303	| IOT060 |	You mentioned the web services that Amazon offers notice I didn't mention her name you could build that into a TV
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,071	| IOT060 |	For Allah
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,095	| IOT060 |	Sprint live chat
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:29,215	| IOT060 |	Speaker a small chip in the end of microphone so I like the way they're going in a sense because it's
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:31,775	| IOT060 |	You can put it into any hardware supposed to
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:33,055	| IOT060 |	Find specific Hardware
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,615	| IOT060 |	Yes but you do have to build the ontology
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,919	| IOT060 |	It is says
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:40,479	| IOT060 |	Vocabulary of words that will turn your you know
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,807	| IOT060 |	Cuz I really want to tell my Roomba to
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:44,831	| IOT060 |	Uflymike
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:47,391	| IOT060 |	It's very
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,719	| IOT060 |	Actually work
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:54,047	| IOT060 |	The Voice Services her voice service
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:58,655	| IOT060 |	Supports the words fly my pretties and recognizes that that will
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,167	| IOT060 |	Actually
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:04,799	| IOT060 |	Which still though I mean we're making progress here as opposed to
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:07,871	| IOT060 |	When Siri first came out that was really the first one
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:08,895	| IOT060 |	Lucy and natsu
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:11,967	| IOT060 |	That's true and that's where the openness I think that's where
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:15,551	| IOT060 |	You know the echo building up the developer ecosystem matter I mean
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:18,623	| IOT060 |	Siri stagnating I think is partly because
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,695	| IOT060 |	You just couldn't
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,719	| IOT060 |	Do much with it
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:24,255	| IOT060 |	Beyond like what
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,303	| IOT060 |	Describe Apple
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:32,703	| IOT060 |	Exactly it was a very native bacon solution and it's finally now becoming what we I just hoped it would
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,215	| IOT060 |	Become
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:36,799	| IOT060 |	Openness yay for the win
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:38,335	| IOT060 |	Speaking of openness one less
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,103	| IOT060 |	Quick thought
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:44,735	| IOT060 |	The one thing we did not hear from Google while we've been here a couple things I wouldn't hear price or availability for Google home
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:47,551	| IOT060 |	I think it was later this summer or maybe later this year
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:51,135	| IOT060 |	Better this year okay yeah there's a lot of products announcing their all later
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:53,951	| IOT060 |	You can't get anything that was announced yet
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:55,999	| IOT060 |	Except for something I know we're going to talk about shortly
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,023	| IOT060 |	And
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:59,583	| IOT060 |	The one big missing piece to me
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:01,631	| IOT060 |	Where was thinking about you and I talked about this
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,399	| IOT060 |	As soon as it was announced
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,935	| IOT060 |	There was no list of
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:08,031	| IOT060 |	Partner products and such that it will work within the home
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,567	| IOT060 |	Other than of course nest
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:11,103	| IOT060 |	So we don't know
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:13,151	| IOT060 |	You know is it going to work with WeMo is it going to work
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:16,223	| IOT060 |	Wink smart home there's more things in
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,015	| IOT060 |	Intel Cannon
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,295	| IOT060 |	And then all the others
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,575	| IOT060 |	So there's a lot of
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,599	| IOT060 |	Open questions on
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,391	| IOT060 |	Who is going to be a partner for this
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:25,695	| IOT060 |	All right
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:26,719	| IOT060 |	We're moving on
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:28,767	| IOT060 |	All right
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,559	| IOT060 |	These are could be shorter Converse
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,423	| IOT060 |	Pebble
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:38,495	| IOT060 |	Announced some new products that will launch
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,263	| IOT060 |	Again
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:41,823	| IOT060 |	Actually not even later this year some of them won't come out until
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,103	| IOT060 |	The beginning of next year
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,895	| IOT060 |	The pebble core
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:49,759	| IOT060 |	I was so excited about this you guys if you heard me talk about it was
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:52,831	| IOT060 |	The device called The Mighty you'll understand why this is a
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:57,439	| IOT060 |	Clip on iPod Nano
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:57,951	| IOT060 |	Has both
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:01,535	| IOT060 |	The possibility of a Cellular Connection you will have to buy your own
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:02,815	| IOT060 |	And
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:07,423	| IOT060 |	4 gigs of memory so it can store your Spotify playlist
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,447	| IOT060 |	You can listen to it with
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,263	| IOT060 |	Wired or wireless headphones
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,543	| IOT060 |	And I love it
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:15,359	| IOT060 |	I love you not having to carry
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,127	| IOT060 |	Phone
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:19,199	| IOT060 |	On a walker run specially as it gets hotter in
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:19,711	| IOT060 |	My clothes just
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:26,111	| IOT060 |	Super excited early bird specials on Kickstarter
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,391	| IOT060 |	69
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:30,207	| IOT060 |	And it's going to retail for 99
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,999	| IOT060 |	But I won't be out till January
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,023	| IOT060 |	2017
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:36,095	| IOT060 |	No I run a lot both with a phone and without a phone
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:38,399	| IOT060 |	And I like what they've done here
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:42,495	| IOT060 |	But I probably will not get one and the only reason why
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,263	| IOT060 |	Is
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:46,335	| IOT060 |	I can already do all that on my SmartWatch
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:49,407	| IOT060 |	I don't need to carry my phone like it might have GPS in it
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:50,431	| IOT060 |	I have
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:54,015	| IOT060 |	I'm working for a cat 4 gigs of storage I have Bluetooth
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,295	| IOT060 |	Compatibility for
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:56,831	| IOT060 |	No foreign
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,599	| IOT060 |	Listen to music
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:58,879	| IOT060 |	So
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:16:59,903	| IOT060 |	I think
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:03,231	| IOT060 |	At this point I think it's great and then and I do think they'll do well with it
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:04,511	| IOT060 |	But
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:10,399	| IOT060 |	I almost feel and you intersect I want to throw this question at you and you can please just agree with me
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,959	| IOT060 |	I must feel like this is a little bit of a pivot for them
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:14,495	| IOT060 |	It is
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:17,311	| IOT060 |	So they also announced
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:23,711	| IOT060 |	It is to new watches but they're really the same
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:24,991	| IOT060 |	Old watches
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:27,295	| IOT060 |	With the addition of a heart rate monitor
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,087	| IOT060 |	It is a little bit of a
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:29,855	| IOT060 |	Pivot
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:30,879	| IOT060 |	It's a reckoning
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,671	| IOT060 |	Maybe they plan to do this all the time
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,951	| IOT060 |	Baby the idea was
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:37,023	| IOT060 |	Entrance through wearable Computing and I do think
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:39,071	| IOT060 |	Wearable Computing is going to have
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,607	| IOT060 |	A billion different form factor
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:46,239	| IOT060 |	So I think it's really interesting for any company that's looking at this because personally
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:47,519	| IOT060 |	I think
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:49,567	| IOT060 |	The technology should be
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,335	| IOT060 |	Freaking interchange
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:52,127	| IOT060 |	Alright and it's how you execute
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,407	| IOT060 |	It's going to be
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:58,527	| IOT060 |	The pebble is really if you think about what they're doing they're really trying to do that
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:02,367	| IOT060 |	It'll be hard for a small company though to build a bunch of school
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:04,159	| IOT060 |	You know a bunch of different products like that
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:09,535	| IOT060 |	Whenever you know I'm glad to see the moving out of just SmartWatches because like
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,839	| IOT060 |	Fruit for your example
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:12,351	| IOT060 |	I don't like
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:16,447	| IOT060 |	You know I get it I get it
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:18,239	| IOT060 |	So I like the fact
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:20,031	| IOT060 |	Score in
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:23,359	| IOT060 |	I also like the fact that you don't maybe they'll get into like
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:29,503	| IOT060 |	Jewelry or maybe they'll get into something crazy like sticking modules inside athletic
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,527	| IOT060 |	Close
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,575	| IOT060 |	That's kind of where I think this will go
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:35,135	| IOT060 |	Anna I don't disagree. I like
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:35,903	| IOT060 |	That there
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:37,695	| IOT060 |	The recognizing we can just
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:41,023	| IOT060 |	Be a smartwatch company we need to be a smart wearable company
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:43,583	| IOT060 |	So I think you're right I think they're going to
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:48,191	| IOT060 |	Continue innovating new products after doing SmartWatches now for the better part of
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:51,007	| IOT060 |	At least 3 years
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:55,103	| IOT060 |	I remember their initial Kickstarter was the largest Kickstarter ever
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:58,687	| IOT060 |	I do find it interesting that they're using Kickstarter again as the
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:01,247	| IOT060 |	Point of sale for this it's kind of
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,039	| IOT060 |	Super strong release
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,087	| IOT060 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,111	| IOT060 |	So that's
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:06,623	| IOT060 |	That's what that is
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:09,695	| IOT060 |	Yeah I totally get it and you can go
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:13,023	| IOT060 |	Bed Retail Partners as well as it's not just the kickstarter think so
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:15,071	| IOT060 |	Probably smart for them to Leverage
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:19,935	| IOT060 |	Leverage the relationship with Kickstarter and I don't want to downplay this by Pebble Court too much
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:21,471	| IOT060 |	I mean everything I won't buy one
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:24,543	| IOT060 |	It can do something that my SmartWatch is my car smogged
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,311	| IOT060 |	Just can't do
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,847	| IOT060 |	Because there's a 3-g connection
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:30,175	| IOT060 |	You know if you want to pop a SIM card in there you can do that and
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:32,991	| IOT060 |	Not just could you stream Spotify instead of
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,271	| IOT060 |	Plain local playlist
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,575	| IOT060 |	You could actually
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:39,903	| IOT060 |	Send your location in emergency
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:45,279	| IOT060 |	It has a programmable button so you can you can hack away kind of like the you know the Amazon tile
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:47,583	| IOT060 |	I make it a single-purpose thing and
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:52,447	| IOT060 |	Again my watch when I go out for a run and we just found behind I can do everything but
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:55,519	| IOT060 |	Tell my family hey come pick me up I got a problem or whatever
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:57,567	| IOT060 |	There are certain smart watches and
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,103	| IOT060 |	I think you're going to see this actually
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:00,895	| IOT060 |	Quite a bit in the future
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:03,711	| IOT060 |	Have integrated 3G or LTE but
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:07,295	| IOT060 |	My watches don't so the Pebble Court definitely has a an advantage over what I have
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,319	| IOT060 |	We're still going to need that
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:14,719	| IOT060 |	Yeah I guess either you know 5 or $10 a month to add has a device I presume
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:17,023	| IOT060 |	Characteristics plant
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:18,303	| IOT060 |	Pricing
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:25,727	| IOT060 |	Yeah that's that's what they've done with smart watches that have LTE just a device like a tablet for 10 bucks it's
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:28,799	| IOT060 |	I suspect maybe it'll be five bucks
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:32,639	| IOT060 |	Highway robbery well yeah because considering how much
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:34,687	| IOT060 |	How little did are you use on a
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:39,039	| IOT060 |	Pebble core vs connect a tablet I agree but if you
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:39,807	| IOT060 |	Portray it as
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:41,599	| IOT060 |	Emergency contact
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,879	| IOT060 |	I suppose
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:46,207	| IOT060 |	You know you're paying $10 a month for being always able to
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:49,535	| IOT060 |	Connect are you a Spotify user
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:50,047	| IOT060 |	I am
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:54,143	| IOT060 |	And I am not so when I sit here in and see
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:59,007	| IOT060 |	That you can only stream Spotify without 3g connection to Penelec
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:00,799	| IOT060 |	Why can't I pick and choose my
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,335	| IOT060 |	They're going to add other
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:05,407	| IOT060 |	Partners in maybe they'll have another reason
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,175	| IOT060 |	Set partner
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:06,687	| IOT060 |	I don't know
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,479	| IOT060 |	Yeah so we'll see
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:09,759	| IOT060 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:13,343	| IOT060 |	So this should bring us up to more wearables which is Android Wear in Tyson
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:14,623	| IOT060 |	Which
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:16,159	| IOT060 |	The rumor has it
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:17,952	| IOT060 |	That Samsung is debating
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:22,048	| IOT060 |	Using tizen on its SmartWatches as opposed to Android Wear
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:23,328	| IOT060 |	Now
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,352	| IOT060 |	The story came out and was like
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:27,424	| IOT060 |	Kind of walk back
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,984	| IOT060 |	So write the story was
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:35,616	| IOT060 |	Samsung is abandoning at Android Wear essentially an in Samsung to huge and our partner so
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:37,408	| IOT060 |	Of course everything
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:39,200	| IOT060 |	But then there's been an update which is
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:42,272	| IOT060 |	Not much of an updating anyways Engadget spoke to
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:45,600	| IOT060 |	A Samsung representative and said no no no everybody is missing
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,112	| IOT060 |	Interpretive essay
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:49,440	| IOT060 |	And we didn't say that we're not going to do Android Wear
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:53,280	| IOT060 |	But they're not saying that they're going to either so it's really kind of
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,816	| IOT060 |	Fuzzy right now
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:56,096	| IOT060 |	But the reality is
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:22:00,448	| IOT060 |	Samsung actually started with Android wear with its first Gear watch
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:03,520	| IOT060 |	3ish two years ago to si2
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:06,336	| IOT060 |	Cuz I don't want Android Wear hasn't been around that long
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:09,664	| IOT060 |	But they eventually came out with additional models that use their
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:12,224	| IOT060 |	Not there ties in with the open-source ties end
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:18,368	| IOT060 |	And then they switch the Android Wear ones that they have on the field they sent a firmware update and updated them all
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:19,392	| IOT060 |	Tyson so really
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:24,000	| IOT060 |	It's not a huge surprise if they don't make an Android Wear device anymore
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,048	| IOT060 |	Because I really not doing it today
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:31,168	| IOT060 |	I think it was more of positioning that the media token like is a big big issue
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:32,704	| IOT060 |	I don't know that it is or not
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:33,984	| IOT060 |	Okay
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:35,776	| IOT060 |	So there we have it
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:37,056	| IOT060 |	And then
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:37,824	| IOT060 |	Will ended
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:41,664	| IOT060 |	An update for you guys a couple episodes ago we talked about
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:46,016	| IOT060 |	Vampire power consumption and I said I would wander around with my
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:49,856	| IOT060 |	WeMo Insight switch and test power consumption of
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:51,904	| IOT060 |	Wink
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:52,416	| IOT060 |	And
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,464	| IOT060 |	What you find out
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,256	| IOT060 |	They don't consume a lot of power
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:59,328	| IOT060 |	Yay
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:01,376	| IOT060 |	This is good news
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,912	| IOT060 |	Zodiac
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:04,448	| IOT060 |	Roughly 3 Watts a day
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,728	| IOT060 |	Wow that's low
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:08,032	| IOT060 |	Superlo
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:10,080	| IOT060 |	So I take
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:12,896	| IOT060 |	Really high electricity rates I pay like $0.16
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:15,200	| IOT060 |	Per kilowatt-hour
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:19,808	| IOT060 |	I I get very confused when I think about this and so it's saying I'm going to use
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:20,576	| IOT060 |	About
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:23,904	| IOT060 |	$0.34 a month paying for my Amazon
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:25,440	| IOT060 |	Sunlake
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:26,464	| IOT060 |	Totally worth it
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:28,256	| IOT060 |	And then
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,048	| IOT060 |	Which is the Hub that
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:30,816	| IOT060 |	Used most often
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:33,632	| IOT060 |	Antennas less than 2 what
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:36,192	| IOT060 |	The cutoff point for the WeMo
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,984	| IOT060 |	Inside switch so I I can't
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:39,520	| IOT060 |	Tell you exactly how much
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,288	| IOT060 |	Consumes
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,568	| IOT060 |	It could be less
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:46,176	| IOT060 |	Estimate like $0.20 a month to run it over
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:51,296	| IOT060 |	It is okay it's okay it has to be less than
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:53,344	| IOT060 |	The $0.37 from
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,368	| IOT060 |	America
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,392	| IOT060 |	It's west of the 34 Cent
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,976	| IOT060 |	Just a quarter just a quarter
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:01,024	| IOT060 |	$0.25 I don't know
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:03,328	| IOT060 |	It's still super loud which is awesome
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:05,376	| IOT060 |	It is you should be running all kind
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,192	| IOT060 |	Because why not
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:10,496	| IOT060 |	It consumes $0.22
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,288	| IOT060 |	Sam's close
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:15,360	| IOT060 |	Yeah you were you were very close it's saying today it's
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:17,152	| IOT060 |	It's so far consumed less than
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:18,176	| IOT060 |	A tenth of a penny
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:21,760	| IOT060 |	That's pretty awesome
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:22,784	| IOT060 |	So there you go so
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:26,368	| IOT060 |	Both are always on connected devices that are
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,648	| IOT060 |	In my house always on and
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:28,672	| IOT060 |	Neither
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:30,464	| IOT060 |	Is going to break the bank
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:30,976	| IOT060 |	However
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:32,512	| IOT060 |	However
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:33,280	| IOT060 |	However
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:33,792	| IOT060 |	If you have
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:35,584	| IOT060 |	Doesn't something
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:37,120	| IOT060 |	If like certain
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:38,144	| IOT060 |	People like me
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:40,704	| IOT060 |	You may find yourself consuming a lot of energy
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:44,544	| IOT060 |	So that is
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:45,824	| IOT060 |	The update there
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:47,616	| IOT060 |	Keep trying if you guys
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,408	| IOT060 |	Try anything in
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:49,920	| IOT060 |	Particular icon
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:53,760	| IOT060 |	Play things and I'd be curious to see what a IP video camera
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:57,600	| IOT060 |	You want to plug in a Foscam into your inside
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:25:03,488	| IOT060 |	That's a good point I do have a Foscam I may be packed already since we're moving but I will I will look for it
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:06,304	| IOT060 |	That's okay
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:12,704	| IOT060 |	At precisely the wrong time.
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:14,240	| IOT060 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,008	| IOT060 |	All right

EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:50,240	| IOT060 |	Oh thanks for coming on the show we had a lot of questions about Russia
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:56,384	| IOT060 |	Listeners who don't know what this is can you give them a brief overview of what you are selling
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:27:01,504	| IOT060 |	Sure so we make an internet-connected bring the controller for residence
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:07,136	| IOT060 |	Ira places on the existing timer that you would find on your wall in your garage and once it's connected
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:07,904	| IOT060 |	Weehawken
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:08,416	| IOT060 |	Consumers
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:15,584	| IOT060 |	I got its information about their about their Zone in their landscape and then take that information
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:18,400	| IOT060 |	I don't do things like adjust the frequency of watering
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,936	| IOT060 |	Adjust the duration of watering
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:22,752	| IOT060 |	And we can watch for a ringtones and make sure you're not watering in the rain
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:24,032	| IOT060 |	Awesome
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:28,896	| IOT060 |	And I will let you guys know that I actually installed one of these about 2 weeks ago
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:31,968	| IOT060 |	Water
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,528	| IOT060 |	We'll talk about that in the future
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:37,344	| IOT060 |	It was easy to install
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:38,624	| IOT060 |	And so far my father-in-law's house
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:41,184	| IOT060 |	What I was actually kind of
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:44,256	| IOT060 |	Surprised out when I connect to a
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:46,816	| IOT060 |	Weather station that actually is kind of far away from
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:55,776	| IOT060 |	There's no sensors here I kind of always thought for something to be really intelligent
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:57,824	| IOT060 |	I'm very curious like
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:00,640	| IOT060 |	Do you have plans to kind of
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:04,992	| IOT060 |	Add to the product or do you think maybe you know you'll do that through like an ecosystem play
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:09,600	| IOT060 |	Yeah that's a great question and I didn't weather specifically is
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:12,928	| IOT060 |	One that we get a lot about a lot of questions around in
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:17,536	| IOT060 |	Birth certificate the same exact circumstances you ran into where there is a weather station that is
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:19,072	| IOT060 |	If I were 6 miles away
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:21,120	| IOT060 |	The really good news is
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:24,448	| IOT060 |	Absolutely approach
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:26,240	| IOT060 |	Perspective and create another
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:28,288	| IOT060 |	Accessory
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:32,384	| IOT060 |	Study we can also leverage other products that are out there like
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:33,408	| IOT060 |	Uid number of
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:34,944	| IOT060 |	Text mother station then
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:38,272	| IOT060 |	Yo where did using one letter seriously
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:40,064	| IOT060 |	Plan do I do that until you can
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:41,600	| IOT060 |	Imagine that there is a number of
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:46,720	| IOT060 |	Personal weather stations in all kinds of weather information that will make
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:49,792	| IOT060 |	It's a digital version of whether I'm better and
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:51,584	| IOT060 |	You better resolution as a user
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:54,144	| IOT060 |	I feel like I don't know if I want to digital version to the
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:56,960	| IOT060 |	I feel like the real-world analog versions of the weather
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:29:03,872	| IOT060 |	They're alright you know some services are getting really good at analyzing radar and weather stations and
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:10,272	| IOT060 |	I didn't even using water balloons and the other getting out of basically one square kilometer of high-resolution weather
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:10,784	| IOT060 |	15 minutes
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:15,904	| IOT060 |	Get really cool and you can kind of get that digital version of it and use it in our software
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:21,536	| IOT060 |	Let's think about how all this plays out because
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:22,816	| IOT060 |	A lot of companies
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:28,960	| IOT060 |	I feel miss the Mark is a start up there like
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:29,984	| IOT060 |	Intelligent
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:33,056	| IOT060 |	I think that a lot of them
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:34,080	| IOT060 |	Don't realize it
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:39,712	| IOT060 |	Maybe the in-service that you're delivering here isn't a connected sprinkler that's easier to program
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:43,040	| IOT060 |	But I know that's what my father
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:46,112	| IOT060 |	Curious how you say
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:49,184	| IOT060 |	Kind of rachio when you think about the actual problem you're solving
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:53,536	| IOT060 |	Start a company with with a mission to really
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:55,584	| IOT060 |	Save water in and make it available
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:58,144	| IOT060 |	Sustainable way
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:59,680	| IOT060 |	And your water use
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:01,984	| IOT060 |	Outdoors is hugin in the US
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:04,800	| IOT060 |	And you know a smart sprinkler controller
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:06,848	| IOT060 |	Where the input comes from
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:07,872	| IOT060 |	In terms of weather and
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:09,408	| IOT060 |	Soylent
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:10,432	| IOT060 |	Even Flow sensors
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:12,736	| IOT060 |	Yeah you can really start to dial that in
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:18,880	| IOT060 |	Especially with great that's what's great about a product is weekend update the software over the years and make it better and better
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:21,440	| IOT060 |	I'm in and really reduce that that way
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:23,744	| IOT060 |	And that's really interesting for
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:25,024	| IOT060 |	Just holidays to a lot of
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:28,096	| IOT060 |	The Westin house
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:29,120	| IOT060 |	Water reduction
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:30,656	| IOT060 |	Whataburger or
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:32,960	| IOT060 |	Goals are ejected they're trying to meet I think
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:35,008	| IOT060 |	What was really close when you have Cactus products
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:38,848	| IOT060 |	Analytics bacon look and see if they're beating their targets
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:40,128	| IOT060 |	Or even predictive
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:44,224	| IOT060 |	Alex on when we think we might water may be based on last year or
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:46,784	| IOT060 |	What we're seeing in the upcoming couple weeks or months
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:49,344	| IOT060 |	I was thinking about this because here in Texas we have
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,648	| IOT060 |	Edgewater
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:52,416	| IOT060 |	Conservation
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:53,184	| IOT060 |	Program
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:57,280	| IOT060 |	And I was thinking you know if everyone in my neighborhood for example
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:31:00,864	| IOT060 |	Like the neighbor neighborhood
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:06,496	| IOT060 |	Right now we've got water restrictions so like you can water like maybe one day a week if you're on one side of the street
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:07,520	| IOT060 |	Another day the other
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:12,640	| IOT060 |	You know if you're on the other side with the system like this if everyone has some sort of
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:17,248	| IOT060 |	Intelligent sprinkler system in that data would you could contribute that data to
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:18,784	| IOT060 |	Neighborhood pool
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:20,576	| IOT060 |	You can actually
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,856	| IOT060 |	Maybe do a lot more
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:25,184	| IOT060 |	I guess personalized watering and maybe
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:29,792	| IOT060 |	Baby the city takes over as a service
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:32,864	| IOT060 |	I just think the power there is really interesting but I'm not sure how
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:33,888	| IOT060 |	Never get to something
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:38,240	| IOT060 |	Know yet that's super interesting to us as well as
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:41,824	| IOT060 |	Actually we didn't work in a couple minutes polities. If you have Ark
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:45,408	| IOT060 |	Controller you don't have to follow the restrictions because of some
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:49,760	| IOT060 |	We have some type of schedule that only really Waters when it when it needs to
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:50,784	| IOT060 |	And you're
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:53,088	| IOT060 |	Artificial Warriors butt
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:53,856	| IOT060 |	I think
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:56,160	| IOT060 |	Yeah you touched on it that is as a community
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:59,232	| IOT060 |	Yo almost like a budget and look at the fair budget
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:01,792	| IOT060 |	Hey we only have this much water today at to use Outdoors
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:04,608	| IOT060 |	This is the most often used for it
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:06,656	| IOT060 |	I am your municipality in
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:11,520	| IOT060 |	Customers and Technology can work together to really create a task
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:13,056	| IOT060 |	It's a sustainable watering
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:14,336	| IOT060 |	Planters Outdoors
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,104	| IOT060 |	To me that's fast
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:18,176	| IOT060 |	Although then you kind of get into issues of Lake
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:24,064	| IOT060 |	Although it also turns brown
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:28,416	| IOT060 |	Is that something you guys would ever
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:30,720	| IOT060 |	Waiting
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:32,000	| IOT060 |	Americans love their lawns
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:35,840	| IOT060 |	Is that something you guys are thinking about her
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:44,288	| IOT060 |	Yeah absolutely I mean I think you would even love to be able to make recommendations on
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:45,312	| IOT060 |	Yo people in
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:50,688	| IOT060 |	In your area have benefits many zones are this this much square footage of a lawn
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:53,760	| IOT060 |	Buffalo grass or Kentucky Bluegrass and
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:55,040	| IOT060 |	Now you may consider
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:59,904	| IOT060 |	Switching some of these islands out to I'm more of a Zero Escape or a drought resistant
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:00,672	| IOT060 |	Pipezone
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:01,952	| IOT060 |	Here's the recommendation
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:02,976	| IOT060 |	How to do that
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:09,120	| IOT060 |	And yeah I think that's definitely part of our plan as well
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:10,912	| IOT060 |	I am
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:17,056	| IOT060 |	Let's get going
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:18,592	| IOT060 |	I do I've given up
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,872	| IOT060 |	That's kind of
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:20,896	| IOT060 |	Long-term vision
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:23,712	| IOT060 |	Today you guys are on your second generation product
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:29,856	| IOT060 |	What have you learned because the last time I talked to you I think it was before you launch your first-generation product
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:31,392	| IOT060 |	You are amazing cuz y'all were already in
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:33,440	| IOT060 |	You're going into Home Depot so
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:36,000	| IOT060 |	How's it been what have you learned from now
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:37,280	| IOT060 |	2 Generations
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:40,096	| IOT060 |	Yes oh it's been
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:43,168	| IOT060 |	Experience
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:46,240	| IOT060 |	One of many things we learned in 900 should just be a given but
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:48,032	| IOT060 |	I'm sorry that it seems but
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:50,336	| IOT060 |	Create a really reliable products
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:53,664	| IOT060 |	Hardware to Software
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:54,944	| IOT060 |	Connectivity
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:56,992	| IOT060 |	Customer support
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:59,552	| IOT060 |	Helping a customer sometimes
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:02,112	| IOT060 |	No it's their first connect device or even a second
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:06,208	| IOT060 |	Make that transition into a connected world where they found from
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:07,232	| IOT060 |	Wanting to
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:11,584	| IOT060 |	You're wanting to but that's what they were doing
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:13,120	| IOT060 |	Do controlling it
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:15,424	| IOT060 |	Falling asleep
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:17,216	| IOT060 |	Hey
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:22,592	| IOT060 |	We're going to watch for water and we're going to adjust your schedule over the month
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:26,432	| IOT060 |	And experiences.
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:31,296	| IOT060 |	Build that trust those those customers out overtime and make sure that information at their fingertips
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:33,088	| IOT060 |	Nothing much at this time of day
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:36,672	| IOT060 |	Other than Running Springs prices like that was kind of first and foremost get all that right
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:38,720	| IOT060 |	And there's ways to have optimized from there
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:42,048	| IOT060 |	In specifically because I know a lot of
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:46,400	| IOT060 |	Companies are trying to get their products in a big box retail
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:48,192	| IOT060 |	Words of wisdom for those guys
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:52,544	| IOT060 |	I didn't realize we were the lucky situation where we were at the first product of her kind
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:56,384	| IOT060 |	And retailers were really looking to build out this connected home
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:58,176	| IOT060 |	Japanese second home category
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:00,224	| IOT060 |	So the number of Dimes
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:02,784	| IOT060 |	Got in touch with us they did with other
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:04,576	| IOT060 |	Entering space
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:05,088	| IOT060 |	Same time
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:10,976	| IOT060 |	They dilated products and you know they they brought ours in getting into retail
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:13,280	| IOT060 |	Wasn't necessarily difficult for us
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:14,560	| IOT060 |	I think that was just a function of
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:17,376	| IOT060 |	Timing in the pot if you're watching
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:19,936	| IOT060 |	And even things like Bike Shop in the last
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:21,216	| IOT060 |	But I actually
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:27,616	| IOT060 |	Going through the channel is where ye'll it starts to get a bit more difficult and I think that's where we're really learning as a
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:28,128	| IOT060 |	As a company now
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:30,944	| IOT060 |	What are some of the things you've
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,224	| IOT060 |	Insofar
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:34,784	| IOT060 |	Telling the story of iot at the Shell
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:36,576	| IOT060 |	Is difficult
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:40,928	| IOT060 |	There's a lot of information to kind of pack into that small area that you have on on a Shelf
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:44,512	| IOT060 |	You know one thing that we're finding right now at retail and
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:46,048	| IOT060 |	Witness it first-hand
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:47,328	| IOT060 |	Just last weekend for example
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:50,144	| IOT060 |	Izod I it's really
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:52,192	| IOT060 |	Appears to be a destination sale
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:53,728	| IOT060 |	Well you have a lot of
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:57,312	| IOT060 |	Murders that are coming into
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:58,336	| IOT060 |	The Stars themselves
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:01,152	| IOT060 |	Driving to the store. Just last weekend
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:03,456	| IOT060 |	I'm talking to someone in the irrigation
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:07,552	| IOT060 |	Daughter unit
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:09,856	| IOT060 |	It's amazing how people come in and ask for it by name
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:15,232	| IOT060 |	I was at the shop and I was standing there another gentleman walked up and
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:16,768	| IOT060 |	I'd like to have the wink on cat
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:18,304	| IOT060 |	Where is it at
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:22,400	| IOT060 |	I think that's what we're seeing right now at retail is that it's really the onus is on
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:28,288	| IOT060 |	Start up companies like elastic I'll bring those people to the shelves to go by the product but not necessarily
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:31,616	| IOT060 |	We are going to find that magic formulas and I'm than learning at the Shelf quite yet
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:33,408	| IOT060 |	Difficult
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:34,944	| IOT060 |	Know that there's a lot of information
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:38,272	| IOT060 |	And I'm delighted by the idea
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:39,040	| IOT060 |	You're standing out in the
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:41,344	| IOT060 |	Irrigation
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,368	| IOT060 |	Local hardware store
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:47,232	| IOT060 |	That's about it
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:48,512	| IOT060 |	Happy lighting aisle or the
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:50,304	| IOT060 |	My my look
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:54,144	| IOT060 |	Accosting random stranger
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:54,656	| IOT060 |	Hi
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:58,752	| IOT060 |	How is it
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:00,544	| IOT060 |	Dealing with your customer
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:03,360	| IOT060 |	Because one of the things that I find from
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:04,384	| IOT060 |	People who have built
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:05,920	| IOT060 |	You know pretty successful connector
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:08,480	| IOT060 |	They have
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:11,296	| IOT060 |	And dedicated customer base who is not afraid to tell them
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:12,576	| IOT060 |	When they mess up
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:17,696	| IOT060 |	And I think it's both a blessing and a curse so I'm curious like how you view
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:20,256	| IOT060 |	I don't know the early adopters still that your cuss
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:26,144	| IOT060 |	Yeah it it's funny you should ask that we we were very vocal
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:30,240	| IOT060 |	Customer base and we loaded our community is Super Active online
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:33,056	| IOT060 |	As we are even near the road right at other channels
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:34,592	| IOT060 |	AR support directly
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:40,736	| IOT060 |	But our community specifically they give us great feedback on all kinds of features things we're planning things that we
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:44,064	| IOT060 |	I give you a great example is
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:46,624	| IOT060 |	Beaver trying to simplify the product a little bit
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:50,720	| IOT060 |	And actually produce a better scheduling system then we move the future
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:53,536	| IOT060 |	I met a girl
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:56,096	| IOT060 |	Call rr Flex scheduling
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:58,144	| IOT060 |	It can be somewhat unpredictable sometimes
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:00,704	| IOT060 |	It really is the right way to water
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:04,544	| IOT060 |	He was great in helping us understand that we should bring it back
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:09,408	| IOT060 |	Can we listen to all and they brought up some really great point that we hadn't even thought through
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:14,784	| IOT060 |	Because that we're excited to bring it back and she better rate on that product with them
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:17,088	| IOT060 |	Actually really know what the problem is that was all that now
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:18,368	| IOT060 |	That kind of stuff is invaluable
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:21,184	| IOT060 |	True know how then as you become
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:23,232	| IOT060 |	Hopefully we'll cross our fingers more successful
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:24,512	| IOT060 |	How do you
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:30,144	| IOT060 |	Account for the demands of a vocal few perhaps like you're hardcore users and then
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:31,680	| IOT060 |	What everybody else me
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:33,472	| IOT060 |	It's because I think that's going to be
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:35,776	| IOT060 |	A challenge for a lot of these companies
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:37,312	| IOT060 |	As they find success
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:41,408	| IOT060 |	Oh absolutely that's a conversation we have on a daily basis
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:42,432	| IOT060 |	Nothing for us
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,456	| IOT060 |	It was
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:47,808	| IOT060 |	We didn't try to make a reaction
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:51,904	| IOT060 |	We want to do is replace one type of schedule with
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:52,672	| IOT060 |	A different time
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:54,976	| IOT060 |	And you know we talked about it as a group and said
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:57,280	| IOT060 |	If we weren't going to
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:39:00,608	| IOT060 |	If you're just going to say we went to remove this feature the future that we ended up
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:01,632	| IOT060 |	The scheduling
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:03,936	| IOT060 |	Turning off would we actually do that
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:07,008	| IOT060 |	Or we compromise anything he will replace it with this
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:12,384	| IOT060 |	Yeonwoo scheduled mean on the new schedule really wasn't what they were looking for and what you kind of went through the process of
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:16,480	| IOT060 |	Dining around saying well actually all we've done is taken away future.
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:18,528	| IOT060 |	Yell at certain percentage of our customers really like
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:21,600	| IOT060 |	We made a decision that we should bring it back until
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:22,880	| IOT060 |	It can be completely replaced
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:27,488	| IOT060 |	What's something that would make them happy and it is hard to evaluate by The Warriors versus the majority
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:31,072	| IOT060 |	But we do have data only have an idea of you know how many people have those types
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:32,096	| IOT060 |	Schedules and
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:34,912	| IOT060 |	Time you were able to make a decision on that
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:36,704	| IOT060 |	Awesome and
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:37,472	| IOT060 |	What is next
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:37,984	| IOT060 |	For you guys
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:41,312	| IOT060 |	You've done that the first gen sprinkler
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:42,336	| IOT060 |	Sprinkler controller
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:45,920	| IOT060 |	2nd gen product
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:51,552	| IOT060 |	Enclosure and outdoor enclosure that
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:52,064	| IOT060 |	You sound like
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:57,440	| IOT060 |	There's some logical
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:00,512	| IOT060 |	Yeah
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:03,328	| IOT060 |	You don't have to pass to go down
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:06,656	| IOT060 |	I think one is DP accessories kind of modeling
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:08,960	| IOT060 |	There's a number of pieces of hardware and
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:12,544	| IOT060 |	Products that are on a road map that we can make good I think compliments
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:13,824	| IOT060 |	Controller nicely
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:16,896	| IOT060 |	Yeah there's I think the software called the company
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:18,688	| IOT060 |	Very excited about
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:23,296	| IOT060 |	Natural extensions that maybe you know Tyson some enterprising and and I
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:25,600	| IOT060 |	Or maybe business and let me buy.
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:27,648	| IOT060 |	Trip to
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:29,184	| IOT060 |	Adjacent markets that are really interesting.
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:32,256	| IOT060 |	What is a professional landscape space
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:34,816	| IOT060 |	70% of these controllers have been solved by
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:37,120	| IOT060 |	Landscapers 4 years
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:38,656	| IOT060 |	I am
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:41,984	| IOT060 |	Yeah we're we're trying to learn from them about what makes our controllers
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:45,312	| IOT060 |	How it can possibly improve their businesses
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:49,920	| IOT060 |	Or make their communication with the customer better or you know Christian relationships and bonds
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:54,528	| IOT060 |	I'm about to produce products to them that they can help him.
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:56,576	| IOT060 |	The other Jason Market is really utilities
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:41:04,256	| IOT060 |	It's really interesting to see how they're approaching water conservation problems or even things is simplest keep shaving
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:07,328	| IOT060 |	You know what really starts to happen when you have this
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:08,608	| IOT060 |	Throat
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:11,936	| IOT060 |	Disconnected nodes out there that can help solve some of these bigger problems
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:13,984	| IOT060 |	Balance of those types of
EDL	00:41:15,264	00:41:17,312	| IOT060 |	I'm heading frosting
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:20,896	| IOT060 |	You know we're looking forward to continuing to
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:24,736	| IOT060 |	When I open my rachio I noticed that this was
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:28,320	| IOT060 |	Actually the whole things made in America
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:30,624	| IOT060 |	And I did want to ask you about
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:32,160	| IOT060 |	True Manufacturing efforts
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:33,184	| IOT060 |	Because
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:33,696	| IOT060 |	Struck me as
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:35,232	| IOT060 |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:37,792	| IOT060 |	There's a lot of things that go into that
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:38,560	| IOT060 |	And
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:39,328	| IOT060 |	1
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:41,376	| IOT060 |	The only was first launched in the product
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:42,912	| IOT060 |	We wanted to
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:46,752	| IOT060 |	Because to a manufacturer we wanted to be able to move with Speed and Agility
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:47,520	| IOT060 |	And
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:48,032	| IOT060 |	At the same time
EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:50,848	| IOT060 |	Blvd Costa design process
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:54,943	| IOT060 |	BO2 45 minutes from RR 290 pictures then
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:57,759	| IOT060 |	I can't tell you how valuable that has been
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:42:01,599	| IOT060 |	Show me different circumstances where you get to drive up to the the factory
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:03,135	| IOT060 |	I was all on the side
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:05,439	| IOT060 |	You don't get the process back up and running
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:07,231	| IOT060 |	Driving that was the most important
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:08,511	| IOT060 |	Things for us when we are first starting
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:10,303	| IOT060 |	Apple at the same time
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:11,839	| IOT060 |	I can't tell you like how great it
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:15,167	| IOT060 |	Feels to walk onto the Florida manufacturer
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:16,703	| IOT060 |	I'm a ninja.
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:19,007	| IOT060 |	You know you're helping put people at work
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:21,567	| IOT060 |	I not on people are excited to work on your product in
EDL	00:42:22,079	00:42:23,871	| IOT060 |	That's a great experiences while in
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:25,919	| IOT060 |	So far it's been rewarding enough.
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:28,479	| IOT060 |	You know we want to continue to manufacture here in the US
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:30,271	| IOT060 |	All right
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:32,063	| IOT060 |	How many do you guys produce a day
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:34,623	| IOT060 |	We can produce up to 2000 today
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:35,135	| IOT060 |	Wow
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:37,951	| IOT060 |	Awesome Chris thanks so much for coming on the show
