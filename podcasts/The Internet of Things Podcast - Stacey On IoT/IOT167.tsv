EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:52,896	| IOT167 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:53,408	| IOT167 |	Kevin
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:54,944	| IOT167 |	You
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,528	| IOT167 |	You watched
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:01:59,296	| IOT167 |	All of WWE
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:01,088	| IOT167 |	Yeah I kind of
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:02,368	| IOT167 |	I had it going on in the background
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,160	| IOT167 |	Work cell
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,696	| IOT167 |	We're going to rely on your take
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:06,976	| IOT167 |	Most of this
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:09,024	| IOT167 |	So let's talk about the biggest news
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,304	| IOT167 |	From this I was just
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:14,400	| IOT167 |	Frankly I was too not just cuz I invested about
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:17,984	| IOT167 |	2 hours and 15 minutes waiting for something really exciting but
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:23,104	| IOT167 |	When they finally got to talk about Siri at home kits a little bit of a letdown
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:23,872	| IOT167 |	Granted
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:26,432	| IOT167 |	This is their developer event they being Apple
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:30,528	| IOT167 |	So they focused on software this time around no new hardware whatsoever talk about
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,040	| IOT167 |	IOS
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:33,088	| IOT167 |	Os10
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,112	| IOT167 |	TV OS
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,136	| IOT167 |	Aaron's
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:38,976	| IOT167 |	Hof I forgot I forgot about that
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:42,560	| IOT167 |	I wear that every waking moment yes I forgot about that
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:47,936	| IOT167 |	But homepod was only mentioned one time and passing first of all so there's nothing to say there
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,448	| IOT167 |	Hands
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:51,776	| IOT167 |	Siri yes they did talk about Siri
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:53,568	| IOT167 |	And I wrote up my thoughts
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:57,152	| IOT167 |	The blog and I said she got smarter
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,944	| IOT167 |	But not in the way you might have
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,992	| IOT167 |	Or maybe you had hoped
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,016	| IOT167 |	They're still a knowledge.
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:06,624	| IOT167 |	Between Siri and the offerings from Amazon and Google I don't see much
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:09,952	| IOT167 |	List. Forward there maybe half a step forward
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:11,232	| IOT167 |	It was more about
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:15,584	| IOT167 |	The usefulness of Siri in your everyday life which is good
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:17,888	| IOT167 |	They introduced this was the big feature
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:18,912	| IOT167 |	What is shortcut
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,448	| IOT167 |	And
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:21,728	| IOT167 |	If you're familiar with
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:25,312	| IOT167 |	If this then that it's very similar to
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,336	| IOT167 |	Shortcuts
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,616	| IOT167 |	What you can do is you can
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,640	| IOT167 |	Record a
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,920	| IOT167 |	Trigger phrase
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:30,944	| IOT167 |	Or Siri
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:31,712	| IOT167 |	And
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:35,040	| IOT167 |	When you say that phrase you can actually configure
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:37,600	| IOT167 |	Siri to do any number of things
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:40,416	| IOT167 |	Using various apps and services on your phone
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:43,744	| IOT167 |	Which is kind of cool the demo was kind of neat with a woman on stage said
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:46,304	| IOT167 |	Heading home and she had pre-configured that phrase to
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,328	| IOT167 |	Fire up
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:52,960	| IOT167 |	Apple Maps and find the quickest way home and to send a message to everybody home saying I'm on my way home then
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:56,288	| IOT167 |	Fire up the radio station so she can listen to NPR on her phone
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,312	| IOT167 |	In her car
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:04:00,384	| IOT167 |	Do one or two other things that she oh she said her own thermostat
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:02,176	| IOT167 |	The 7D young and so on
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,200	| IOT167 |	Kind of cool
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:06,272	| IOT167 |	And again reminds me of if this and that and also how
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:10,112	| IOT167 |	Homekit sets up the automation very much
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,392	| IOT167 |	Drag-and-drop kind of experience
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:18,047	| IOT167 |	This actually reminds me a lot of this is actually something I've built using both stringify and yonomi plus goo
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:19,839	| IOT167 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:20,863	| IOT167 |	So yes
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,167	| IOT167 |	Extra
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:28,543	| IOT167 |	Software platform player I guess you could actually do this
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,055	| IOT167 |	Yourself
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,359	| IOT167 |	Using any number of other
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:37,247	| IOT167 |	Yeah it's funny you mention that because you want to know what the first thought I had was when I saw this
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,271	| IOT167 |	What was the
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:41,855	| IOT167 |	I recall specific memories
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,879	| IOT167 |	Setting up
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:43,903	| IOT167 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,183	| IOT167 |	Voice command
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:46,719	| IOT167 |	Where you would record a voice command
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:49,535	| IOT167 |	I pocket PC in 2001
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:51,839	| IOT167 |	And we can figure that to do certain things
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:55,935	| IOT167 |	Scranton you can do nearly the things that you can do today backwards
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:57,471	| IOT167 |	That's exactly what they were
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:58,751	| IOT167 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:01,311	| IOT167 |	And I thought of that and then the other thing I thought of was
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:03,871	| IOT167 |	Shouldn't be assistant
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:04,895	| IOT167 |	ELearning
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,663	| IOT167 |	And
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:11,551	| IOT167 |	Know what my habits are in just set the configuration of sort of for me like surfaces at these kind of things
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,343	| IOT167 |	And to be fair
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:16,159	| IOT167 |	Siri will start doing more of that they did
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:16,927	| IOT167 |	Show
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:22,815	| IOT167 |	Circus Casino if you constantly go to the gym at 5 p.m. everyday and you open a particular running app like
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:23,839	| IOT167 |	Which I do not
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,119	| IOT167 |	Everyday at 5 but whatever
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:27,167	| IOT167 |	Eventually Siri will
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:33,311	| IOT167 |	See that you are there and before you even open the app it'll say hey looks like you're at the gym ready to start running at 4
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:35,103	| IOT167 |	It'll save you a Tapper 2
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:41,503	| IOT167 |	It just felt weird because the assistance were supposed to be getting smarter but in this case
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,783	| IOT167 |	You're teaching
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:46,111	| IOT167 |	Siri to get smarter on your own you have to configure it
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:49,951	| IOT167 |	And I wonder how many people are really going to take full advantage of this
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,743	| IOT167 |	How many Siri users
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:57,119	| IOT167 |	I don't think it's going to catch on where everybody's going to be using us who has an iPhone
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:01,215	| IOT167 |	I just don't see it I'm actually curious cuz like you can do this with routines
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:04,031	| IOT167 |	Or I think it's routines in Amazon's world and in
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:05,823	| IOT167 |	And I've set up
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:06,847	| IOT167 |	A couple but
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,871	| IOT167 |	You know they're kind of
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,639	| IOT167 |	Pain
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:12,735	| IOT167 |	You have extra thing the whole point of the assistant is it supposed to do things
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:16,575	| IOT167 |	For you know this is kind of like programming your assistant salary
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:22,975	| IOT167 |	Simple fashion in a way that anybody can do but you're absolutely right these are like routines and in fact
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:25,023	| IOT167 |	One smart thing apple is done here is
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,047	| IOT167 |	The way you
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:28,863	| IOT167 |	Do this you have to link your apps with Siri and
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:29,887	| IOT167 |	Siri hasn't worked
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:34,239	| IOT167 |	Tremendously well with a lot of third-party apps Oye Apple for opening it up
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:38,847	| IOT167 |	And now you can link your app so that way another stage demo was a
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:40,383	| IOT167 |	Can't find my keys
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,663	| IOT167 |	Shortcut for you say that
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,455	| IOT167 |	And because you linked
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:44,223	| IOT167 |	Siri Twitter
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:45,247	| IOT167 |	Tile app
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:49,343	| IOT167 |	Siri would Buzz the tile Bluetooth tracker for you and pop up the app
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:52,159	| IOT167 |	So that's good but
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,695	| IOT167 |	I don't know it is since
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:55,231	| IOT167 |	Apple is not going the
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:07:01,375	| IOT167 |	Amazon Google route with skills or actions and routines it's just using apps for those purposes I think
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,935	| IOT167 |	Yes and a friend of mine who's a Big Sur
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:04,703	| IOT167 |	Supporter of
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,471	| IOT167 |	Apple products
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:08,287	| IOT167 |	He pointed out that learning is really tough
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:11,103	| IOT167 |	And when you get it wrong it irritates
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:15,199	| IOT167 |	People in that actually brought me back to and I wrote about this but seeing Google's
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:17,759	| IOT167 |	Head of connected speaker products mark space
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,295	| IOT167 |	And he talked about
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:21,087	| IOT167 |	You know when you're doing
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:22,111	| IOT167 |	An AI model
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:29,023	| IOT167 |	If you're doing it for what he called a corrective experience so that's when a motion sensor doesn't detect motion for a while and it turns off the light
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:29,535	| IOT167 |	Automatically
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:32,863	| IOT167 |	It is a black at 85% confidence interval
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:34,143	| IOT167 |	Because it's really annoying when you
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,679	| IOT167 |	Sitting there in a room
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:40,287	| IOT167 |	And if you're actually going to start something
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,055	| IOT167 |	Lectern like
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:44,127	| IOT167 |	I'm going home turn on the oven or order a pizza
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:46,687	| IOT167 |	And it has real world applications that are
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:48,735	| IOT167 |	Kind of bigger than just waving your hands around
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:50,271	| IOT167 |	Then you got to have like 5 9
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:52,319	| IOT167 |	Which is why a lot of
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,599	| IOT167 |	Black people fight with their advice
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:55,135	| IOT167 |	Like learning thermostats
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,439	| IOT167 |	Can I come see you know apple does not want to build
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,719	| IOT167 |	Sprite
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,231	| IOT167 |	Right
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,767	| IOT167 |	Yeah that makes sense
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,047	| IOT167 |	The only other
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:04,351	| IOT167 |	Aspect that our listeners might be interested in
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:07,935	| IOT167 |	The Apple home app which is typically on iOS devices
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:12,031	| IOT167 |	Will also be available on Mac OS 10 this fall
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:14,335	| IOT167 |	With OS 10 Mojave
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:16,127	| IOT167 |	And that should be out
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,663	| IOT167 |	What they tested for
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,199	| IOT167 |	Suspect September issue
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,735	| IOT167 |	The public beta will
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,527	| IOT167 |	Probably kick off soon so
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:23,807	| IOT167 |	You'll be able to have a home on your Mac
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:25,343	| IOT167 |	Yay
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:28,671	| IOT167 |	I could actually play with it
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,207	| IOT167 |	Without but you wouldn't get to your fence
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:36,863	| IOT167 |	No no you have Siri built into the Mac already and then you would gain access
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,143	| IOT167 |	Your back was always
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:42,495	| IOT167 |	What's a good question they did not mention that didn't talk really about
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:48,895	| IOT167 |	Remote access and hubs and all that which I was actually hoping for him and they did have a whole Apple TV bin I was like oh please
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:51,199	| IOT167 |	Suzuki DRZ way radios in a new version
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:53,247	| IOT167 |	Didn't discuss
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,015	| IOT167 |	Sub-Zero
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,551	| IOT167 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,087	| IOT167 |	So that was what was new on
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,111	| IOT167 |	WWDC
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,207	| IOT167 |	That was very muted
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,023	| IOT167 |	You know I know we weren't expecting
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:10,655	| IOT167 |	All right so let's talk about
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:12,703	| IOT167 |	Homekit is coming to a computer
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,471	| IOT167 |	Are you suppose
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,239	| IOT167 |	Pacifically a map
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,799	| IOT167 |	And Madame
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,567	| IOT167 |	Amazon
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,103	| IOT167 |	Echo assistant
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,895	| IOT167 |	Is coming to a PC
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,663	| IOT167 |	Near you
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,431	| IOT167 |	Kevin what do you think
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,247	| IOT167 |	Well I think it's
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,807	| IOT167 |	Candida have these assistants
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,831	| IOT167 |	In and around
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:33,439	| IOT167 |	Us everywhere you can have in your home and such to me this is kind of
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,207	| IOT167 |	Probably
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:39,839	| IOT167 |	Something Microsoft is not too happy about because they want Cortana and all their Windows machines
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,863	| IOT167 |	Big partnership with him
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:45,215	| IOT167 |	Exactly exactly what Amazon is taking play out of Microsoft
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,751	| IOT167 |	Display book now because they work
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:49,823	| IOT167 |	Three different odms original design manufacturers
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:50,847	| IOT167 |	PCS
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:53,151	| IOT167 |	Compound quanta in Wichita and they all
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:56,735	| IOT167 |	Create PCS for PHP sadelle's and song they build them
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:58,527	| IOT167 |	What they have is for
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,295	| IOT167 |	Actual
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:03,135	| IOT167 |	Windows PCS that have Madame a built-in
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:05,183	| IOT167 |	And this will lead
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,207	| IOT167 |	Hardware makers just
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:10,559	| IOT167 |	Work with these designs and just have Madam a integrated automatic
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:16,959	| IOT167 |	Play there's nothing they'll have to do so there is one PC and three laptops that will cover makers can choose from
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,727	| IOT167 |	To build off of
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:18,495	| IOT167 |	I will have matinee
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,799	| IOT167 |	I think it's good I just I don't think
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:25,919	| IOT167 |	Yeah because they were trying to make this weird fine line that that I
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:28,735	| IOT167 |	Originally think was strange between
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,759	| IOT167 |	Matinee
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,527	| IOT167 |	Cortana
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:32,575	| IOT167 |	And Cortana was for business and Padme was for home
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,879	| IOT167 |	But even figuring out what was what
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,391	| IOT167 |	Didn't make sense
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,975	| IOT167 |	This would be a more Nativity
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:41,279	| IOT167 |	Screen Sunday Cortana asking
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:43,327	| IOT167 |	Padme to do something you know s
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:46,655	| IOT167 |	One assistant asking another so this would probably be a better
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,935	| IOT167 |	Amazon experience
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:48,703	| IOT167 |	What would help
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,215	| IOT167 |	I would hope
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,263	| IOT167 |	One of these days
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:53,311	| IOT167 |	You know what these are just
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:55,359	| IOT167 |	Again neither like design
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,639	| IOT167 |	Reference models
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,663	| IOT167 |	So
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:03,295	| IOT167 |	It's going to be up to Acer vs. Lenovo HP Dell etcetera to decide if they're going to use these
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:06,879	| IOT167 |	Reference models are not so I don't know if or when we'll see these
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:08,671	| IOT167 |	All right
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:09,951	| IOT167 |	And
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:10,975	| IOT167 |	In the
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:12,255	| IOT167 |	Maybe more exciting
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,791	| IOT167 |	World of crazy connect
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:16,095	| IOT167 |	The gadgets you can buy you found
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,119	| IOT167 |	A sensor that
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,423	| IOT167 |	I've seen it
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,447	| IOT167 |	You thought it was
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:22,495	| IOT167 |	Yeah we have seen
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:25,567	| IOT167 |	This type of sensors before this is a Kickstarter project
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:29,407	| IOT167 |	It has 8 days to go it's only halfway to its goal and if it's
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:33,503	| IOT167 |	Not funded all the way it's not happening it's one of those All or Nothing which is actually good
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:39,391	| IOT167 |	If it doesn't happen if you back that you'll get your money back this is called the oval and it's actually the second generation over
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:42,719	| IOT167 |	Basically it's a small 5 in 1 sensor
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:45,535	| IOT167 |	It can measure or tell you about motion
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:47,071	| IOT167 |	Light temperature
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:52,447	| IOT167 |	Water or humidity no video camera no microphone Rising like that there's no subscription fees
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:54,495	| IOT167 |	You just kind of stick these anywhere you want
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:12:01,151	| IOT167 |	There's a little Gateway device of these things can talk to each other before the show station I were comparing pricing to
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:07,039	| IOT167 |	Something similar I think it was the notion you would said yes it's the notion sensors there
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,319	| IOT167 |	Colorado company
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:11,903	| IOT167 |	You can find them on Amazon or at their website getting ocean.com and
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:14,207	| IOT167 |	Pizza been out for a while they're just circular sensors that
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:15,743	| IOT167 |	To measure a bunch of
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:16,255	| IOT167 |	Different stuff temp
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:17,791	| IOT167 |	Humidity water
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:21,887	| IOT167 |	They don't measure light but they have a decibel tracker so they can measure things like
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,679	| IOT167 |	Glass breaking in that sort of
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:30,591	| IOT167 |	Right you know if you already have a smart home setup these are probably not for you I would say these are in fact
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:34,943	| IOT167 |	Ovals campaign is targeting apartment renters Airbnb host
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,479	| IOT167 |	In a roommate at College Maybe
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,015	| IOT167 |	Pricing isn't
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:41,087	| IOT167 |	Terrible you can literally get one sensor
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,367	| IOT167 |	And one
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,927	| IOT167 |	Gateway for 99 bucks
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:48,511	| IOT167 |	Join two sensors it's 129 price goes up from there
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:52,351	| IOT167 |	It was interesting to me I mean that they run on a coin cell battery so you don't
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:57,471	| IOT167 |	I have to really worry about that for about 6 months you just stick them anywhere you want there's double-sided tape included
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:59,775	| IOT167 |	Is subscription fees there's an app for
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,055	| IOT167 |	For IOS and Android
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:06,175	| IOT167 |	You obviously get push notifications but it can also send text or even emails
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,967	| IOT167 |	If you'd rather get notified of things that weigh
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:09,759	| IOT167 |	Integration wise
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:11,807	| IOT167 |	Currently only with if this then that
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:17,439	| IOT167 |	They are looking at homekit certification but they are saying upfront you know it's kind of costly so may not have
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,487	| IOT167 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:20,511	| IOT167 |	Yes and
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:21,791	| IOT167 |	Notion the other
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:25,631	| IOT167 |	Desensitize most reminded me of this is an Kevin the one that came and found us a novel
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:29,215	| IOT167 |	Do not have an if
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:32,031	| IOT167 |	Integration they do work with nest
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:32,799	| IOT167 |	So
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,591	| IOT167 |	You know you can actually like
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:36,895	| IOT167 |	Detect temperature and then turn on your
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:37,663	| IOT167 |	Air conditioner
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,431	| IOT167 |	Yay
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:40,223	| IOT167 |	That's where they are
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:41,759	| IOT167 |	Let's talk about kind of
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:42,783	| IOT167 |	Some fun little bit
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:43,551	| IOT167 |	7 News
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:49,183	| IOT167 |	Sweet got Lenovo smart display that Kevin and I are both really excited about these are the Google Assistant smart display
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,743	| IOT167 |	Well I can
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,255	| IOT167 |	Pre-order it now
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,279	| IOT167 |	Doesn't shift
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:57,119	| IOT167 |	Well I'm going to make it even sadder because
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,399	| IOT167 |	The LINQ
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,935	| IOT167 |	Was working before the show
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:00,959	| IOT167 |	And now
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:03,263	| IOT167 |	Page is down for pre-orders
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:08,383	| IOT167 |	Sounds to me like in this is B&H Photo
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:13,247	| IOT167 |	Yeah sounds to me like that went up a little early and they
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:16,063	| IOT167 |	Gave away the shipping date or rough
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:20,927	| IOT167 |	Estimation of when it will be available which was September 3rd so I don't know
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,463	| IOT167 |	What the deal is but
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,999	| IOT167 |	We haven't heard squat about this
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:25,279	| IOT167 |	Mustang shipping
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,815	| IOT167 |	What is the first time in the summer
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:27,839	| IOT167 |	So
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,375	| IOT167 |	Technically
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:30,399	| IOT167 |	Now it's right after
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:34,239	| IOT167 |	It's still summer so yeah
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:37,055	| IOT167 |	All right you know I can't hold it could be
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:40,895	| IOT167 |	This is not just a standard smart display running on Android wasn't this
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:42,431	| IOT167 |	We later found out Android things
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:44,991	| IOT167 |	That could be part of the issue
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:47,551	| IOT167 |	Find
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:48,319	| IOT167 |	Let's get business
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:49,599	| IOT167 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:52,159	| IOT167 |	New iot core services
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,463	| IOT167 |	What are they Kevin
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:15:01,375	| IOT167 |	This will make you happy because they already announced the iot core products so the services at their nothing today provides
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:05,727	| IOT167 |	10 years of Windows OS support through the windows long-term service Channel
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:06,495	| IOT167 |	And
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,775	| IOT167 |	Obviously that means you have
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:14,175	| IOT167 |	Your devices will be support for 10 years but also if you're using that release you won't get feature updates
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:18,783	| IOT167 |	But that's not a bad thing because that will let you focus on stability if your device make
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:22,879	| IOT167 |	So that's good in this is actually super important in the industrial
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,415	| IOT167 |	Where patches
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:25,183	| IOT167 |	Can break like
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:25,695	| IOT167 |	Everything
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:29,279	| IOT167 |	If your patching a piece of equipment that's like
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,815	| IOT167 |	Gear manufacturing processes
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,327	| IOT167 |	Dependent on
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:32,863	| IOT167 |	You know you're looking at
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:37,727	| IOT167 |	Millions hundreds of thousands of dollars of lost Revenue if your line goes down I mean this is
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:44,639	| IOT167 |	For most of us in the consumer world were like I'd hate to have this but a lot of these big Industrial
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:46,175	| IOT167 |	Companies are Enterprises that
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:46,943	| IOT167 |	Epcot
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:48,223	| IOT167 |	A lot of things set up on
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:54,623	| IOT167 |	Or if your medical device manufacturer you don't want it like sending update to the FDA this kind of stability is
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:55,135	| IOT167 |	Really am
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:57,951	| IOT167 |	In Microsoft gets it
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,231	| IOT167 |	This is why
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:00,511	| IOT167 |	Azure cloud is doing
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:02,815	| IOT167 |	Sowell in Microsoft iot services
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,375	| IOT167 |	I wish that they had
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:11,775	| IOT167 |	More customers to talk about they still using the same reference customers in Sam George at Microsoft had told me
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:15,615	| IOT167 |	This is partially because a lot of customers are trying things out and if it works
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:17,663	| IOT167 |	It's so good for them that they don't want to share
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:20,223	| IOT167 |	And if they're kind of like I don't know what to do with it yet
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:21,503	| IOT167 |	Tentative
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,783	| IOT167 |	Stan pilot Purgatory for
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:29,695	| IOT167 |	I agree with you but I did notice I was very happy to see it that one of those customers using this
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,463	| IOT167 |	Misty robotics
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:33,023	| IOT167 |	Yes yes they are they were at build
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:33,535	| IOT167 |	Actually that's where I
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:35,583	| IOT167 |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:42,751	| IOT167 |	Two other things with this slick or Services they it works with Microsoft device Update Center so that way
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:48,895	| IOT167 |	Is your centralized way too controlling and send out updates as needed you can even Target a small group of devices
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:52,223	| IOT167 |	Testing updates that's good and then they have device
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:53,759	| IOT167 |	Health attestation
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:58,111	| IOT167 |	So you can enable the trustworthiness of a device at boot time
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:00,927	| IOT167 |	Free trusted iot system so that is awesome
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:01,695	| IOT167 |	That is
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,207	| IOT167 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,231	| IOT167 |	Also
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:05,535	| IOT167 |	From Redmond Microsoft announced
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:07,583	| IOT167 |	This week that they are
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:10,399	| IOT167 |	They don't have a name for the service yet but
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,167	| IOT167 |	We'll call it
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,447	| IOT167 |	Spatial intelligence
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:15,775	| IOT167 |	So understanding of where things are in a building
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,823	| IOT167 |	So they released this
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,103	| IOT167 |	They actually showed off
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:21,663	| IOT167 |	Kind of a sense of this at build
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,431	| IOT167 |	A few weeks ago
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:27,551	| IOT167 |	When they did a conference room demo in the conference room understood who was in the room
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:29,087	| IOT167 |	Based on their ID that
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:30,367	| IOT167 |	And kind of
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:32,671	| IOT167 |	Where other people were in the building
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,951	| IOT167 |	So that was pretty cool
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:39,839	| IOT167 |	This is the service that enables this and it can do things like detect occupancy it can understand
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:44,959	| IOT167 |	If you have tags on furniture it can understand what Furnitures and what rooms and
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,495	| IOT167 |	All kind of
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:49,823	| IOT167 |	It understand how people move around the building and interact with
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:50,591	| IOT167 |	With the space
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:52,127	| IOT167 |	This is going to freak a lot of pee
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:54,175	| IOT167 |	If your employers like
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:55,199	| IOT167 |	Hey
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:57,247	| IOT167 |	Why aren't you in the office more
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:02,367	| IOT167 |	Do you spend all your time at the bathroom or at the water cooler that might
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,135	| IOT167 |	You know you might be like
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:08,255	| IOT167 |	But the goal is to understand how buildings are used
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:12,863	| IOT167 |	Where stuff is if employer needs it you know you're like I did the paper cutter
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:13,631	| IOT167 |	Where is it
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,655	| IOT167 |	We had this issue
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,423	| IOT167 |	Newsroom speech
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:20,543	| IOT167 |	From home person I love this
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:25,407	| IOT167 |	No, I'll never be monitored
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:25,919	| IOT167 |	Is my points
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:28,991	| IOT167 |	Well actually so you used to have
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:33,599	| IOT167 |	Used to have this idea when we were at gigaom together where you wanted to tie your chair
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:37,183	| IOT167 |	Your butt being in your chair to your I am status
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:40,511	| IOT167 |	Yeah see people would know when I'm available when I'm not
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,535	| IOT167 |	So you can do said yes
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:50,495	| IOT167 |	I was being facetious there's a lot of cool applications for the Senate when I was at Google we worked on the smart office
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:51,775	| IOT167 |	Projects in spare time
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:52,799	| IOT167 |	This is very cool stuff
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:55,615	| IOT167 |	Yes and her customers using it are Steelcase
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:57,151	| IOT167 |	And CBRE
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,431	| IOT167 |	Which is a
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:59,455	| IOT167 |	Huge
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:00,479	| IOT167 |	CB Richard Ellis
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:02,783	| IOT167 |	It's just a bunch of
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:04,063	| IOT167 |	Just a bunch of letters
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,087	| IOT167 |	Real estate
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:10,463	| IOT167 |	I'm a little surprised that maybe they are using this but I'm a little surprised that Microsoft
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:16,607	| IOT167 |	Seems to have abandoned all the technology that it Acquired and invested in with the Xbox Kinect
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:19,423	| IOT167 |	Yeah so they actually in the
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,191	| IOT167 |	Gemo
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:25,055	| IOT167 |	And this was a big thing at Microsoft build they had you know where the polycom speaker
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:26,079	| IOT167 |	Conference Center was
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:29,151	| IOT167 |	Cone and I wonder if
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:29,919	| IOT167 |	The connect
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,967	| IOT167 |	Hardware could be in the cold
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:33,503	| IOT167 |	Everyone was like what's in the cold
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,015	| IOT167 |	Nobody knows
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,295	| IOT167 |	So
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,575	| IOT167 |	They may not have a band
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:40,415	| IOT167 |	We'll just have to see where it
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:42,207	| IOT167 |	I mean they would be silly not to
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:42,719	| IOT167 |	Incorporate some
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,047	| IOT167 |	Pretty high bandwidth
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,583	| IOT167 |	Data so
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,375	| IOT167 |	True Faith at one point
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,655	| IOT167 |	Maybe
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:52,191	| IOT167 |	I mean I have to use all of the
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,983	| IOT167 |	Sensors you know the cameras and such
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,519	| IOT167 |	Time to do what they need to do
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:58,079	| IOT167 |	I remember after I bought the Kinect
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,871	| IOT167 |	They actually had an SDK
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:03,455	| IOT167 |	Kinect SDK for Windows and I was using it to kind of
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:09,855	| IOT167 |	Create a way to turn my lights on when I walked in my office when The Connect saw me and will not miss this goes back quite a ways
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:12,927	| IOT167 |	But all the pieces of the puzzle were there
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,231	| IOT167 |	Make a list
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:15,743	| IOT167 |	Who knows
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:19,071	| IOT167 |	And finally
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:21,887	| IOT167 |	Find a little bit of news Sierra Wireless has
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:23,679	| IOT167 |	Launched a new version of it
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:24,447	| IOT167 |	Mango
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:25,727	| IOT167 |	Open source
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:26,495	| IOT167 |	Hardware platform
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:29,055	| IOT167 |	For industrial iot
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:29,823	| IOT167 |	And so
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:32,383	| IOT167 |	The mango yellow is the new
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,431	| IOT167 |	Device it is a super sensor
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,479	| IOT167 |	The mango yellow has
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:39,551	| IOT167 |	14 sensors and actuators on board
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,063	| IOT167 |	Which is
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:42,111	| IOT167 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,671	| IOT167 |	And it will function with
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:50,559	| IOT167 |	A wide variety of cellular-based low-power wide area networks such as cat M1 and nb-iot
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:53,887	| IOT167 |	So this joins the mango
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:55,423	| IOT167 |	Red and green Prada
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,191	| IOT167 |	That are out
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:59,263	| IOT167 |	And basically it's just got
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:00,031	| IOT167 |	More sensor
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:05,407	| IOT167 |	This is used by companies who want to try to build and prototype
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,687	| IOT167 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,991	| IOT167 |	Business processes
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:13,599	| IOT167 |	So you can buy a couple of these Papa around your manufacturing facility if you want and see like
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:15,135	| IOT167 |	What does it make sense to measure here
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,696	| IOT167 |	That's what these are
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,464	| IOT167 |	Pretty cool
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:19,488	| IOT167 |	And
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,024	| IOT167 |	The mango yellow
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:25,376	| IOT167 |	Is not going to be available though until May 2019
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,216	| IOT167 |	And now
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:33,312	| IOT167 |	Kevin and I are going to share things that we have spent our own money on
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,896	| IOT167 |	You spent more
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:42,016	| IOT167 |	I spent a lot more so I spent $99 on an aware glow this is a
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:48,416	| IOT167 |	Really interesting products that I've actually been looking at this company that used to make it bigger one there's a new one coming so the
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:49,440	| IOT167 |	Old one is being discounted
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:52,768	| IOT167 |	It was like $200 now it looks like
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:53,280	| IOT167 |	It might be on sale
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:58,656	| IOT167 |	If you get one but you may not want to get one cuz there's a new one coming out or you can spend
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,936	| IOT167 |	$99
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:00,704	| IOT167 |	And get
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:02,240	| IOT167 |	The glow which is what I did
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,776	| IOT167 |	It measures
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:06,336	| IOT167 |	Chemicals in the air so vocs in the air
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,104	| IOT167 |	It measures
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,384	| IOT167 |	Humidity
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,408	| IOT167 |	Temperature
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,944	| IOT167 |	And also carbon dioxide
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,480	| IOT167 |	And
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:17,856	| IOT167 |	I got it because I wanted to test the air quality in the Portables in my daughter's school
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:22,208	| IOT167 |	Because she has classes in them and she says it's so hot and stuffy
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:23,744	| IOT167 |	And I was trying to get data to like
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:24,768	| IOT167 |	Understand
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:26,048	| IOT167 |	How hot and stuffy
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:28,608	| IOT167 |	And the school allowed that which is awesome
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:31,680	| IOT167 |	He did now I had a hard time connecting it to their Network
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:33,728	| IOT167 |	So this is a Wi-Fi product
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:37,824	| IOT167 |	Power products they just pop it in and the coolest thing is they have a
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:38,336	| IOT167 |	Pass-through
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:39,872	| IOT167 |	Plug so
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:41,664	| IOT167 |	You do take up an outlet
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,688	| IOT167 |	When you plug this in
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:44,992	| IOT167 |	But you can plug other things in it and
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,272	| IOT167 |	Also acts as a smart
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:48,832	| IOT167 |	Plug even cooler is
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:51,392	| IOT167 |	In the app you can actually pick
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:53,184	| IOT167 |	Like if you plug in a fan
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:54,720	| IOT167 |	Or a humidifier
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:56,256	| IOT167 |	Dehumidifier
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,280	| IOT167 |	Or in my case
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:58,304	| IOT167 |	Air purifier
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:03,168	| IOT167 |	You tell it what you plugged in and it will automatically turn that device on
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:04,192	| IOT167 |	When it's needed
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:07,264	| IOT167 |	So if the temperature gets too high and it knows there's a fan plugged in
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,544	| IOT167 |	Intuit it'll automatically turn the fan
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:09,824	| IOT167 |	I think that's
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:12,640	| IOT167 |	This is basically in
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:16,480	| IOT167 |	This is good for anybody who's got who like lives in a New York City Apartment
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:16,992	| IOT167 |	Or has
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,528	| IOT167 |	Window air conditioning
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:21,088	| IOT167 |	You can actually take your old window air conditioning unit
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:23,648	| IOT167 |	Plug it into this and tell it hey
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:25,952	| IOT167 |	When the temperature gets above 90 degrees
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:26,976	| IOT167 |	Turn the sucker rod
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:27,488	| IOT167 |	Or
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,024	| IOT167 |	If you don't want that to happen cuz
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:30,816	| IOT167 |	At work all day you can also sets
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:33,632	| IOT167 |	I think it's a really nice mode
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:38,496	| IOT167 |	I'm not 100% sure it does not tell me how many parts
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,288	| IOT167 |	Vermillion is measuring for the boc
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:41,824	| IOT167 |	Short interest
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:42,592	| IOT167 |	There's a lot of
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:46,944	| IOT167 |	How sensitive these really are but it is very good for noticing
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:50,272	| IOT167 |	That's what I have to ask
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:53,344	| IOT167 |	What was the trend in the classroom
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:57,440	| IOT167 |	So because I had a hard time getting it on the Wi-Fi network I never actually got in
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,256	| IOT167 |	But I can tell you
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:01,536	| IOT167 |	It's right now in my car
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:02,816	| IOT167 |	Kitchen when I cook
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,608	| IOT167 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,632	| IOT167 |	I really should leave Italy
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:07,168	| IOT167 |	That is what yeah
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:08,960	| IOT167 |	I know
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:12,288	| IOT167 |	I can save you $99 and just tell you to do that
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:14,848	| IOT167 |	Fair
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:18,432	| IOT167 |	I should also say you can set preferences if this is kind of fun
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:23,040	| IOT167 |	It will tell you your air is bad with a little glowing light on the device or it will also send you a new
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:24,064	| IOT167 |	Vacation if you will
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,392	| IOT167 |	But you can set different priorities
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:30,208	| IOT167 |	With you basically tell the device
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:30,976	| IOT167 |	Like allergies aren't
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:33,280	| IOT167 |	To me so it will tell you
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:35,328	| IOT167 |	It's a little bit more sensitive to
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:35,840	| IOT167 |	Humidity
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:38,656	| IOT167 |	Chemicals if you want productivity
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,448	| IOT167 |	Carbon dioxide in the air
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:41,728	| IOT167 |	Becomes
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:42,496	| IOT167 |	Born critic
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:45,824	| IOT167 |	So I think it's a really fun product
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:47,616	| IOT167 |	For $99
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:50,944	| IOT167 |	They've got a promotion right now going on Spring 10
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:52,224	| IOT167 |	And then you get like
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:53,504	| IOT167 |	10% off which again
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:54,784	| IOT167 |	Huge but nice
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,832	| IOT167 |	I like it
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:57,856	| IOT167 |	So smart plugs
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,880	| IOT167 |	Also tracks my hair
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:04,000	| IOT167 |	Very nice sell it works with a bunch of other devices like Madam a
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:04,512	| IOT167 |	And I think
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:06,560	| IOT167 |	Hey
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:10,144	| IOT167 |	So I spent a whopping $2.99
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:10,912	| IOT167 |	As for my
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:12,448	| IOT167 |	Hey Big Spender
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:15,520	| IOT167 |	Yeah but I had to I had to have this
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:16,288	| IOT167 |	I'll tell you why
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:18,080	| IOT167 |	Because I couldn't believe it was true
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:18,848	| IOT167 |	Seriously
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:20,128	| IOT167 |	I found an app
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,664	| IOT167 |	For my Apple watch
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:23,968	| IOT167 |	But apparently allegedly
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:24,736	| IOT167 |	Reportedly
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,272	| IOT167 |	Put some anime
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:26,784	| IOT167 |	On my wrist
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:30,112	| IOT167 |	I'm thinking no way Applewood never allowed
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:32,160	| IOT167 |	Just can't work not possible
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:32,928	| IOT167 |	Turn off
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:33,952	| IOT167 |	It works
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:35,232	| IOT167 |	I'm not going to say it works
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:39,584	| IOT167 |	The way you would hope and I'll explain why in a second but it does work so
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:43,168	| IOT167 |	The name of the app is voice in a can
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:49,056	| IOT167 |	And maybe we can put a link in the show notes not just maybe to the app in appstore but also to a video demo
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,336	| IOT167 |	Tattoo developer
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:51,104	| IOT167 |	Chose
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:51,872	| IOT167 |	It works
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:54,688	| IOT167 |	Basically this is really clever
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:26:00,832	| IOT167 |	You open the app on your watch and I have a complication on my watch that is a shortcut to it so I have to tap the watch obviously
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:02,368	| IOT167 |	And then I also have to
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,904	| IOT167 |	Tap the screen to
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:05,184	| IOT167 |	Tell the watch to start listening
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:06,976	| IOT167 |	So now I say my
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:08,256	| IOT167 |	I don't have to say Madam a I just
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,560	| IOT167 |	And I say my command
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:16,704	| IOT167 |	That information that sound bite is then sent to Amazon servers just like any other Echo device
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:20,032	| IOT167 |	And she responds and does or does whatever I've commanded
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:21,568	| IOT167 |	You know just like you would to an echo
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:26,688	| IOT167 |	So there's a little bit of lag in terms of the back-and-forth communication
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:28,480	| IOT167 |	And the fact you have to tap the screen
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:32,576	| IOT167 |	But it does work now and that it's not unbearable lag I mean it's just
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:35,392	| IOT167 |	Not as quick as using an actual Amazon product so
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:39,488	| IOT167 |	I'm impressed it does what it says it does and I did not think it would
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:40,512	| IOT167 |	That is rare in the
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:43,328	| IOT167 |	Yes very true
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:45,376	| IOT167 |	And now it is
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:47,936	| IOT167 |	Alright listener hotline
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:49,216	| IOT167 |	And guys
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:50,240	| IOT167 |	Andros
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:53,568	| IOT167 |	We are still doing a giveaway I am giving away my
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:56,896	| IOT167 |	SI thermostat
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:59,456	| IOT167 |	So this is not the cool looking ecobee that
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:04,320	| IOT167 |	And if they launched in response to Nest but it is a perfectly good
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,600	| IOT167 |	Connect a thermostat
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:09,696	| IOT167 |	It talks to Madame a and Google assistant and has a lovely ecobee app
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,464	| IOT167 |	So you'll
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:12,000	| IOT167 |	You got all the benefits in just
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:13,536	| IOT167 |	An older model thermostat
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:18,144	| IOT167 |	So that is what we are giving away if you leave a voicemail at 5 1/2
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:19,936	| IOT167 |	62374
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:20,448	| IOT167 |	2/4
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:25,056	| IOT167 |	And this week's voicemail comes to us from Dan in Charlotte
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:26,848	| IOT167 |	Hi Stacy and Kevin
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:28,384	| IOT167 |	This is dance with Charlotte
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:30,432	| IOT167 |	I got to be honest I am really struggling
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,200	| IOT167 |	Smart lighting
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:32,992	| IOT167 |	You both know a lot about the space
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:34,272	| IOT167 |	Stacy particular seems
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:35,552	| IOT167 |	Smart lighting
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:36,320	| IOT167 |	Chinato
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:38,880	| IOT167 |	I've thus far stayed away from Smart bulbs
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:41,952	| IOT167 |	Because balls are expensive and they put the burden on my wife and Young
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,720	| IOT167 |	Kids
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:44,000	| IOT167 |	Not to touch the wall switches
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:47,840	| IOT167 |	SmartThings user I've already installed about 5
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:48,608	| IOT167 |	GE smart
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,888	| IOT167 |	Which is around the house
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:53,728	| IOT167 |	Delete my basic GE smart switches I can schedule lights to go on and off
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:54,752	| IOT167 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:56,800	| IOT167 |	Turn on off groups of Lights
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:58,592	| IOT167 |	For example when we're going to bed
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:00,384	| IOT167 |	I am planning out a bunch more switches
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:02,944	| IOT167 |	And so I wonder what I'm missing out on
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:04,736	| IOT167 |	Should I honestly consider smart bulb
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:06,784	| IOT167 |	With Lutron caseta
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:07,552	| IOT167 |	For switches
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:09,344	| IOT167 |	Be much better for me than my tea
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,112	| IOT167 |	East Witches
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:11,904	| IOT167 |	What else would I want to
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:12,928	| IOT167 |	Regularly do
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:14,976	| IOT167 |	Gianna current GE smart
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:15,744	| IOT167 |	Switch features
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:18,048	| IOT167 |	Thanks very much for the recommendation
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:19,840	| IOT167 |	Oh damn
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:26,240	| IOT167 |	I kind of wish I knew a little bit more about your light switch but we are going to guess that it is the GE Z-Wave either
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:26,752	| IOT167 |	Either the demo
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:29,312	| IOT167 |	Switch or the on-off switch
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:31,360	| IOT167 |	If it is the on-off switch
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,640	| IOT167 |	I'm going to recommend you go for
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:33,664	| IOT167 |	Dimmer switches
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:35,712	| IOT167 |	I am not going to recommend you go for
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:36,480	| IOT167 |	Car bulbs
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:37,504	| IOT167 |	Unless you are doing
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:39,296	| IOT167 |	Actual
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:40,064	| IOT167 |	Lamps
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:41,344	| IOT167 |	Between lamps and bulbs
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:42,112	| IOT167 |	Perfectly except
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:44,928	| IOT167 |	But in terms of getting more
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:48,256	| IOT167 |	Out of switches if you are happy with those switches
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:50,048	| IOT167 |	Then I see keep going
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:52,608	| IOT167 |	I will say by switch of choice
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:54,400	| IOT167 |	Is the Lutron caseta
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:55,936	| IOT167 |	Only because
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:56,704	| IOT167 |	Cuz
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:57,728	| IOT167 |	With the Lutron
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:59,776	| IOT167 |	Hub they will work with homekit
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:00,544	| IOT167 |	And
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:01,824	| IOT167 |	A bunch of other
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:02,592	| IOT167 |	Site Google
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:04,384	| IOT167 |	Padme SmartThings
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:06,432	| IOT167 |	Wink
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:12,064	| IOT167 |	Yes so if that sort of like level of future-proofing and interoperability is important to you
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:12,832	| IOT167 |	Then
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:14,112	| IOT167 |	Yes gopher
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:20,512	| IOT167 |	That when you sell your house I would recommend in that case you sell the Lutron caseta Hub with it and then they
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:21,280	| IOT167 |	Nature's can do it
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:22,048	| IOT167 |	What they want
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:23,072	| IOT167 |	With the current
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:25,120	| IOT167 |	GE things you probably
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:28,448	| IOT167 |	It's going to be hard to convince someone to use SmartThings you know what I'm saying
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:28,960	| IOT167 |	It's a little tough
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:33,568	| IOT167 |	But those are really the only thing certain Kevin can you think of
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:35,616	| IOT167 |	Things that he's missing out on by
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:37,152	| IOT167 |	Going or sticking with it
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:38,432	| IOT167 |	GE
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:41,248	| IOT167 |	Either dimmers I would go with dimmers over the switch
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:43,552	| IOT167 |	Right because that way
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:50,464	| IOT167 |	Ciq the bulb route because I do lamps more than overhead lights and such in my family is trained that they'll get a small
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:52,768	| IOT167 |	Small electric shock if they touch any switches in the house
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:57,376	| IOT167 |	I can't think of anything the only other thing I would consider and I don't know if
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:59,168	| IOT167 |	The investment is worth it
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:04,288	| IOT167 |	We talked about a couple of switches and light sets that will kind of create the scenes for you
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:07,360	| IOT167 |	Things like new
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:09,152	| IOT167 |	Citracal that's the one
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:12,224	| IOT167 |	Noon does an in this is better for open floor plan
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:15,040	| IOT167 |	Plants this is not good for like individual rooms but
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:16,064	| IOT167 |	If you uninstall
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:18,112	| IOT167 |	And actually someone else will come out in
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:19,648	| IOT167 |	Install a bunch of noon switches for
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:25,280	| IOT167 |	Then they create they have a lighting designer whose pre-configured a bunch of options like movie time
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:28,096	| IOT167 |	This is what all the lights should do
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:28,608	| IOT167 |	Movie time
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,912	| IOT167 |	Some other things to think about
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:33,728	| IOT167 |	Lutron bought a company called catcher that also does this
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:36,288	| IOT167 |	So we may see that coming to luchon
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:37,568	| IOT167 |	Baby
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:39,360	| IOT167 |	I'm guessing maybe it would be nice but
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:39,872	| IOT167 |	I'm not holding my breath
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:43,456	| IOT167 |	And then only other thing that you might want is
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:47,296	| IOT167 |	There's a couple light switches that have like motion sensors
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:54,208	| IOT167 |	And ecobee4 example has a $99 light switch that has a motion sensor and Madame Abe
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:54,976	| IOT167 |	Belton
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:56,512	| IOT167 |	If that's appealing to you
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:59,072	| IOT167 |	Pretty expensive if you're going to replace a bunch of them
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:00,608	| IOT167 |	I don't know if I'd go there
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:02,144	| IOT167 |	But you got those do exist
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:04,704	| IOT167 |	And I couldn't help solve the whole
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:06,240	| IOT167 |	Use the switch or not use the switch
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:09,312	| IOT167 |	Issue because you got the motion sensor and they're granted
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,104	| IOT167 |	A little more than two times
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:12,128	| IOT167 |	The price of
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:13,920	| IOT167 |	The ge's that you have but
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:16,224	| IOT167 |	You know when you get mad at me so
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:19,552	| IOT167 |	Easy way to put an assistant in a room without buying another
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:21,344	| IOT167 |	Device itself another Standalone device

EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:10,560	| IOT167 |	On the screen it was a really surreal in
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,864	| IOT167 |	Cool experience talk to me about
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:14,912	| IOT167 |	That performance in how it all came together

EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:26,688	| IOT167 |	And we connected about a year ago
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:27,968	| IOT167 |	They help
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:29,504	| IOT167 |	As the first time I Tibet
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:30,272	| IOT167 |	Try the glass

EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:35,392	| IOT167 |	Stances that kind of stuff
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:37,440	| IOT167 |	It's kind of been in the back of my mind
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:42,048	| IOT167 |	Do something as an extension of the music that I could use
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:43,328	| IOT167 |	Again about
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:45,120	| IOT167 |	She wants to know something and
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:47,680	| IOT167 |	We had this amazing Workshop actually
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:51,008	| IOT167 |	Basically with all these Amazing Ideas that we want to try and
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:52,288	| IOT167 |	What's the one thing
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:54,336	| IOT167 |	Right now
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:55,104	| IOT167 |	They just pets
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:56,640	| IOT167 |	Cool suits
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,968	| IOT167 |	I'm basically
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:03,552	| IOT167 |	I was like okay well maybe I can perform in this week
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:05,856	| IOT167 |	Something we can create
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:06,880	| IOT167 |	Kind of surreal
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:08,928	| IOT167 |	Experience
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:11,744	| IOT167 |	Into my into my songs and which song I wanted
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:13,024	| IOT167 |	Performance and
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:14,304	| IOT167 |	The bed sometimes
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:15,328	| IOT167 |	Smart Switch
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:19,680	| IOT167 |	It's credit personal songs to me it's with I wrote it just after my grandmother passed away
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:23,776	| IOT167 |	Then when I certainly went into a really lunch time
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:25,312	| IOT167 |	Which is why
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:27,104	| IOT167 |	Oh there's my eye
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:30,176	| IOT167 |	Because I deal with bipolar disorder and
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:31,200	| IOT167 |	Carnival
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:31,712	| IOT167 |	Spirit animal
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:34,016	| IOT167 |	Polar bear with dance
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:35,552	| IOT167 |	Different theme
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:39,648	| IOT167 |	Sorry that was a really great team
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:45,792	| IOT167 |	Fugees my vision I suppose so I gave them the conception they kind of morphed
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:47,840	| IOT167 |	We filmed in that are we feeling
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:49,120	| IOT167 |	At a club
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:51,680	| IOT167 |	Onion
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:52,960	| IOT167 |	Lovely experience
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:58,592	| IOT167 |	Came out so you guys I'll play a little snippet of the song for you and a link to a video of
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:00,896	| IOT167 |	Parts of the performance in the show notes in
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:01,664	| IOT167 |	In case you
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,176	| IOT167 |	Want to see
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:20,096	| IOT167 |	Alright so
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:21,632	| IOT167 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:23,168	| IOT167 |	You as an artist
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:25,472	| IOT167 |	What do you do what do you focus on
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:28,544	| IOT167 |	And then we'll talk about how you think about bringing technology
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:33,664	| IOT167 |	I mean I know it's been a musician since I was quite young I played the trumpet
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:36,480	| IOT167 |	So many years and then black moose more and Chip quiet
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:37,760	| IOT167 |	Japan
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:39,040	| IOT167 |	And then now finally on
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:40,320	| IOT167 |	Play music
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,856	| IOT167 |	AnnaSophia code Ableton Live
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:43,904	| IOT167 |	Which is really intuitive
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,696	| IOT167 |	It software actually
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:47,488	| IOT167 |	Because you can pretty much orchestrate
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:49,024	| IOT167 |	As many sounds
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:49,536	| IOT167 |	Lively
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:51,328	| IOT167 |	Kind of things
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:54,400	| IOT167 |	Your software to my music so it can be quite emojis
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:54,912	| IOT167 |	I love chicken
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:57,216	| IOT167 |	Technology
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:58,496	| IOT167 |	Has the potential
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:00,032	| IOT167 |	In a creative way to be
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:01,824	| IOT167 |	Really magical
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:03,872	| IOT167 |	So then let's talk about
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:06,432	| IOT167 |	This suit for example that was using lotion
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:06,944	| IOT167 |	Capture
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,992	| IOT167 |	Create this VR experience
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:14,112	| IOT167 |	And you have this idea for a VR elevator that I think is
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:14,880	| IOT167 |	Really interesting
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:16,160	| IOT167 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:18,720	| IOT167 |	I think it kind of came about
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:20,512	| IOT167 |	Initial Wikipedia
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:21,792	| IOT167 |	Create
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:23,072	| IOT167 |	Is that true
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:24,352	| IOT167 |	Stay so you can like
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:26,144	| IOT167 |	Choose where you want to go
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:27,424	| IOT167 |	Inside an elevator came
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:28,448	| IOT167 |	You know what shop
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:31,008	| IOT167 |	Black creatives
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:33,312	| IOT167 |	Virtual space so we can release Music Week
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:36,896	| IOT167 |	Have interviews people can go in and try instrument
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:37,664	| IOT167 |	Bavette
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:40,736	| IOT167 |	To space so I don't really really excited
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:44,064	| IOT167 |	It's something they were actually working on
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:48,928	| IOT167 |	And ideas what I'd love to do is to release my album
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:50,464	| IOT167 |	In the elevator
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:52,000	| IOT167 |	It does that make sense
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:52,512	| IOT167 |	It's a little bit
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:53,792	| IOT167 |	Big wild
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:55,584	| IOT167 |	Each floor could have
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:58,400	| IOT167 |	Find song I suppose you can like cheese
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:37:59,168	| IOT167 |	Selection
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:03,776	| IOT167 |	Maybe the top that be like a interview going on but I mean
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:05,056	| IOT167 |	Jose might Collective
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:10,432	| IOT167 |	Facilitate all different than Keurig different floors cuz I have a lot of
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:13,760	| IOT167 |	It's loud stated that IDK
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:15,040	| IOT167 |	Came out in the light wow wow
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:16,576	| IOT167 |	Have a whole system
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:21,696	| IOT167 |	And you just randomly pick a
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:25,792	| IOT167 |	The floor I mean
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:27,584	| IOT167 |	Technically that's what day would come
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:34,752	| IOT167 |	Yeah and let's talk about working and we'll get this in Spades in a moment
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:36,288	| IOT167 |	Let's talk about working with
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:37,568	| IOT167 |	Technology as an
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:38,336	| IOT167 |	Artist
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:39,360	| IOT167 |	How do you
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:44,480	| IOT167 |	I know that you're like oh I think this is need how could I use it how much do you have to collaborate with
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:45,504	| IOT167 |	Partners and what do you look
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:47,552	| IOT167 |	Yeah
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:51,136	| IOT167 |	I mean when it comes to the stuff we're able to have been using it for about 6
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:52,928	| IOT167 |	And I use it too
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:53,952	| IOT167 |	Sketch sound
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:55,232	| IOT167 |	Interscope
EDL	00:38:55,232	00:38:55,744	| IOT167 |	Sounds
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:57,792	| IOT167 |	Two different forms
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:59,584	| IOT167 |	Exemplify recorded
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:01,888	| IOT167 |	Snake like one of my Stones new country
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:03,168	| IOT167 |	Actually recorded
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:04,192	| IOT167 |	Snow
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:06,496	| IOT167 |	Steps to take on the snow and then
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:07,264	| IOT167 |	Transporter
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:08,800	| IOT167 |	Ableton
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:11,872	| IOT167 |	And I messed around with it to make it sound like a song
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:12,384	| IOT167 |	I said I do
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:16,224	| IOT167 |	Just on my own and I love doing that but I also really love
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:17,248	| IOT167 |	Clever
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:18,528	| IOT167 |	Expedition stickers
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:19,552	| IOT167 |	They add so much
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:20,832	| IOT167 |	Text Jen death
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:23,648	| IOT167 |	Cipher example my friend Looney she's
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:24,928	| IOT167 |	A trumpet player
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:26,464	| IOT167 |	Spreadable chocolate
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:27,488	| IOT167 |	And when she played
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:28,512	| IOT167 |	Ilovesukie
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:30,560	| IOT167 |	Trumpet Wild play
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:31,840	| IOT167 |	Lives
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:32,608	| IOT167 |	Stuff
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:35,680	| IOT167 |	Took sketch's real texture
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:38,752	| IOT167 |	Imitation in my feelings electronic
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:40,544	| IOT167 |	Music
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:43,104	| IOT167 |	Think she knows technical it's very like
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:48,224	| IOT167 |	Maybe a little solace in some way though just to check my banking music that actually
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:49,504	| IOT167 |	It's kind of like having an old
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:51,552	| IOT167 |	In your computer that you just
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:52,832	| IOT167 |	Launch different sounds
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:58,720	| IOT167 |	And when you're thinking about doing like these VR worlds
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:01,280	| IOT167 |	How do you sync that collaboration
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:03,840	| IOT167 |	Works do you like SketchUp
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:04,352	| IOT167 |	With someone
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:07,168	| IOT167 |	Yeah I'm not I love the idea of you
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:08,192	| IOT167 |	Eating a live animation
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:09,216	| IOT167 |	Analytics different
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:11,264	| IOT167 |	Phoenix Artisan that way
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:12,800	| IOT167 |	Visual artist salary
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:15,360	| IOT167 |	If you in mind commissioning other artists
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:18,688	| IOT167 |	She create there in floor
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:19,456	| IOT167 |	The sequence
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:20,736	| IOT167 |	Which BRS
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:23,552	| IOT167 |	The accessibility some people
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:25,856	| IOT167 |	So maybe you could be cool types
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:26,368	| IOT167 |	Estates
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:28,416	| IOT167 |	Arcade
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:29,952	| IOT167 |	You can come in and try these
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:37,632	| IOT167 |	So let's go to this concept of descent babes because this is something you are passionate about and it's
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:38,400	| IOT167 |	The unjust use
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:39,424	| IOT167 |	Talk to me about what that is
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:43,520	| IOT167 |	Since paid records about 2 years ago
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:48,128	| IOT167 |	Editor's Pitchfork Jessica Hopper
EDL	00:40:49,152	00:40:49,920	| IOT167 |	Kum & Go
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:53,248	| IOT167 |	Business ideas
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:54,016	| IOT167 |	Because
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:55,040	| IOT167 |	Traditional
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:56,832	| IOT167 |	The music industry is very
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:58,624	| IOT167 |	Enchanted
EDL	00:40:58,624	00:41:00,672	| IOT167 |	The leadership structure sounds like
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:02,208	| IOT167 |	I really want to create this
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:02,976	| IOT167 |	Collective
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:04,768	| IOT167 |	Basically of women
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:06,304	| IOT167 |	Gender diverse
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:09,632	| IOT167 |	And also I wanted to release my own album
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:13,984	| IOT167 |	And that's always been the core I think you stop sitting
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:14,752	| IOT167 |	Having
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:16,288	| IOT167 |	Dynasty of my music
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:19,872	| IOT167 |	I'm not handing it over and not losing the copyright to it and then
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:22,176	| IOT167 |	It's kind of evolved into
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:24,736	| IOT167 |	More of the collective more of a startup
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:26,784	| IOT167 |	Because I wanted to
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:27,552	| IOT167 |	Have impact
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:29,344	| IOT167 |	I wanted to change the electronic music
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:32,928	| IOT167 |	Representation is so loose women
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:38,304	| IOT167 |	Biggest scale and it stinks one of the main issues is accessibility to
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:40,608	| IOT167 |	Expensive music software
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:41,376	| IOT167 |	I think
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:42,656	| IOT167 |	United stilettos
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:43,680	| IOT167 |	Gatekeepers
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:50,080	| IOT167 |	That has many female artists because maybe they just got different biases
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:53,663	| IOT167 |	About a year ago and how and why and those are the kind of reason
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:55,967	| IOT167 |	Create
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:57,503	| IOT167 |	Can a very cool online face
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:59,039	| IOT167 |	With the funding you're trying to raise
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:02,879	| IOT167 |	You guys are going to create this online space where
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:03,647	| IOT167 |	People will have
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:05,951	| IOT167 |	Access to the discounted software
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:07,231	| IOT167 |	Yeah kind of
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:09,023	| IOT167 |	I think I was really inspired by
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:10,047	| IOT167 |	The
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:16,191	| IOT167 |	Wow
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:19,519	| IOT167 |	Revolutionize the way you GPS me to basically
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:23,103	| IOT167 |	I was discussing his concept of offering up the software
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:26,687	| IOT167 |	Time I suppose
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:27,455	| IOT167 |	Omnicef
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:31,551	| IOT167 |	It takes a long time to learn
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:32,831	| IOT167 |	I mean I had to Ableton
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:35,903	| IOT167 |	6 years before I actually bought it myself
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:40,255	| IOT167 |	Idea of like being able to share the stuff way around
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:42,815	| IOT167 |	And then just being charged with what you used
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:45,631	| IOT167 |	Taxi really cool concept
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:47,167	| IOT167 |	That could be a really
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:48,191	| IOT167 |	Cool idea where you could
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:50,239	| IOT167 |	Try it out and then you can
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:52,799	| IOT167 |	I had this idea
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:54,335	| IOT167 |	Because cost of the way such as
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:55,359	| IOT167 |	Thing that came up
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:56,639	| IOT167 |	See my research
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:57,919	| IOT167 |	As to why
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:59,455	| IOT167 |	Why you do by the software
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:03,807	| IOT167 |	I'm like well you know average and less than men
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:05,343	| IOT167 |	Gender pay Gap
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:06,111	| IOT167 |	Clean the world
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:07,903	| IOT167 |	You know women on average have more
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:09,183	| IOT167 |	Customer service
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:16,863	| IOT167 |	You know some discounts you can also do you use the platform that's the kind of
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:17,887	| IOT167 |	Thinking that I want
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:19,423	| IOT167 |	Next to me feels like it was
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:20,703	| IOT167 |	Create more impact
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:22,239	| IOT167 |	Got it
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:27,359	| IOT167 |	Okay and then the other part of this so after you got the online space you're also creating a festival
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:28,383	| IOT167 |	Correct
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:30,943	| IOT167 |	Exciting
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:32,735	| IOT167 |	Gene study
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:33,759	| IOT167 |	It's going to come from
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:35,807	| IOT167 |	Conferences check music feminist
EDL	00:43:35,807	00:43:41,183	| IOT167 |	And some of this money that the raising will go towards that and then we basically
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:43,743	| IOT167 |	Cities around the world
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:45,791	| IOT167 |	And yeah just inspire
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:48,863	| IOT167 |	Basically because yeah
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:50,655	| IOT167 |	Women have really interesting
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:53,983	| IOT167 |	Ways of approaching technology and also making using it
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:55,263	| IOT167 |	So I think it has a
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:57,823	| IOT167 |	Potential to inspire
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:59,359	| IOT167 |	Got it all right and
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:01,663	| IOT167 |	Let's talk about the blockchain because yes
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:02,175	| IOT167 |	Wouldn't
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:07,551	| IOT167 |	After the conference when we went out to dinner we were all very excited about blockchain
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:12,671	| IOT167 |	And I keep talking about
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:15,999	| IOT167 |	Have you thought of ways to use it and music
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:16,767	| IOT167 |	Seem like they might
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:19,327	| IOT167 |	I know you Imogen Heap
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:20,607	| IOT167 |	She's an amazing artist
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:23,167	| IOT167 |	How do you
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:23,935	| IOT167 |	Create transaction
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:28,031	| IOT167 |	Assess streaming cost because the way I see it
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:30,335	| IOT167 |	Have their own
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:31,359	| IOT167 |	Justin on the Block
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:33,407	| IOT167 |	We can see exactly how many
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:34,175	| IOT167 |	Streams weekend
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:37,759	| IOT167 |	We can see it's a nut-free put really subtract
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:39,295	| IOT167 |	On a particular date that way
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:41,343	| IOT167 |	Cuz right now
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:42,623	| IOT167 |	If I
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:43,903	| IOT167 |	You know I'm a
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:44,671	| IOT167 |	Distributor
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:46,719	| IOT167 |	If I take that down there
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:47,487	| IOT167 |	What happens to the
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:49,535	| IOT167 |	The song like I just think the permanent
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:51,071	| IOT167 |	Of blockchain mixit
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:52,095	| IOT167 |	Very exciting
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:54,399	| IOT167 |	And you can really see exactly
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:55,423	| IOT167 |	How many streams
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:57,471	| IOT167 |	Did you get how much money you are
EDL	00:44:57,471	00:44:58,495	| IOT167 |	That's what makes me
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:44:59,263	| IOT167 |	Meetfighters
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:00,543	| IOT167 |	Okay so more is a payments
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:04,127	| IOT167 |	Payment seeing the other than ulcers smart contract
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:05,919	| IOT167 |	When you working with Odyssey
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:07,199	| IOT167 |	You know you
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:10,015	| IOT167 |	You want it to be as legitimate as possible
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:11,295	| IOT167 |	And sometimes
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:12,319	| IOT167 |	Where did I put that contract
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:16,927	| IOT167 |	Quite exciting and then that's the stuff we're sharing
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:17,695	| IOT167 |	System
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:19,231	| IOT167 |	Would be in the blockchain because
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:21,535	| IOT167 |	You know you use it and then it sits there as a wreck
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:23,839	| IOT167 |	But this is kind of things that I'm
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:25,631	| IOT167 |	Planning on thinking about
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:26,911	| IOT167 |	And going forward
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:30,495	| IOT167 |	How do you think that connectivity and Technology will change
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:32,287	| IOT167 |	How we experience music
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:35,359	| IOT167 |	That is a head of a human pillar
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:36,383	| IOT167 |	It's like a it's a
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:41,247	| IOT167 |	Play that is a Bluetooth cooler
EDL	00:45:41,759	00:45:43,295	| IOT167 |	And had the speaker in it
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:45,343	| IOT167 |	Jesus
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:46,879	| IOT167 |	Flashlight
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:47,903	| IOT167 |	50s music
EDL	00:45:47,903	00:45:50,207	| IOT167 |	And they had beef United displays
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:51,743	| IOT167 |	And it's just amazing
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:53,279	| IOT167 |	Killer Bean spacing
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:54,047	| IOT167 |	Enfamil enspire
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:45:58,399	| IOT167 |	Can watch a movie on your phone or you could
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:45:59,935	| IOT167 |	I can sleep
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:00,959	| IOT167 |	Something old list
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:01,727	| IOT167 |	Listen to music
EDL	00:46:01,727	00:46:03,007	| IOT167 |	I've been listening to it
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:04,799	| IOT167 |	Vibration
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:07,103	| IOT167 |	So I think that has
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:07,871	| IOT167 |	Containment salon
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:08,895	| IOT167 |	Will be a big
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:11,199	| IOT167 |	Change when people stop to get all these
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:12,223	| IOT167 |	Cool little gadgets
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:14,015	| IOT167 |	Kids music
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:15,039	| IOT167 |	Whole new way
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:15,551	| IOT167 |	When it comes
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:17,343	| IOT167 |	Forming like the way I talk
EDL	00:46:17,343	00:46:19,135	| IOT167 |	Performed
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:22,207	| IOT167 |	The order
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:23,231	| IOT167 |	So I can
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:24,511	| IOT167 |	Is my audio system
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:25,791	| IOT167 |	Is motion sensor
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:27,839	| IOT167 |	And when I move spinner
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:28,863	| IOT167 |	Different
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:31,423	| IOT167 |	Different different sounds can come out just
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:32,191	| IOT167 |	Remind me
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:33,471	| IOT167 |	Rather than me
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:35,519	| IOT167 |	Ashley
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:36,031	| IOT167 |	Maybe I could
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:38,335	| IOT167 |	Control the music with membrane
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:40,383	| IOT167 |	And I think that's really
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:41,407	| IOT167 |	Very very cool and fun
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:43,199	| IOT167 |	Hiking sweat
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:47,551	| IOT167 |	I think it's kind of messy I think you know even stage cough like
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:49,343	| IOT167 |	Microphones and mic French
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:50,879	| IOT167 |	Stems and things like that
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:52,671	| IOT167 |	Analogues
EDL	00:46:52,671	00:46:55,743	| IOT167 |	I think the evolution of different products
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:57,023	| IOT167 |	Can use on stage
EDL	00:46:57,791	00:46:59,071	| IOT167 |	That maybe didn't exist
EDL	00:46:59,071	00:47:00,095	| IOT167 |	Music
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:02,655	| IOT167 |	Oh so like we ditch the microphone and we go for something
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:05,471	| IOT167 |	Yeah I have this idea of a
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:08,031	| IOT167 |	Say
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:10,335	| IOT167 |	Kind of follow you and
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:11,871	| IOT167 |	You don't have sexy hold
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:13,407	| IOT167 |	But she likes
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:13,919	| IOT167 |	When you hold the next
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:16,223	| IOT167 |	How to tell your whole performance
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:20,063	| IOT167 |	Anna Kate Bush was one of the first people to request a headset mic
EDL	00:47:20,575	00:47:21,855	| IOT167 |	You want to feel this moment
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:23,391	| IOT167 |	She was one of the first people to do that
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:25,695	| IOT167 |	Beside you is like a
EDL	00:47:25,695	00:47:26,463	| IOT167 |	Train that could
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:28,255	| IOT167 |	American flag in front of your face
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:33,375	| IOT167 |	You can sing into it and then like I said about the elevator part
EDL	00:47:33,375	00:47:35,679	| IOT167 |	Entertainment at home
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:36,447	| IOT167 |	Feeling like
EDL	00:47:37,471	00:47:39,263	| IOT167 |	And that gives access to a lot more
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:40,031	| IOT167 |	People
EDL	00:47:40,031	00:47:40,799	| IOT167 |	The people that
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:41,823	| IOT167 |	Experience life
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:43,103	| IOT167 |	Could be thousands
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:44,895	| IOT167 |	And then
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:52,063	| IOT167 |	Sew-in that gets to a big challenges right now it feels like the
EDL	00:47:52,063	00:47:53,343	| IOT167 |	World for artists
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:56,415	| IOT167 |	Is both wide open with crowdfunding taipei
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:47:57,183	| IOT167 |	Opportunities and
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:47:57,695	| IOT167 |	Patreon
EDL	00:47:58,719	00:47:59,487	| IOT167 |	Yes
EDL	00:47:59,999	00:48:01,279	| IOT167 |	Yes is a lot of
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:02,047	| IOT167 |	Construction happening
EDL	00:48:02,815	00:48:04,351	| IOT167 |	Because he called music
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:05,631	| IOT167 |	Industry model. Working
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:08,959	| IOT167 |	Really
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:11,007	| IOT167 |	Reclaim the in Independence
EDL	00:48:11,007	00:48:11,775	| IOT167 |	Anoka
EDL	00:48:14,847	00:48:20,479	| IOT167 |	Is to be able to send or the creative projects that we want to do and not operate like a like a not-for-profit
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:22,783	| IOT167 |	Something actually operate on a business
EDL	00:48:22,783	00:48:23,807	| IOT167 |	Stitches
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:25,599	| IOT167 |	This is social cause
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:26,623	| IOT167 |	No I think that's PayPal
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:28,159	| IOT167 |	When that happens
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:31,743	| IOT167 |	Okay well I'm here thank you so much for coming on the show
EDL	00:48:32,511	00:48:33,791	| IOT167 |	Thank you
EDL	00:48:33,791	00:48:36,095	| IOT167 |	That's it for this week
EDL	00:48:36,095	00:48:39,935	| IOT167 |	Thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like more iot
