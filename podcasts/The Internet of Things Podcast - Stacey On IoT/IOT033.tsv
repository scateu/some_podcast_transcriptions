EDL	00:00:08,704	00:00:10,240	| IOT033 |	Hey everyone Welcome to the
EDL	00:00:10,240	00:00:14,336	| IOT033 |	Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and your co-host
EDL	00:00:14,848	00:00:15,360	| IOT033 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:15,872	00:00:20,224	| IOT033 |	And we are here today with lots of little bits of news so we're going to try to zip on through
EDL	00:00:20,224	00:00:21,504	| IOT033 |	This should be live
EDL	00:00:21,504	00:00:22,272	| IOT033 |	Pacn
EDL	00:00:22,272	00:00:22,784	| IOT033 |	Full of
EDL	00:00:24,320	00:00:25,344	| IOT033 |	So to kick ass off
EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:26,880	| IOT033 |	Let's start with
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:27,392	| IOT033 |	The
EDL	00:00:28,160	00:00:29,952	| IOT033 |	I'm going to go with mind-boggling news
EDL	00:00:30,464	00:00:31,488	| IOT033 |	Gartner's news
EDL	00:00:32,000	00:00:34,048	| IOT033 |	They said that there are now six
EDL	00:00:34,048	00:00:36,864	| IOT033 |	Now we are going to be 6.4
EDL	00:00:36,864	00:00:37,632	| IOT033 |	Billion
EDL	00:00:37,632	00:00:38,912	| IOT033 |	With a B connected
EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:39,680	| IOT033 |	Things
EDL	00:00:40,704	00:00:42,496	| IOT033 |	Things in use
EDL	00:00:42,496	00:00:44,032	| IOT033 |	In 2016
EDL	00:00:44,544	00:00:46,592	| IOT033 |	Up 30% from 2015
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:48,896	| IOT033 |	I've actually kind of amazing
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:51,456	| IOT033 |	I should have done the math before the show
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:52,992	| IOT033 |	I'm the third what
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:54,784	| IOT033 |	Is that 4 billion ish
EDL	00:00:55,552	00:00:57,856	| IOT033 |	Devices that are kind of currently connected
EDL	00:00:58,624	00:01:00,416	| IOT033 |	That's about right
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:01,440	| IOT033 |	That's about right
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:08,096	| IOT033 |	3.8 I'm sorry I'm looking at their number installs by category millions of units
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:10,400	| IOT033 |	2014 3.8 billion
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:16,544	| IOT033 |	2015 nurse biking 4.9 and then in 2016 6.392 or Isaac
EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:18,848	| IOT033 |	6.4 billion
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:23,968	| IOT033 |	And so most of these devices
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:25,504	| IOT033 |	In their category breakdown
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:27,808	| IOT033 |	Are actually consumer devices
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:31,904	| IOT033 |	Which I thought was kind of pretty crazy because
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:33,696	| IOT033 |	A lot of people
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:39,840	| IOT033 |	When you say internet of things I know we talked about the consumer a lot but most people are like oh it's all this crazy connected Factory
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:41,120	| IOT033 |	But no
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:43,936	| IOT033 |	Know the vast majority of their devices
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:46,240	| IOT033 |	This year it's like
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:47,776	| IOT033 |	3 billion
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:49,568	| IOT033 |	Other 4.9 billion
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,592	| IOT033 |	AR
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,128	| IOT033 |	Connected consumer
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,152	| IOT033 |	Devices
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:56,992	| IOT033 |	And even going out to 20/20 when they expect
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,272	| IOT033 |	20 point
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:00,576	| IOT033 |	8 billion devices to be connected
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:02,368	| IOT033 |	13 point
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:05,184	| IOT033 |	6 billion of them are going to be consumer
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:07,488	| IOT033 |	Set alarm alarm
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:12,096	| IOT033 |	Skewed percentage any surprise me too and that's why I added to the show notes because
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:17,216	| IOT033 |	You're right and we think of there's all these vertical markets and the industrial sector
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:20,544	| IOT033 |	You know smart meters and all these other things but
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,080	| IOT033 |	Really it looks like
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,360	| IOT033 |	The consumer Market is
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:23,872	| IOT033 |	Driving
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:26,432	| IOT033 |	Well that's in terms of number of things
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,200	| IOT033 |	But then we get into
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:28,480	| IOT033 |	Dollars
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:31,296	| IOT033 |	Here's where it gets a little bit more fun
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:34,112	| IOT033 |	Consumer applications will about 2
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:37,184	| IOT033 |	546 billion dollars in
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,488	| IOT033 |	2016 so that's next year
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:45,888	| IOT033 |	What's the use of connected things in the Enterprise will drive 868 billion dollars
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:46,912	| IOT033 |	In that same.
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:47,936	| IOT033 |	So
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,216	| IOT033 |	Consumers
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:49,984	| IOT033 |	We've got
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,776	| IOT033 |	More stuff and connected objects
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,568	| IOT033 |	But the Enterprise stuff
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,872	| IOT033 |	Makes our cost more money
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,408	| IOT033 |	Which you're getting ripped off
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,688	| IOT033 |	Yeah basically
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:05,088	| IOT033 |	We're all doing DIY and they're all like healthy Consultants ready for Enterprise logo on there
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:05,600	| IOT033 |	Struggle the price
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:09,184	| IOT033 |	So that's the Gartner study it was out on Tuesday
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,464	| IOT033 |	Band
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:12,256	| IOT033 |	Totally worth looking into because
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:19,680	| IOT033 |	Because a it's a lot of things but it feels a little bit more realistic than some of the earlier studies that we had in Tallahassee
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,960	| IOT033 |	Study that had I believe
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:24,032	| IOT033 |	50 billion devices in 2020
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:27,872	| IOT033 |	This is a little bit more realistic at 20.8 billion
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:31,200	| IOT033 |	But you know it all fairness some of these numbers were like just tossed out like
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,736	| IOT033 |	Probably
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:35,040	| IOT033 |	I think it was like 3 years ago
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:39,648	| IOT033 |	3 years ago this was pretty new and we were all like
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:43,488	| IOT033 |	Do you know A lot's changed since then
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,536	| IOT033 |	We got a little bit more practical
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:48,096	| IOT033 |	And you know
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:54,496	| IOT033 |	Forecasting stuff is never easy but you're right a few years back or talk about such huge numbers right not going to happen but
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:57,824	| IOT033 |	Reality is there sharing 2014 and 20th
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,616	| IOT033 |	Pmdd data actual data
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:00,896	| IOT033 |	It is prime
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:04,224	| IOT033 |	As Beijing as fast as they said it would have several years ago so
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:10,368	| IOT033 |	Besides you think might be a big thing Sunday
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,648	| IOT033 |	Really I am
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:12,672	| IOT033 |	Stacy's cat
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:20,607	| IOT033 |	There's a subcategory for hubs and right now you've got the market share so
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:22,399	| IOT033 |	So next item up
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:25,215	| IOT033 |	In terms of spending on connected things
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:29,567	| IOT033 |	You can buy the Amazon Echo in retail stores
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,591	| IOT033 |	For the Christmas season
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:31,615	| IOT033 |	For the holidays
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:34,431	| IOT033 |	This is I think very good news at
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,711	| IOT033 |	So kind of surprising since
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:42,879	| IOT033 |	8U Amazon obviously sells Kindle devices and other things in retail stores but they're also known as the
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:44,159	| IOT033 |	Shopping Hub of
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,927	| IOT033 |	The online world
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:47,487	| IOT033 |	And The Echoes of very unique device
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:51,071	| IOT033 |	Keep it to themselves to some point but
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,863	| IOT033 |	But now there's a whole list
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:55,679	| IOT033 |	You never talk about them right before the show
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:05:00,543	| IOT033 |	Who is the who's going to sell this RadioShack which surprised me to be on the list at all
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:01,823	| IOT033 |	Staples switch
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:04,127	| IOT033 |	Now that makes sense that got the whole connected home
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,663	| IOT033 |	Get up so talk about right then
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:12,575	| IOT033 |	Brookstone wearable cost twice as much of the riverhouse navigating
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,343	| IOT033 |	Home Depot
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:16,671	| IOT033 |	Westworld PC Richards at Fry's
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,951	| IOT033 |	Hhgregg
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:20,255	| IOT033 |	Sears where you don't pick up your vacuum
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:21,279	| IOT033 |	Clear bags if your me
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,863	| IOT033 |	Lincoln shutting down by May 6th
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:29,727	| IOT033 |	Hard to find a Sears but yes they will be in serious as well BJ's Wholesale Club so maybe get a discount there
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:32,543	| IOT033 |	It's not because
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:35,103	| IOT033 |	Notable know your place I didn't see it two of them
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:36,639	| IOT033 |	Target
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,663	| IOT033 |	And Best Buy
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:39,711	| IOT033 |	Which is kind of a shame
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:41,503	| IOT033 |	For the holiday season because
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,807	| IOT033 |	But I don't know I mean I don't go into
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:45,599	| IOT033 |	Site for the holidays
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:50,719	| IOT033 |	Too much every day of the holiday season for me so I'm in Best Buy a lot
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:55,327	| IOT033 |	But I was actually kind of surprised because Best Buy is actually really
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,095	| IOT033 |	Trying to create life
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:00,959	| IOT033 |	Service business around the connected home and they sell a lot of other connected
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:01,727	| IOT033 |	Tom products
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:02,751	| IOT033 |	And the echo is
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:05,567	| IOT033 |	Actually really good beginner product
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:06,591	| IOT033 |	Believe it or not
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:08,639	| IOT033 |	And Target
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,919	| IOT033 |	Because they're really
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:13,247	| IOT033 |	Doing some really cool stuff around the connected home
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,783	| IOT033 |	And once again
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,063	| IOT033 |	Day
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:21,439	| IOT033 |	Are really emphasizing how these things all work together and the echo is really done a lot to
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:22,719	| IOT033 |	Kind of
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:26,815	| IOT033 |	Trace consumer awareness I think
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:29,631	| IOT033 |	Both of those stores probably feel a lot of tension
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:31,167	| IOT033 |	With Amazon
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:34,751	| IOT033 |	Although they I believe both of those stores also sell
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:35,263	| IOT033 |	Candles
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:38,847	| IOT033 |	I think they do I know what kind of Target
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:45,247	| IOT033 |	Does Imagine Best Buy doesn't actually I just bought something at Best Buy this weekend they will
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:49,599	| IOT033 |	Match Amazon prices so I got new a discount on that so you're right there's tension there there
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:51,391	| IOT033 |	They're definitely in combating
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:53,183	| IOT033 |	Amazon there so
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,719	| IOT033 |	I don't know
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:58,815	| IOT033 |	I mean cuz the echo is not just a smart home automation Hub it's also a
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:00,095	| IOT033 |	Hey
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,399	| IOT033 |	Person who lives in the Echo
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,447	| IOT033 |	Will you pick up
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,471	| IOT033 |	Will you order this from
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,775	| IOT033 |	So we cannot live
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:10,079	| IOT033 |	It's a pretty good product
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:13,663	| IOT033 |	Even without the smart home integration stuff and we talked about for the smarthome bits
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,711	| IOT033 |	Touchpoints book
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:19,039	| IOT033 |	You know Isaac connecting Bluetooth speaker a personal assistant software
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:20,063	| IOT033 |	It's pretty interesting
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:21,855	| IOT033 |	Okay so
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,879	| IOT033 |	Next item
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:23,903	| IOT033 |	Let's see
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,927	| IOT033 |	We've got hope
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:26,207	| IOT033 |	Do you want to talk about a smartwatch
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,999	| IOT033 |	What is the greatest
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,535	| IOT033 |	Not this one but I will
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,351	| IOT033 |	So
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:34,143	| IOT033 |	I remember it was in May or March
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:37,983	| IOT033 |	Intel said they're going to be working with tag hair
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:38,751	| IOT033 |	2
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,519	| IOT033 |	Create an
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,799	| IOT033 |	Android Wear smartwatch
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:44,639	| IOT033 |	And at the time I could have sworn I said
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:46,431	| IOT033 |	It would be powered by their clock chip
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:51,807	| IOT033 |	Set sound right it says sound right in their courtship is now the chip that's on there
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:52,831	| IOT033 |	Siri platform
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:58,207	| IOT033 |	For those and the tree platform is Intel's wearable platform
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,743	| IOT033 |	It competes with
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,791	| IOT033 |	It was supposed to compete with
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,863	| IOT033 |	All of the arm low power
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:07,167	| IOT033 |	So so
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,471	| IOT033 |	So background good now present day
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,519	| IOT033 |	Earlier this week
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,311	| IOT033 |	The watch was introduced
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,591	| IOT033 |	It's called the tag
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:16,383	| IOT033 |	Are connected
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:18,687	| IOT033 |	What Carrera connected watch
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:21,247	| IOT033 |	It will cost you $1,500
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:27,135	| IOT033 |	It does not have a QuikTrip in it it has from what we can tell an Intel atom dual-core chip that's
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,927	| IOT033 |	Clock IT 1.6 gigahertz but then
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:33,535	| IOT033 |	Ramps down to 500 megahertz because I don't want the battery to
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,559	| IOT033 |	Run out in 3 hours
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:40,703	| IOT033 |	Here's the interesting crazy bit and there are lots of Android Wear watches not working today that start as low as $150
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,751	| IOT033 |	So if you would like to buy
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:44,031	| IOT033 |	K-Swiss
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:46,079	| IOT033 |	Made or Swiss made brand
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,871	| IOT033 |	Android Wear watch you can do so now
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:52,735	| IOT033 |	I'm kind of scratching my head over so because really you buy Swiss made watch I have several of them
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,271	| IOT033 |	Mundane
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:56,063	| IOT033 |	Tissot Omega
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,599	| IOT033 |	Hamilton songs
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:09:02,207	| IOT033 |	You buy those for the mechanical bits inside that are Swiss made
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:04,511	| IOT033 |	But there aren't any mechanical bits in your
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:07,583	| IOT033 |	Strictly brand you're getting a digital watch face
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,375	| IOT033 |	Made my tag hair
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,399	| IOT033 |	And
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:15,519	| IOT033 |	1500 boxes to part with for Android Wear smartwatch
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:16,799	| IOT033 |	Here's a really great party
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:20,127	| IOT033 |	Paper to your back-up plan because I don't think they think it's going to be successful
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:24,223	| IOT033 |	At the end of two years when they think the watch will be outdated
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:26,271	| IOT033 |	You would then treat your the option
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,807	| IOT033 |	I should say to trade it in
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:32,671	| IOT033 |	And pay another $1,500 and get a real tag hair
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,183	| IOT033 |	Carrera watch
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,999	| IOT033 |	One that doesn't have a chip in it
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,023	| IOT033 |	That's correct.
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:41,119	| IOT033 |	Traditional true Swiss made analog mechanical watch
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:44,191	| IOT033 |	You're going to pay $3,000 in the end if you go that route
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,727	| IOT033 |	And you have to give back an Android
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,263	| IOT033 |	Watch which probably will be outdated
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:50,079	| IOT033 |	Wait so how much is like a real Tag Heuer watch
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:53,151	| IOT033 |	Easily 3000 you can spend for 5
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,967	| IOT033 |	Oh okay so like
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,015	| IOT033 |	So basically I'm getting a smartwatch
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:03,647	| IOT033 |	You're going to rent a townhouse
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,671	| IOT033 |	Yeah pretty much
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,439	| IOT033 |	Pretty much
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:09,023	| IOT033 |	Okay it's just really the most it just reeks of
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,559	| IOT033 |	We don't think this is really going to work
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:15,423	| IOT033 |	And we don't think you are going to buy this for 1500 so we're going to do is we're going to add some incentive
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:16,703	| IOT033 |	And say
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:18,239	| IOT033 |	You're halfway paid towards a real watch
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:25,151	| IOT033 |	It is interesting and it's cheaper than a Porsche Carrera which is all that
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,431	| IOT033 |	Well yes
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,455	| IOT033 |	Much much cheaper than that
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:32,575	| IOT033 |	When I first heard about the $1,500 so I can know where they're going to sell any of these quite honestly
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:36,159	| IOT033 |	I don't think Apple sells a lot of their $10,000 and up Apple watches for example
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,487	| IOT033 |	But you know what there is that incentive that
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:42,047	| IOT033 |	Yeah it's kind of like a downpayment on a
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:43,071	| IOT033 |	Traditional watch
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,095	| IOT033 |	2 years from now
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:45,631	| IOT033 |	Okay well that's
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:48,959	| IOT033 |	See and I was looking at this strictly from the standpoint of
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:51,519	| IOT033 |	Has Intel Curie platform
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,311	| IOT033 |	You managed to become
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,847	| IOT033 |	Like competitive with arm
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:57,407	| IOT033 |	In the answer appears to be no
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,175	| IOT033 |	And
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,967	| IOT033 |	Also apparently if you are a watch band
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:03,295	| IOT033 |	This may not be the deal for you
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:08,671	| IOT033 |	Well I'm in the only a 1,500 saved up for your new tag hair and maybe it is
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,719	| IOT033 |	Will know it sounds like you should probably have
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:11,231	| IOT033 |	F3000
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:14,047	| IOT033 |	Cuz if you paid 1500
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:17,375	| IOT033 |	Then you spent $750 for
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,143	| IOT033 |	IWatch for a year
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:24,031	| IOT033 |	Unless you can stretch it to 3 I'm really good at stretching things out like that the life of my life
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:27,103	| IOT033 |	Smart watches I don't think
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:28,895	| IOT033 |	3 years is going to cut it
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,431	| IOT033 |	I just don't
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,223	| IOT033 |	So fancy smart watches
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:32,991	| IOT033 |	It's not our thing
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,527	| IOT033 |	How how long are you going to keep your Apple watch
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:40,671	| IOT033 |	You know that's a good question I don't know when they might refresh I don't know if I can do a yearly refresh
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:41,951	| IOT033 |	I have to see
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,487	| IOT033 |	What they added
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:47,839	| IOT033 |	You know what I assume they'll put a GPS radio in there next time around which I would really like
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,887	| IOT033 |	But other than that
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:52,191	| IOT033 |	I'm fine with what it does and
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:53,727	| IOT033 |	What I have today
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,007	| IOT033 |	How much was
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:58,079	| IOT033 |	I bought the cheapest one you can get for 350 bucks
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,383	| IOT033 |	The average sales price
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:03,455	| IOT033 |	Tends to be between four and five hundred dollars are not selling
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:06,527	| IOT033 |	A lot of those precious metal watches they're selling a lot of B
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,295	| IOT033 |	Entry
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:10,623	| IOT033 |	Model the sport edition actually about two-thirds of the estimate
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:13,439	| IOT033 |	Two-thirds of the total Apple watch sales are in the
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,719	| IOT033 |	350 $400 ring
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,839	| IOT033 |	Alright next news item
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,631	| IOT033 |	Let's see
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,423	| IOT033 |	Oh
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,447	| IOT033 |	Speaking of wearables
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,519	| IOT033 |	Let's talk about arm because
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:31,871	| IOT033 |	Well because you already have your arm
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:32,383	| IOT033 |	So much for
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:33,663	| IOT033 |	So much worse
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,735	| IOT033 |	Officer
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,015	| IOT033 |	Okay
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,295	| IOT033 |	Arm is coming back
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,879	| IOT033 |	It has a new
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:46,463	| IOT033 |	Processor design so things to know
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:46,975	| IOT033 |	Background
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:51,071	| IOT033 |	Is arm doesn't make chips it is a chip design
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:52,095	| IOT033 |	That makes
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:53,631	| IOT033 |	Designs
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:57,983	| IOT033 |	And then Jacob Riis license arms designed and then they build their own chips
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:01,823	| IOT033 |	And they can either build straight from arms designs or they can tweak the design
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,103	| IOT033 |	State Farm Gibson
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,383	| IOT033 |	To a certain extent
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,151	| IOT033 |	And then
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,199	| IOT033 |	Annabelle demon pants
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:09,503	| IOT033 |	Send customers Qualcomm Apple
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:11,807	| IOT033 |	Even Intel actually has an armless
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:12,319	| IOT033 |	Believe it or not
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:16,671	| IOT033 |	The newest arm architecture design was announced today at
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:17,951	| IOT033 |	It's user conference
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,231	| IOT033 |	And
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,255	| IOT033 |	It has
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:26,143	| IOT033 |	Two things worth noted one is the A35 which The Internet of Things show doesn't care much about but it's for
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:27,935	| IOT033 |	Basically blower power
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:28,703	| IOT033 |	Smartphone
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,727	| IOT033 |	Consider going to be cheaper
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,007	| IOT033 |	But
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,287	| IOT033 |	This shows purpose
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:34,079	| IOT033 |	This is what we really care about is the
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:35,871	| IOT033 |	Really terribly named
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:37,919	| IOT033 |	V
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:38,687	| IOT033 |	8
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,199	| IOT033 |	M
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:40,991	| IOT033 |	Architecture design
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:43,039	| IOT033 |	Which don't even think about that because
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:43,551	| IOT033 |	Hideously name
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:47,903	| IOT033 |	I'm basically what it is is arm is taking its trustzone
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:49,439	| IOT033 |	Security features
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:52,255	| IOT033 |	From smartphones and server chips
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:54,303	| IOT033 |	Kind of chips for smartphones and servers
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:56,351	| IOT033 |	And bring it down to the microcontroller
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,887	| IOT033 |	Where's that's what I am stands for
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,911	| IOT033 |	And
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:06,079	| IOT033 |	This is awesome because that means the Internet of Things is finally going to get some unified security
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:07,871	| IOT033 |	Teachers at the chip level
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:10,431	| IOT033 |	Which me and it's going to be at like
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,455	| IOT033 |	The design
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,991	| IOT033 |	Double the arm design level
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:15,039	| IOT033 |	And this is important because right now
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:18,367	| IOT033 |	A lot of the security we see at the chip level is coming from like
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,903	| IOT033 |	The chip vendors themselves
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:26,047	| IOT033 |	And they're like all their MCS have different layer like different ways of implementing security so if your developer in
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:30,143	| IOT033 |	Building on the Capri scale MCU you got one way to do security
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:33,727	| IOT033 |	Lmcu you got a different way of doing security
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,007	| IOT033 |	So
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,543	| IOT033 |	What's Happening Here is
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,823	| IOT033 |	Actually a unification
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:39,871	| IOT033 |	One step below that
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,151	| IOT033 |	Witches
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:41,663	| IOT033 |	Awesome
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:43,455	| IOT033 |	Now that's
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:47,039	| IOT033 |	That's good news for these devices and we talked about security and
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:50,111	| IOT033 |	Smart Homes and iot a the past and it's been a
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:51,903	| IOT033 |	And eyebrow razor like
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:57,023	| IOT033 |	How is all this going to be secured and there's a lot of other aspects of that your data in the cloud so on but
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,303	| IOT033 |	But at the device level
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:00,351	| IOT033 |	All the way down to the third ship level
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:04,703	| IOT033 |	This is cake that's pretty exciting and then we also have in the esoteric kind of like
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:07,263	| IOT033 |	Hardware standards world we also have
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:10,079	| IOT033 |	Threat certification which is out this week
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,359	| IOT033 |	And
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,151	| IOT033 |	I don't know this
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:16,223	| IOT033 |	I'm excited about how do you feel about thread surf
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:20,831	| IOT033 |	I can it's important it's important I just
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,623	| IOT033 |	I haven't seen much
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,135	| IOT033 |	Tangible
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:26,463	| IOT033 |	Products Medical Products using thread yet
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,231	| IOT033 |	Finessed
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:30,047	| IOT033 |	Okay so here's what thread is
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:32,607	| IOT033 |	If you guys for those of you who don't remember
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,887	| IOT033 |	And that's okay if you don't because
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:35,167	| IOT033 |	Kevin's right
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,703	| IOT033 |	It's not out by then the market because
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:41,055	| IOT033 |	Basically just been invented this is a wireless protocol so
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,847	| IOT033 |	It's like zigbee or Wi-Fi or
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:46,687	| IOT033 |	Bluetooth so it's a it's a way for devices to talk to each other
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,991	| IOT033 |	It's a mesh Network it is
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:51,039	| IOT033 |	Low data rate so tiny little bit today.
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,575	| IOT033 |	Is close range
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:53,855	| IOT033 |	And
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:55,135	| IOT033 |	It speaks IPv6
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:56,415	| IOT033 |	And it goes straight to the cloud
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,975	| IOT033 |	So it can talk to her but
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:00,255	| IOT033 |	It's it can also go straight to the cloud
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:02,047	| IOT033 |	And those are kind of the big salient
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:04,095	| IOT033 |	Do I have to say it was a mesh Network
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,887	| IOT033 |	I think it is
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,911	| IOT033 |	Okay great
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:10,751	| IOT033 |	So it's going to compete or coexist depending on how you know
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:13,311	| IOT033 |	How you want to feel about it
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:15,615	| IOT033 |	With kind of existing Wireless protocols
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:21,503	| IOT033 |	The big companies that invented it and kind of gathering around it are free scale Samsung
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,271	| IOT033 |	Nest
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:23,295	| IOT033 |	Silicon labs
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,063	| IOT033 |	Osram
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:29,183	| IOT033 |	Salary
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:29,695	| IOT033 |	Appliance
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:33,791	| IOT033 |	So I actually got off the phone today with Procter & Gamble
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,071	| IOT033 |	The Giant
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:38,655	| IOT033 |	Consumer goods company and they're actually trying to innovate around
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,423	| IOT033 |	Arthritis swelling
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:43,775	| IOT033 |	I talked to someone there he was like yeah we really believe that this is actually going to be
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:47,615	| IOT033 |	What Society moves towards for the connected home
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:48,895	| IOT033 |	For Consumer products
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,175	| IOT033 |	Interesting
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:52,991	| IOT033 |	It was on my Proctor again
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:55,039	| IOT033 |	So that a company I would have expected
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:56,575	| IOT033 |	Yasso
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,343	| IOT033 |	A
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:17:00,415	| IOT033 |	Guys Procter & Gamble's excited about the internet of things and be
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,439	| IOT033 |	Vocalizing around thread
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:02,719	| IOT033 |	Hey
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,743	| IOT033 |	Pretty cool so
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:05,023	| IOT033 |	Red certification
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:07,071	| IOT033 |	It's out their current products using it
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,351	| IOT033 |	Nest later products
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:09,375	| IOT033 |	We'll see
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:10,655	| IOT033 |	All right
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,447	| IOT033 |	Until finally
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:14,239	| IOT033 |	Kind of talks so much on the show Kevin
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,775	| IOT033 |	That's okay I'm listening
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:20,127	| IOT033 |	If I could just hug you for that
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,407	| IOT033 |	So
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,687	| IOT033 |	Big is
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:26,015	| IOT033 |	I have been testing for the last like 2 days cuz
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:27,551	| IOT033 |	This isn't like an in-depth test
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:30,623	| IOT033 |	It's not really end up the product but it's pretty cool the roost
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:36,255	| IOT033 |	Smart home I don't even know what to call it it's a it's a battery it's connected battery for smoke detector
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:40,607	| IOT033 |	I don't know if you remember me talking about this Kevin but
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:44,703	| IOT033 |	I don't I don't in an action curious because you know we do the whole
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,983	| IOT033 |	Swap out the batteries
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,775	| IOT033 |	When we change the clocks
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,543	| IOT033 |	We didn't do that
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:51,103	| IOT033 |	Smoke detectors this year so what is this do
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:52,383	| IOT033 |	This is going to be great for you
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:55,711	| IOT033 |	I don't know okay so
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:58,015	| IOT033 |	Roost is a Smart 9 volt
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:58,527	| IOT033 |	Battery
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,831	| IOT033 |	Design to go in your smoke.
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:04,159	| IOT033 |	So this is a wifi-connected battery
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:06,719	| IOT033 |	You pop it into your smoke detector
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:10,815	| IOT033 |	And you download the app and suddenly you can see
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,863	| IOT033 |	When your smoke detector is on
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:15,423	| IOT033 |	Right and you can also see when it goes off
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:19,519	| IOT033 |	You'll get a notification on your phone it would also tell like a circle of your friends
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:24,127	| IOT033 |	Spike your neighbors are whoever you want to notify for alerts of things
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:26,943	| IOT033 |	And then you can also it'll also tell you like
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,735	| IOT033 |	Hey your battery is about to
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:36,671	| IOT033 |	Obviously I've only had it in for 2 days so I can't tell you how long the battery last but that is when
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:37,439	| IOT033 |	Weather today
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:42,815	| IOT033 |	This is interesting this seems like a way to retrofit and turn old
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:44,863	| IOT033 |	Smart smoke detectors into
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:48,959	| IOT033 |	Smart one spaceship through the battery I like this okay
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:51,263	| IOT033 |	And so it's a little bit expensive
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:54,591	| IOT033 |	It's 3499 for One battery
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:57,919	| IOT033 |	It's 65 for 2Pac
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:58,943	| IOT033 |	A batteries
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:00,735	| IOT033 |	But
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:02,271	| IOT033 |	That's cheaper than a nest
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,551	| IOT033 |	Protect which is the current
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:07,391	| IOT033 |	Right now your options in the connected
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:07,903	| IOT033 |	The smoke
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:09,951	| IOT033 |	Are like
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,719	| IOT033 |	Replacing
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:14,303	| IOT033 |	Your existing smoke detector with like a kitty
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:16,607	| IOT033 |	Is that a kid I don't know how to say these
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:20,959	| IOT033 |	Sing. Leah k i d d e n
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:25,055	| IOT033 |	They have a proprietary radio so you have to work with like one of their hubs
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:26,335	| IOT033 |	If
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:27,359	| IOT033 |	So that's not
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,895	| IOT033 |	Great for anyone who doesn't want to mess with
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:32,223	| IOT033 |	And no smoke detectors are
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:33,247	| IOT033 |	Fletc
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,319	| IOT033 |	Look at how much a Kidde smoke detector is
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,599	| IOT033 |	I think they're about
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:39,391	| IOT033 |	Actually
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,183	| IOT033 |	You can get something like that
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,231	| IOT033 |	And yeah
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:47,327	| IOT033 |	So some of the some of the connected ones that talked to the hubs are a little bit more
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,863	| IOT033 |	That's if they're only $25
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,399	| IOT033 |	So
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:53,727	| IOT033 |	And you can get versions that are little fancier with different
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:54,239	| IOT033 |	Lights
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:55,519	| IOT033 |	So
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:59,615	| IOT033 |	This is kind of within that price range but you basically just
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,151	| IOT033 |	Plop out of battery
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:02,943	| IOT033 |	And
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,479	| IOT033 |	You're golden in this way
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,527	| IOT033 |	It connects to your phone you got the app
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:09,855	| IOT033 |	The other option you have is something like Leo
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:13,439	| IOT033 |	Which is like $100 night light that listens for your smoke
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:17,023	| IOT033 |	Alarm to go off and then can they give you the notification function
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:19,071	| IOT033 |	But that can't tell you
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:24,703	| IOT033 |	When your existing smoke alarms about to run out of battery so you still can have that issue
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:28,287	| IOT033 |	I like chirping at 3 a.m. and not knowing sure
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:32,383	| IOT033 |	We have to chase the trip in our house addresses nuts
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:34,687	| IOT033 |	So this this eliminates that
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:42,623	| IOT033 |	You don't at first I thought $35 for a battery no but now that now that it could basically term
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,927	| IOT033 |	Dumb smoke content with Smart Ones
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:48,767	| IOT033 |	And as if I'm reading this right the battery last for up to five years
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:51,839	| IOT033 |	Yes oh yes it does last for a long time
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:54,655	| IOT033 |	And the nice thing is you don't have to take it out
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:57,727	| IOT033 |	You know every year like you do your other one
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,007	| IOT033 |	You're going to know my name
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:05,151	| IOT033 |	Yeah now it doesn't look like it you mention there's an IOS and Android app that this works with now
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:09,759	| IOT033 |	It doesn't look like it works with any smart home hubs but they do say that they are
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:14,623	| IOT033 |	Opening up an API for it so I presume we'll see some decoration points
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:18,208	| IOT033 |	So I am so this is one of those things where I am okay
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:20,512	| IOT033 |	With my smoke alarm not working with a hub
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:22,816	| IOT033 |	Mostly because
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:24,864	| IOT033 |	It has audio sounds as it is
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:27,424	| IOT033 |	Yeah and I'm I'm less worried I mean
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:30,240	| IOT033 |	Guess they're cool automations were like my Hue Lights can
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:31,520	| IOT033 |	Lexi
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:34,592	| IOT033 |	Get off my smoke alarm goes off my Hue Lights will
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:35,872	| IOT033 |	In a Flash reading
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:40,480	| IOT033 |	I can flick see through the smoke and I think that's me Nest protect has that kind of integration
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:41,760	| IOT033 |	Euphoric symbol
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:44,064	| IOT033 |	But I'm actually okay with
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:49,696	| IOT033 |	You don't want it if this then that channels that we can turn on you no water
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:52,000	| IOT033 |	My rachio sprinklers
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:54,560	| IOT033 |	I'm okay without that too
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:57,376	| IOT033 |	IIA don't have the sprinklers in
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:57,888	| IOT033 |	NB
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:22:01,728	| IOT033 |	It doesn't bother me if it's not if it doesn't have any other Integrations is just
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:05,312	| IOT033 |	It's a personal preference and end up speaking only for myself
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:07,360	| IOT033 |	I like to have everything in one app
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:10,432	| IOT033 |	Nice as it is I have a folder of apps and
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:11,712	| IOT033 |	Annoys the crap outta me that I've
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:15,040	| IOT033 |	I want to do this
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:15,808	| IOT033 |	Just a person
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:19,392	| IOT033 |	Yeah but for me this is not a nap I'm ever going to
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,696	| IOT033 |	This is truly just going to be something
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:22,720	| IOT033 |	Yells at me
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:27,072	| IOT033 |	Install on 5 years from now you on here
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:27,584	| IOT033 |	Front wheel
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,376	| IOT033 |	That's that's the plan
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:31,936	| IOT033 |	And so I got eight smoke detectors in my house
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:33,728	| IOT033 |	So I'm looking at
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:38,592	| IOT033 |	$260 to upgrade my entire house to smart
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:42,432	| IOT033 |	As opposed to eight Nest protect
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:42,944	| IOT033 |	800
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:49,344	| IOT033 |	$200 for two Leos but then I I'm still doing chirping and since

EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:53,184	| IOT033 |	Three weeks ago I was chasing a chirp
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:55,232	| IOT033 |	It's still fresh in my mind some kind of like
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,792	| IOT033 |	60 bucks more not to chase the chirp
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,328	| IOT033 |	It's worth it
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:03,168	| IOT033 |	It's going on my holiday listening

EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:57,088	| IOT033 |	I got to tell you right now I'm not really seeing it
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:58,112	| IOT033 |	All right
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,136	| IOT033 |	OKC
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:04,256	| IOT033 |	Kind of reinforced a little bit by this might get to Summit having said that
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:06,560	| IOT033 |	I want to make sure it's understood that I thought it was a great
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:09,376	| IOT033 |	Conference our former colleague Mike Wolfe put it on
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:12,448	| IOT033 |	He asked me to MC it and even though I'm not
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:16,032	| IOT033 |	Super interested in this market December they were a lot of great speakers that day
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,568	| IOT033 |	With a lot of interesting
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,080	| IOT033 |	Content
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:21,664	| IOT033 |	Yes sir this was like an all-day event with people from
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:26,784	| IOT033 |	Like the start of World that we've had on the show like the June oven people that drop kitchen scale
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:29,600	| IOT033 |	Tons of connected devices for the kitchen
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:31,392	| IOT033 |	Even some folks from Amazon
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:36,512	| IOT033 |	And then a bunch of people from like the Appliance in Old School world like that
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:38,816	| IOT033 |	The president of Williams-Sonoma was there
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:45,216	| IOT033 |	Guy from Electrolux and Jardin those the people to make the connected crock pot which is not refrigerated
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:52,128	| IOT033 |	I did not I was so crestfallen when I saw that I got so excited for you cuz I know for years you've been talking about the refrigerated connected
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:55,968	| IOT033 |	Crock-Pot there is a device you guys on Kickstarter called mellow
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:26:00,064	| IOT033 |	That is kind of like a Crock-Pot it is also refrigerated
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:01,856	| IOT033 |	But I feel like
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:02,880	| IOT033 |	It's probably not
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,672	| IOT033 |	Actually come to fruition
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,440	| IOT033 |	But
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:08,000	| IOT033 |	You know we'll talk more about that on another show not the show
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,280	| IOT033 |	I'll try to get the
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,304	| IOT033 |	People on to see if this
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,072	| IOT033 |	It's going to be a real thing
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,352	| IOT033 |	So
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:15,936	| IOT033 |	Back to the smart kitchen so that's what this event was it was really great
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:17,216	| IOT033 |	Lot of good content
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:17,984	| IOT033 |	First off
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:20,800	| IOT033 |	Smart kitchens we kind of talked about
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:21,568	| IOT033 |	What that means for
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:24,640	| IOT033 |	Increase you don't want a smart kitchen
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:26,688	| IOT033 |	What do you even think of when you hear the phrase smart
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:34,112	| IOT033 |	So I think it's also important to kind of set the scene a little bit my wife predominantly does the cooking just cuz she loved
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:34,880	| IOT033 |	Loves to cook
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:36,416	| IOT033 |	And she's a much better cook than I
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:41,280	| IOT033 |	And so when I tell her like oh there's is neat I love gadgets though so I'm all about
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:44,096	| IOT033 |	Oh what can we connect our up and what can we do
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:46,912	| IOT033 |	What's the neat little doohickey that I can look
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:48,448	| IOT033 |	I use my phone with
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:52,288	| IOT033 |	I want to bring that up and she just kind of looks at me and gives me the the cartoon blank blank
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:55,616	| IOT033 |	Like why would that to see why would you want that
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:57,664	| IOT033 |	So it there's sort of a
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:59,712	| IOT033 |	Because I know I'm not the predominant
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:02,528	| IOT033 |	Person in the kitchen for good reason
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:04,832	| IOT033 |	We pretended not we
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:06,368	| IOT033 |	We're not really a smart kitchen house
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,928	| IOT033 |	And but I
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:09,696	| IOT033 |	I love
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:14,816	| IOT033 |	Kind of the gadgets that are coming out they all just seem so expensive right now and I feel like I'm kind of rambling and I'm sorry
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,840	| IOT033 |	That's okay
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:16,608	| IOT033 |	Alright so
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:17,888	| IOT033 |	I think one of us
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:20,960	| IOT033 |	What I think of a smart kitchen I actually don't think of what
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:23,264	| IOT033 |	I don't think I know what you're saying
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:26,336	| IOT033 |	I don't think about a bunch of gadgets I actually think about
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:29,408	| IOT033 |	A kitchen that
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:32,736	| IOT033 |	Can actually help me because when I am cooking
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:34,016	| IOT033 |	I am actually performing
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:36,576	| IOT033 |	A bunch of really highly choreographed
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:37,856	| IOT033 |	Steps Ray time
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:40,672	| IOT033 |	Chopping a bunch of stuff I usually have fire going on somewhere
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:41,952	| IOT033 |	Usually
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:43,232	| IOT033 |	I am
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:46,560	| IOT033 |	You know trying to do like way too many things at once cuz I never like
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:48,608	| IOT033 |	Prepare everything all at once right that's
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,888	| IOT033 |	That's like just did
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:50,656	| IOT033 |	Pipedream for me
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:51,936	| IOT033 |	So
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:54,752	| IOT033 |	I'm running around and tossing things into the pot
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:55,520	| IOT033 |	Washington
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,056	| IOT033 |	And
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:28:00,640	| IOT033 |	I don't have time to pick up my smartphone because my hands are dirty and because
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:02,432	| IOT033 |	I got some things on fire
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:05,504	| IOT033 |	So for me that idea is I really want something
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:08,320	| IOT033 |	That integrates into my workflow and doesn't
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,600	| IOT033 |	Take me out of it
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:11,392	| IOT033 |	So I want
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:13,184	| IOT033 |	Things like the Amazon Alexa
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:16,512	| IOT033 |	Okay sorry the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,280	| IOT033 |	Where I can be like
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:18,304	| IOT033 |	Hey
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:20,608	| IOT033 |	Lady in the Echo
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:22,400	| IOT033 |	Set a timer for this amount
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:25,472	| IOT033 |	It happens without me pressing anything or going some
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:25,984	| IOT033 |	Place
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:30,080	| IOT033 |	I doubt she actually be Echo with some of the people talked about a lot during that day
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:34,432	| IOT033 |	So and actually it wasn't a device that
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:41,600	| IOT033 |	I am intrigued by and I went back and actually read your big article on it when I think it came out in June
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:44,928	| IOT033 |	Without that piece it came out for the General Public
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,464	| IOT033 |	Somewhere around Mayer
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:48,512	| IOT033 |	Right and so
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:50,304	| IOT033 |	The idea of to your point like
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:51,584	| IOT033 |	Not coming up
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:53,376	| IOT033 |	IPhone or an iPad
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,656	| IOT033 |	But the ability to connect
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:56,704	| IOT033 |	What I want to explore is the ability to connect
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:57,216	| IOT033 |	The echo
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:58,240	| IOT033 |	So
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:28:59,264	| IOT033 |	You can
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:01,568	| IOT033 |	What I want or need to find out probably
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:04,128	| IOT033 |	From you or other people I just how well the voice commands work
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:07,200	| IOT033 |	And how many steps you can throw in cuz I think actually
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:10,016	| IOT033 |	The echo was a really good idea for
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:11,552	| IOT033 |	Creating what you are talking about
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:12,576	| IOT033 |	I think
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:15,648	| IOT033 |	At this event and I don't think we really
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:18,208	| IOT033 |	Got into it as much as I would have liked
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:22,048	| IOT033 |	We have AAFES Silicon Valley types who are like
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:25,632	| IOT033 |	I have reinvented the oven for you I've reinvented a robot that makes tea
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:27,424	| IOT033 |	And
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:31,008	| IOT033 |	We didn't really talk about how this is going to hit mainstream
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:32,032	| IOT033 |	America
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:34,592	| IOT033 |	And how we're going to get this into her kitchen
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:35,104	| IOT033 |	Today
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:38,176	| IOT033 |	Right well and I think one of the things
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:39,968	| IOT033 |	I mean part and parcel with
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:40,480	| IOT033 |	That right is
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:44,832	| IOT033 |	Silicon Valley startup people are used to kind of this planned obsolescence
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:48,928	| IOT033 |	Upgrading your phone every two years upgrading your TV every 5 years
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:49,952	| IOT033 |	Write like
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:52,256	| IOT033 |	And when you get something big like an appliance
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:53,280	| IOT033 |	Like an oven
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:54,304	| IOT033 |	Which
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:30:00,960	| IOT033 |	You know comes with a house typically or has a space for it you know has a big empty place with wiring all set for
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:06,080	| IOT033 |	What I see when I see those interfaces under cycle what's going to happen when they upgrade
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:07,360	| IOT033 |	What am I going to miss out on
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:10,688	| IOT033 |	In two years from now when they're software does X
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,456	| IOT033 |	And they haven't
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:12,992	| IOT033 |	You know they don't
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:14,528	| IOT033 |	They don't support
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:15,552	| IOT033 |	Versions behind
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:16,832	| IOT033 |	You know what I mean
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:20,416	| IOT033 |	When when they add like a high-definition to my
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:21,952	| IOT033 |	My Smart Oven
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:23,232	| IOT033 |	I'm stuck on this
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:23,744	| IOT033 |	Standard definition
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:26,560	| IOT033 |	Are 4K you know what I'm stuck on HD
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:28,096	| IOT033 |	You can look at garbage
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:31,680	| IOT033 |	I need I need so many pixels for my turkey
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:35,776	| IOT033 |	So that's to that kind of like here's why I like
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:37,056	| IOT033 |	And where Amazon is going
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:39,872	| IOT033 |	Because between the echo
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:41,152	| IOT033 |	But also just their dash button
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:44,992	| IOT033 |	I think are so that I think that you could talk away into things
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:47,296	| IOT033 |	And as they expand
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:49,856	| IOT033 |	What they could be good for or maybe make them programmable
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:54,720	| IOT033 |	So and I apologize if this has been written about but if they had like a barcode reader
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:56,256	| IOT033 |	I think just a blank one
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:57,792	| IOT033 |	And you had a barcode reader
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:59,584	| IOT033 |	Since I was like oh this one is for
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:03,168	| IOT033 |	Pasta or this one's for this particular kind of bread
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:04,704	| IOT033 |	And when I get low I get the button
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:07,520	| IOT033 |	That to me is really interesting
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:09,568	| IOT033 |	Let's put a line of demarcation here
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:11,360	| IOT033 |	Cuz we've moved from talking about kind of Lake
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:13,664	| IOT033 |	Gadgets and food prep
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:15,200	| IOT033 |	And now we're talking about like
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:16,224	| IOT033 |	Food acquisition
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:21,088	| IOT033 |	Or I think we're also just talking about unifying the kitchen at a workspace right like making extremely
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:24,160	| IOT033 |	Okay so like to your point I think
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:26,720	| IOT033 |	Granite we are talking kind of or approaching it differently
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:30,560	| IOT033 |	You know where is you are looking at a for a director to kind of
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:33,632	| IOT033 |	If coordinate the symphony when you are creating your masterpiece
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:38,752	| IOT033 |	I'm looking for something that seamlessly fits in that I that I don't feel will be
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:42,336	| IOT033 |	Obsolete especially now when we're getting like these are all first-generation product
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:45,152	| IOT033 |	So I I think on the dash side
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:45,664	| IOT033 |	I think
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:47,200	| IOT033 |	Yes
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:49,248	| IOT033 |	You are you are so
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:52,320	| IOT033 |	That I think that is a really great
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:54,368	| IOT033 |	Solution
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:56,928	| IOT033 |	Both from a retrofit standpoint like
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:58,208	| IOT033 |	Awesome because
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:04,352	| IOT033 |	You know you paid for 99 you get this button and you get 499 discounted whatever it is that button orders
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:07,168	| IOT033 |	Amazon is expanding the program
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:11,008	| IOT033 |	There was a guy from Amazon. She was at the show talking
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,544	| IOT033 |	And he was like
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:15,104	| IOT033 |	You know our retailers are excited about it
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:16,384	| IOT033 |	We're excited about it
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:17,664	| IOT033 |	He said that
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:21,248	| IOT033 |	Anchor most popular button is the Smart Water button
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:22,272	| IOT033 |	And
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:25,856	| IOT033 |	People interact with that every 11 days
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:27,648	| IOT033 |	I got to get there electrolytes
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:28,928	| IOT033 |	Exactly I'm like
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:32,256	| IOT033 |	Jennifer Aniston made them do it
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:34,048	| IOT033 |	Emirates Airline
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:38,400	| IOT033 |	But that's also something really easy that like my son could use
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:40,448	| IOT033 |	He's going to get older and more sophisticated
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:42,240	| IOT033 |	But like if
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:44,544	| IOT033 |	When it in the next couple of years he likes
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:45,824	| IOT033 |	You know he likes dried apricots
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:48,384	| IOT033 |	And if he runs out of dried apricots then week
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:51,456	| IOT033 |	You know that's not something that I'm necessarily paying attention to
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:54,272	| IOT033 |	I mean even though I do want
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:57,600	| IOT033 |	But he could it's simple enough to where he could press it and it's not going to
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:33:00,416	| IOT033 |	You know require getting into my accountant
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:05,280	| IOT033 |	Get okra filling out a card and doing all the other stuff it's just something really simple
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:08,864	| IOT033 |	That he can learn to keep track of
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:09,376	| IOT033 |	And that's
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:14,240	| IOT033 |	That's awesome and Everyone likes pressing buttons actually the Amazon guy said that he gets
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:16,800	| IOT033 |	Biggest fan mail for the dash where
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:17,568	| IOT033 |	Couples are like
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:20,640	| IOT033 |	They they will email him and they will say things like
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:24,992	| IOT033 |	My husband says I have it he waits until I get home
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:27,040	| IOT033 |	Until we can both press the button
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:27,808	| IOT033 |	Together
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:28,832	| IOT033 |	That's how much we love this
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:30,368	| IOT033 |	Well that's
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:36,512	| IOT033 |	Once that you would do that and then to that you would write the guy at Amazon
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:38,560	| IOT033 |	And say
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:41,120	| IOT033 |	I don't normally do this but I wanted to tell you about
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:44,192	| IOT033 |	Your product to help me buy more products
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:45,472	| IOT033 |	So great
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:47,776	| IOT033 |	But
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:48,288	| IOT033 |	So I think
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:50,336	| IOT033 |	I think there's a couple things happen
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:54,944	| IOT033 |	I think one is impossible to imagine that Amazon could give you a dash for air
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:57,760	| IOT033 |	I think the idea of it being programmable
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:33:59,296	| IOT033 |	Is actually kind of
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:03,392	| IOT033 |	Smart and fun and I bet Amazon will do that eventually
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:07,744	| IOT033 |	They also have an addition to the dash something called the Amazon
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:09,792	| IOT033 |	Dash fulfillment service
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:11,840	| IOT033 |	And that is an automatic
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:17,216	| IOT033 |	It's for products and they build basically sensors in that connects back to Amazon
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:20,032	| IOT033 |	So without you actually having to press the button
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:21,056	| IOT033 |	Free things like
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:24,128	| IOT033 |	A dog food dog food in a dog food canister
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,920	| IOT033 |	It will actually
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:28,224	| IOT033 |	Automatically sends when that
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:29,760	| IOT033 |	Canister is running low
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:30,272	| IOT033 |	And sent you more
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:37,184	| IOT033 |	So another way that this kind of all ties together right is that I've been on a kind of a diet for the past few months
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:42,048	| IOT033 |	And I use one of those food that's not it like a special one it's just sort of like
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:43,584	| IOT033 |	Hey hey dummy eat less
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:49,216	| IOT033 |	You don't need to jam wheat wheat thins in your mama all day long right but it's it it's got a food tracker in it
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:55,360	| IOT033 |	Pet scan the barcode and then brings up all the nutritional information about that and then I input how much is a 8th of that particular thing
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:58,176	| IOT033 |	So as part of that I was eating a lot of eggs
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:01,504	| IOT033 |	And so for it the kind of tie in with my shopping list
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:03,808	| IOT033 |	Some kind of Amazonian shopping list it will go like
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:04,832	| IOT033 |	Oh hey
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:08,416	| IOT033 |	I noticed that your Fitness tracker that you've been eating a lot of eggs and
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:09,696	| IOT033 |	Based on you know
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:15,840	| IOT033 |	We think you might be running low based on whatever maybe I bought a dozen eggs and it seemed that I've eaten six of them by Wednesday
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:18,144	| IOT033 |	Then it could automatically add that to
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:19,936	| IOT033 |	That shopping list
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:23,008	| IOT033 |	Okay so this gets into something that
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:25,312	| IOT033 |	I am super passionate about most people probably are like
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:27,104	| IOT033 |	Which is
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:30,944	| IOT033 |	There's so many ways to input data into kind of
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:34,272	| IOT033 |	Look at the cloud The Internet of Things whatever
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:36,320	| IOT033 |	So you could grab that data from
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:38,880	| IOT033 |	Your Fitness your your food tracker
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:39,648	| IOT033 |	Right
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:40,928	| IOT033 |	Your food tracker app
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:41,696	| IOT033 |	But that doesn't
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:43,744	| IOT033 |	Get everybody in your household
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:45,024	| IOT033 |	It's probably not the best way
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:49,376	| IOT033 |	You could get it through like a dedicated device like I used to have the quirky egg
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:50,656	| IOT033 |	Minder
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:55,008	| IOT033 |	Stop it like device which actually literally counted how many eggs are in my refrigerator
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:58,336	| IOT033 |	It was a dedicated device for that it was the
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:35:59,104	| IOT033 |	Stupid money
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:04,224	| IOT033 |	You could also get it from like a camera in your fridge that like
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:09,088	| IOT033 |	You know A in food recognition that then exported it to a shopping list
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:12,672	| IOT033 |	You could get it from like you telling your Amazon
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:13,696	| IOT033 |	Echo
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:14,720	| IOT033 |	Hey I need more eggs
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,560	| IOT033 |	You see like
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:20,608	| IOT033 |	And I think what's going to happen is
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:26,240	| IOT033 |	Every family is going to approach this a little bit differently because we love having Variety in choice
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:28,800	| IOT033 |	So I think the key isn't actually going to be like
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:30,592	| IOT033 |	Iceman dating
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:34,688	| IOT033 |	How we want to do that it's actually going to be developing standards around
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:35,712	| IOT033 |	How we
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:37,760	| IOT033 |	Call an egg an egg
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:38,784	| IOT033 |	So
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:41,344	| IOT033 |	When we say we want an egg
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:47,488	| IOT033 |	All of these things will actually be able to recognize what an egg is and they can just like
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:49,280	| IOT033 |	Pop it in the list and then it's out of it
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:50,048	| IOT033 |	Does that make sense
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:55,936	| IOT033 |	Yeah absolutely in that the reason I was bringing up the like a food tracker thing is cuz my wife will often say is like
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:58,240	| IOT033 |	What do you want me to pick up at the store
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:36:59,776	| IOT033 |	And
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:01,312	| IOT033 |	What's the device for you
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:03,872	| IOT033 |	Okay it's called the haiku
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:06,176	| IOT033 |	Okay $50
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:07,200	| IOT033 |	Your son might even lie
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:10,016	| IOT033 |	So what you do is a refrigerator magnet
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:14,368	| IOT033 |	And it has a barcode scanner and voice activation
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:17,696	| IOT033 |	And then it also has Partnerships with both Walmart and Peapod
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:18,976	| IOT033 |	So
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:22,048	| IOT033 |	You press a button and we had
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:23,840	| IOT033 |	The CEO Haiku was our guest
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:25,888	| IOT033 |	We can talk about food all months
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:27,168	| IOT033 |	Because hey it's almost Thanksgiving
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:29,472	| IOT033 |	Yay see press the button
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:31,520	| IOT033 |	And you say
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:32,288	| IOT033 |	Add eggs
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:33,568	| IOT033 |	And then it goes to both and
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:36,128	| IOT033 |	App on your phone or your wife's phone
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:37,408	| IOT033 |	For Andrew Weissman rather
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:42,272	| IOT033 |	And she can either pick it up at the store or you can create a list in
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:46,880	| IOT033 |	Can I pick up curbside delivery at participating Walmart's or you can have it delivered from Peapod
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:50,208	| IOT033 |	I will check it out
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:56,352	| IOT033 |	Are there are two things at that we've been talking about that to think that we have kind of danced around here
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:38:02,496	| IOT033 |	And that I want to talk with you about specifically one I want to give you a call back
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:03,776	| IOT033 |	To the stupid expensive
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:06,592	| IOT033 |	And then to talk about platform
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:12,224	| IOT033 |	Alright feel like those are two things that are holding me back one lets the start was stupid expensive
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:14,784	| IOT033 |	There was a tea infuser that eforia
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:16,320	| IOT033 |	And
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:17,856	| IOT033 |	Man that guy was a TV evangelist
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:22,464	| IOT033 |	They it's a very Sleek looking very Apple looking they call it a Tesla tea maker
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:27,072	| IOT033 |	That device that supposedly makes a way better
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:28,352	| IOT033 |	A cup of tea
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:31,168	| IOT033 |	It'll know if they comes in pods
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:32,192	| IOT033 |	You tap it to the top
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:37,824	| IOT033 |	You dump your loose leaf in and then it knows from reading a pod what kind of tea it is what temperature the water
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:39,872	| IOT033 |	Beyond all this other extraction stuff
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:41,664	| IOT033 |	So it creates a more complex
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,200	| IOT033 |	Tea
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:46,272	| IOT033 |	Which sounds great I drink tea I mostly drink just kind of
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:49,856	| IOT033 |	Straight up PG tips cuz I love that black iced tea in the morning
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:52,160	| IOT033 |	So I'm not like a connoisseur
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:55,232	| IOT033 |	And I'm intrigued by but it's also it's
EDL	00:38:55,232	00:38:57,024	| IOT033 |	649 / 700 box
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:38:59,840	| IOT033 |	Like that's a lot of a big ass
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:02,144	| IOT033 |	For a device that dispenses tea
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:08,032	| IOT033 |	It is yet I actually met two people at the show who tried the tea and Ashley
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:09,056	| IOT033 |	Put money down and bought it
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:11,872	| IOT033 |	Oh yeah I remember talking to one of those guys I got one
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:13,920	| IOT033 |	Wow
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:18,784	| IOT033 |	He's like what he was breaking it down right like if I get seven uses out of it or if I get
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:22,624	| IOT033 |	You know a hundred uses out of it at seven bucks a t which I guess if you do
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:23,904	| IOT033 |	Kind of the macro
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:27,232	| IOT033 |	The big picture on it I guess you could do that but it's still just like
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:28,256	| IOT033 |	Wow that's a lot of money
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:34,656	| IOT033 |	The other that I'm I'm actually curious about it from my family might be worth the money as the coffee maker
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:36,448	| IOT033 |	Can you put green beans in
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:38,240	| IOT033 |	Not green beans
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:39,520	| IOT033 |	Not like string beans
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:40,288	| IOT033 |	But like you put
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:41,824	| IOT033 |	Yeah green coffee beans in
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:44,640	| IOT033 |	It roasts and Brews the coffee for you
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:46,176	| IOT033 |	Again
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:48,736	| IOT033 |	Customizing it to your particular taste
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:51,552	| IOT033 |	This is the cellar coffee maker and is not available
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:52,832	| IOT033 |	This is
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:59,744	| IOT033 |	This coffee maker looks like it was extruded from like a spaceship man that it's it's very pretty it has literally no
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:03,584	| IOT033 |	No button switch me that's a deal-breaker for me cuz you can only control it from your app but
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:05,888	| IOT033 |	And not like present-day spaceships
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:07,936	| IOT033 |	Spike future spaceships that are all
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:10,752	| IOT033 |	Cool looking I was going to say like mid-century modern spaceship
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:12,544	| IOT033 |	Beautiful design
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:15,360	| IOT033 |	Tamara 2001 right
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:18,176	| IOT033 |	So so yes
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:22,272	| IOT033 |	I am with you I am intrigued by the coffee maker as well I don't know how much it cost
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:24,320	| IOT033 |	Alright well let's hit your platform
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:28,416	| IOT033 |	I'm texting question and I've listened to your guys's show for a long time
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:29,952	| IOT033 |	Somebody even say I was there at the beginning
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:34,560	| IOT033 |	Thank you Chris somebody to say that you
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:37,120	| IOT033 |	Pushed us to start the show against our will
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:37,632	| IOT033 |	I did
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:39,936	| IOT033 |	Because I had to
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:41,216	| IOT033 |	Turn the Sala. Make it all about me
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:45,312	| IOT033 |	The platform questions so when I get to the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:50,944	| IOT033 |	Right or in this is something that you guys have touched on a lot which is what's going to communicate with
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:54,016	| IOT033 |	What other things what platforms are going to survive
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:58,624	| IOT033 |	And I look at the Amazon Echo and I think that's really neat and if I can connect it
EDL	00:40:58,624	00:41:00,928	| IOT033 |	Giganta like some kind of visual dashboard
EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:04,000	| IOT033 |	I could see that being really useful at the conductor in the kitchen
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:06,304	| IOT033 |	But I don't need it I don't have Amazon music
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:09,120	| IOT033 |	I have Amazon Prime video
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:11,936	| IOT033 |	Which might be interesting but I don't really want that in the kitchen
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:13,984	| IOT033 |	And you know I'm
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:15,520	| IOT033 |	I'm on an iOS
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:19,872	| IOT033 |	Where does it get to with the do I have to create a separate
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:24,736	| IOT033 |	Ecosystem in my kitchen that Amazon between Dash buttons and Echo
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:27,552	| IOT033 |	Or we know how does this all tie in together
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:28,832	| IOT033 |	That
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:31,392	| IOT033 |	That fits into my life in a way that's going to stick around
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:32,416	| IOT033 |	Would that be be
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:33,440	| IOT033 |	Echo
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:35,232	| IOT033 |	Babe
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:39,840	| IOT033 |	That is one of those niggling awful questions
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:41,120	| IOT033 |	And if we're lucky
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:43,936	| IOT033 |	It will all just work itself out and work
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:45,728	| IOT033 |	If we're unlucky
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:47,520	| IOT033 |	Which is where we are right now
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:49,568	| IOT033 |	You're going to be stuck
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:50,848	| IOT033 |	Dealing
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:51,360	| IOT033 |	With
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:53,919	| IOT033 |	A bunch of devices
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:55,711	| IOT033 |	That only talked to each other
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:57,247	| IOT033 |	What's a lot of work
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,783	| IOT033 |	Or don't talk to each other at all
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:00,575	| IOT033 |	And
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:01,599	| IOT033 |	It's going to stink
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:08,255	| IOT033 |	And that's a terrible question I mean that's a terrible answer to your totally legit question in this is why consumers have not yet adopted
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:09,791	| IOT033 |	Like a lot of faces
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:14,655	| IOT033 |	Because I could almost see you like I can
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:17,983	| IOT033 |	I almost see Amazon being the echo system in my kitchen
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:20,799	| IOT033 |	Because it's also tied into my shopping
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:25,151	| IOT033 |	And then I almost feel like I'm going to have apple for my entertainment because I'm already
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:27,199	| IOT033 |	Kind of deep in with the entertainment
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:29,247	| IOT033 |	With the movies and stuff
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:30,527	| IOT033 |	In the living room
EDL	00:42:30,527	00:42:31,295	| IOT033 |	Through them
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:33,599	| IOT033 |	Okay so you got Amazon in the kitchen
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:34,879	| IOT033 |	Apple in the living room
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:36,159	| IOT033 |	And then
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:38,463	| IOT033 |	Lord only knows what is send the rest of your house
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:41,279	| IOT033 |	Well right now it's a giant mess
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:42,559	| IOT033 |	Okay well
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:47,679	| IOT033 |	I'm glad that we've settled you know at least two rooms and it maybe you'll have a magic
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:48,191	| IOT033 |	Bridge between
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:54,335	| IOT033 |	Well the one bridge that I do like the true play came out today that you play software update for the Sonos
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:57,151	| IOT033 |	This is why I love
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:42:58,687	| IOT033 |	My Sonos
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:01,503	| IOT033 |	And I'm really excited cuz they did they trueplay witch
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:04,575	| IOT033 |	Optimizes the sound in your room
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:06,367	| IOT033 |	Based on where you place the speaker
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:10,975	| IOT033 |	Until I ran through and did it this morning walking around my house waiting my phone up and down
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:13,279	| IOT033 |	With a microphone aimed at the speaker 2
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:14,559	| IOT033 |	Optimize my phone
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:18,143	| IOT033 |	Arabic crestfallen when it said you're serious placements fine
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:21,215	| IOT033 |	We made a couple of Minor Adjustments but don't worry about it
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:24,287	| IOT033 |	OC I'll have to go do this
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:25,823	| IOT033 |	Yes cuz I was really excited about this
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:28,383	| IOT033 |	So I will
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:28,895	| IOT033 |	Can't wait
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:33,759	| IOT033 |	I'm I will also go and download the true play update on my Sonos has
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:35,551	| IOT033 |	Maybe I will
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,343	| IOT033 |	Does it adapt
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:40,415	| IOT033 |	The speakers or does it tell you to place them in a better spot
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:47,071	| IOT033 |	What it just says place just because we're going to play some so I have one in the kitchen and then one in kind of living room area
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:49,375	| IOT033 |	And there different sections of the house
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:50,143	| IOT033 |	And
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:51,679	| IOT033 |	It says it shows you a video
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:53,983	| IOT033 |	How to waive your phone up and down
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:44:01,151	| IOT033 |	Sound and you walk around the room where you listen to the music waving your phone up and down in like a wave like a sine wave or whatever
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:03,455	| IOT033 |	And then it did
