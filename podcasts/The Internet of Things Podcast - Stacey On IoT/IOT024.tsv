EDL	00:00:06,656	00:00:12,032	| IOT024 |	Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things show I have your house
EDL	00:00:12,032	00:00:14,592	| IOT024 |	Stacey Higginbotham and this is my co-host
EDL	00:00:14,592	00:00:15,616	| IOT024 |	Kevin coval
EDL	00:00:15,616	00:00:16,384	| IOT024 |	And
EDL	00:00:16,384	00:00:17,920	| IOT024 |	Let's see we have got a
EDL	00:00:17,920	00:00:19,712	| IOT024 |	Great show for you today but
EDL	00:00:19,712	00:00:23,296	| IOT024 |	Here's a quick note we are not going to talk about Apple because
EDL	00:00:23,808	00:00:28,160	| IOT024 |	The timing of Apple's event we consulted with Evan you know what they did
EDL	00:00:28,928	00:00:30,976	| IOT024 |	Didn't move the event I mean I don't understand
EDL	00:00:31,488	00:00:33,536	| IOT024 |	No we record on a Tuesday
EDL	00:00:33,536	00:00:37,632	| IOT024 |	And Wednesday is when Apple's holding their event and Thursday is when we do the podcast
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:38,656	| IOT024 |	So
EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:40,960	| IOT024 |	Instead of us
EDL	00:00:40,960	00:00:44,288	| IOT024 |	Speculating and then being proven right or wrong
EDL	00:00:44,800	00:00:45,824	| IOT024 |	Probably wrong
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:48,896	| IOT024 |	We are just going to hold it till next week so
EDL	00:00:48,896	00:00:50,688	| IOT024 |	All your Apple news will be next week
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:52,480	| IOT024 |	And we will open at that time
EDL	00:00:52,480	00:00:54,784	| IOT024 |	I do hope that we see a lot of homekit stuff
EDL	00:00:55,296	00:00:58,880	| IOT024 |	I do too I have been talking to sources in
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:01:00,160	| IOT024 |	They also hope that
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:02,720	| IOT024 |	You never know what the last minute Apple
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:03,488	| IOT024 |	Has been known
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:06,048	| IOT024 |	The poor things so I'm hoping there's an update
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:08,608	| IOT024 |	And we see some realistic awesome cool things
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:13,216	| IOT024 |	We have been told that September and fall was the time frame for that so
EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:14,752	| IOT024 |	Fingers crossed everyone
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:18,848	| IOT024 |	Is very intelligent and connected people familiar with the matter
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:19,616	| IOT024 |	Say that
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:20,384	| IOT024 |	They will be home
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:22,432	| IOT024 |	And it will be greatly in
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:23,712	| IOT024 |	Prove so
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:24,224	| IOT024 |	Next week
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:25,504	| IOT024 |	We have talked
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:27,296	| IOT024 |	Nothing but homekit is what we are
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:29,088	| IOT024 |	Nothing but home test
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:31,136	| IOT024 |	So all right
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:32,160	| IOT024 |	Onto the show
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:33,696	| IOT024 |	So let's get started with
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:34,720	| IOT024 |	Nest
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:35,744	| IOT024 |	Outages
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:41,632	| IOT024 |	It just happened it just happened last night that they before we are recording the show
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:44,704	| IOT024 |	And I was affected by a square
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:48,032	| IOT024 |	Because around 9 p.m. eastern time
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:51,872	| IOT024 |	On Monday evening the Labor Day holiday here in the US
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:58,272	| IOT024 |	Nobody could connect to their nest I was in my app and it's like just turned and turning and turning and then finally said
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:01:59,552	| IOT024 |	Can't do it
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,088	| IOT024 |	It turns out that
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:03,904	| IOT024 |	That's was aware there was a service outage
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:06,720	| IOT024 |	And me work on a fix for about 3 hours and
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,256	| IOT024 |	At midnight everything was bad
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:09,792	| IOT024 |	Which is great
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:10,560	| IOT024 |	And all
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,072	| IOT024 |	But
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:17,984	| IOT024 |	This really irks me Anna and I shouldn't complain he was like hey firstworldproblems you I could get out of bed to go downstairs to turn
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:19,008	| IOT024 |	Turn the air conditioning up over
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,056	| IOT024 |	I know life is tough
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,080	| IOT024 |	The point is
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:24,128	| IOT024 |	Is what I said for a long time
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:28,736	| IOT024 |	I worry about iot devices that rely solely on the cloud
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:33,088	| IOT024 |	I don't like them for this very reason that's why I went with that insteon system
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,368	| IOT024 |	And the Headless server
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:36,416	| IOT024 |	4 years ago 5 years ago now I'm in
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:38,464	| IOT024 |	It didn't matter if the
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:41,024	| IOT024 |	Cloud services went down because all of my rules
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:41,792	| IOT024 |	Everything was
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:44,352	| IOT024 |	Still available locally and things just worked
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:46,912	| IOT024 |	Hold on
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:52,800	| IOT024 |	Your Nest would still work if you got out of bed and touched the dial
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,312	| IOT024 |	Correct
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,360	| IOT024 |	Yes but that
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:58,432	| IOT024 |	Yes y'all can't do I just I want to make that clear
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,968	| IOT024 |	No you're absolutely right
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:03,040	| IOT024 |	Can the nest itself still work as a will call it a day
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:06,112	| IOT024 |	Old school manual thermostat
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:09,440	| IOT024 |	In the fact that you could still go up to it
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:12,512	| IOT024 |	Turn the temperature adjusted turn it off to whatever
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,792	| IOT024 |	It was the
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:15,584	| IOT024 |	Ability to access it remotely
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:20,448	| IOT024 |	Weather in new home or out of a home that was lost but the cloud service itself you couldn't
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:22,496	| IOT024 |	You couldn't remotely connect
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:25,568	| IOT024 |	To your nest from a nest app
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,104	| IOT024 |	See your dropped
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,896	| IOT024 |	Nope
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,920	| IOT024 |	So that that is a
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:35,296	| IOT024 |	Probably a bigger problem but I don't have a Dropcam so I was
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:37,856	| IOT024 |	Obviously not affected by that you're absolutely correct
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:41,440	| IOT024 |	Okay so I am and I wonder about the smoke alarms
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,512	| IOT024 |	The smoke alarms with still work
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,792	| IOT024 |	As a smoke alarm
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,840	| IOT024 |	Set a fire
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,120	| IOT024 |	They would still
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,144	| IOT024 |	Be back
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,168	| IOT024 |	But remote
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,192	| IOT024 |	Access Lake
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:55,776	| IOT024 |	Telling you like your batteries out or something like that I'm sure
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,056	| IOT024 |	Compromised
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,080	| IOT024 |	Agree
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:00,128	| IOT024 |	Again these are not
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:02,944	| IOT024 |	Major problem depressed back in the stone ages
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:07,552	| IOT024 |	It's just you know the promise of the cloud as being the
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,344	| IOT024 |	The bridge for all things IRT
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:12,160	| IOT024 |	It's just not a perfect scenario
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,184	| IOT024 |	And and
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,720	| IOT024 |	Extra dark me for the longest
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:19,071	| IOT024 |	Time cuz I'm like I kept saying is going to happen someday it's going to happen to be affected and boom it happen
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,375	| IOT024 |	And how were you affected
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,703	| IOT024 |	I had to go
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,239	| IOT024 |	All the way down stay I know I don't want to come
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:29,823	| IOT024 |	Beacon Grand scheme of things it's a small problem
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:34,943	| IOT024 |	I'm great but it speaks to the larger issue of ever so much Reliance on the cloud instead of
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,735	| IOT024 |	Having some type of hybrid type
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:40,063	| IOT024 |	Cloud / local systems for iot
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:46,463	| IOT024 |	It's true and actually with SmartThings their latest thing that just came out they actually put some local Intelligence on it for the
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,231	| IOT024 |	That exact reason
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,303	| IOT024 |	Because the cloud does fail sometimes
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:50,815	| IOT024 |	Seether
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:56,191	| IOT024 |	Massively like the nest systemwide outage or even just locally it's like
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:57,983	| IOT024 |	Your own personal internet camp
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:58,495	| IOT024 |	They relied on
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:00,287	| IOT024 |	Make sense
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:01,567	| IOT024 |	Witness
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:04,895	| IOT024 |	I'm trying to think they don't really have
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:07,199	| IOT024 |	Because of the way their system is designed
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:14,367	| IOT024 |	I'm not sure where they would put the brains because if you're thinking about having brains for a smart home system
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,647	| IOT024 |	You have to have a hug
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:23,071	| IOT024 |	The hover were server something that can still manage the devices in lieu of a cloud
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,887	| IOT024 |	With Google's new rap
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:32,799	| IOT024 |	And it's new fun weave and Brillo maybe they just pop that into
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:38,431	| IOT024 |	You know you pop Weaver Brillo into any sort of router and that becomes your hub
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:38,943	| IOT024 |	And they could talk
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:46,367	| IOT024 |	Yeah I mean I could see that and I like that idea as a secondary / backup system I don't want to sit here
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:49,951	| IOT024 |	And say I need to run a nest server in my house I don't want that
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,487	| IOT024 |	But I do want some
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:55,839	| IOT024 |	Physical device that have those rules that can take over
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:58,655	| IOT024 |	Freenas or whatever that product Maybe
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,423	| IOT024 |	When the cloud
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,215	| IOT024 |	System breaks down
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:03,519	| IOT024 |	Does any of those systems need some sort of
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:06,079	| IOT024 |	Basically you need like an arm cortex
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,359	| IOT024 |	Kind of chip in that
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:07,871	| IOT024 |	Because you
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:14,271	| IOT024 |	The microcontrollers that are inside like an aster any other kind of connected device probably isn't
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:16,063	| IOT024 |	Powerful enough to run the all
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:22,207	| IOT024 |	I think that's fair and I don't know that I want localized
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,743	| IOT024 |	Wheels and storage in
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,791	| IOT024 |	Intelligence in all of my
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:31,935	| IOT024 |	My actual devices I like the idea that you were talking about a hub or put it into a router or something
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:32,703	| IOT024 |	Where again
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:36,031	| IOT024 |	If the devices are peeing in their cloud services
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:37,823	| IOT024 |	Custom colors outage
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,103	| IOT024 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:43,711	| IOT024 |	Reba Harbor whatever the brain's is local branch as well that's a problem
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:46,271	| IOT024 |	I'm going to go to my localized rules now
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:50,111	| IOT024 |	And I'll keep peeing in the cloud when the car comes back we'll switch back over to the cloud service
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:51,391	| IOT024 |	So do that
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,231	| IOT024 |	The dreaded s word
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,535	| IOT024 |	So I like that
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:59,583	| IOT024 |	And while we're on the topic I should ask you
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:01,375	| IOT024 |	Speaking of the Google router
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,143	| IOT024 |	Did you
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:02,911	| IOT024 |	Perhaps
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:05,471	| IOT024 |	Purchase 100 the onhub yes yes yes
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:11,871	| IOT024 |	So I literally just before the show check to see if it was available in the PlayStore been checking on a pretty much a day
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,639	| IOT024 |	Basis
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:14,175	| IOT024 |	It has not been in stock
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:14,943	| IOT024 |	However
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:21,855	| IOT024 |	Also just before the show I check bestbuy.com and they do have them in stock at the normal 199
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:23,135	| IOT024 |	99 price
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:25,183	| IOT024 |	Could go to Amazon to buy an onhub but you
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:28,255	| IOT024 |	Pay 28999 right now because of the markup switches
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,023	| IOT024 |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:30,303	| IOT024 |	Don't do that people please don't do that
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:33,631	| IOT024 |	So I do have one coming cuz I just ordered it
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:40,031	| IOT024 |	It will be here I did not do expedited shipping soda be on Thursday when it's podcast was live which gives us something
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,567	| IOT024 |	Something to discuss next week
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:44,127	| IOT024 |	All right so hopefully we'll talk about
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:45,407	| IOT024 |	Homekit
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:47,711	| IOT024 |	So I did not because
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,735	| IOT024 |	Kevin is buying the router
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:50,783	| IOT024 |	I decided I did not
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,551	| IOT024 |	I want to buy the router
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:52,319	| IOT024 |	Nor did I buy the
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:53,855	| IOT024 |	So4
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:58,719	| IOT024 |	A few people who ask me who sent me emails like did you buy the handbag
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:00,511	| IOT024 |	Did you buy the router if the answer is Ibotta
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:04,607	| IOT024 |	That's a tough decision I feel you there
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:08,447	| IOT024 |	Handbags are very but it would have
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:08,959	| IOT024 |	Who's going to hold my
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,263	| IOT024 |	Not just any hair
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,823	| IOT024 |	If it was a connected handbag I think you would have had it
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:17,407	| IOT024 |	Spot someone did send me
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,687	| IOT024 |	Synthetic
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,455	| IOT024 |	Twitter
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,991	| IOT024 |	Perfect leave it behind your phone
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:26,111	| IOT024 |	Rings or something
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,159	| IOT024 |	I just need to bite the bullet and buy them
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:28,927	| IOT024 |	It was because
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:31,999	| IOT024 |	I've been leaving stuff left and right I need to put one of my water bong
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,303	| IOT024 |	You know what that's what I'm going to
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,583	| IOT024 |	That is what I
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,095	| IOT024 |	Tile
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:42,751	| IOT024 |	Those are the Bluetooth tags that remind you when you've left something behind for people who do not know
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:48,127	| IOT024 |	Yes there's a Bluetooth has and they actually recently just got an update so they actually have a louder alarm
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,175	| IOT024 |	And by golly
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,199	| IOT024 |	I need them
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:56,319	| IOT024 |	And best of all they don't rely on cloud services
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,367	| IOT024 |	Speaking of cloud service
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,415	| IOT024 |	Who actually
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,183	| IOT024 |	Posted something
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:03,999	| IOT024 |	On Google Plus which I saw because no one else
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:09,631	| IOT024 |	Like I told my hundred thousand plus followers over there
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:10,143	| IOT024 |	Miss Augusta
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,935	| IOT024 |	Wow a hundred thousand
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,239	| IOT024 |	Kevin you are the Lord of
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:16,287	| IOT024 |	Google play oh no no no other people
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:19,359	| IOT024 |	The far more important to me that has millions of
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,639	| IOT024 |	A followers of Arabic
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,199	| IOT024 |	You and Larry Page
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:25,503	| IOT024 |	Alright so
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,551	| IOT024 |	You said that
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,063	| IOT024 |	Google
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:30,111	| IOT024 |	Should buy if this then that
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:36,255	| IOT024 |	And I thought that was a really fun topic that we should we should talk about but first we should tell people what is 2
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,023	| IOT024 |	System that is
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:38,047	| IOT024 |	You want to do the honors
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:42,399	| IOT024 |	Oh no you do that because you are the IFTTT Queen
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:45,215	| IOT024 |	So is this and that is a web service
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:46,751	| IOT024 |	The basically connect
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,287	| IOT024 |	Your
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:50,079	| IOT024 |	It's actually any web service
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:53,407	| IOT024 |	To any other web service or any device
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,431	| IOT024 |	So using the
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,223	| IOT024 |	Programming language
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:58,015	| IOT024 |	If this happens
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,295	| IOT024 |	Then that happens
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,599	| IOT024 |	You can link things like
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:03,135	| IOT024 |	Your phone to your Dropbox
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:04,671	| IOT024 |	So if I take a picture
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,439	| IOT024 |	With my
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,719	| IOT024 |	IOS or Android phone
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:08,767	| IOT024 |	Then
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,559	| IOT024 |	Send that picture to Dropbox
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,863	| IOT024 |	Or it could be something as fun as
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,911	| IOT024 |	If the Cardinals score a point
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,703	| IOT024 |	Then my Hue Lights
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,215	| IOT024 |	Turn red
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:20,031	| IOT024 |	All of these are actual recipes that I've cream
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,567	| IOT024 |	Created using cannabis pen that
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,359	| IOT024 |	I have created in my time with
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:26,175	| IOT024 |	The service probably dozens of recipes
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,711	| IOT024 |	It's super fun
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:28,991	| IOT024 |	I recommend it to every
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:33,343	| IOT024 |	Because I almost when people ask me what it is I almost tell them
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:35,391	| IOT024 |	I don't know if you know what an API is butt
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:37,695	| IOT024 |	If this then that is almost like apis for dummies
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:40,767	| IOT024 |	Yes I would never use apis because I'm always
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:41,535	| IOT024 |	Trying to explain it
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:42,815	| IOT024 |	What's the weather like
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,583	| IOT024 |	They don't know what it is
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:46,143	| IOT024 |	Sure
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:50,495	| IOT024 |	Thank you this is why you should have explained
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,031	| IOT024 |	You did fine I just
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:52,799	| IOT024 |	YouTube
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:53,311	| IOT024 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:54,591	| IOT024 |	So that's what if
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:56,639	| IOT024 |	The shorthand for it
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,431	| IOT024 |	So yes
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:00,479	| IOT024 |	So that's the service and they also have something big
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,271	| IOT024 |	Do
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,295	| IOT024 |	Like two buttons
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,319	| IOT024 |	Hindus are
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:07,647	| IOT024 |	Like a single button that you press that make something happen
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:12,511	| IOT024 |	So on my phone I have one that turns off my bedside table light at connect to Hue
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:15,327	| IOT024 |	My Hue lamp on my bedside table and when I
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:16,607	| IOT024 |	Push that button
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,655	| IOT024 |	Hue lamp
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,167	| IOT024 |	Turn soft
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:22,751	| IOT024 |	I used to have one for my gigaohms slack Channel
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:25,055	| IOT024 |	Where I pressed it it said
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,079	| IOT024 |	Stacy is
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:27,359	| IOT024 |	Away from her desk
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:30,431	| IOT024 |	But I no longer have that because I no longer have
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,455	| IOT024 |	Mike Ditka
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:31,967	| IOT024 |	Slack Channel
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:35,039	| IOT024 |	Because there is no longer a gigaom that I work at
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:38,623	| IOT024 |	The do buttons kind of interesting because
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:42,719	| IOT024 |	It is an easy way to create one touch shortcuts for your recipes
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:45,535	| IOT024 |	Kappa button and whatever you want it to happen
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:50,911	| IOT024 |	And the nice thing is in this is what led me to my comment about Google should buy them is
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:54,495	| IOT024 |	They have brought the two button they being if this then that
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,519	| IOT024 |	Hey Brother Dubai
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:57,311	| IOT024 |	To Google's Android Wear watches
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:00,383	| IOT024 |	So now you've got Quick One Touch shortcuts
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,407	| IOT024 |	For whatever
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:03,711	| IOT024 |	Recipes and things do you setup
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:06,271	| IOT024 |	And some of the examples that the if this then that team
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,807	| IOT024 |	Provide adjusted
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,575	| IOT024 |	Illustrate this
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,367	| IOT024 |	With a three-button you can
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:13,439	| IOT024 |	Free sample set your nest thermostat to the perfect temperature
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,719	| IOT024 |	Assuming a services
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:19,839	| IOT024 |	You can block off an hour or next hours busy in Google Calendar so nobody will
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:21,887	| IOT024 |	You know bother you a notification to come in
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:25,983	| IOT024 |	Don't download the slack bit you could ask Ali some slack if they want coffee
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:27,519	| IOT024 |	To the pre-programmed buttons
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:29,567	| IOT024 |	Made by software and
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:31,359	| IOT024 |	And if this then that recipes
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:34,175	| IOT024 |	My neighbor watches perfect for the
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:35,199	| IOT024 |	I just thought it was a
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:36,735	| IOT024 |	Really really smart
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:40,319	| IOT024 |	Place to put the seasoning on the home screen of your smartphone is good to of course but
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:42,111	| IOT024 |	The more I thought about it like you know
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:45,695	| IOT024 |	We're past the point where smartphones are just
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,719	| IOT024 |	You know
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:52,351	| IOT024 |	Functional connected devices where we going to have to go do something and then we're. Never going to another app would do somewhere.
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:56,447	| IOT024 |	We want these things to start reacting to our knees we want these things to just
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,727	| IOT024 |	Do more
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:13:01,567	| IOT024 |	And yet we don't want the complexity of having to program them to do more
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:05,151	| IOT024 |	It's really not complexed to do that with the do but I don't like Google
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:07,199	| IOT024 |	What huge opportunity you have right here too
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:11,295	| IOT024 |	To advance the smartphone by integrating if this then that right
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,575	| IOT024 |	Into Android natively
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:17,695	| IOT024 |	Exactly it actually in talking to Linden Tibbets who is the CEO of Lyft
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:19,999	| IOT024 |	He actually wants to do
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:22,047	| IOT024 |	Dudududu
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:25,119	| IOT024 |	He wants to integrate the do button into apps
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,399	| IOT024 |	So
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:27,679	| IOT024 |	It's very easy
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,215	| IOT024 |	To like
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:30,239	| IOT024 |	Right now with
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,007	| IOT024 |	Android
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,799	| IOT024 |	I think Android and iOS
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:35,615	| IOT024 |	It actually there's a do for photos
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,407	| IOT024 |	Can I do for nose
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:39,711	| IOT024 |	So when you take a photo
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:42,527	| IOT024 |	You have a dual button that will automatically like
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:47,135	| IOT024 |	When you take a photo it automatically does something with the photo so you
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:47,647	| IOT024 |	You hit the button
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:51,743	| IOT024 |	It automatically like sends it to Dropbox are automatically
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:55,327	| IOT024 |	Posted
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:58,143	| IOT024 |	So that kind of like again what button
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:59,935	| IOT024 |	Support that you can build
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:01,471	| IOT024 |	Is so
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:04,287	| IOT024 |	Easy and powerful and customizable
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,823	| IOT024 |	If you can imagine that
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,615	| IOT024 |	All over your phone
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:09,919	| IOT024 |	With anything that you any app
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,431	| IOT024 |	That you use
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:11,711	| IOT024 |	Enough
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:12,735	| IOT024 |	That's awesome
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:14,783	| IOT024 |	I mean it really is and
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,575	| IOT024 |	They have over a hundred
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,343	| IOT024 |	60 Channel Park
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,903	| IOT024 |	And they span the web
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:22,207	| IOT024 |	The crossover the physical devices
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,511	| IOT024 |	It is nuts
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,279	| IOT024 |	I love it
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,559	| IOT024 |	Horse of the echo
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,119	| IOT024 |	It works with the echo although
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:32,703	| IOT024 |	The triggers are a little limited there and the triggers are limited on
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,471	| IOT024 |	All of the things
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:34,495	| IOT024 |	But
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:37,311	| IOT024 |	When you think of companies like
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:39,871	| IOT024 |	Google would be great because they're open
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:41,663	| IOT024 |	Like apple could also buy it and then just
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,199	| IOT024 |	Shut it down
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:44,991	| IOT024 |	Only use it with that
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:46,527	| IOT024 |	Ecosystem kind of like Appleton
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:47,295	| IOT024 |	Testflight right
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,623	| IOT024 |	How do you say
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,159	| IOT024 |	So
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:53,695	| IOT024 |	Facebook would be another good
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,719	| IOT024 |	Fire actually
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:56,511	| IOT024 |	Because Facebook's really trying to
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:01,375	| IOT024 |	Control the mobile lab and build out this amazing walled-garden kind of
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:04,447	| IOT024 |	Really fast Speedy web services
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:07,007	| IOT024 |	So I could see Facebook being a
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:07,519	| IOT024 |	A good buyer for
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,847	| IOT024 |	I don't know but I really think
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,383	| IOT024 |	And of course you know
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,151	| IOT024 |	Is the synapse
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:19,039	| IOT024 |	It's a really undervalued service and maybe it's because there's not a lot of people using it
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,599	| IOT024 |	But I think thinking about it as a
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:27,231	| IOT024 |	As a service with users as opposed to thinking about it is this amazing back end
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,535	| IOT024 |	For the next generation of Lake
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,047	| IOT024 |	I guess like this
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:34,911	| IOT024 |	Underpinning or service that underpins the entire mobile web is like a better way
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,191	| IOT024 |	Think about it
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,727	| IOT024 |	I completely agree I mean
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:39,519	| IOT024 |	We talked about if this then that
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,799	| IOT024 |	Many times before but
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,591	| IOT024 |	It still
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:46,431	| IOT024 |	To the mainstream person I think it's still very esoteric I don't think
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,967	| IOT024 |	It's very commonly known
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:51,551	| IOT024 |	And yet it provides tremendous value with such little investment
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:54,111	| IOT024 |	And that's why I'd like to see is you said that you know
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,647	| IOT024 |	Focused on non-users
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:58,207	| IOT024 |	And I think I'm going to go could really push that
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:01,791	| IOT024 |	You know there's lots of other potential buyers as you said
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:03,583	| IOT024 |	Where would be a good fit
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,887	| IOT024 |	Right now I think the best it would be Android Google Android
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:06,911	| IOT024 |	Already
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:07,935	| IOT024 |	So
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,471	| IOT024 |	There we go
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:10,751	| IOT024 |	Just sold off if the
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,031	| IOT024 |	This and that
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:13,567	| IOT024 |	And if you haven't tried it
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,335	| IOT024 |	Please
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,615	| IOT024 |	Go try it because
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:18,431	| IOT024 |	I guarantee you like even my even my daughter and I we have
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:20,991	| IOT024 |	It's just addictive
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:23,551	| IOT024 |	Yeah we get commission if I do Byron
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:24,575	| IOT024 |	Yes
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,087	| IOT024 |	Speakers
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:26,879	| IOT024 |	There's so many things
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,903	| IOT024 |	For sale
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:29,439	| IOT024 |	I do think they actually have
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,279	| IOT024 |	I'm alright
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:38,143	| IOT024 |	Let's eat before we go we should probably talk a little bit about some Enterprise news
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:41,471	| IOT024 |	Is that is worth talking about which is last week at FIFA
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:42,751	| IOT024 |	Which is like
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:44,543	| IOT024 |	Who is it like the CES of Europe
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:50,687	| IOT024 |	Yeah it's actually bigger than CES if I'm not mistaken it's like the largest type trait event and that kind in the world
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:52,991	| IOT024 |	Impute
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:55,807	| IOT024 |	So arm and IBM
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:56,575	| IOT024 |	Announced
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,343	| IOT024 |	A partnership
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:59,903	| IOT024 |	They actually have had a partnership for a while
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:01,951	| IOT024 |	They just basically took it alot.
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,999	| IOT024 |	Deeper and then IBM also announced
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,279	| IOT024 |	Tweaks and addons
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:08,095	| IOT024 |	You know IBM is very good it like
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,375	| IOT024 |	Basically
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:11,167	| IOT024 |	Taking news that it's already announced in in
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:12,703	| IOT024 |	Adding a little bit of
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:14,239	| IOT024 |	Some extra tweet
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:15,007	| IOT024 |	Jason Phillips Twitter
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,055	| IOT024 |	Now I'm going to make it to
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:19,359	| IOT024 |	And put out another press release
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:20,895	| IOT024 |	So
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:22,687	| IOT024 |	Basically what what they did is
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:24,735	| IOT024 |	IBM has a
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:28,063	| IOT024 |	Take back in Cloud product foundations
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:30,111	| IOT024 |	And it's part of it
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,391	| IOT024 |	Bluematrix
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:31,903	| IOT024 |	Cloud
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:32,927	| IOT024 |	Product
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,975	| IOT024 |	What this is is
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:37,791	| IOT024 |	You basically send all of your iot connected
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:38,815	| IOT024 |	Device information
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:40,607	| IOT024 |	Up there
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:42,143	| IOT024 |	Data analytics
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,679	| IOT024 |	Scott device
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,703	| IOT024 |	Management
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:47,775	| IOT024 |	Compliance kind of stuff all the stuff you basically need to like
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,567	| IOT024 |	Have all this device stayed in
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,615	| IOT024 |	And what arm has done
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:54,943	| IOT024 |	Is they taking their mbed OS which is
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:57,247	| IOT024 |	A real time operating system for their
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,783	| IOT024 |	Microcontrollers
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,831	| IOT024 |	And any other kind of
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,879	| IOT024 |	Arm-based microcontroller
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:05,183	| IOT024 |	And the connected the two
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,719	| IOT024 |	With a line of code or two
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:08,511	| IOT024 |	You can basically connect
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,791	| IOT024 |	Anything running
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:11,327	| IOT024 |	Mbed OS
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:11,839	| IOT024 |	2
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,631	| IOT024 |	IBM's
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,655	| IOT024 |	Iot Foundation
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:19,775	| IOT024 |	It's basically an easy way to connect any device
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,055	| IOT024 |	Tybee
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:22,847	| IOT024 |	And
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:23,871	| IOT024 |	That is important
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,639	| IOT024 |	Because
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,919	| IOT024 |	Well I'm thinking Analytics
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:32,319	| IOT024 |	Python thinking big data analytics because that's where IBM is really pushing the boundaries these days you know what the
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:34,111	| IOT024 |	Watson platform for example
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:38,719	| IOT024 |	And I don't know the details of their IRT foundations Cloud product but I'm guessing that
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,999	| IOT024 |	It has to do a lot with
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:47,167	| IOT024 |	Reviewing all the data coming in from these devices
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:50,239	| IOT024 |	Safe place because you know you don't want all this data going
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,775	| IOT024 |	Any place like just any old cloud
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,311	| IOT024 |	It runs on spark
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:54,591	| IOT024 |	Which is
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:56,127	| IOT024 |	The real-time processing engine
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,407	| IOT024 |	You guys came up
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,199	| IOT024 |	It's not enough
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:01,759	| IOT024 |	I mean you could send it over to Watson if you wanted to
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:04,575	| IOT024 |	But it's a secure place to analyze all this data
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:07,647	| IOT024 |	And basically it's it's kind of like idiot
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:10,463	| IOT024 |	So if you're like the VP
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:15,839	| IOT024 |	Are the CTO of a company that's like making washing machines in here like hey we got a really get a connected
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:16,863	| IOT024 |	Washing machine
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,679	| IOT024 |	This is an easy way to say
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:23,007	| IOT024 |	I've got a bunch of arm-based chips and sensors
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,567	| IOT024 |	I need to put those in my washing machine
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:30,175	| IOT024 |	I need an easy way to get all of that data from Those sensors
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:33,247	| IOT024 |	Open to a secure cloud
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,271	| IOT024 |	And you know
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:35,807	| IOT024 |	Nobody gets fired for buying IBM
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:38,623	| IOT024 |	I'm going to send it on IBM's cloud
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,903	| IOT024 |	This is an easy way to do
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:41,439	| IOT024 |	And that's what this is
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:48,095	| IOT024 |	And it's not a way to like build a connected manufacturing center operation you know this isn't this isn't like
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,399	| IOT024 |	I'm sure IBM has products for that
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:56,543	| IOT024 |	But this is just a simple way to get your products connected
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:58,335	| IOT024 |	If you're like a big name company that
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:02,431	| IOT024 |	It doesn't want to spend a lot of time Reinventing the wheel when it
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:03,967	| IOT024 |	Most of the Internet of Things a building
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,247	| IOT024 |	Nectar product
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,527	| IOT024 |	I think
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:09,087	| IOT024 |	IBM among others are obviously
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:11,391	| IOT024 |	IBM is really well positioned here
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:12,671	| IOT024 |	2
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:14,207	| IOT024 |	You know provide
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,487	| IOT024 |	Device intelligence
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:18,815	| IOT024 |	And similar data and analytics to these device makers
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:21,375	| IOT024 |	Which will eventually hopefully make them smarter
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:23,423	| IOT024 |	I can't say I'm surprised by this
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:28,543	| IOT024 |	I know this is a long time coming now there are startups in the space there's companies like Ayla Networks
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:34,431	| IOT024 |	Venture-backed startup there's also electric it is kind of in the space they provide a
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:35,711	| IOT024 |	Cloud services well
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,015	| IOT024 |	They're older companies like
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:39,039	| IOT024 |	Exata
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:39,551	| IOT024 |	It was
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:41,343	| IOT024 |	Papaya PTC
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:43,135	| IOT024 |	They're a little bit different
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,927	| IOT024 |	But the offering sound a bit
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:45,695	| IOT024 |	The same
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:49,791	| IOT024 |	And the other thing to note is that this is using arms mbed OS
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,583	| IOT024 |	Prior to this most
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:57,727	| IOT024 |	Companies that you buy microcontrollers from they usually have their own proprietary operating systems
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:20:59,519	| IOT024 |	And
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:02,079	| IOT024 |	Arms mbed OS was introduced last year
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,871	| IOT024 |	Around this time
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:04,639	| IOT024 |	Two kind of
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:07,711	| IOT024 |	Cuz defragment that market would be a way to think about it
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:10,527	| IOT024 |	Are Bandit will become publicly available
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:14,879	| IOT024 |	Arm told me that it would become publicly available at Tech con this year which is in November
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:17,184	| IOT024 |	So we are all waiting for the
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:21,024	| IOT024 |	The public version right now it's in a beta version that you can download and play with
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:22,048	| IOT024 |	So
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:25,376	| IOT024 |	That is that is kind of this is a little bit more enterprising but it's
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,144	| IOT024 |	It's really important
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,448	| IOT024 |	So
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:32,800	| IOT024 |	This is this is kind of like IBM's big play here and it's not exclusive
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:34,848	| IOT024 |	Armor work with other clouds
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:38,176	| IOT024 |	Will work with other artists
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:38,688	| IOT024 |	So
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:39,968	| IOT024 |	Keep an eye out here
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:41,504	| IOT024 |	Pretty big deal
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,016	| IOT024 |	For both of these
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:44,320	| IOT024 |	And that
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:46,368	| IOT024 |	It's kind of the big enterprisenews there
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:50,720	| IOT024 |	I think we should probably skip ahead to our
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:53,280	| IOT024 |	Guessed which this week is Michael Wolff
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:56,096	| IOT024 |	He is actually a former colleague of ours
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,888	| IOT024 |	And he is an analyst

EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:09,920	| IOT024 |	Tiny bit of news that we heard
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:15,552	| IOT024 |	When we learn that Amazon was firing a lot of Hardware people which is that it has a secret project called cabinet
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:18,368	| IOT024 |	Lab126
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:19,392	| IOT024 |	It is a
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,416	| IOT024 |	Connected kitchen
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:20,928	| IOT024 |	So

EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:21,856	| IOT024 |	Man I used to call you like
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:24,928	| IOT024 |	Like a decade ago about like when you were at like ABI research
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:26,720	| IOT024 |	Like I interviewed you about like
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:27,232	| IOT024 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:28,768	| IOT024 |	I don't know if you remember that
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:32,864	| IOT024 |	At this point have gray hair and I've been falling asleep way too long

EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:40,800	| IOT024 |	At that
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:44,384	| IOT024 |	That's why we're so late Jazz to be here and talking about
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:45,664	| IOT024 |	Smart
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,176	| IOT024 |	Kitchen
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:48,736	| IOT024 |	I'm just going to warn everybody listening right now
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:53,088	| IOT024 |	About a month ago you guys may remember I had a shift on the show talking
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:55,136	| IOT024 |	About connected ovens and connected
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:55,648	| IOT024 |	Cooking and
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,696	| IOT024 |	If you guys aren't into that thing
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,768	| IOT024 |	He might not be excited about the show cuz we are going to talk about
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:02,560	| IOT024 |	Same sort of topic again
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:04,096	| IOT024 |	But this time with the attitudes hook
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:05,888	| IOT024 |	Amazon
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:08,192	| IOT024 |	And its plans for something called
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,472	| IOT024 |	Cabinet
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,240	| IOT024 |	Mike
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:10,752	| IOT024 |	What do we know
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:14,592	| IOT024 |	Well we know that Amazon like to spell Cameron with a k
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:15,872	| IOT024 |	Like the Kardashians
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:16,640	| IOT024 |	Yes
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,408	| IOT024 |	Yes
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:23,552	| IOT024 |	And this is something that showed up in an article I Believe In The Wall Street Journal and it was almost an afterthought
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:24,576	| IOT024 |	It was an article about
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:29,952	| IOT024 |	How Amazon lab126 which is their hard work group for all the things like Amazon Fire
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,744	| IOT024 |	The Fire Phone excetera
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,024	| IOT024 |	It was about
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:36,096	| IOT024 |	The main focus of the articles about how they were laying off a big chunk of
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:36,864	| IOT024 |	The people who are
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:39,168	| IOT024 |	Responsible for the fire phone cuz that by and large
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,960	| IOT024 |	Interfire funny Crash and Burn
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:45,056	| IOT024 |	But apparently there's there's something else are working on called the cabinet which is
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:48,896	| IOT024 |	Called an article is called a smart kitchen computer or kitchen
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,688	| IOT024 |	And what's that
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:53,248	| IOT024 |	It got me to thinking about what this thing could be
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:55,808	| IOT024 |	So I wrote a post about it for Forbes
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,576	| IOT024 |	As well as my own
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:58,112	| IOT024 |	Am I on block and
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:03,744	| IOT024 |	That's what I would like to talk about me or just speculating about what exactly a kitchen computer from Amazon could be
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,792	| IOT024 |	I don't kiss like what I saw that
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,840	| IOT024 |	You actually were the first person I thought of
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:11,168	| IOT024 |	In Seattle maybe has
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,704	| IOT024 |	Snooze other lab 100
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:13,984	| IOT024 |	She's not in
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:14,752	| IOT024 |	Seattle
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:15,520	| IOT024 |	But
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:19,616	| IOT024 |	When I think of Amazon in their kitchen computer I actually think of the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:20,384	| IOT024 |	Which
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:22,176	| IOT024 |	It's actually on my kitchen counter
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:24,224	| IOT024 |	And we used to control
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:31,136	| IOT024 |	To me it's like our our calendar it is our question answer it turns on her lights and does all her stuff downstairs so that
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:33,184	| IOT024 |	Let me Hazard kitchen computer at orders
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:35,744	| IOT024 |	Keep track of my to-do list to my grocery list so I'm like
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:38,048	| IOT024 |	What on Earth would my
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:39,328	| IOT024 |	Kitchen computer actually do
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:40,608	| IOT024 |	What else
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:42,144	| IOT024 |	Do I need to do and you
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:43,936	| IOT024 |	You have some ideas around kind of
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:48,032	| IOT024 |	Shopping list and even kind of thinking about food prepping recipes
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:49,824	| IOT024 |	But I thought we're kind of
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:50,848	| IOT024 |	I don't know
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:51,872	| IOT024 |	Crazy
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:54,176	| IOT024 |	Dare I say crazy
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:26:01,856	| IOT024 |	Well yeah I'm the crazy analyst and that's my job could come up with crazy ideas and you know what's interesting in your comparison to that Co is it
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:04,672	| IOT024 |	It actually sounded a lot like an echo
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:06,976	| IOT024 |	You have to kind of just quote that article basically says
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:09,792	| IOT024 |	The cabinet will be designed to serve as a hub
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,584	| IOT024 |	Birth internet-connected home
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:15,168	| IOT024 |	And take voice commands for tasik ordering merchandise from Amazon
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:15,936	| IOT024 |	Well guess what
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,984	| IOT024 |	Can't you do that with Amazon Echo
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:22,592	| IOT024 |	So I thought well maybe it's a suit of echo or they're going to do something more
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:24,640	| IOT024 |	With all these different efforts that they have
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:26,944	| IOT024 |	I also think that they'll have a screen on
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:33,344	| IOT024 |	I mean one of the things that that go doesn't have it it's largely a headless devices it's kind of almost mint act like a router in a sense
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:35,392	| IOT024 |	Even though it is a kind of voice interface
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:36,416	| IOT024 |	Birthday quotes
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:37,696	| IOT024 |	Kitchen computer
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:39,488	| IOT024 |	You probably want a touch screen
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:43,328	| IOT024 |	Inability to bring up recipes in kind of Explorer
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:45,120	| IOT024 |	The world of food Audible
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:48,192	| IOT024 |	I think that's one of the aspects of it I think we'll have that differentiates it
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:49,984	| IOT024 |	From the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:52,032	| IOT024 |	Okay so is screen I totally agree
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:54,080	| IOT024 |	Cuz I I will say that I kind of wish I could
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:57,408	| IOT024 |	Fling myrecipes onto a screen
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:27:01,248	| IOT024 |	Not onto my echo but I wish my echo could actually read recipes
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:01,760	| IOT024 |	Is to me
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:04,832	| IOT024 |	As I'm cooking and kind of slow them down for me
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:05,856	| IOT024 |	Psychedelic
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:06,880	| IOT024 |	Hey
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:10,720	| IOT024 |	I want to say it too loud so people's Echoes don't wake up but
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,256	| IOT024 |	Hey
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:14,048	| IOT024 |	What's next in my process
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:16,352	| IOT024 |	And she could say you know add to
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,120	| IOT024 |	Splenda sugar
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:23,264	| IOT024 |	But the other thing that I thought was really cool that you had had in there was that it would likely use the dash replenishment
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:23,776	| IOT024 |	Service
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:27,616	| IOT024 |	And I'm not a huge fan of Amazon's Dash buttons that you
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:30,176	| IOT024 |	Press the button and it automatically orders
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:31,712	| IOT024 |	One thing for you
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:33,760	| IOT024 |	But I do like this idea of having
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:38,112	| IOT024 |	Replenishment service that automatically detects when you're out of things
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:39,648	| IOT024 |	In order stuff
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:40,672	| IOT024 |	So
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:42,976	| IOT024 |	Let's talk about how something like that might
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:48,096	| IOT024 |	Yeah you know I think that I shall be called maybe a dashboard
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:48,864	| IOT024 |	Sorry that's terrible
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,448	| IOT024 |	But I can imagine
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,984	| IOT024 |	It being a central
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:57,312	| IOT024 |	Clearinghouse for different types of Amazon Dash
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,848	| IOT024 |	Replenishment Services I mean I think
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:00,640	| IOT024 |	MLB step back in what
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:04,480	| IOT024 |	Maybe look at what Amazon division for the homies with with Dash is
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:08,320	| IOT024 |	They want to basic automate reordering for all the consumables
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,600	| IOT024 |	Any Kitchen & Beyond
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:10,368	| IOT024 |	And
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,648	| IOT024 |	You're the problem is with a button
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:14,464	| IOT024 |	I know you and I probably don't want a lot of these different
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,232	| IOT024 |	Glue on button
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,024	| IOT024 |	13B sitting at War
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:23,936	| IOT024 |	And if you start to integrate Dash which is the bigger Vision I think with Amazon Dash replenishment Services integrating Dash into all these different
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:24,448	| IOT024 |	Appliances
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:29,568	| IOT024 |	How do you get a controller if it's if you have one device from Whirlpool you have another from LG
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:31,616	| IOT024 |	And you have something from Samsung
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,640	| IOT024 |	How you going to
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:34,688	| IOT024 |	You all know someone that well you could use a nap
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,736	| IOT024 |	I mean that that's probably like the the lower
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:41,600	| IOT024 |	Friction round may be the easy around just have a dash app that kind of symbolizes all this
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:43,904	| IOT024 |	But you know Amazon probably wants to
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:48,768	| IOT024 |	Go even further than and I think that what the kitchen computer it could be a physical manifestation
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:50,816	| IOT024 |	Become a physical device that manages all that
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:52,608	| IOT024 |	And so it'll incorporate
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,656	| IOT024 |	Trucks and all these different devices
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:57,216	| IOT024 |	Don't have features in the end
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:59,776	| IOT024 |	Dashboards that allows you to kind of monitor everything you've ordered
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:01,568	| IOT024 |	I think it's just one asked
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:02,848	| IOT024 |	Spectra that I think we never seen one
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:04,128	| IOT024 |	Okay
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:05,664	| IOT024 |	Now I wonder if it would be
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:08,480	| IOT024 |	Similar are you familiar with the Haiku device
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:09,504	| IOT024 |	Yes I am
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:11,296	| IOT024 |	The Sea of hikers coming to my event
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:13,088	| IOT024 |	That's excellent
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:16,416	| IOT024 |	You are either my friend will talk about yours
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:17,184	| IOT024 |	So
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:19,744	| IOT024 |	Haikyuu is kind of a meld of like the
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:21,280	| IOT024 |	The shopping list
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:22,048	| IOT024 |	On the echo
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:23,328	| IOT024 |	And
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:25,376	| IOT024 |	Maybe the dash replenishment service cuz
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:27,168	| IOT024 |	The shopping list
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:27,936	| IOT024 |	It's just
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:29,728	| IOT024 |	I give it a list right I say
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:33,056	| IOT024 |	Add wrapping paper at milk
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:34,848	| IOT024 |	It does that in the app nothing else happens
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:38,432	| IOT024 |	Haiku has these kind of fun Partnerships with
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:40,736	| IOT024 |	They're mostly high-end grocery stores in other
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:42,016	| IOT024 |	Countries
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:44,064	| IOT024 |	Even understand they're going to happen here
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:45,600	| IOT024 |	But I'd say add milk
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:49,184	| IOT024 |	To a haiku if I were in France or the UK
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:52,512	| IOT024 |	It would actually add milk to my list and it also
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:54,560	| IOT024 |	Conveys that order to
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:55,328	| IOT024 |	A grocery store
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:59,680	| IOT024 |	And then I can either go pick it up later in the week or it will be delivered to
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:00,960	| IOT024 |	Incel
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:02,496	| IOT024 |	If you think about that
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:05,824	| IOT024 |	As a replenishment service is supposed to be like
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:12,224	| IOT024 |	Having a special container that has a sensor on it that automatically lets Amazon know that I'm out of milk
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:13,504	| IOT024 |	This is a perishable
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,272	| IOT024 |	What's a terrible example
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,320	| IOT024 |	Changes to dog food
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:17,600	| IOT024 |	That kind of gets
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:19,136	| IOT024 |	Interesting
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,416	| IOT024 |	I'm sorry Rob I probably just
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:20,928	| IOT024 |	Killed your business
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:24,768	| IOT024 |	So I don't know that was another one of your kind
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:25,280	| IOT024 |	Cabinet ideas
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,096	| IOT024 |	And then
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:29,376	| IOT024 |	You talk about this idea of
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:31,424	| IOT024 |	Cabinet bingo
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:33,216	| IOT024 |	Physical manifestation of the
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:33,984	| IOT024 |	The kitchen operating
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:40,128	| IOT024 |	Which sounds terrible and he said it sounded like a call to Arms
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:41,664	| IOT024 |	Jang
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:43,968	| IOT024 |	What the heck is
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:47,296	| IOT024 |	Why does my kitchen need an OS what is
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:49,088	| IOT024 |	What is that going to
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:50,368	| IOT024 |	Ten-tails I wanted to
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:51,904	| IOT024 |	Get some thoughts for me
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:58,304	| IOT024 |	Why I think that there are a number of like startups in this goes beyond Amazon who are creating Point devices
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:31:00,608	| IOT024 |	And I think the initial reaction to
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:03,680	| IOT024 |	Some of these devices be these know these connected scales
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:05,216	| IOT024 |	These are the things
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:08,032	| IOT024 |	Maybe can't connect into these different
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:08,800	| IOT024 |	White goods is
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:10,848	| IOT024 |	The white Canary Factor saywell
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:12,384	| IOT024 |	This is great but what's happened
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:13,664	| IOT024 |	Kind of work together
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:15,456	| IOT024 |	Rather something that plugs into I think
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:20,064	| IOT024 |	Be looking with orange Jeff is trying to do I think there may be moving down that path as well
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:25,952	| IOT024 |	I think you know haikus interesting Haiku to me is more like an arms Merchant that can be a competitor to everyone who isn't Amazon
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:27,744	| IOT024 |	But I just think it
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:31,328	| IOT024 |	Rather than having a bunch of different things that don't work together
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:36,448	| IOT024 |	Amazon what's going to be the central point with all these different things in the kitchen were together and so
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:39,776	| IOT024 |	Dwayne leave the foundation with this kind of the services and they pii
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:41,312	| IOT024 |	With Dash
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:42,848	| IOT024 |	I'm with Amazon Fresh
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:47,200	| IOT024 |	And in some of these other rappers so I can Alexa which is going to be the voice interface for these
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:50,016	| IOT024 |	If you can bring those are all together into one device
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:54,112	| IOT024 |	And then they'd go out to do Partnerships with all these Wicked manufacturers as well as
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:57,440	| IOT024 |	Are some of the the brand so if you look at the dash button
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:32:01,024	| IOT024 |	That's very much a strategic rollout in the chosen some of the biggest
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:03,328	| IOT024 |	Consumable manufacturers in the World rides on YouTube
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:05,632	| IOT024 |	Whoever those are Johnson & Johnson Coca-Cola
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:07,680	| IOT024 |	Those are very strategic partner so
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:12,544	| IOT024 |	I think they're giving a taste of what a dash embedded world can feel like with a dash button
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:17,408	| IOT024 |	To these Brands and I think they're going to reel them in hopefully over time we secure Amazon
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,968	| IOT024 |	And say when we have the speaker Vision we're going at this kitchen computer
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:23,808	| IOT024 |	Do you want the service in this Replacement Service hooked into your you're
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:25,600	| IOT024 |	Is your brand
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:31,744	| IOT024 |	And I'm sure the water can be rented a two-story I mean that's I'm sure it wake what their vision is to relay these this kind of brand attitude
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:32,768	| IOT024 |	Dbrand
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:37,120	| IOT024 |	Register I think that rather than having all the stuff piecemeal they want to bring it together in one unit
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:39,680	| IOT024 |	So I'm picturing I like
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:43,008	| IOT024 |	So cuz I couldn't break up the kitchen
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:45,056	| IOT024 |	The Kitchen Story into
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:46,592	| IOT024 |	Maybe it's not a story
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,640	| IOT024 |	Maybe it's my task
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:50,176	| IOT024 |	I break them up into planning
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:51,712	| IOT024 |	Prep
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:52,224	| IOT024 |	Cooking
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:53,504	| IOT024 |	Consumption
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:56,576	| IOT024 |	So on the planning side of got my kind of
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:58,368	| IOT024 |	Recipe apps
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:03,488	| IOT024 |	My Pratt I got things like the drop kitchen scale orange Chef the countertop
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:04,000	| IOT024 |	Kind of stuff
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:06,304	| IOT024 |	Cook at the June
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:08,096	| IOT024 |	I got whatever other kind of
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:09,888	| IOT024 |	Cooking devices there are
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:12,704	| IOT024 |	And then consumption I got things
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:14,240	| IOT024 |	They even go so far as like
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:15,520	| IOT024 |	MyFitnessPal in
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:17,568	| IOT024 |	Even things like health kit with my data
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:19,872	| IOT024 |	So on top of all that
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:22,944	| IOT024 |	I'm trying to think of the things that need to run across all of that
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:25,248	| IOT024 |	Photos of ruined storage
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:27,296	| IOT024 |	I'm going to take you to one of things you have is like
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:30,112	| IOT024 |	Obviously refrigerators you have other guys were making
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:31,392	| IOT024 |	Smart containers
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:33,184	| IOT024 |	I'm that I think are interesting
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:36,000	| IOT024 |	I think I want somewhere in there you slide in
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:37,536	| IOT024 |	Replenishment in in purchasing
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:38,560	| IOT024 |	Which I think is
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:40,352	| IOT024 |	Maybe I won't go into consumption but
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:42,912	| IOT024 |	I think Amazon sticking all the way from
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:47,008	| IOT024 |	I have this need for consumables I have this
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:48,800	| IOT024 |	Planning process I do for cooking
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:50,848	| IOT024 |	I have is consumption around
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:53,920	| IOT024 |	Food and I are going to the impacts of Health excetera
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:55,200	| IOT024 |	I have a storage of it
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:58,016	| IOT024 |	And if you could tie all those together at thinks that's the big vision
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:33:59,808	| IOT024 |	Got it okay
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:04,928	| IOT024 |	And I think what size hose together is data around food right nutrition
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:07,488	| IOT024 |	Recipes are kind of a way
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:10,304	| IOT024 |	Today the the recipe is almost the OS rate
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:14,144	| IOT024 |	But that's not digitized in a way that's that's friendly
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:16,448	| IOT024 |	Nitrate in food is not digital so
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:19,008	| IOT024 |	Okay this is fine I'm thinking about this
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:25,152	| IOT024 |	And we'll be able to think about it more because you have this kind of fun show coming up November 5th in Seattle it is the
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:27,200	| IOT024 |	Smart kitchen

EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:55,872	| IOT024 |	You got the president of Williams-Sonoma coming you've got
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:58,176	| IOT024 |	Brock from Haiku you've got people from June
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:00,224	| IOT024 |	You got me I'm coming
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:03,296	| IOT024 |	Let's see who else is probably the most exciting part for me
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:07,392	| IOT024 |	It is just one of those I can't wait to see you and you see Chris
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:09,440	| IOT024 |	Chris Albrecht our friends can be Dempsey
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:13,024	| IOT024 |	There you go but you got actually some grape me follow you got Jardin
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:15,328	| IOT024 |	I'm someone from Jordan who makes
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:16,096	| IOT024 |	The Crock-Pot
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:18,144	| IOT024 |	The connected crock pot
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:19,424	| IOT024 |	The connected crock pot
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:24,544	| IOT024 |	I'm going to ask him about my refrigerator Crock-Pot I've spoken to them before about this they are still not making it
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:26,336	| IOT024 |	Must not be a good idea
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:26,848	| IOT024 |	I don't know why
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:30,432	| IOT024 |	But why we are on this topic I would love to ask
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:32,224	| IOT024 |	What are some of the kind of
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:33,760	| IOT024 |	Other companies
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:35,552	| IOT024 |	That we should be excited about
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:36,832	| IOT024 |	In the smart kitchen
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:42,976	| IOT024 |	Where should I be looking for good ideas I know that there is some startups making these Point devices that we kind of talked about that
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:44,512	| IOT024 |	Who else is thinking big about this
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:47,840	| IOT024 |	Well I would say that you know I made this comparison
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:53,472	| IOT024 |	The people to come and show them what where my thinking is I mean when you look at 10 years ago we're all excited about the reinvention of the television
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:57,568	| IOT024 |	And yeah we're just at the end of the beginning of this revolution that has unfolded
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:35:59,104	| IOT024 |	Before I sold last decade were
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:01,920	| IOT024 |	10 years goes all through cable box
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:05,760	| IOT024 |	But we knew if we can get internet to the TV it was a massive potential
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:09,344	| IOT024 |	Opportunity for disruption yashow market is 50 billion dollars
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:12,928	| IOT024 |	10 years later looking at where where are Netflix is is the largest
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:14,208	| IOT024 |	Pay TV provider in the US
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:18,816	| IOT024 |	You all this conversation about disrupting the television I think we're at that phase right now
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:22,400	| IOT024 |	When we were ten years ago it with TV were right there with food
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:23,168	| IOT024 |	And
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:25,216	| IOT024 |	As I said if people knew everyone needs
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:27,776	| IOT024 |	The food in the grocery in the restaurant business in
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:31,104	| IOT024 |	And then just that total Market is a much bigger Market probably
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:32,640	| IOT024 |	Exponentially bigger than TV
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:35,200	| IOT024 |	I think it's really exciting in
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:41,088	| IOT024 |	You could just go along all these different pockets of innovation I mean there's a lot of interesting stuff that people put up like the scales except for butt
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:44,672	| IOT024 |	I'll give you one example, that really is exciting is coming hotel for you
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,440	| IOT024 |	And
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:46,464	| IOT024 |	Their copy that
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:48,512	| IOT024 |	Is trying to reinvent something that's been
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:50,816	| IOT024 |	People been doing what are the same way for a thousand years
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:52,096	| IOT024 |	Witches Brew tea
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:54,400	| IOT024 |	You know I love t
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:57,216	| IOT024 |	But it is the most simple thing you could do
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:37:03,360	| IOT024 |	Drop a bag of tea in hot water and how can you change that and that was very skeptical before I talk to him and so
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:10,272	| IOT024 |	Ponytail you say you you have t you love but you can only drink it before 5 cuz otherwise you're going to be up all night
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:13,856	| IOT024 |	What's a for you to say well I want to do a nighttime Brew this tea
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:17,184	| IOT024 |	And I want to reduce the amount of caffeine I can do those turn this knob
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:20,512	| IOT024 |	Oh by the way I really think an antioxidants are healthy
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:26,912	| IOT024 |	I'm getting to that age where I think it's going to be to make me live longer what's turn up the antioxidants and you could do all this with the tip for a bird
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:27,936	| IOT024 |	You can just change
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:30,496	| IOT024 |	It ended kind of make it taste of Indian accent
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:32,032	| IOT024 |	Kind of turnips in accents and notes
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:35,616	| IOT024 |	And that to me for I have been diving to the world
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:41,504	| IOT024 |	Politely and there is a massive Community there's like T conferences and there's just these team through this and I think you start telling about this
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:43,808	| IOT024 |	Tell me some people are skeptical
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:46,112	| IOT024 |	But I think there was some people be really excited about
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:49,696	| IOT024 |	I think that's one really kind of interesting example of a
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:52,256	| IOT024 |	A company is trying to reinvent something
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:53,280	| IOT024 |	Done the same way forever
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:54,560	| IOT024 |	No I'm
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:57,120	| IOT024 |	I'm sitting here thinking about that I'm like okay
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:59,168	| IOT024 |	Yeah change the way I brew tea
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:38:00,960	| IOT024 |	Some people will argue that that is
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:04,544	| IOT024 |	Just kind of mechanizing a process that maybe doesn't need to be mechanized
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:06,592	| IOT024 |	I guess
EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:08,896	| IOT024 |	This is an area where you see a lot of gimmicks
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:09,408	| IOT024 |	Like
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:11,968	| IOT024 |	To meet cooking is something that has
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:14,528	| IOT024 |	Is fundamentally unchanged a lot of ways
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:17,344	| IOT024 |	Because you know you heat something over a fire
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:19,392	| IOT024 |	Like thousands of years we
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,928	| IOT024 |	Bend Heating
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:24,512	| IOT024 |	Chopping things up in the various Cuts or bits and
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:25,792	| IOT024 |	Eating them over virus
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:27,328	| IOT024 |	The way we heat them
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:29,632	| IOT024 |	Dictates how they end up tasting
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:31,168	| IOT024 |	So
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:33,216	| IOT024 |	Fundamentally that hasn't changed
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:33,984	| IOT024 |	And a lot of
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:35,776	| IOT024 |	Cooking
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:39,360	| IOT024 |	In devices and Innovations in cooking have been based around gimmicks like
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:41,408	| IOT024 |	You know a lot of people have like
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:43,456	| IOT024 |	George Foreman grills or
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:43,968	| IOT024 |	Exodus
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:46,784	| IOT024 |	You know we've all seen the
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:50,112	| IOT024 |	What is that thing that makes you look the connecting meat thermometer so it goes like
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:53,952	| IOT024 |	You know adding Wi-Fi Bluetooth on something in and kind of making that a device
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:55,488	| IOT024 |	I agree is a gimmick
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:59,072	| IOT024 |	List that actually a connection thermometer can be really helpful especially if it's a cure
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:01,888	| IOT024 |	But I was thinking like maybe vessel like a
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:04,448	| IOT024 |	Something is something that
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:05,216	| IOT024 |	You don't like
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:06,752	| IOT024 |	$200 glass
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:08,544	| IOT024 |	Spec tells you what you're drinking or how many
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:09,824	| IOT024 |	Glasses of water
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:12,128	| IOT024 |	I would argue in a
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:14,688	| IOT024 |	That is something that has been in a widely pan
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:16,224	| IOT024 |	I'm ask you something
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:17,504	| IOT024 |	Someone that finds that really intrigued
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:18,528	| IOT024 |	AYSO
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:25,184	| IOT024 |	You know sure you can look on the can of Stephen Colbert said and see what's in it but what if you're someone has like a very specific dietary need
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:31,840	| IOT024 |	I'm yet you know you were some of that really needs to closely monitor while you're taking in over the course of a week or or course of the month
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:36,448	| IOT024 |	That is very hard to do just by trying to transcribe what you're drinking
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:40,288	| IOT024 |	As you go Adventure some of the travel so if you had something like this that can
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:41,568	| IOT024 |	Do that I think that's
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:42,848	| IOT024 |	That's usually viable
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:43,616	| IOT024 |	I am
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:44,896	| IOT024 |	Technology
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:48,736	| IOT024 |	Right not against at and I'm actually really excited about passive data collection
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:52,832	| IOT024 |	I am panicking that idea because they're very opaque about how they do
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:56,160	| IOT024 |	Writing whether or not it's
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:40:02,560	| IOT024 |	It's whether or not they're their molecular sensor Works anyone thinks it's interesting to them about them as they have
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:05,120	| IOT024 |	A weight sensor is awesome at Mach or sensor with the big
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:07,168	| IOT024 |	I guess mystery box
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:09,216	| IOT024 |	Kind of the unknown is how the moisture sensor work
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:14,848	| IOT024 |	But I think of it does work whether or not it's not them if someone else can get that I think I Choose You diable
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:18,944	| IOT024 |	I think that is valuable I don't know if it's necessarily
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:20,480	| IOT024 |	Consumer technology at the beach
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:22,784	| IOT024 |	But yes yes I'm not against
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:23,552	| IOT024 |	That I'm
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:26,880	| IOT024 |	Market device
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:33,280	| IOT024 |	Yeah I think most of these Technologies are not consumer technology since beginning their they're like rich people technology for the 1st
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:35,840	| IOT024 |	3 years and look at the June of it right I mean
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:38,912	| IOT024 |	You're talking about $1,500 for a basically what
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:40,448	| IOT024 |	Looks like a toaster oven
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:41,984	| IOT024 |	It's much more complicated
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:44,032	| IOT024 |	Getting that now but it's something that is a size 1
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:46,848	| IOT024 |	But that is something that is not going to be Mass Market
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:50,176	| IOT024 |	But let's go to the Next Generation to the Next Generation
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:54,784	| IOT024 |	Another example is the peak of a right to the peekaboo is a 15 or $2,000 device
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:57,600	| IOT024 |	It's still fairly big in my wife
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:40:59,648	| IOT024 |	Laughs at me when I say I want a peek a brew my house
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:01,440	| IOT024 |	A kiss is still big
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:02,208	| IOT024 |	What you should tell us what a
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:06,816	| IOT024 |	What is a peekaboo so picobrew is a home
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:08,096	| IOT024 |	Beer brewing Appliance
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:10,656	| IOT024 |	And it's their basic taking
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:14,240	| IOT024 |	Iot technology in applying and applying to science to beer
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:19,104	| IOT024 |	What's interesting about what's a step back about you know kind of that the product Evolution forbid
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:20,640	| IOT024 |	What's interesting about that is
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:27,552	| IOT024 |	No home brewing is something that is widely variable people have been doing it for a long time they're enthusiastic but one batch of the next
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:29,088	| IOT024 |	You can't really make it
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:32,160	| IOT024 |	You can't really say with any degree of certainty is going to taste the same
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:35,488	| IOT024 |	And if I give my my buddy my recipe in Austin
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:36,768	| IOT024 |	I sent it over the internet
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:39,072	| IOT024 |	Chances are that he can to the same
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:40,608	| IOT024 |	Unless you replicate it
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:43,936	| IOT024 |	Using technology like this and there's no there's a technology called beer XML
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:50,848	| IOT024 |	So you talked to him about this kind of the idea of data which is really interesting there's actually data and kind of Frameworks around getting beer recipes
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:52,384	| IOT024 |	Shirley Rodriguez KO up to like
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:54,431	| IOT024 |	Brewery size beer
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:55,455	| IOT024 |	Brewing down to Lake
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:56,991	| IOT024 |	Half a gallon
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:42:01,855	| IOT024 |	And you could just scaled up or down so I think applying technology like that is really interesting
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:03,903	| IOT024 |	And it does something that
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:06,719	| IOT024 |	I've never really been done before and this other guys like we're about as well
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:09,023	| IOT024 |	You haven't really been able to brew in the home
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:12,351	| IOT024 |	Cost effectively using technology in replicating really good recipes
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:13,119	| IOT024 |	Until now
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:14,143	| IOT024 |	Okay
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:15,423	| IOT024 |	It's like a b r o s
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:19,775	| IOT024 |	Abuse abuse schema
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:21,311	| IOT024 |	I got your schema there we go
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:23,871	| IOT024 |	That's awesome
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:27,711	| IOT024 |	And I can't wait are the picobrew guys going
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:30,783	| IOT024 |	They're going to be there and I'm trying to get them to bring a lot of beer
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:32,063	| IOT024 |	Golf Course
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:36,927	| IOT024 |	Pico in and of itself implies small so not as small as Nano
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:38,975	| IOT024 |	Or maybe that's smaller
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:41,279	| IOT024 |	Nano Brewing
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:44,607	| IOT024 |	I don't know what to do between man on Pico both imply small but
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:45,631	| IOT024 |	Anything compared to Lake
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:47,935	| IOT024 |	Sierra Nevada small
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:50,239	| IOT024 |	But enough probably to Philly give us give us a nice Buzz
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:52,543	| IOT024 |	I don't know actually I can
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:57,407	| IOT024 |	I will save my bravado for another
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:58,431	| IOT024 |	Another beverage
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:42:59,455	| IOT024 |	Okay
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:02,015	| IOT024 |	I think we're out of time
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:03,807	| IOT024 |	But I'm really enjoying this
EDL	00:43:03,807	00:43:04,831	| IOT024 |	So I cannot
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:05,343	| IOT024 |	Wait
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:06,623	| IOT024 |	2
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:09,183	| IOT024 |	Visit your conference and before we go I want to get you
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:10,463	| IOT024 |	Really fast
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:12,511	| IOT024 |	Big trends give me
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:15,071	| IOT024 |	Listen to big trends that we should be watching for
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:15,583	| IOT024 |	In the kitchen
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:22,239	| IOT024 |	I think this is an overused term democratization of technology that was really only used in professional kitchens
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:25,055	| IOT024 |	Is coming to the consumer Market example that is
EDL	00:43:25,055	00:43:27,871	| IOT024 |	Is the others two or three connected to beat makers
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:31,967	| IOT024 |	Recipe makers in general whether or not they're connected that's something that really didn't exist
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:33,247	| IOT024 |	3-4 years ago
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:34,271	| IOT024 |	Brick and Timber prices
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:35,295	| IOT024 |	I use one
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:38,879	| IOT024 |	I'm making better steak I've ever met before I can make I made pudding with it
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:41,183	| IOT024 |	Stacy we haven't tried when you try to destroy fun
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:42,463	| IOT024 |	Oh you're inviting me to
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:45,791	| IOT024 |	I'll make funny. My suvee cooker
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:50,655	| IOT024 |	And I think this year you alluded to that kind of the fusing of
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:51,935	| IOT024 |	Appdata in cooking
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:54,751	| IOT024 |	I think you know this idea of taking healthkit
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:55,263	| IOT024 |	Data
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:59,871	| IOT024 |	I'm in in August of really understand where you are in Ark
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:01,407	| IOT024 |	In our day in our hour
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:02,431	| IOT024 |	And more long-term
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:09,343	| IOT024 |	Having that feed into what we buy and feed ourselves at I think it's going to be really important I don't think anyone's really crack that
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:15,999	| IOT024 |	I think Apple's trying to lay some Foundation but I think that'll be a really interesting Trend watch would like to see big Brands actually start to push
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:18,047	| IOT024 |	Nutritional data
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:18,815	| IOT024 |	Their data
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:19,839	| IOT024 |	Actually
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:22,655	| IOT024 |	To Consumers I would like to see them get on board
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:25,983	| IOT024 |	Maybe through apis and starting to release some of that a little bit
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:27,775	| IOT024 |	So I'm not the one laborious Lee
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:30,335	| IOT024 |	Typing all this into my app
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:31,615	| IOT024 |	I have my app crashes
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:34,687	| IOT024 |	Do it again
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:36,479	| IOT024 |	So that's my hoe
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:41,087	| IOT024 |	The big Brands will start to realize that there's a lot of value and there's probably even some advertising opportunity
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:42,111	| IOT024 |	Actually there
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:43,391	| IOT024 |	So we'll see
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:45,183	| IOT024 |	Mike
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:48,511	| IOT024 |	Thank you so much for coming on the show I cannot wait to see you
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:49,535	| IOT024 |	November 5th
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:51,071	| IOT024 |	In Seattle at the smart
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:52,095	| IOT024 |	Kitchen Summit
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:53,375	| IOT024 |	And

EDL	00:44:56,191	00:44:58,751	| IOT024 |	We'll see if we ever see the cabinet what are the odds
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:02,335	| IOT024 |	You know I know that Amazon has
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:03,103	| IOT024 |	Done
EDL	00:45:03,103	00:45:04,383	| IOT024 |	Projects that they kill
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:09,503	| IOT024 |	And I'll talk to books have been behind some of the projects and then never made the light of day
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:13,855	| IOT024 |	I have a feeling this year if I were to put odds on a Sprite no over 50% will see something
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:16,671	| IOT024 |	But who knows it could be something that is playing with and they kill it
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:17,951	| IOT024 |	All right
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:23,327	| IOT024 |	Everyone thank you so much for listening and we will see you next week
