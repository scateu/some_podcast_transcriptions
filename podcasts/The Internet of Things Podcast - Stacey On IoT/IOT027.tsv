EDL	00:00:08,704	00:00:11,520	| IOT027 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:00:11,520	00:00:13,568	| IOT027 |	I am your host Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:13,568	00:00:15,872	| IOT027 |	And today we have for you apron
EDL	00:00:16,896	00:00:17,408	| IOT027 |	Cohoes
EDL	00:00:17,920	00:00:18,944	| IOT027 |	Andrew allemann
EDL	00:00:18,944	00:00:19,456	| IOT027 |	That's right
EDL	00:00:19,968	00:00:23,040	| IOT027 |	This is a special occasion Kevin will be back with us next week
EDL	00:00:23,552	00:00:25,856	| IOT027 |	But Andrew is my husband
EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:29,184	| IOT027 |	And today he would be playing the role of a smart home skeptic
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:30,464	| IOT027 |	Which
EDL	00:00:30,464	00:00:33,024	| IOT027 |	Actually I drew that's the role you play pretty much everyday
EDL	00:00:33,024	00:00:33,792	| IOT027 |	Right
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:36,352	| IOT027 |	ICandy eye candy around this household
EDL	00:00:37,888	00:00:38,656	| IOT027 |	It's hard not to
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:39,168	| IOT027 |	Skeptical
EDL	00:00:40,192	00:00:45,568	| IOT027 |	So Andrew just so you guys know in addition to my husband he is also a blogger and a podcaster himself
EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:49,408	| IOT027 |	He blogs over at domain name wire about the domain industry
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:50,688	| IOT027 |	And he also has a podcast
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:51,200	| IOT027 |	Just about the same time
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:53,504	| IOT027 |	So let's get this started
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:56,576	| IOT027 |	You came on the podcast probably about nine months ago
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:58,112	| IOT027 |	And at that time
EDL	00:00:58,624	00:00:59,648	| IOT027 |	You're pretty
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:03,232	| IOT027 |	I meant to say ambivalent but you were kind of down on all the stuff that I brought into the house
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:07,840	| IOT027 |	You actually only like one thing I believe if I recall correctly and that was
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:11,936	| IOT027 |	The SmartThings home hub that I brought in and programmed with our blinds
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:12,704	| IOT027 |	And had them going
EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:14,752	| IOT027 |	Up and down on a schedule
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:16,800	| IOT027 |	And since then I've taken that away from you
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:18,592	| IOT027 |	Yes
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:20,640	| IOT027 |	You have sorry about that
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:21,664	| IOT027 |	But
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:23,712	| IOT027 |	I'm hoping that
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:25,248	| IOT027 |	We brought some other Gadgets in the house
EDL	00:01:25,760	00:01:28,832	| IOT027 |	Are there any things right now that you actually like
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:29,600	| IOT027 |	About her smartphone
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:34,720	| IOT027 |	Well to me the whole game changer the thing that shifts this to something that
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:37,280	| IOT027 |	Is practical is the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:38,816	| IOT027 |	For me being able to
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:40,352	| IOT027 |	Use voice commands
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:42,400	| IOT027 |	To control lights for example
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:46,752	| IOT027 |	Is great compared to having to open up
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:51,104	| IOT027 |	Right if you have to press a few buttons or find your phone and kind of losses
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:51,616	| IOT027 |	Its effectiveness
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,408	| IOT027 |	I mean that
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:54,176	| IOT027 |	Huge
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:55,456	| IOT027 |	I frankly think that
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:59,040	| IOT027 |	As far as this ecosystems concern that could be a big game-changer
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:01,344	| IOT027 |	You've got the Hue tap
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:04,672	| IOT027 |	Which is nice because you can control Smart
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:08,256	| IOT027 |	Device without a game getting out your phone
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:10,048	| IOT027 |	That's like the Amazon Echo is
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,328	| IOT027 |	Is that it's a big deal
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:12,864	| IOT027 |	All right and
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:15,168	| IOT027 |	In our house we mostly use the echo
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:15,680	| IOT027 |	Go to
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:17,728	| IOT027 |	Turn off the lights downstairs
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:18,496	| IOT027 |	But
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:20,032	| IOT027 |	Do you ever use it or could you
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,056	| IOT027 |	You see using it for any
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:27,200	| IOT027 |	Oh yeah those are the main things and again it's one of those things that works part of the time I don't know if that's
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,480	| IOT027 |	Alexis salt
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:29,504	| IOT027 |	Echo
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:30,528	| IOT027 |	Corset
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,296	| IOT027 |	Lights
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,064	| IOT027 |	Are we having
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:36,160	| IOT027 |	I could see myself using it to for example control the fly
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:37,952	| IOT027 |	It's on the other side
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,232	| IOT027 |	Just be lazy
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:42,048	| IOT027 |	And tell it to do that so if there was a way to cook that into the
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:46,144	| IOT027 |	Do the blinds make them clothes when it's hot out or son of your whereabouts
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,424	| IOT027 |	Watching TV
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:50,240	| IOT027 |	I think that could be valuable as well really AT&T
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:51,520	| IOT027 |	Smart
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:55,360	| IOT027 |	Connected devices if you can control them from that
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,640	| IOT027 |	Voices just much
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:58,688	| IOT027 |	Easier in most circumstances
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:02:59,712	| IOT027 |	Then
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:04,832	| IOT027 |	Using multiple table menus on a phone to pull up what you're looking for by that time
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:06,624	| IOT027 |	You may as well have
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:08,160	| IOT027 |	Found the remote
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,928	| IOT027 |	Or
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:10,208	| IOT027 |	Dundee accent
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,232	| IOT027 |	Got it
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:12,768	| IOT027 |	Alright so
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:16,096	| IOT027 |	Any other things that you're kind of like
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:19,424	| IOT027 |	Thinking oh this is a nice to have in the house lissy
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,984	| IOT027 |	Connect two thermostats
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:22,752	| IOT027 |	I feel like
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:27,104	| IOT027 |	You may not touch the nest every day but I feel like that's a device that
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:28,384	| IOT027 |	You certainly use and
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,736	| IOT027 |	Yeah and it's very useful
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:34,528	| IOT027 |	2f say you're out of town
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:35,552	| IOT027 |	I'm at the office
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:38,880	| IOT027 |	I mean obviously it'll go to auto away but
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,160	| IOT027 |	But you know the program that
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:42,208	| IOT027 |	And then when I'm about to head home program
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,232	| IOT027 |	Again
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:47,840	| IOT027 |	On the phone change its go to a cooler temperature I think that's
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,376	| IOT027 |	That's valuable
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:51,168	| IOT027 |	I'm so certainly the
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,704	| IOT027 |	The thermostats are good
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:55,520	| IOT027 |	What else we have the blinds when you actually had to look up
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:58,848	| IOT027 |	I actually
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,640	| IOT027 |	Can hook them into Alexa
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:02,944	| IOT027 |	Cynthia boe's wink or SmartThings
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,224	| IOT027 |	Okay
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:05,760	| IOT027 |	See I am I pulled it out
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,856	| IOT027 |	It's going to be a birthday present book
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:12,928	| IOT027 |	Looked work again
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,000	| IOT027 |	I was often very long time
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,071	| IOT027 |	You hate keys
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,607	| IOT027 |	And
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:24,447	| IOT027 |	I know where front door doesn't really work with a lot of smart locks out there
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:30,079	| IOT027 |	But do you have a sense of would you prefer to have a lock that just opened when you got
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:32,895	| IOT027 |	Near it with your phone in your pocket or would you
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,687	| IOT027 |	I know you like keypad lock
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:36,991	| IOT027 |	So do you have a sense I know how you feel about
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:37,759	| IOT027 |	Kind of connected lock
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,295	| IOT027 |	Here's the thing
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:40,831	| IOT027 |	There's got to be
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:43,647	| IOT027 |	In addition to having that
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:45,951	| IOT027 |	I don't know what you called but what you walk up to today
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:46,975	| IOT027 |	Automatically
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:48,255	| IOT027 |	Locks unlocks
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:54,655	| IOT027 |	There has to be a way to do it manually without having the kids while so a great example would be the Locklear downstairs
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,679	| IOT027 |	We had to keep an eye on
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,447	| IOT027 |	And you can do it
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:58,495	| IOT027 |	Is there a number of times I run down to the garage
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:00,287	| IOT027 |	I don't have my phone
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:03,359	| IOT027 |	You know and so and I don't have the key
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,639	| IOT027 |	So I'd like to build
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:08,479	| IOT027 |	It's super fast and easy ride to type in a four-digit code unless your hands are full
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:11,807	| IOT027 |	So I also question and maybe there's an answer for this but
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,855	| IOT027 |	Take for example our garage
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,135	| IOT027 |	Not our
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,927	| IOT027 |	Electric garage door right
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:18,207	| IOT027 |	Butter other
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,231	| IOT027 |	The door to the garage
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:26,399	| IOT027 |	Okay so if it unlocks things for when you pulled into the garage at automatically unlock the door
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:28,191	| IOT027 |	Where that went from our garage to our house
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:32,799	| IOT027 |	It did now I'm going to tell everybody right now we have the Kwikset Z-Wave
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:33,823	| IOT027 |	Connected locks
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,847	| IOT027 |	With a keypad
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,615	| IOT027 |	So
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:37,151	| IOT027 |	They're both connected and they have to keep
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:41,759	| IOT027 |	Spencer Locke and yes we did have it hooked in through SmartThings
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:45,599	| IOT027 |	And you had a presents tag in your car so when you drove up
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,391	| IOT027 |	The present stag
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,159	| IOT027 |	Triggered
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:48,927	| IOT027 |	That lock
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,463	| IOT027 |	To the garage
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:50,975	| IOT027 |	To unlock
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,511	| IOT027 |	So that was helpful
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:55,583	| IOT027 |	Why do you always take away the things that I like I said I don't get it
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,607	| IOT027 |	It's not because I hate you
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:59,423	| IOT027 |	On the presents tag actually ran out of battery
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,983	| IOT027 |	And I didn't know
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:04,031	| IOT027 |	I could I could put that back on
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:05,055	| IOT027 |	Because the locks are back on
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,663	| IOT027 |	And the other thing is
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,431	| IOT027 |	I took
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,199	| IOT027 |	The
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:14,015	| IOT027 |	That the blinds are controlled by a Z-Wave controller
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:16,063	| IOT027 |	It is a bit gimpy
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:18,367	| IOT027 |	To install it's not actually
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:20,927	| IOT027 |	It's not recognized by a lot of
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:24,255	| IOT027 |	Of the hubs that we have is not recognized by any of them
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,791	| IOT027 |	So it's hard to install
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:29,887	| IOT027 |	And so I uninstall whenever I uninstall it to reinstall it
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:30,655	| IOT027 |	Takes
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,703	| IOT027 |	A little more time and effort and
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,727	| IOT027 |	I usually
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:36,287	| IOT027 |	End up unprogramming are blinds and that
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,055	| IOT027 |	Cost $8
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:38,335	| IOT027 |	Come back and fix
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:41,407	| IOT027 |	And then you get sad and grumpy
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:48,063	| IOT027 |	Yeah yeah I was a little suspect on
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,343	| IOT027 |	Idea of
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:52,927	| IOT027 |	Yes I guess in as you walked out the door was unlocked and
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,719	| IOT027 |	When your presence wasn't there
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,255	| IOT027 |	It's interesting
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,023	| IOT027 |	You know
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:58,303	| IOT027 |	I don't know
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,327	| IOT027 |	Tesla
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:04,703	| IOT027 |	Now that I've seen how that works for the Tesla or you just leave then
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:07,007	| IOT027 |	Turns off and takes care of all that.
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,287	| IOT027 |	That's kind of Handy
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,823	| IOT027 |	The other thing I like
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:12,383	| IOT027 |	In-N-Out in its being skeptical at first week
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:13,919	| IOT027 |	The Chamberlain garage
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:14,943	| IOT027 |	Or wear it
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:16,735	| IOT027 |	Where you can turn it
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:19,039	| IOT027 |	That's one item or being able to shut
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:20,063	| IOT027 |	The door or open it
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:21,599	| IOT027 |	From the phone is help
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:24,415	| IOT027 |	For to use cases first of all in our case
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,183	| IOT027 |	Beef cuts
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:27,743	| IOT027 |	The garage downstairs and then you walk upstairs
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:28,511	| IOT027 |	The house
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,303	| IOT027 |	And so
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:34,399	| IOT027 |	Getting alert that you forgot to shut the garage door and not having to go down
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,679	| IOT027 |	Outside of stairs again
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,447	| IOT027 |	To shut it
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,215	| IOT027 |	It's helpful.
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:37,983	| IOT027 |	And any other thing
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:40,543	| IOT027 |	Someone needs to get inside the garage for some
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:43,615	| IOT027 |	Be able to grant them that access when you're not home
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,127	| IOT027 |	Fat is healthy
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:45,919	| IOT027 |	All right
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:48,479	| IOT027 |	See so now discuss the things you do like
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,783	| IOT027 |	What are the things that you're like
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,295	| IOT027 |	Stacy
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,599	| IOT027 |	You try this out or
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:56,415	| IOT027 |	You know maybe if you can purchase it and I still don't know why you
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:00,255	| IOT027 |	I think my main gripe is the same it was
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:02,303	| IOT027 |	Before what you see things just don't work out
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,071	| IOT027 |	In the Box
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:06,399	| IOT027 |	There's some there's something that doesn't work and maybe
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,167	| IOT027 |	Because our house
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,447	| IOT027 |	This is a test
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:10,239	| IOT027 |	Items interior made lyrics
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,775	| IOT027 |	Fighting with each other
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,543	| IOT027 |	Redfin
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:15,103	| IOT027 |	Even for a while it seemed like our lights
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:15,615	| IOT027 |	You're working
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:20,479	| IOT027 |	Then the ones that were connected into those GE light bulbs that are connected into
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,015	| IOT027 |	Weak now
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,319	| IOT027 |	You know how they work
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,087	| IOT027 |	Part of the time
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,879	| IOT027 |	Well the one where I guess
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,183	| IOT027 |	They actually were connected through the
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:32,255	| IOT027 |	Shoe-in for some reason the Hue connection
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,535	| IOT027 |	To the GE link bulbs
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,839	| IOT027 |	Through the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,631	| IOT027 |	Suddenly didn't
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,935	| IOT027 |	And I'm not sure actually
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,727	| IOT027 |	Savannah
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,751	| IOT027 |	Switch them over
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:44,031	| IOT027 |	To the wink
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,591	| IOT027 |	Except for that one
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:49,407	| IOT027 |	Wish weekend
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:49,919	| IOT027 |	Broken
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,223	| IOT027 |	Defective so you've got
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:53,247	| IOT027 |	3
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,039	| IOT027 |	You spend 20 bucks on these balls
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,087	| IOT027 |	Which is a lot cheaper
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,367	| IOT027 |	Hughes but then
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:01,439	| IOT027 |	He's got three months later one of them the Z-Wave
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:01,951	| IOT027 |	Stop
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:05,535	| IOT027 |	Thankfully Home Depot is really easy
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,071	| IOT027 |	It was
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,351	| IOT027 |	Nicki sorry
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:10,655	| IOT027 |	I told the lady at Home Depot the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,959	| IOT027 |	I don't think it matters
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:13,983	| IOT027 |	Any idea
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:16,799	| IOT027 |	But I was talking about she just wrote as return light
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,567	| IOT027 |	Turn on
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:23,711	| IOT027 |	Please work now right I mean
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:26,527	| IOT027 |	If we say Alexa turn off living room lights
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,551	| IOT027 |	I mean it seems like
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:30,623	| IOT027 |	20% of the time it doesn't work
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,159	| IOT027 |	I would say
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,951	| IOT027 |	That's too high I think it's like five
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:37,023	| IOT027 |	5% of the time it doesn't work but I think
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:38,047	| IOT027 |	They just didn't
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:38,815	| IOT027 |	Update
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:39,327	| IOT027 |	That should help
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,655	| IOT027 |	So I haven't seen it not working
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,703	| IOT027 |	But yes you're right
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:50,079	| IOT027 |	No voice recognition seems to be
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:50,847	| IOT027 |	Getting better
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:51,871	| IOT027 |	I member at first
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,919	| IOT027 |	Understand what we were saying but
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:56,223	| IOT027 |	That really anything to me on
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:58,015	| IOT027 |	On Alexis we're going upstairs and Beyond
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,063	| IOT027 |	Turn off downstairs
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,111	| IOT027 |	And at that point we're halfway up the stairs
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:06,719	| IOT027 |	Light from upstairs we can see so we don't trip and everything downstairs goes off
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,535	| IOT027 |	So
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:11,583	| IOT027 |	What would your advice be to someone
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:12,351	| IOT027 |	Like
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,887	| IOT027 |	If you're hanging out with your friends and
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:19,007	| IOT027 |	And someone mentions like hey I think I'm going to buy a connected device or I'm interested in home automation
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,543	| IOT027 |	I'm other than
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:23,103	| IOT027 |	Maybe you tell them talk to Stacy or maybe sick God don't talk
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,663	| IOT027 |	What would you tell them about
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:26,943	| IOT027 |	What they should buy
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,479	| IOT027 |	Cindy Pickett
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:34,367	| IOT027 |	Open and I think that use are cool and
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,391	| IOT027 |	They're fairly simple
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:37,951	| IOT027 |	I mean if you do have a hug
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:38,719	| IOT027 |	That you have to plug in
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,279	| IOT027 |	But they're fairly simple underneath party
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:42,303	| IOT027 |	If nothing else
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,863	| IOT027 |	Yes there are some cool practical things
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:48,447	| IOT027 |	Having them go on when you're out of town
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:52,031	| IOT027 |	And be able to control them when you're walking away it's on
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,079	| IOT027 |	But I think those are nice
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:56,383	| IOT027 |	And it's kind of all in a box
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:59,199	| IOT027 |	Solution to try to get that wet three bulbs in the hub
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,991	| IOT027 |	So that's interesting
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:03,039	| IOT027 |	And then the other would probably be locked
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:06,623	| IOT027 |	I think we did some presents check but then then you're getting into
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:10,719	| IOT027 |	SmartThings in a hub as well so it gets complicated there but I know people that do like
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:15,583	| IOT027 |	Short-term rentals on houses or have people come in and eat them to be able to come in
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,607	| IOT027 |	To do something real quick
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:20,447	| IOT027 |	I get them you know one time use passcode or something like that
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,727	| IOT027 |	Status Seekers
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,239	| IOT027 |	Practical
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:23,775	| IOT027 |	But I probably start
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:30,175	| IOT027 |	And I know you say you're just get frustrated when he talked about light bulbs all the time but it's the simplest easiest example
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,199	| IOT027 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,223	| IOT027 |	Not like a thermostat
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,015	| IOT027 |	You don't feel like we're getting there
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:37,087	| IOT027 |	Value out of are connected thermostats or anyting
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,623	| IOT027 |	Well that's a good point
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:41,183	| IOT027 |	Yeah I forgot I forget about those beans
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,207	| IOT027 |	Connected and maybe that's
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:43,487	| IOT027 |	Because they judge
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,511	| IOT027 |	Is worthwhile
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:46,047	| IOT027 |	Right I don't
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:48,095	| IOT027 |	The only time I log into the
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,887	| IOT027 |	Is from same iPhone in
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:54,239	| IOT027 |	When something is happening right
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:58,079	| IOT027 |	That's a good point that's a fairly easy
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:02,175	| IOT027 |	On ramp ends well I guess it worked sort of easy to install
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,711	| IOT027 |	We had to get a little bit of help there
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:07,295	| IOT027 |	You know anyone can do that right anyone can
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,831	| IOT027 |	Screw in a lightbulb with a lot of jokes
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,367	| IOT027 |	Anyone can
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,415	| IOT027 |	And I think anyone could just
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,439	| IOT027 |	Put the
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:16,255	| IOT027 |	Plug it into the back of the router
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,583	| IOT027 |	I really think that's easier right you're not
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:20,607	| IOT027 |	Installing sump
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,375	| IOT027 |	10%
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:22,143	| IOT027 |	Okay
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:23,167	| IOT027 |	Well it looks
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:25,215	| IOT027 |	Let's go back to the thermostats and
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:28,287	| IOT027 |	My latest thing because it has been
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:30,079	| IOT027 |	The hotter months of the year here in Texas
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:32,127	| IOT027 |	We've been talking about different
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:35,455	| IOT027 |	Products that help you optimize your
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,223	| IOT027 |	Air conditioner
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:38,271	| IOT027 |	Sing in bioptimizers I'm not talking about
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,319	| IOT027 |	Not like in the nest
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:44,159	| IOT027 |	More in the way of making sure that you
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,951	| IOT027 |	Your air conditioning is running most efficiently
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:49,279	| IOT027 |	So there's a product from Everson called Comfort guard
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:53,375	| IOT027 |	And what this is you have to have a professional installer coming out
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:55,423	| IOT027 |	And what they do is
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:59,263	| IOT027 |	They install about $100 worth of sensors into
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:01,823	| IOT027 |	Your furnace your docs and your
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:04,127	| IOT027 |	Air conditioning unit that sits outside your house
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:07,711	| IOT027 |	And then you pay like an 8 to $10 monthly fee
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:10,527	| IOT027 |	And Those sensors gather data
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:15,135	| IOT027 |	And it's like a Predictive Analytics kind of service for your home so it's supposed to be
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:22,303	| IOT027 |	Checking all of the data from Those sensors and saying hey it looks like your air conditioner is only running at 60% a fish
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:22,815	| IOT027 |	Efficiency right now
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:25,119	| IOT027 |	You should call someone and have them come out or
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:28,703	| IOT027 |	Maybe because the installer who installed it as hell
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,727	| IOT027 |	Contract with you
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:30,751	| IOT027 |	Movie they come out
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:32,543	| IOT027 |	Come out and look at it
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,871	| IOT027 |	There's also
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:38,431	| IOT027 |	Some kind of interesting new things tied to data coming out
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:39,711	| IOT027 |	Soon
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:40,991	| IOT027 |	I can't talk about all this
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:44,575	| IOT027 |	But then we also had our HP AC guy come out
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:47,135	| IOT027 |	Just the other day for a regular maintenance check
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,927	| IOT027 |	And he told us some cool stuff
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,719	| IOT027 |	So angry when I talk about some of that
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:54,047	| IOT027 |	I think the more interesting thing about what he's obviously he has
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,839	| IOT027 |	Incentive
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:59,423	| IOT027 |	This guy doesn't think about it that way right
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,191	| IOT027 |	Attack but
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:04,287	| IOT027 |	I think it was interesting what you said and I think it's interesting because we
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:06,335	| IOT027 |	I feel like some of the things you tell me about
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,359	| IOT027 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:09,407	| IOT027 |	Connected devices kind of get ahead of them
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:12,735	| IOT027 |	Sounds right they aren't solving a huge problem and so
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:15,551	| IOT027 |	I would question in this case is like well
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:17,855	| IOT027 |	Love you so
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:20,927	| IOT027 |	Almost two years at the guy at 250
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:23,743	| IOT027 |	Right is everything is working fine
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:26,559	| IOT027 |	Cleaning jobs outside
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:29,887	| IOT027 |	Lead staff into the each of our units
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:30,911	| IOT027 |	He's like well
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:32,703	| IOT027 |	You know installing something
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,727	| IOT027 |	She just get
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:36,543	| IOT027 |	If you just get fairly regular maintenance on these you're going to
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,311	| IOT027 |	Catch it
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:37,823	| IOT027 |	In advance
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:42,175	| IOT027 |	You don't even a leak on something isn't something that overnight
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:44,223	| IOT027 |	You know it loses all its power
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:47,295	| IOT027 |	Or something like that so I guess the question is how much it cost
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:48,831	| IOT027 |	And how much
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:50,879	| IOT027 |	It's ongoing
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:53,695	| IOT027 |	And having a professional come out and install it
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:55,743	| IOT027 |	Ali really fixing that big of a problem
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:15:02,655	| IOT027 |	Also said the fact that we had both an ecobee n&s so we had connected thermostats he was like
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:07,007	| IOT027 |	Is news things detect a problem or an anomalous use
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:10,079	| IOT027 |	They will also let you know
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,103	| IOT027 |	Which I thought was kind of
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,383	| IOT027 |	As well
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:13,663	| IOT027 |	And then
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:14,687	| IOT027 |	Yeah I haven't I haven't
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:16,223	| IOT027 |	If they would actually
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:16,735	| IOT027 |	Do
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:21,855	| IOT027 |	I was I was a little curious about that myself I was like
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:23,135	| IOT027 |	I did not think they would do that
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,671	| IOT027 |	But
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,463	| IOT027 |	We also running the
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:28,511	| IOT027 |	Bruker things from curb
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:30,559	| IOT027 |	So we're checking our energy usage
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:31,327	| IOT027 |	Can real time
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:33,631	| IOT027 |	And that actually will send us a notification if
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,399	| IOT027 |	Fitzy's vet
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:35,679	| IOT027 |	Were using
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:39,775	| IOT027 |	In the curb is need but you know there's another one where
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:46,687	| IOT027 |	You know you have to have an electrician come out I'm sure I don't know how much it is but I'm sure it's expensive and it's like well even from
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:48,735	| IOT027 |	Cost savings perspective right eye mean
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,759	| IOT027 |	Maybe it's cuz we don't
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:50,527	| IOT027 |	Use a lot of
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:52,575	| IOT027 |	Energy relatively speaking by
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:54,623	| IOT027 |	How much are you going to say versus how much
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:55,647	| IOT027 |	Does it cost
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,183	| IOT027 |	Is one of those things that
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:59,487	| IOT027 |	I think when I see some devices
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:01,023	| IOT027 |	Ashley
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,303	| IOT027 |	Prevent something
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:04,095	| IOT027 |	Mildly bad from happening or
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:04,863	| IOT027 |	We save you money
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:07,167	| IOT027 |	It's felt like a back.
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,447	| IOT027 |	5 years
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:10,239	| IOT027 |	I'm probably not interested
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:13,055	| IOT027 |	Wow C on an air conditioning I feel like
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:15,103	| IOT027 |	Because those things are like $9,000
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,895	| IOT027 |	It feels like well
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:22,015	| IOT027 |	If something was to go wrong that would actually break it and make you have to replace entire thing will that's one thing
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:25,087	| IOT027 |	Oh look it's not working as well
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,391	| IOT027 |	Needs to be even if you don't have anything
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:29,951	| IOT027 |	Is my utility bill
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:34,303	| IOT027 |	So much higher than usual at that point then you pick up the phone you have someone come out
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:36,095	| IOT027 |	And they say I'll look that's because of this
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:37,887	| IOT027 |	This is dirty or this isn't working
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,679	| IOT027 |	Air compressor sailing
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,959	| IOT027 |	IFixit
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:41,727	| IOT027 |	You know most
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,775	| IOT027 |	Townhomes for 500 bucks
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:44,799	| IOT027 |	In that
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,335	| IOT027 |	Wehrli
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:47,615	| IOT027 |	Did something happen
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,943	| IOT027 |	Replace buffer units especially
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,735	| IOT027 |	If it's on older ones
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:54,527	| IOT027 |	Is Tommy going to happen anyway
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,903	| IOT027 |	That's true and I get very excited about
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:01,439	| IOT027 |	Possibilities of all of this data
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:06,047	| IOT027 |	Because I'm looking so far ahead but you're right as a homeowner it seems very
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:07,839	| IOT027 |	It's a very difficult
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:09,887	| IOT027 |	So I guess we'll see
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,935	| IOT027 |	So any final thoughts
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:13,727	| IOT027 |	481 in this industry
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:15,263	| IOT027 |	You is a guy
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:16,799	| IOT027 |	2
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:17,567	| IOT027 |	It's kind of like
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,079	| IOT027 |	Probably
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:21,407	| IOT027 |	Way more mainstream buyer of all of this Tech than anybody
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:22,687	| IOT027 |	Spike especially me
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,967	| IOT027 |	And Kevin
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:25,247	| IOT027 |	What is your advice to
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:25,759	| IOT027 |	People who are
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:26,783	| IOT027 |	Building this in
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,599	| IOT027 |	I say make it simple
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:33,695	| IOT027 |	Make sure there is a very easy to understand rli
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:35,231	| IOT027 |	And then make it work out of the box
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:37,279	| IOT027 |	By the time it ships
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,303	| IOT027 |	It just has to
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:38,815	| IOT027 |	Castaway
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:42,143	| IOT027 |	You know I think it seems like an and I know you get plenty of Alf
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:47,007	| IOT027 |	Test your first words have been said
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,847	| IOT027 |	I got to ask what about your data private
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:52,127	| IOT027 |	Are you worried about that
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,663	| IOT027 |	Particularly
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:18:00,063	| IOT027 |	You know the only thing it cameras are the one thing that concerns me a little bit I like the idea of cameras on the outs
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:00,575	| IOT027 |	Dial home
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:06,207	| IOT027 |	Because you have some breaks on or something then hopefully you can get the picture then that doorbell we have is kind of neat
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:08,767	| IOT027 |	Morrison walks up to it at
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,559	| IOT027 |	He could take some video of them
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:13,119	| IOT027 |	I mean I don't know what the nest
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:13,887	| IOT027 |	Is going to get
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:16,703	| IOT027 |	That is going to really cause a privacy issue
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:24,895	| IOT027 |	I guess I could see one of these being used in a court case when someone says they were somewhere and they weren't
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:28,735	| IOT027 |	Yeah it's mostly cameras and making sure that my
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,503	| IOT027 |	Privacy
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:31,039	| IOT027 |	You know nothing
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,367	| IOT027 |	All right
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:36,671	| IOT027 |	Thank you so much for coming on the show today and
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:41,535	| IOT027 |	I'm glad to be a fill in for Kevin but I'm sure your guests will be throwing
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,303	| IOT027 |	USAC next week
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:44,607	| IOT027 |	Oh nonsense they love their perspective from
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:45,631	| IOT027 |	Guy who doesn't
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:48,191	| IOT027 |	Sincerely. I was going to say no much
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:49,471	| IOT027 |	But that's not the right word
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:51,007	| IOT027 |	The guy who doesn't necessarily
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,287	| IOT027 |	Love the Smart car
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:59,967	| IOT027 |	Alright just let me know
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,783	| IOT027 |	And I appreciate you inviting me
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,575	| IOT027 |	There you go I'd like
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:05,343	| IOT027 |	Your paycheck
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:06,367	| IOT027 |	It's in the mail
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,647	| IOT027 |	All right
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,671	| IOT027 |	Thank you
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:10,207	| IOT027 |	Stay tuned for
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:12,255	| IOT027 |	Our Guest this week who is
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:19,167	| IOT027 |	Nandini Nayak who is going to talk to us about building Living Services and how big companies and
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:25,311	| IOT027 |	And small companies are going to have to adapt to having connected devices everywhere
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:34,527	| IOT027 |	Hi everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is Stacey Higginbotham and today my guess
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,807	| IOT027 |	West Nyack
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,879	| IOT027 |	She is the design strategy leader at
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:39,391	| IOT027 |	Yours
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:43,999	| IOT027 |	And she's also for the time being heading up there San Francisco Design Studio
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,791	| IOT027 |	Hainan how are you doing
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:48,095	| IOT027 |	I'm good baby how are you
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,119	| IOT027 |	I am awesomeness
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:51,679	| IOT027 |	So I'm really excited
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,727	| IOT027 |	Need to talk to you because you have actually
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:57,823	| IOT027 |	When I met you a couple months back you actually put into words very eloquently
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:02,943	| IOT027 |	A concept that I've been thinking about for a while which is this idea of living service
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,479	| IOT027 |	Do you want to
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,503	| IOT027 |	Kind of talk about what that is
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:07,551	| IOT027 |	Let's read
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:09,343	| IOT027 |	You don't Living Services in
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:12,159	| IOT027 |	Fjord has talked
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:15,231	| IOT027 |	I mean all of you guys talk about the internet
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:18,559	| IOT027 |	And you know the fact that you know you can have
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:24,191	| IOT027 |	But I think what
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,215	| IOT027 |	We believers
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:27,263	| IOT027 |	The more interesting aspect of
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:30,335	| IOT027 |	Is technology it should be a fun holiday in April
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:32,383	| IOT027 |	A new kind of service
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,919	| IOT027 |	A new kind of living
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:35,455	| IOT027 |	My dad
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:36,991	| IOT027 |	Give me about
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:41,343	| IOT027 |	Digital Services becoming more human-like
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:44,415	| IOT027 |	You know more responsive to contacts more
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,951	| IOT027 |	A meeting with Kim and expect
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:49,023	| IOT027 |	So we called it the era of living service
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,095	| IOT027 |	Galaxy
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:56,447	| IOT027 |	Age of nginx where you know finally he had access to.
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:00,031	| IOT027 |	Assign you think
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:02,079	| IOT027 |	Computing has become
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:03,359	| IOT027 |	So every day
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,127	| IOT027 |	Double X back
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,407	| IOT027 |	Have
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,943	| IOT027 |	Everything
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:10,015	| IOT027 |	Begin to kind of connect together to help us live
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:10,527	| IOT027 |	Better life
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:14,879	| IOT027 |	Okay and that's
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,928	| IOT027 |	That's a very nice overview
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:20,256	| IOT027 |	And I think one of the things that I thought was really
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,024	| IOT027 |	Compelling about it
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:24,864	| IOT027 |	Is that it offers this kind of sense of customization
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:27,168	| IOT027 |	So this idea that
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:30,496	| IOT027 |	You not only design a product to put in people's homes
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:32,032	| IOT027 |	But what you're doing is your
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,080	| IOT027 |	Again building service
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,360	| IOT027 |	And the service is
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,128	| IOT027 |	Unique 4
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:41,504	| IOT027 |	Maybe individuals maybe it's a family that lives in the home and consumes the service
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:44,320	| IOT027 |	I guess it could be a corporation we can talk about that
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:46,112	| IOT027 |	So you're developing this
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,648	| IOT027 |	Service but
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:50,464	| IOT027 |	It doesn't what what I think is kefir
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:52,768	| IOT027 |	Businesses is that it doesn't end
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,048	| IOT027 |	With a purchase
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:55,840	| IOT027 |	The product is going to exist
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,888	| IOT027 |	Far and Away Beyond
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:58,912	| IOT027 |	Purchase
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,448	| IOT027 |	So it could go
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:02,752	| IOT027 |	To be a washing machine that I
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,264	| IOT027 |	Can I buy
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,056	| IOT027 |	But I'm also going to
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:05,568	| IOT027 |	Consume
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:09,408	| IOT027 |	Some sort of maybe it's a replenishment service with it
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,688	| IOT027 |	Or maybe it is
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:12,224	| IOT027 |	I don't know
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:15,552	| IOT027 |	Maybe it's a warranty that's actually a little bit more Interactive
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:18,880	| IOT027 |	Can you give us an example of some of these
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,904	| IOT027 |	Living Services
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:20,672	| IOT027 |	As you see it
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:27,072	| IOT027 |	Anything fundamentally living from 2:40
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,864	| IOT027 |	Talking about is the digitization of a
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:29,888	| IOT027 |	Which means
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:33,984	| IOT027 |	Yak everyday devices of washing machine your strength
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:40,128	| IOT027 |	I'm eating your counselor your fork me have some level of ability to change the environment
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:43,712	| IOT027 |	To capture some data and also respond in
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:47,808	| IOT027 |	And that's what your he's object by themselves
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:49,088	| IOT027 |	Are not the product
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:52,928	| IOT027 |	Human in Chinese
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,720	| IOT027 |	Big service
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:57,280	| IOT027 |	Let's talk about the washing machine
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,584	| IOT027 |	You know whenever I'm in
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:02,656	| IOT027 |	Add doing laundry
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:10,336	| IOT027 |	Weather I have all the different detergent I use for different
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,640	| IOT027 |	Imagine of
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:15,968	| IOT027 |	Washing machines in the future.
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:18,016	| IOT027 |	Determining whether I have enough
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:22,880	| IOT027 |	That I am running out of something one of them
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:24,928	| IOT027 |	I'll be able to on again
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:25,696	| IOT027 |	Kind of
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:30,048	| IOT027 |	To my shopping list
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:32,352	| IOT027 |	Signal the brain to send it over to me
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,216	| IOT027 |	I don't even have to
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,240	| IOT027 |	Drink about
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,264	| IOT027 |	Odoo I have enough
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:44,640	| IOT027 |	Magically
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:48,480	| IOT027 |	Is alternates a mundane task
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:50,784	| IOT027 |	Add button to my day-to-day life
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:53,600	| IOT027 |	Austin & Ally I Think About You
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:24:01,792	| IOT027 |	All you may think about whether my mother is out of
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:03,328	| IOT027 |	Not because she's a diabetic
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:07,168	| IOT027 |	I'm so I need to make sure
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:14,592	| IOT027 |	The truck after the hard product
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:17,920	| IOT027 |	Rubbish
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:24,064	| IOT027 |	Participation in my life not just in the washing machine
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:26,368	| IOT027 |	Help me deal with e
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:30,464	| IOT027 |	Cast of Walking Dead
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:33,280	| IOT027 |	Eventually you may even think about whether the
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:36,352	| IOT027 |	The interface that that washing machine has could do other thing
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:42,496	| IOT027 |	Like in my laundry room I have other things going on like how often do I need to do laundry
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:46,336	| IOT027 |	Why do not be with my son.
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:52,224	| IOT027 |	Don't we have settings that he does everything in one pile
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:59,136	| IOT027 |	I want you to point to what you were talking about
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:01,952	| IOT027 |	Lutetia Vision specialize themselves to individual
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:03,744	| IOT027 |	Do. You know
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:06,048	| IOT027 |	When I walk into the room
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:08,608	| IOT027 |	He decided settings for how I might
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:11,424	| IOT027 |	You can imagine how this
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:13,984	| IOT027 |	Would extend into the future in terms of
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,264	| IOT027 |	How
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,544	| IOT027 |	The environment
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,824	| IOT027 |	The ecosystem
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:18,848	| IOT027 |	Begins to
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:21,408	| IOT027 |	Connect to individual to a present
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,944	| IOT027 |	Iron Sheik
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:24,224	| IOT027 |	Skin challenge around
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:26,016	| IOT027 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:28,064	| IOT027 |	In these examples sound very
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:33,440	| IOT027 |	Consumer-oriented in maybe you cannot just consumer but consumption oriented
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:35,232	| IOT027 |	It's so I'm picking Amazon Dash
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:37,536	| IOT027 |	For example are Amazon's replenishment services
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:40,096	| IOT027 |	Are very
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:41,376	| IOT027 |	Nascent maybe steps to this
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:46,240	| IOT027 |	But let's think about can you bring Living Services outside of
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:48,032	| IOT027 |	Me buying more stuff
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:49,568	| IOT027 |	If that makes sense
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:51,360	| IOT027 |	Because right now this feels very much
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:52,640	| IOT027 |	Align
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:54,688	| IOT027 |	Buying things that I need right now but
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:55,456	| IOT027 |	Let's take it
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:55,968	| IOT027 |	To something else
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:58,016	| IOT027 |	Let's think about the working
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:05,696	| IOT027 |	Doing people are working today you know most companies have
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:07,744	| IOT027 |	Songs about the future
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:12,608	| IOT027 |	Practices you know you're coming into second time and time you should have certain types of
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:14,400	| IOT027 |	Are you doing
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,936	| IOT027 |	Differentiate between
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:19,520	| IOT027 |	How I like to work which is how they see me like to work
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:25,664	| IOT027 |	A weather alert during the morning times where I think he likes you
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:30,272	| IOT027 |	Standardized
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:32,320	| IOT027 |	What please
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:35,392	| IOT027 |	Luminosity be helping productivity
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:39,232	| IOT027 |	50 company
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:43,328	| IOT027 |	How people need to be supported
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,912	| IOT027 |	Highly cognitive
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:50,752	| IOT027 |	And you know how you be set up for that type of work
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:54,592	| IOT027 |	14 ammo
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:58,688	| IOT027 |	Begin to have dentures in
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:09,952	| IOT027 |	Doing a certain type of what
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:15,072	| IOT027 |	It's not too much consumption oriented it's actually
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:17,888	| IOT027 |	What might be the cops number
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:21,984	| IOT027 |	Even in the washing machine
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:23,520	| IOT027 |	Ecosystem for back
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:26,848	| IOT027 |	I think you think about it as
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:28,384	| IOT027 |	What is a human intentions
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:30,176	| IOT027 |	Supported
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:31,968	| IOT027 |	And how do you support them
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:36,320	| IOT027 |	Catching that I take notes about that person that have it
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:38,368	| IOT027 |	That College
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,648	| IOT027 |	Tossed and turned
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:41,184	| IOT027 |	And you'll begin to see
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:43,744	| IOT027 |	You don't work environment adjusted.
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:48,608	| IOT027 |	Think about it
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:50,656	| IOT027 |	Audrey
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:54,240	| IOT027 |	Printing Supplies similar to house washing machine
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:55,776	| IOT027 |	Usher
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:57,312	| IOT027 |	And I can think of in the home
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,360	| IOT027 |	Do you want to leave the laundry room which
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:01,920	| IOT027 |	Crazy specific
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:03,712	| IOT027 |	But you can even think of
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:04,480	| IOT027 |	Gosh is
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:07,808	| IOT027 |	It's my my home can read my contacts
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:08,832	| IOT027 |	Clues appropriately
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,880	| IOT027 |	It could figure out o
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:15,488	| IOT027 |	Josh Stacy right now is getting ready to cook time I'm reading the symbols she's
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:19,072	| IOT027 |	She's coming into the kitchen she's turning on her work lights right above the
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:19,840	| IOT027 |	The counter
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:21,888	| IOT027 |	You know she's she's washing her hands
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:26,240	| IOT027 |	She's made like six trips to the refrigerator and then to the pantry
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:28,800	| IOT027 |	Those are all pretty indicative of
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:31,360	| IOT027 |	Setting her prep getting her prepped together so then
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:33,408	| IOT027 |	My kitchen can start adapting itself
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:36,224	| IOT027 |	My kitchen
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:37,248	| IOT027 |	Settings which is
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:39,040	| IOT027 |	In addition that lighting there's
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:39,808	| IOT027 |	Music I like
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:44,160	| IOT027 |	Be awesome if Mike my robotic Butler could bring me my glass of cooking wine
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:47,232	| IOT027 |	Yeah but you know we'll get there my Amazon
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:50,816	| IOT027 |	Echo could start you know pulling up the recipe that I sent
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:53,888	| IOT027 |	And you know I can see these
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:54,912	| IOT027 |	Kind of things start
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:57,472	| IOT027 |	To develop and that is not consumption that is purely
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:59,008	| IOT027 |	A service that would help me
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:01,056	| IOT027 |	It leads to consumption
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:03,360	| IOT027 |	Hopefully the consumption of delicious food
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:05,664	| IOT027 |	And in 20 minutes or less
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:10,272	| IOT027 |	And I think that one of the important things you like to do
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:13,600	| IOT027 |	Stop thinking about Industries
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:18,720	| IOT027 |	Louisiana find them today right
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:20,000	| IOT027 |	Unhide products
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:25,888	| IOT027 |	I just because we are talking about supporting human pattern
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:29,984	| IOT027 |	You probably think about ecosystems off services that make Carson
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:33,312	| IOT027 |	Okay so like in that example and ecosystem
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:36,128	| IOT027 |	Is it a kitchen ecosystem so then I might need
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:43,296	| IOT027 |	Because I don't have all appliances from one Bender I would need my Samsung refrigerator to talk to my Bosch dishwasher
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,832	| IOT027 |	In my Delta faucet
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:46,112	| IOT027 |	And my
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:50,208	| IOT027 |	I don't know who makes my pots and pans they're not connected but
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:50,720	| IOT027 |	You know
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:57,376	| IOT027 |	Getting all that plus I'm going to want my cookbooks and recipes to be communicating also it probably to
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:30:00,960	| IOT027 |	My fitness stuff but also to my family's because
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:06,080	| IOT027 |	It would be nice to know what they've been going through that day or maybe what they got on track
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:08,128	| IOT027 |	Cuz if my husband is planning on a
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:11,456	| IOT027 |	13 Mile run tomorrow to help train for his Marathon
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:14,272	| IOT027 |	Maybe I can cook something that helps him prepare for that
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:18,880	| IOT027 |	And you may know that he's planning for a dirty mind even before he
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:25,280	| IOT027 |	Like you might be going on the lunch tomorrow
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:31,936	| IOT027 |	And I guess you're kind of also means that you know that
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:35,776	| IOT027 |	H-2b
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:37,824	| IOT027 |	On that allows you to connect
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:39,872	| IOT027 |	Steve individualized
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:45,760	| IOT027 |	Based on what
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:48,064	| IOT027 |	Specific intent
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:50,624	| IOT027 |	But then how did it connect to all of the others
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:51,904	| IOT027 |	In the context
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:55,744	| IOT027 |	Destiny Achievers and what is the band what is
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:57,792	| IOT027 |	What is blinding
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:31:00,608	| IOT027 |	I think that's going to be an interesting
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:02,144	| IOT027 |	Evolution of
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:05,216	| IOT027 |	What brand small atomizer
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:15,712	| IOT027 |	Taking that you're going to be an interesting time to examine how landing page
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:20,064	| IOT027 |	Well let's talk about that because right now I see
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:24,160	| IOT027 |	If I think about Brandon that context especially in the home I've got like
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,464	| IOT027 |	We'll just works with x
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:28,768	| IOT027 |	So if that works with homekit
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:29,792	| IOT027 |	Works with nest
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:31,840	| IOT027 |	It works with whatever brand is out there
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:34,144	| IOT027 |	But if I'm Ge
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:35,424	| IOT027 |	Or if I'm bi
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:36,192	| IOT027 |	Or
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:41,312	| IOT027 |	And that's in the consumer space if I'm in the Enterprise space if I'm IBM or if I'm Cisco
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:42,848	| IOT027 |	How do I build
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,128	| IOT027 |	A brand
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:44,640	| IOT027 |	Around
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:46,176	| IOT027 |	These experiences
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:50,272	| IOT027 |	Do I build a brand around experiences or do I build a brand around
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:51,296	| IOT027 |	Products
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:53,344	| IOT027 |	Or servicer
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:55,136	| IOT027 |	I don't even know Nan help
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:55,648	| IOT027 |	My God
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:58,976	| IOT027 |	Yeah I think I can
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:31:59,488	| IOT027 |	Interesting question
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:05,120	| IOT027 |	If you want to bring the Vans and I think we've talked a bit about
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:05,888	| IOT027 |	You know how many
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:08,960	| IOT027 |	True blance can a human
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:10,496	| IOT027 |	Have a relationship with
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,520	| IOT027 |	Did she was in the vacuum
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:17,408	| IOT027 |	Don't believe any money Branch services
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,456	| IOT027 |	And sometimes it's not
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:25,600	| IOT027 |	Shingles
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:29,440	| IOT027 |	That's media
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:33,280	| IOT027 |	So I can if you depend upon what
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:34,304	| IOT027 |	Platforms in Ark
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:37,376	| IOT027 |	And whether branding becomes
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:39,936	| IOT027 |	Important enzyme the recognition of a concussion
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:45,056	| IOT027 |	Method of how you do things
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:47,104	| IOT027 |	Is the collection of brands that
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:54,016	| IOT027 |	Show me Product brands have to figure out how they become
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:56,576	| IOT027 |	Experience branch
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:57,856	| IOT027 |	Experience brands that
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:00,160	| IOT027 |	DD's Connections in the mostest
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:04,512	| IOT027 |	Recognize
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:07,328	| IOT027 |	Rachel's example
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:16,032	| IOT027 |	Infuriating that donkey
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:16,800	| IOT027 |	Competing products
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:19,104	| IOT027 |	Guess what
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:25,248	| IOT027 |	Not going to be
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:31,648	| IOT027 |	That DJ Jason sees the connection
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:34,208	| IOT027 |	The collections of services that you recognize
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:37,536	| IOT027 |	Add something that participates in your life
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:40,864	| IOT027 |	So we can be have answer to that
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:42,912	| IOT027 |	Yes but I think you do
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:44,960	| IOT027 |	Transformational time when
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:47,008	| IOT027 |	So we're going to have
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:48,544	| IOT027 |	A reduction in the value
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:49,824	| IOT027 |	Brands that sounds like
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:51,360	| IOT027 |	And what's going to happen is we're going to have a
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:53,152	| IOT027 |	Quote unquote living brand
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:55,456	| IOT027 |	It's going to be kind of experiential
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,248	| IOT027 |	And it's going to be
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:59,296	| IOT027 |	These brands are going to be these
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,064	| IOT027 |	Curated
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:01,856	| IOT027 |	I guess we'll call it a platform
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:03,904	| IOT027 |	Of these atomized services
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:04,416	| IOT027 |	An experience
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:06,976	| IOT027 |	So then my question to you
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:08,256	| IOT027 |	Is
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:10,048	| IOT027 |	As I'm building out these Platte
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:10,560	| IOT027 |	Forms
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:13,376	| IOT027 |	Does this living brand sodas
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:14,912	| IOT027 |	Monolithic
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:15,424	| IOT027 |	Platform
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:17,728	| IOT027 |	Are they choosing
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,264	| IOT027 |	Who they play with
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:25,408	| IOT027 |	Is there no like real interoperability or are they going to be doing the hard work of making
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:26,688	| IOT027 |	Things in Rockford
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:30,528	| IOT027 |	And as the consumer does that mean we're going to have to choose between
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:32,320	| IOT027 |	Establish cluster
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:33,088	| IOT027 |	Brandon
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:33,856	| IOT027 |	Experiences
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:36,160	| IOT027 |	As opposed to kind of building our own
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:39,232	| IOT027 |	Yeah I think more and more you know
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:40,512	| IOT027 |	Even though
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:43,072	| IOT027 |	Number of Living Services.
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:46,400	| IOT027 |	I'm available
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:48,192	| IOT027 |	You want to have
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:49,472	| IOT027 |	Knowing Translate
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:51,520	| IOT027 |	Cuba Cuba
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:55,360	| IOT027 |	Play similar to
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:57,152	| IOT027 |	Think about it like a travel agent
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:00,992	| IOT027 |	I need you to delete all the time
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,528	| IOT027 |	Travel
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:04,576	| IOT027 |	Arby's song
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:06,880	| IOT027 |	Booking on a
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:08,160	| IOT027 |	Locations
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:09,440	| IOT027 |	Looking on this device
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:10,720	| IOT027 |	Travel
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:11,488	| IOT027 |	Some point to point
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:18,400	| IOT027 |	My home travel experience of going to a particular
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:25,568	| IOT027 |	You may begin to see Airbnb may become
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:26,336	| IOT027 |	Because
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:28,128	| IOT027 |	Deactivating a
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:31,200	| IOT027 |	Part of that experience but they are beginning to look at json
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:32,992	| IOT027 |	They may combine with other
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:37,856	| IOT027 |	You may think about Airbnb
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:42,720	| IOT027 |	Maybe have some flexibility in picking
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:44,256	| IOT027 |	Chuggington from different brands
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:46,048	| IOT027 |	I think it would be interesting to
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:51,936	| IOT027 |	Experian
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:53,472	| IOT027 |	And then how you
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:54,496	| IOT027 |	Ida
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:56,544	| IOT027 |	Give up control to one of those bands
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:57,568	| IOT027 |	Insecurities
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:35:58,336	| IOT027 |	Kayaking
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:03,456	| IOT027 |	Ultimate Ninja potions that you want to have some flexibility of control over
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:04,480	| IOT027 |	Chess master
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:08,320	| IOT027 |	I think it would be interesting to see how this notion
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:10,624	| IOT027 |	Living Brands come to life
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:14,976	| IOT027 |	Where your total expense maybe a combination of brand with one or two
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:17,792	| IOT027 |	Okay that makes sense
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:18,560	| IOT027 |	It does that
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:19,328	| IOT027 |	Make sense
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:21,888	| IOT027 |	All right into if you're an established company
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:23,936	| IOT027 |	As opposed to
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:24,448	| IOT027 |	A startup
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:25,984	| IOT027 |	How do you kind of
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:28,032	| IOT027 |	If you want to
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:29,568	| IOT027 |	Develop a living service
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:31,616	| IOT027 |	How do you canoe
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:32,384	| IOT027 |	Get there
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:38,272	| IOT027 |	And then do these companies established companies have an advantage in establishing a living brand
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:39,296	| IOT027 |	Orteza startup
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:41,600	| IOT027 |	Don't you think about it
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:43,904	| IOT027 |	Create a living cell
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:48,512	| IOT027 |	Creative Living Services that fundamentally is that you have
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:49,024	| IOT027 |	No

EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:31,008	| IOT027 |	Dimensions the intersection of them
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:34,848	| IOT027 |	You can think of about 15 ground for the diesel
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:41,760	| IOT027 |	Pokemon company I think it may be a bit
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:44,832	| IOT027 |	May not have the history of how they have
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:45,600	| IOT027 |	Known
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:47,904	| IOT027 |	If you would like to disappoint their customer base
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:51,488	| IOT027 |	But I think.
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:53,024	| IOT027 |	Juanita Jackson would be
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:56,096	| IOT027 |	Is that they should not just think about themselves

EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:09,664	| IOT027 |	Amal Fuller capabilities
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:15,808	| IOT027 |	It allows you to even have an API on a connection
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:16,576	| IOT027 |	Something more
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:18,880	| IOT027 |	Xiamen company
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:20,928	| IOT027 |	Think about
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:22,720	| IOT027 |	Something Beyond
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:24,256	| IOT027 |	What I'm trying to design
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:25,536	| IOT027 |	Designing

EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:33,984	| IOT027 |	Jupiter Center in to figure out
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:36,800	| IOT027 |	You know how warm is going to be
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:38,848	| IOT027 |	Pikachu
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:40,640	| IOT027 |	Adjust
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:43,200	| IOT027 |	So if you are going to be
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:46,016	| IOT027 |	Maybe I can offer you at
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:50,880	| IOT027 |	Starting a new company
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:52,160	| IOT027 |	Begin to think about
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:59,072	| IOT027 |	Products in terms of services on living furniture
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:38:59,840	| IOT027 |	Benefits
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:00,608	| IOT027 |	Ashanti
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:05,216	| IOT027 |	For more established companies I think the challenges they have
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:07,008	| IOT027 |	Lots and lots of data
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:09,312	| IOT027 |	And absolutely don't know
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:10,848	| IOT027 |	How to extract the patterns
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:15,456	| IOT027 |	The one of the things that job to think about
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:18,016	| IOT027 |	Understand how to
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:21,600	| IOT027 |	Understand what in the data
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:22,368	| IOT027 |	Are there
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:25,696	| IOT027 |	Insights from the data that can be used to create new living
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:29,536	| IOT027 |	And you could also ask yourself
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:36,704	| IOT027 |	What contextual information to enhance the product or service that
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:37,984	| IOT027 |	I'm already creating
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:44,896	| IOT027 |	Because the tunnel vision into this is how I think about
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:54,112	| IOT027 |	Think about how to
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:56,672	| IOT027 |	Change the Viewpoint of how they think
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:40:00,768	| IOT027 |	So I think there's more transformation
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:06,144	| IOT027 |	Big companies that can be done from the start
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:08,448	| IOT027 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:09,728	| IOT027 |	And
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:11,008	| IOT027 |	When it comes to building
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:12,544	| IOT027 |	A living
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:13,056	| IOT027 |	Brand
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:16,128	| IOT027 |	Do bigger companies have it
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:16,640	| IOT027 |	Easier
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:22,528	| IOT027 |	I think because we have an established brand it would seem that they may have an advantage
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:25,344	| IOT027 |	Depend upon with the keeping up with the
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:26,880	| IOT027 |	Straight Talk
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:30,976	| IOT027 |	I can think of companies are beginning to see that the Conte just got to come
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:37,120	| IOT027 |	Experience
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,144	| IOT027 |	Movie back in action
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:41,472	| IOT027 |	Where did beginning to do mashups with smaller
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:47,616	| IOT027 |	A new version of intellij idea
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:50,176	| IOT027 |	Can you use that brand Treasures
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:51,712	| IOT027 |	Stewie evil tulip
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:52,736	| IOT027 |	Dog in the state
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:55,040	| IOT027 |	I think that extends
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:56,832	| IOT027 |	Are you conceited a positive
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:57,856	| IOT027 |	On the other hand
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:58,880	| IOT027 |	If you don't
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:01,184	| IOT027 |	Expected Market that you're beginning to do that
