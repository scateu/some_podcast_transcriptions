EDL	00:00:23,808	00:00:25,600	| IOT223 |	Astonishing because we're going to talk about
EDL	00:00:26,112	00:00:26,624	| IOT223 |	Amazon
EDL	00:00:27,136	00:00:29,440	| IOT223 |	Finally answering some questions about
EDL	00:00:29,952	00:00:30,976	| IOT223 |	What it does with your
EDL	00:00:31,488	00:00:32,000	| IOT223 |	Voice
EDL	00:00:32,512	00:00:33,024	| IOT223 |	Data
EDL	00:00:33,536	00:00:36,864	| IOT223 |	Plus we are going to be talking about another smart home platform
EDL	00:00:36,864	00:00:37,376	| IOT223 |	Data leak
EDL	00:00:37,888	00:00:38,656	| IOT223 |	We got
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:42,496	| IOT223 |	D-Link settlement with the FTC over at security failures
EDL	00:00:43,008	00:00:44,288	| IOT223 |	We've got a hat
EDL	00:00:44,288	00:00:45,312	| IOT223 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:00:45,312	00:00:46,592	| IOT223 |	It might be
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:49,664	| IOT223 |	Put in lots of apartment buildings around the country
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:54,272	| IOT223 |	We got some news about hpe and its plan to
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:57,344	| IOT223 |	Continue its own digital transformation
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:01:00,160	| IOT223 |	Kevin tried out some new software
EDL	00:01:00,160	00:01:01,440	| IOT223 |	Could replace if
EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:02,208	| IOT223 |	Or could it
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:05,280	| IOT223 |	And we got lots of little updates on
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:08,864	| IOT223 |	Products and stuff you probably use
EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:09,888	| IOT223 |	Plus
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:10,912	| IOT223 |	We have
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:15,008	| IOT223 |	Andy Lowery the CEO of real whereas Our Guest on the show this week
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:17,056	| IOT223 |	Realwear just raised
EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:18,592	| IOT223 |	80 million dollars
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:22,688	| IOT223 |	I will talk to him about using heads-up displays in industrial settings
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:24,736	| IOT223 |	Why
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:26,016	| IOT223 |	That's taking so long
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:32,672	| IOT223 |	So we're going to talk about this plus hear from our sponsor Dell Technologies
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:34,208	| IOT223 |	But before we get to that
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:37,024	| IOT223 |	Let's hear from another one of our sponsors
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:39,328	| IOT223 |	This week sponsor is a pharaoh
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:42,912	| IOT223 |	Are you doing multiple iot projects that work
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:49,312	| IOT223 |	Well together is there a single app that strengthens your brand this is really tough stuff and it requires
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:55,712	| IOT223 |	The right platform but with a pharaoh Kenmore launch 42 smart Appliance models in just two years
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:02:02,112	| IOT223 |	Anna Farrell customers realized as much as an 80% reduction in time to Market
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:08,512	| IOT223 |	99% pure support calls and 10x higher activation rates plus they can reuse
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:12,864	| IOT223 |	Is 90% of their work from one project to the next so
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:17,216	| IOT223 |	If you're looking to do multiple iot projects or just one pic of pharaoh
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:23,616	| IOT223 |	Just like Kenmore Mitsubishi ufj group and dealing did and you can beat your carpet
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:28,736	| IOT223 |	Addition with a solution that your team loves to build on and your customers love to use
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:32,576	| IOT223 |	Learn more at a pharaoh. IO
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:35,648	| IOT223 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:39,232	| IOT223 |	Big news on the Privacy front this week
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:42,560	| IOT223 |	We've called privacy friend are we just call it the Madame de France
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:46,656	| IOT223 |	Email specific to matamata but it is
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,680	| IOT223 |	Privacy so
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:54,848	| IOT223 |	Here's the deal cuz there's a lot happening here and there's a lot of concern and I would say these are legitimate
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:55,616	| IOT223 |	Questions
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,640	| IOT223 |	So what has happened
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,152	| IOT223 |	It is
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:00,992	| IOT223 |	Journalist discovered a while back that the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:03,552	| IOT223 |	A couple things when we all
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,576	| IOT223 |	No
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:06,880	| IOT223 |	Listings for Wake word and then when it hears that way
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:08,416	| IOT223 |	Wake word it records
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,440	| IOT223 |	What you say
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,232	| IOT223 |	So it can actually
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:16,608	| IOT223 |	Complete the command and Amazon keeps the transcript and the actual utterance
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:18,656	| IOT223 |	A couple weeks back what
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,936	| IOT223 |	People discovered is that
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:22,496	| IOT223 |	There were call centers of people who
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:25,824	| IOT223 |	Took the actual utterances and annotated them
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:27,360	| IOT223 |	Check them against Amazon
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,128	| IOT223 |	Actions
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:30,176	| IOT223 |	And I did that because that's its quality
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,200	| IOT223 |	Basically
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:33,248	| IOT223 |	But people were kind of up in arms
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:35,808	| IOT223 |	In general
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,880	| IOT223 |	People are very concerned about having a microphone
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,416	| IOT223 |	Their house and I guess
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,976	| IOT223 |	That's kind of how we got to hear so
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,536	| IOT223 |	Delaware senator
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,328	| IOT223 |	Sent a letter to Amazon
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:47,840	| IOT223 |	On asking
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:52,448	| IOT223 |	About how long it kept voice recording what to do with transcripts and all of the
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:54,240	| IOT223 |	Data it gets used to
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:55,264	| IOT223 |	So
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:56,544	| IOT223 |	That's okay right
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,592	| IOT223 |	So the Senators like hey
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,384	| IOT223 |	We need more information
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:02,432	| IOT223 |	And this week Amazon Center
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:04,480	| IOT223 |	Some people are really
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:07,040	| IOT223 |	Tweaker taking kind of the wrong message
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,392	| IOT223 |	Amazon basically says
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,696	| IOT223 |	Did they're going to retain
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:16,256	| IOT223 |	Customers voice recordings and transcripts
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,536	| IOT223 |	Until you choose to delete them
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,839	| IOT223 |	If you delete
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:23,935	| IOT223 |	It's going to make every effort to delete the voice recordings
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:26,495	| IOT223 |	And the transcripts themselves
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:29,567	| IOT223 |	But
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,615	| IOT223 |	Metadata
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:33,663	| IOT223 |	What was learned from
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:37,759	| IOT223 |	Voice recording some such as particular actions or skills
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:42,111	| IOT223 |	That information is not really scrub ignores any information
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:44,671	| IOT223 |	That is so cute
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:45,695	| IOT223 |	Exactly
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:48,255	| IOT223 |	And nor is any sort of
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:51,327	| IOT223 |	If you have a recurring thing or there's transactions associated
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,655	| IOT223 |	Stick around
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,423	| IOT223 |	Because it
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,447	| IOT223 |	Peter has to have something
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:01,567	| IOT223 |	If you tell it to set your alarm at such-and-such time everyday it can't
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:03,359	| IOT223 |	Remove the data
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:05,663	| IOT223 |	Because would not know when
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,431	| IOT223 |	Tomorrow 2
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:09,503	| IOT223 |	So there a couple things
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:10,783	| IOT223 |	It is really in
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,319	| IOT223 |	In
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,087	| IOT223 |	I think
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:15,647	| IOT223 |	We should stop having the same conversation about
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,975	| IOT223 |	Privacy in these homes like as a binary thing
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,023	| IOT223 |	It's either there or it isn't there
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:24,863	| IOT223 |	I think we should start having more conducive conversations about
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:28,191	| IOT223 |	How did make sure this data if people are going to use it
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:30,239	| IOT223 |	Stays out of the hams
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,007	| IOT223 |	People
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:31,775	| IOT223 |	And is used for
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:36,895	| IOT223 |	Sound or is not tied individual
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:37,663	| IOT223 |	So
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:38,687	| IOT223 |	That's that's
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:41,759	| IOT223 |	So I think there's a couple things that you
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:42,271	| IOT223 |	Amazon
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,831	| IOT223 |	And Google actually already does
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:46,111	| IOT223 |	So
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:52,511	| IOT223 |	The Senators asked if Amazon takes any measure to anonymizer Identity and other information in relation to
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,279	| IOT223 |	Transcripts
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,327	| IOT223 |	And the answer appears to
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,423	| IOT223 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,983	| IOT223 |	It partly because some of this means to be associated
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:03,263	| IOT223 |	You know if
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:06,079	| IOT223 |	If I'm telling Amazon to do something on my account
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,871	| IOT223 |	It makes sense that
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,895	| IOT223 |	It has to be associated
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:11,967	| IOT223 |	Because I'm buying something from Whole Foods
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:13,759	| IOT223 |	Amazon needs to know where to send it in
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:15,295	| IOT223 |	That's so that's never going to be
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:18,879	| IOT223 |	Google for example takes utterances
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:23,487	| IOT223 |	The actual voice commands and they run their vocal distortion
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:24,767	| IOT223 |	Through it so
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:27,327	| IOT223 |	They still get the benefit
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,607	| IOT223 |	Having the ability to like
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,143	| IOT223 |	Check their work
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:30,911	| IOT223 |	As it were
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:31,423	| IOT223 |	Are there AI
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:34,239	| IOT223 |	They can do annotations on
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,263	| IOT223 |	Peoples voices
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:35,775	| IOT223 |	They can make sure that
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:38,079	| IOT223 |	Command actually
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,359	| IOT223 |	Did what it was supposed to do
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,919	| IOT223 |	They can do all of that without actually knowing
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,455	| IOT223 |	You are meeting
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:46,271	| IOT223 |	And I'm glad you brought that up because if anybody
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:49,087	| IOT223 |	Hasn't already done if you can go into 2
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:52,159	| IOT223 |	And listen to go through the history and listen to
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:54,463	| IOT223 |	What matinee actually her
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,999	| IOT223 |	You will hear your own voice obviously
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,303	| IOT223 |	There is a
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:02,911	| IOT223 |	A mechanism to report to the matinee do what you requested or did she not
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:05,215	| IOT223 |	Sao innocence you can help
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,495	| IOT223 |	Train mad about yourself
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:09,567	| IOT223 |	And you wouldn't be able to do that obviously without
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,591	| IOT223 |	Having that
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,127	| IOT223 |	Transcription history available
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:13,663	| IOT223 |	Exactly
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,455	| IOT223 |	So I think first off
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:18,015	| IOT223 |	To anonymize people's voices problem
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:19,807	| IOT223 |	Privacy protection
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:24,415	| IOT223 |	The other thing I would say is some of these recurring commands
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:27,231	| IOT223 |	They could probably live locally on the
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,743	| IOT223 |	Edifice
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,279	| IOT223 |	And
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,303	| IOT223 |	I imagined
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:32,863	| IOT223 |	Google I mean Google is working very hard
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:33,887	| IOT223 |	Hartford local control
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,679	| IOT223 |	And
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,983	| IOT223 |	Being able to say
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:38,495	| IOT223 |	Hey
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:40,543	| IOT223 |	Keep my recurring alarm
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,311	| IOT223 |	Here
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,103	| IOT223 |	That's great
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:46,175	| IOT223 |	Take rate you get if you get the benefit of having
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:46,943	| IOT223 |	Some of that
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:48,223	| IOT223 |	Madame a features
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:50,015	| IOT223 |	Without worrying that you know
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:51,039	| IOT223 |	Everybody knows
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:52,831	| IOT223 |	5 in the morning
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:54,367	| IOT223 |	Or whatever time you wake up
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:56,927	| IOT223 |	That's another thing that I think would be
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:01,535	| IOT223 |	Very proactive and then the other thing is with skills
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:07,167	| IOT223 |	I think wouldn't download a skill you should see what data they're trying to get
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,191	| IOT223 |	Were able to get
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:10,239	| IOT223 |	From a transaction
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,031	| IOT223 |	And
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:18,175	| IOT223 |	You should be able to read their privacy policies and hopefully there are easy to understand and not like
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,223	| IOT223 |	16 pages of legalese
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:22,015	| IOT223 |	Those are just some thoughts that I think
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:23,039	| IOT223 |	I think we need to move
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,831	| IOT223 |	Forward from
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,879	| IOT223 |	This is Carrie there's a microphone in my house
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,439	| IOT223 |	Hey if there's a microphone in my house
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:31,743	| IOT223 |	What are the steps the concrete steps
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,767	| IOT223 |	That should be taken
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:35,327	| IOT223 |	And maybe should be should be regulated
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:37,375	| IOT223 |	Will protect
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:40,703	| IOT223 |	Glitter
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:47,615	| IOT223 |	There's a lot of cars here which I think
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:50,431	| IOT223 |	I think we had all the high points in the important things
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,967	| IOT223 |	I still have an open question
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,503	| IOT223 |	In that
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:58,111	| IOT223 |	Unresponsive says we design Echo devices at matamata to use on device
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:01,439	| IOT223 |	Keywordspy technology
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:04,511	| IOT223 |	To detect when a customer intends to interact with
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,279	| IOT223 |	Anime
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,559	| IOT223 |	And
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:10,911	| IOT223 |	It's interesting that they didn't say hotword or something to that effect
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,935	| IOT223 |	Is there anything
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,239	| IOT223 |	Other than the Wake word
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:15,263	| IOT223 |	Part of that guy
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,287	| IOT223 |	Keyword spotting
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,591	| IOT223 |	That's a question I would ask as a follow-up
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:23,967	| IOT223 |	That is a good follow-up cuz I know sometimes I can think of a perfect use case right
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:26,783	| IOT223 |	We are sitting around our dinner table and we're arguing over you
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,295	| IOT223 |	You know something silly
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,599	| IOT223 |	One of us will be like
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,391	| IOT223 |	Let's take it to
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:33,439	| IOT223 |	And then be like
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:36,767	| IOT223 |	Who was the 42nd president
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,095	| IOT223 |	And will get a response
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:43,679	| IOT223 |	When we say things like let's take it to Amazon or maybe put it on the grocery list
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:44,959	| IOT223 |	Or whatever
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,239	| IOT223 |	I could see
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,031	| IOT223 |	I don't know what the
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:50,847	| IOT223 |	Shooting action is in my brain I'm the metaphor is like
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,383	| IOT223 |	You like oh
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,175	| IOT223 |	Maybe I should pay closer attention
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:54,687	| IOT223 |	Is it my name
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:55,967	| IOT223 |	Yes it is
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:01,343	| IOT223 |	The only other thing in his letter that thank you
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,903	| IOT223 |	Explained very clearly
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:04,927	| IOT223 |	How
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,207	| IOT223 |	Madam
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:07,743	| IOT223 |	Works which is
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,535	| IOT223 |	It listens for awake
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,095	| IOT223 |	When it hears that wake word
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:12,863	| IOT223 |	It turns on
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,655	| IOT223 |	And open some microphone
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:17,471	| IOT223 |	To take in the voice command that you're going to say
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,007	| IOT223 |	When you stop speaking
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,799	| IOT223 |	It turns that off
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:23,103	| IOT223 |	It sends only that chunk of command
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,127	| IOT223 |	2
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,151	| IOT223 |	Amazon
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,687	| IOT223 |	Adoption
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:27,711	| IOT223 |	And
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,783	| IOT223 |	So many people are concerned that it is always listening
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:36,415	| IOT223 |	And they're they're just not sure it like Amazon can talk till it's blue in the face and explain this
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,695	| IOT223 |	But people are still free
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,255	| IOT223 |	So
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:42,815	| IOT223 |	I wish they would have addressed the weird laughing issues
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,631	| IOT223 |	What exactly is happening with
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:48,703	| IOT223 |	You know one in the house has said anything related to
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,983	| IOT223 |	Matinee at all
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,007	| IOT223 |	And yet it still wakes up
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:53,055	| IOT223 |	Or we heard
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:55,615	| IOT223 |	Jerry edge cases something like
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:59,455	| IOT223 |	2 hours of non-stop recording was actually captured
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:02,527	| IOT223 |	I remember that happened was reported about a year ago
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,575	| IOT223 |	I think it's with the right Edge case
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:09,439	| IOT223 |	There was some also there were some questions about 5 because
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:11,743	| IOT223 |	Natchez
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:15,071	| IOT223 |	You said the Wake words matter I use you say something
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:22,239	| IOT223 |	And then make it responsible action happens and then you take another action without saying awake or tinnitus continue to listen
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:27,359	| IOT223 |	They were clear in the letter and it has been clear from day one that follow-up mode
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,407	| IOT223 |	Conversation would you rather call that way
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,943	| IOT223 |	Has to be
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,479	| IOT223 |	Enable by the customer
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,759	| IOT223 |	So it's not on by default
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:37,599	| IOT223 |	The point here is
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:40,927	| IOT223 |	I feel like we should have more transparency there always computer
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:41,439	| IOT223 |	People who are like
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:44,767	| IOT223 |	This is how these things were
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:51,167	| IOT223 |	Work and could Amazon be better yes I think they should take a page from Google right now if you are more privacy-conscious you may want to pick
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,447	| IOT223 |	OK Google smart assistant
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,263	| IOT223 |	So we'll see
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,031	| IOT223 |	Hopefully Amazon
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:58,079	| IOT223 |	Guess what the program
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:59,359	| IOT223 |	I guess I don't know
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:01,919	| IOT223 |	E-services on whoever Mason
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:05,759	| IOT223 |	Whether it's Samsung Bixby or the other two that we just talked about
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:08,319	| IOT223 |	They're always evolving and frankly
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:12,671	| IOT223 |	If you're going to use one of these devices
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:15,999	| IOT223 |	Yes you are putting microphone in your house and you know that
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,303	| IOT223 |	If you're not comfortable with that actually don't do it
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:21,375	| IOT223 |	If you're comfortable enough with the way they
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:24,703	| IOT223 |	Transcriptions and data are handled again
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:26,239	| IOT223 |	If you're not
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:28,031	| IOT223 |	Against don't put one of these in your house
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:29,567	| IOT223 |	Exactly
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:30,847	| IOT223 |	All right
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:34,175	| IOT223 |	Let's talk about other security issues because they are out there
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:36,223	| IOT223 |	A company called orvibo
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:37,503	| IOT223 |	Has
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,015	| IOT223 |	Apparently
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,295	| IOT223 |	Not been awesome
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:42,367	| IOT223 |	They left their database
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,415	| IOT223 |	Open it is a smart home
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,439	| IOT223 |	Products maker
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:45,951	| IOT223 |	They make
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,999	| IOT223 |	Cheap outlets in
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:52,863	| IOT223 |	And other stuff like a smart plug Wi-Fi outlet for 7 Bucks
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:53,375	| IOT223 |	Amazon
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,399	| IOT223 |	Which
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:55,935	| IOT223 |	Vici sounds good
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:58,751	| IOT223 |	But
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:02,847	| IOT223 |	Except they're based in Shenzhen China
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,383	| IOT223 |	Which nut
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:06,687	| IOT223 |	My soul is a problem however
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:13,343	| IOT223 |	They had over two billion logs in their database that was wide open
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:17,951	| IOT223 |	Usernames emails addresses and passwords
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,719	| IOT223 |	And
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:21,023	| IOT223 |	Your precise location
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:25,375	| IOT223 |	Yeah this has stuff from
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,143	| IOT223 |	Around the world
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:29,471	| IOT223 |	I found this is a company called vpnmentor
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:32,287	| IOT223 |	And they said they contacted
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:35,615	| IOT223 |	Orvibo via email on June 16th they didn't hear
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,639	| IOT223 |	Anything from them
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:38,943	| IOT223 |	So they tweeted the company and
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:43,039	| IOT223 |	It was left open until at least July 2nd
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,063	| IOT223 |	So
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,343	| IOT223 |	Yay
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:48,159	| IOT223 |	3 weeks from the time they are notified
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,207	| IOT223 |	And apparently
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,999	| IOT223 |	It doesn't sound like
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:55,071	| IOT223 |	Actually responded they just closed it and the
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:56,607	| IOT223 |	Recaptcha
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:02,751	| IOT223 |	This is something that like when we talked about
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:08,127	| IOT223 |	Recommended devices for people cuz we get tons of questions about what's the best device during this this mess you know
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:11,199	| IOT223 |	We tend to stick with
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:13,503	| IOT223 |	More well-known brands
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,527	| IOT223 |	Anime
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:17,087	| IOT223 |	And they are more expensive that is correct
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:19,391	| IOT223 |	Now that doesn't mean
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,927	| IOT223 |	Just because
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,463	| IOT223 |	It's a well-known Brand X
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:25,023	| IOT223 |	Insecure
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,047	| IOT223 |	What time is it
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:30,655	| IOT223 |	Give me well but the minute we didn't had questions or people were like hey I
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:35,775	| IOT223 |	When the wise cancerous came out today
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:39,359	| IOT223 |	It's not always knowing where this data is stored in cap so
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:42,943	| IOT223 |	It's not always easy for us to find out it's certainly not easy for anyone to find out
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:46,527	| IOT223 |	You got to pay attention to that though if you can
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,063	| IOT223 |	And yes
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:49,855	| IOT223 |	And that's why we say brands
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:56,767	| IOT223 |	And I also do recommend that you look for a companies that have a history of responding to security incidences
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:59,071	| IOT223 |	Buy response I don't mean soothe
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:14:59,839	| IOT223 |	Hacker I mean
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:00,863	| IOT223 |	Hey
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:03,167	| IOT223 |	Do they issue a patch today
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:07,007	| IOT223 |	Engaged Community to that talk to their customer base about it
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:09,055	| IOT223 |	So those are those are other thing
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:12,639	| IOT223 |	That you should look for when you're buying action
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:16,479	| IOT223 |	You may not mind but you know I certainly don't
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:18,271	| IOT223 |	My my family name
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,551	| IOT223 |	My Wi-Fi password
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,599	| IOT223 |	My device password
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,135	| IOT223 |	And
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,183	| IOT223 |	My address
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:27,999	| IOT223 |	If you know that I turn on my light
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:29,791	| IOT223 |	But otherwise
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:33,119	| IOT223 |	Direct Security news
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,399	| IOT223 |	D-Link has settled
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:35,679	| IOT223 |	Lawsuit
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:37,727	| IOT223 |	That was filed two years ago by the FTC
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:42,079	| IOT223 |	CC file this lawsuit
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:44,639	| IOT223 |	Were advertised as secure but they were
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:45,919	| IOT223 |	Not
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,687	| IOT223 |	Secure
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:48,735	| IOT223 |	And it was over the security of their routers and IP
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:53,343	| IOT223 |	The FTC was like look you guys stored passwords on your app and play
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:56,927	| IOT223 |	Plaintext used hard-coded login credentials this is a
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:57,439	| IOT223 |	A big No-No
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:16:02,303	| IOT223 |	That was actually hard-coded login credentials were one of the issues behind the bar Ibotta
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,583	| IOT223 |	Back in 2016
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,631	| IOT223 |	So all the way back in
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:06,911	| IOT223 |	Well I guess it was
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,191	| IOT223 |	2016
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:10,751	| IOT223 |	We were like really hard could have passwords you guys that's weird
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,799	| IOT223 |	That means your password is
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:15,871	| IOT223 |	It's stored in the device which is not a good
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,687	| IOT223 |	It's like taping your key to the underside of your
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:19,711	| IOT223 |	I know people do it
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:20,991	| IOT223 |	It's not secure
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,575	| IOT223 |	The FCC said
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,879	| IOT223 |	The company was
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,903	| IOT223 |	Negligent
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:31,231	| IOT223 |	Basically
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:31,999	| IOT223 |	In the court was like
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:33,279	| IOT223 |	No
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:36,095	| IOT223 |	You didn't say this enough proof FTC
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,423	| IOT223 |	What combat
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:43,263	| IOT223 |	D-Link is basically by settling
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,311	| IOT223 |	Is probably
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:45,823	| IOT223 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:50,431	| IOT223 |	Yeah we did have V6 which it did and those are not best practices today
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:53,503	| IOT223 |	Today admitted argument that back in 2018
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:56,319	| IOT223 |	14 when they were building these devices these were fine
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:56,831	| IOT223 |	Probably
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,159	| IOT223 |	But we didn't know
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:02,719	| IOT223 |	Basically it's like we didn't know
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,743	| IOT223 |	Now it's clearly problem
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:09,887	| IOT223 |	What they're going to do with the settlement is D-Link is going to implement a comprehensive software security program
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:13,983	| IOT223 |	Vulnerability testing
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:16,287	| IOT223 |	And monitoring of its products to address
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:20,383	| IOT223 |	It will also issue automatic security updates
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:22,175	| IOT223 |	And it will begin accepting
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:22,687	| IOT223 |	Vulnerability
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:25,759	| IOT223 |	Basic math practice
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:31,903	| IOT223 |	Just consider these are all things that we always have her eggs
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:33,183	| IOT223 |	I think the bigger
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,207	| IOT223 |	Then use that
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:38,559	| IOT223 |	Requires a D-Link has to
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,863	| IOT223 |	Have an independent
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,911	| IOT223 |	Assessment of its software security program
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:48,799	| IOT223 |	Once a year for 10 years
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:53,151	| IOT223 |	Hey
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:57,247	| IOT223 |	D-Link is the way to go for the next few years they've got
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,015	| IOT223 |	This
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,295	| IOT223 |	Partial review
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:02,879	| IOT223 |	Check it out their stuff a lot of companies actually hire
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:05,183	| IOT223 |	Impartial reviewers to security test their stuff so
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,463	| IOT223 |	This is not
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:06,975	| IOT223 |	No but
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:09,279	| IOT223 |	Does this feel like the bare minimum
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:12,095	| IOT223 |	Yes but at least we're establishing a Baseline
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:18,495	| IOT223 |	In some we don't have any laws protecting us but with the FTC in this case we've actually establish someone
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:19,007	| IOT223 |	Baseline
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,311	| IOT223 |	And actually that
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:25,407	| IOT223 |	Bring some to a question I was going to ask you when I took a look at this
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:29,247	| IOT223 |	Because I got the same impression here's a baseline could it be a
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:32,063	| IOT223 |	A model for a particular law
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:34,111	| IOT223 |	Or will the FTC do you think just keep
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:40,255	| IOT223 |	Going after companies in this way which would kind of stink of this point
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:45,119	| IOT223 |	Is this a good starting
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,399	| IOT223 |	I think so and
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:50,751	| IOT223 |	I would also say it should not have to be as long of a process because
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:54,335	| IOT223 |	Court case dismissed the original one
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:56,127	| IOT223 |	But now they have this president
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:59,455	| IOT223 |	One conservative company
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,479	| IOT223 |	Could go
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,783	| IOT223 |	Will see this and be like you
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:05,087	| IOT223 |	These are not
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,367	| IOT223 |	Probably 90%
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,135	| IOT223 |	Hopefully they're good
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:07,903	| IOT223 |	At least 90%
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:09,439	| IOT223 |	And then
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,975	| IOT223 |	The FTC can say
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:13,279	| IOT223 |	Great here's this implemented
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:16,351	| IOT223 |	Do it and the company be like okay sure
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:17,887	| IOT223 |	I think we will get
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:18,655	| IOT223 |	Again
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,167	| IOT223 |	In trouble
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:24,031	| IOT223 |	Is with companies that are not really concerned about pleasing the FTC
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:25,055	| IOT223 |	D-Link is based
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:26,335	| IOT223 |	Sharon Leal
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:27,359	| IOT223 |	Steak-Out
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,127	| IOT223 |	Millions of custom
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:32,223	| IOT223 |	When we talked about like some random Fly by Night
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:32,991	| IOT223 |	We're just
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:33,759	| IOT223 |	Quit
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:34,271	| IOT223 |	Quick-hit
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:35,295	| IOT223 |	Product
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:39,647	| IOT223 |	Maybe like the smartplug we're just talking about the or Vevo
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:40,415	| IOT223 |	Stuff
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:41,951	| IOT223 |	Those companies Medicare
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,743	| IOT223 |	The SEC might go after them and they'll be like
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,071	| IOT223 |	No
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,607	| IOT223 |	So
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:53,215	| IOT223 |	I think it'll be good for conscientious companies I think it's kind of the bare minimum but
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:55,519	| IOT223 |	Yay we have a bare minimum and it should be easier
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:56,543	| IOT223 |	The next time
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,591	| IOT223 |	Baby steps
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,639	| IOT223 |	So speaking of hard-coded passwords
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,711	| IOT223 |	Security researchers have
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,479	| IOT223 |	Discovered
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:06,271	| IOT223 |	That the zapato hub
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:10,367	| IOT223 |	Which is actually a hub people have asked us about I have actually played with it it's
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:10,879	| IOT223 |	Github
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,415	| IOT223 |	Except maybe it's not
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,183	| IOT223 |	So
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:16,255	| IOT223 |	Security researchers have discovered that
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:19,839	| IOT223 |	It has her good passwords inside and they could
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:22,399	| IOT223 |	Extract those passwords
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,679	| IOT223 |	And
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,471	| IOT223 |	Get access
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:25,983	| IOT223 |	2
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:27,007	| IOT223 |	The Hub Lincoln
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:29,567	| IOT223 |	But
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:33,919	| IOT223 |	Yeah and I believe the Potter has a an updated
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:37,759	| IOT223 |	Actual aptitude Hardware or throwing out a different hub
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:40,319	| IOT223 |	For multi-tenant properties which is
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:41,599	| IOT223 |	Where this is
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:44,415	| IOT223 |	Yes
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:46,975	| IOT223 |	The reason these guys started hacking it
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:47,743	| IOT223 |	Is because
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:48,511	| IOT223 |	Cuz
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:51,583	| IOT223 |	One of their fellow hackers had and we talked about this on the show
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:52,863	| IOT223 |	Was
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,655	| IOT223 |	Notified by her
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,167	| IOT223 |	Apartments
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,959	| IOT223 |	That they were
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:58,495	| IOT223 |	Transitioning to a
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:00,031	| IOT223 |	Smart apartment building
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:01,311	| IOT223 |	Connected lock
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:04,895	| IOT223 |	The security researcher was like I do not want this
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:09,503	| IOT223 |	But was unclear if she had the ability to say no as a tenant
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:10,783	| IOT223 |	And
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:11,807	| IOT223 |	That'll
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:14,367	| IOT223 |	That kerfuffle died down I believe to
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:18,720	| IOT223 |	Most people satisfaction we also saw a different company
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:22,304	| IOT223 |	It was doing automated lock smart locks in the park
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:22,816	| IOT223 |	Building
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:26,912	| IOT223 |	The tenants actually sue the landlord who is trying to put the smart locks in
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:29,216	| IOT223 |	And demanded a physical key
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:30,496	| IOT223 |	So
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:31,776	| IOT223 |	The bottom line
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:33,056	| IOT223 |	Is
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:36,128	| IOT223 |	This is still an unclear area
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:36,896	| IOT223 |	Dessert
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:39,200	| IOT223 |	Maybe not secure spin tested
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:40,992	| IOT223 |	Is is better for a problem
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:43,808	| IOT223 |	And the company is smart rent
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:46,624	| IOT223 |	And you may have heard of them because last week they raised
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:48,160	| IOT223 |	32 million dollars
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:49,184	| IOT223 |	So
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:51,232	| IOT223 |	What are we saying here
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,280	| IOT223 |	Security is not
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:55,072	| IOT223 |	It's not at a place where you should be like
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,096	| IOT223 |	Complacent yet
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:57,632	| IOT223 |	Isis
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:59,168	| IOT223 |	Being sad
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:00,960	| IOT223 |	People can break into non-smart
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:02,496	| IOT223 |	Princess well it's just
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:07,616	| IOT223 |	It's a little bit more difficult I feel more more okay with a Smart Lock in my single family home
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:09,152	| IOT223 |	Because
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:12,480	| IOT223 |	If someone really wants to get in they can break a window they can
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:14,272	| IOT223 |	Pick a lock it's not
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,040	| IOT223 |	That hard
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:17,600	| IOT223 |	In an apartment complex though
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:21,952	| IOT223 |	Having this sort of vulnerability opens a bunch of locks at once which makes it a Richard
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:25,280	| IOT223 |	And I would also say
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:26,048	| IOT223 |	If your
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:27,072	| IOT223 |	For example
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,608	| IOT223 |	Potential high-risk
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:30,912	| IOT223 |	If you have a high risk profile for hackers
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:31,424	| IOT223 |	Like that
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:34,240	| IOT223 |	Then you can actually bolster
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:34,752	| IOT223 |	Your
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,544	| IOT223 |	Normal dachshund
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,568	| IOT223 |	Could be easily hack
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:38,592	| IOT223 |	With a lot more stuff
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:41,664	| IOT223 |	Things that would make it harder
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:42,688	| IOT223 |	So
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:45,760	| IOT223 |	Okay so
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:47,552	| IOT223 |	Ascot a lot of bad
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:49,856	| IOT223 |	Amazon news
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,648	| IOT223 |	It's good that we got
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:52,928	| IOT223 |	More clarity here
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,976	| IOT223 |	I'm not surprised by any of it
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:57,024	| IOT223 |	I do think it's being made out to be a little bit
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:58,816	| IOT223 |	More traumatic
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,328	| IOT223 |	And it really is
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:03,168	| IOT223 |	And I think that's because of how you started this this whole
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:05,216	| IOT223 |	Podcast in conversation
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:08,288	| IOT223 |	It's not a binary thing privacy around privacy right
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:10,848	| IOT223 |	It still is
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,664	| IOT223 |	Wow subtlety
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:14,688	| IOT223 |	It's the death of us
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:18,784	| IOT223 |	Hey what's talk about Enterprise iot
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,832	| IOT223 |	Hpe hpe
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,880	| IOT223 |	Is HP Enterprises it is the
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,416	| IOT223 |	Server in
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:25,952	| IOT223 |	All kinds of other stuff
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,792	| IOT223 |	HP they've got server software
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,328	| IOT223 |	Cloud computing
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:31,840	| IOT223 |	Crazy stuff
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,632	| IOT223 |	They
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:35,936	| IOT223 |	Hyatt we should have done this last week but we did not
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:37,472	| IOT223 |	Basically
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:39,520	| IOT223 |	Hpe wants to
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,312	| IOT223 |	Deliver their entire
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:42,848	| IOT223 |	Portfolio as a service by
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:45,664	| IOT223 |	What
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,432	| IOT223 |	Heck
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:47,456	| IOT223 |	That mean
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:52,320	| IOT223 |	Basically this is interesting because
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:56,160	| IOT223 |	In the industrial iot in Enterprise iot
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:58,208	| IOT223 |	We talked a lot about this
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:59,744	| IOT223 |	Concept of digital transformation
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:06,144	| IOT223 |	The idea is once you have a lot of data about your products about how people are using your products
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:10,240	| IOT223 |	You can turn something from a capex expense into an object's expense
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:10,752	| IOT223 |	Just cool
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:14,848	| IOT223 |	And you can deliver all kinds of crazy things like
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:16,128	| IOT223 |	Steam traps or
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,920	| IOT223 |	Elevators or
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:22,272	| IOT223 |	Palace deliver Services service because that's what Amazon
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:23,296	| IOT223 |	Web services is
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,344	| IOT223 |	But hpe witch
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:27,648	| IOT223 |	Bill's of physical Hardware
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:28,416	| IOT223 |	I was like huh
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:29,696	| IOT223 |	That's kind of crazy
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:32,000	| IOT223 |	They're still going to provide Hardware
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:33,536	| IOT223 |	And
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:34,304	| IOT223 |	Their software
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:36,352	| IOT223 |	So you could still buy it out
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:38,144	| IOT223 |	But if you want
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:41,216	| IOT223 |	You can also buy a service after 20
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:43,776	| IOT223 |	I thought that was really
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:48,896	| IOT223 |	They're really pushing forward with what everybody else is trying
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:50,944	| IOT223 |	And
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,712	| IOT223 |	I don't know
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:52,224	| IOT223 |	What do you think
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:57,856	| IOT223 |	Microsoft Word example don't really
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:02,720	| IOT223 |	Bill much hard when I do did you some like that the service product line and whatnot
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:10,144	| IOT223 |	They have Services Azure and everything have in-house where is HP
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:16,032	| IOT223 |	Traditionally been a hardware
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,312	| IOT223 |	You're so
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,592	| IOT223 |	They integrate software
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,920	| IOT223 |	Datacenter in a box
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:25,760	| IOT223 |	But maybe you don't want
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:30,624	| IOT223 |	To buy their boxes because it's cheaper for you to host their services on another cloud
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:35,232	| IOT223 |	Yeah they have spacing expanded and new Partnerships with cyrusone
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:37,536	| IOT223 |	Acronym and
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:38,048	| IOT223 |	Google Cloud
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:39,584	| IOT223 |	So
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:43,168	| IOT223 |	HP Services you don't have to buy hpe
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:44,448	| IOT223 |	Software Hardware
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,984	| IOT223 |	You could have it posted on
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:49,568	| IOT223 |	Yeah I thought this was kind of cool
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:54,944	| IOT223 |	For the Enterprise people cuz these are the kind of big efforts that we talked about a lot with our guests and
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:26:00,576	| IOT223 |	Harbor Freight
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:04,672	| IOT223 |	You just rather have everybody else matters at McLeod
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,696	| IOT223 |	Personal
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:07,488	| IOT223 |	We're seeing a shift to like the
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:09,536	| IOT223 |	Economy right so this is basically
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:12,864	| IOT223 |	Instead of capex instead of buying something big once
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:14,912	| IOT223 |	An amortizing IT overtime
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:16,448	| IOT223 |	Depreciating it
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:16,960	| IOT223 |	Every time
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:18,752	| IOT223 |	You just
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:24,128	| IOT223 |	Like Me by Rent the Runway instead of doing my clothes are by my clothes
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:24,896	| IOT223 |	Which by the way
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:28,480	| IOT223 |	Okay
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:31,040	| IOT223 |	Let's talk about something that you tried out this week
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:37,952	| IOT223 |	I tried something I was a piece of software for Android or iOS
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:41,536	| IOT223 |	Runs in the cloud but you can even ask for it
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:43,072	| IOT223 |	There's no web interface for it
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:45,888	| IOT223 |	Any
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:47,168	| IOT223 |	Touts itself
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:49,728	| IOT223 |	Like a potential replacement
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:51,008	| IOT223 |	Competitor to
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:53,824	| IOT223 |	If this then that or stringify or
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:55,616	| IOT223 |	Any one of the other
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:59,712	| IOT223 |	Integration type services to make your smart home more degraded
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:00,224	| IOT223 |	And
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:03,040	| IOT223 |	I guess the best way to say this is
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:05,344	| IOT223 |	It's good at what it does
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,368	| IOT223 |	Becca has some
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,648	| IOT223 |	Benefits over
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:08,928	| IOT223 |	If this then that person
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,720	| IOT223 |	But it doesn't
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:15,584	| IOT223 |	Do much yet and that's because there are not a ton of integration
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:19,168	| IOT223 |	I dug around it turns out this product on 27
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:22,752	| IOT223 |	And it's an amsterdam-based company
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:26,080	| IOT223 |	They created a I believe it's a smart thermostat
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:27,360	| IOT223 |	34 years ago
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:30,176	| IOT223 |	And they decided to make this over snow app and
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:34,784	| IOT223 |	Start to integrate other services not just with their thermostat but with everything
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:38,880	| IOT223 |	But when you look at the channels for example such as
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:40,416	| IOT223 |	Integrates with
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:42,208	| IOT223 |	They're just
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:45,024	| IOT223 |	Aren't nearly enough messages on here
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:50,912	| IOT223 |	Are you can do notifications you can interview with Twitter cryptocurrency
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:53,728	| IOT223 |	It does work with home connect Honeywell lyric
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:56,544	| IOT223 |	Trust Smart Home lifx
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:59,104	| IOT223 |	Tune which is the
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:01,920	| IOT223 |	Smart thermostat that kick this project off
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:06,528	| IOT223 |	Netatmo and it's some other names I just not familiar with like Yuki and
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:08,320	| IOT223 |	Something is on there
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:10,112	| IOT223 |	I do know that masonis is on there
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:11,648	| IOT223 |	But
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,672	| IOT223 |	Acardia
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:14,464	| IOT223 |	Quick and
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,488	| IOT223 |	Quick yuan
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:17,536	| IOT223 |	I don't know what that is crownstone
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,328	| IOT223 |	Zelig
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:23,168	| IOT223 |	I would say so
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:25,728	| IOT223 |	In Europe perhaps this is a good
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,752	| IOT223 |	Option for you to look at
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:30,080	| IOT223 |	Here in the US I don't find a compelling enough
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:32,128	| IOT223 |	My testing showed pretty good
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:38,272	| IOT223 |	I couldn't present will get up with any things on my wink hub
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:43,392	| IOT223 |	Can I get you anything that might be on a smartphone side because that's not supported either
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:48,512	| IOT223 |	And I can do with it
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:53,120	| IOT223 |	I can send text messages with I could have any notifications when something happen
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:55,168	| IOT223 |	And even though
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:59,008	| IOT223 |	Google home and Manet integration is kind of weird
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:01,056	| IOT223 |	You have to create
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:03,104	| IOT223 |	A virtual button
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:06,688	| IOT223 |	Can you connect that to your voice assistant and then you
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:09,504	| IOT223 |	Put a trigger with a collect rig
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:13,088	| IOT223 |	On the button so that tiny that you can create his virtual buttons for
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:15,904	| IOT223 |	Trig's because their whole approach is protease triggers that
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:20,512	| IOT223 |	When this happens what happens next if this then that
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:22,048	| IOT223 |	It's just weird
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:23,072	| IOT223 |	So
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,864	| IOT223 |	What does it do better than
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:26,144	| IOT223 |	After what
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:27,936	| IOT223 |	UE mentioned that they does something saved
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:30,240	| IOT223 |	I'm so glad you asked
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:34,592	| IOT223 |	You could have multiple when things multiple triggers
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:41,248	| IOT223 |	So yeah so you could say if this happens and that happened and this happen
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:43,296	| IOT223 |	Only this time of day
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,320	| IOT223 |	Then do that
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:47,392	| IOT223 |	Got it so that's actually more powerful
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:50,208	| IOT223 |	That that's more like a smart things are stringify effort
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:51,488	| IOT223 |	Correct
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:55,328	| IOT223 |	Correct and it's far easier to use stringify array SmartThings
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:57,632	| IOT223 |	But again the problem is
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:00,448	| IOT223 |	For me and probably I think for both of you asked
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:05,312	| IOT223 |	You want to look at the channels that are offered to see what you can do or rather what you cannot do
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:08,384	| IOT223 |	I have no reason to replace anything with this
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:12,224	| IOT223 |	Right now I'm not saying it's a bad product I'm saying it needs to mature
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:13,760	| IOT223 |	Okay
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:19,392	| IOT223 |	Hey what's talk about some tiny little updates that are fun to do so Kevin you want to kick ass off with
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:20,416	| IOT223 |	Chamberlain
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:24,000	| IOT223 |	Yes Google Assistant
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:25,792	| IOT223 |	And if this then that integration
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:27,584	| IOT223 |	You can get it for
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:29,632	| IOT223 |	Free for a limited
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:30,144	| IOT223 |	Time
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:38,080	| IOT223 |	Wilt Chamberlain start
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:39,360	| IOT223 |	Charging
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:41,920	| IOT223 |	For the microservices on if this then that
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:44,736	| IOT223 |	So does costume the nominal fee right now
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:49,600	| IOT223 |	But for one year you can actually get for free
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:51,392	| IOT223 |	All right and I will tell you that
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:53,184	| IOT223 |	I love my MyQ
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:53,952	| IOT223 |	It's great
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:56,000	| IOT223 |	It's one of the one devices that I'd want to
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:57,536	| IOT223 |	Replace here in this house
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:58,048	| IOT223 |	Lucia
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:00,352	| IOT223 |	They updated their
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:04,448	| IOT223 |	Hub and so now instead of $50 which was the last limit
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:08,032	| IOT223 |	Did not let you control 75 bulbs or switches are whatever you
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:09,824	| IOT223 |	April 75
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,104	| IOT223 |	So
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:13,408	| IOT223 |	This is great for people with lots of
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:15,200	| IOT223 |	I guess lots of house
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:19,552	| IOT223 |	Is the lack of lamb
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:25,440	| IOT223 |	That doesn't require any new hardware
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:28,512	| IOT223 |	If you only have 50 now you can go buy 25 more
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:31,584	| IOT223 |	Do you need a new bridge or no
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:40,800	| IOT223 |	Speaking of balls and speaking of I was actually excited to see
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:48,736	| IOT223 |	Is currently the owner of Philips Hue
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:49,760	| IOT223 |	And
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:52,576	| IOT223 |	Philips Hue bulbs
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:59,232	| IOT223 |	Yes well I never really invested in the Philips Hue bulb
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:01,024	| IOT223 |	And you need that
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:08,192	| IOT223 |	Philips Hue now makes balls with
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:11,776	| IOT223 |	So you can get Philips Hue bulbs
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:13,824	| IOT223 |	White tunable white and
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:14,592	| IOT223 |	Color
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:17,664	| IOT223 |	With Bluetooth and no Philips Hue Bridge needed
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:21,504	| IOT223 |	I am curious what you need
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:22,784	| IOT223 |	Is there some things
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:26,368	| IOT223 |	I think you will need and I'm serious actually to test this out
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:27,136	| IOT223 |	Because
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:29,952	| IOT223 |	The last time I tested Bluetooth bulbs
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:31,488	| IOT223 |	Well
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:33,280	| IOT223 |	The first time I tested them I hated them because
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:34,560	| IOT223 |	Cuz my house was bigger than
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:38,656	| IOT223 |	The range and then the second time I was trying still with
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:41,472	| IOT223 |	Awesome so I can't wait to see if this means blue
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:42,240	| IOT223 |	Bluetooth mask
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:43,008	| IOT223 |	Actually
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:43,520	| IOT223 |	More useful
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:45,824	| IOT223 |	Set temperature to 8
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,200	| IOT223 |	All right
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:53,248	| IOT223 |	Is he Bluetooth
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:54,016	| IOT223 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:55,296	| IOT223 |	And find a little bit
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:59,904	| IOT223 |	SmartThings they have updated the app and you can now integrate
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:01,184	| IOT223 |	A hub connected
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:04,512	| IOT223 |	Device so this is any sort of
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,280	| IOT223 |	Connects through
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:06,560	| IOT223 |	SmartThings compatible
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:08,352	| IOT223 |	Rather still like your weight
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:09,120	| IOT223 |	And
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:11,424	| IOT223 |	It will use the SmartThings Cloud execute those
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:15,008	| IOT223 |	So now you can have your hubs talk to your other hubs
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:15,776	| IOT223 |	It's great
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:19,360	| IOT223 |	But it's all in the cloud and I want local
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:20,128	| IOT223 |	Alright well
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:22,176	| IOT223 |	This isn't for you you don't even want
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:22,944	| IOT223 |	But
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:25,504	| IOT223 |	If I can open if you do want hugs
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:26,016	| IOT223 |	Good news
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:29,344	| IOT223 |	All right now I think it's time for
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:31,648	| IOT223 |	Two things one the voicemail but also
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:34,208	| IOT223 |	Shoes

EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:06,720	| IOT223 |	The Google assistant pick a random number from 1 to the number
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:12,096	| IOT223 |	Kind of weird but that's how it work out
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:17,472	| IOT223 |	So yes it's it is random for any of you
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:17,984	| IOT223 |	Are you guys were like

EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:24,800	| IOT223 |	And I moved in together and
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:26,848	| IOT223 |	I switched everything
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:27,872	| IOT223 |	Over
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:28,896	| IOT223 |	Plum

EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,992	| IOT223 |	Google
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:34,272	| IOT223 |	What have you
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,320	| IOT223 |	My account
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:38,880	| IOT223 |	But I'm wondering
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:41,440	| IOT223 |	Should he have a loan account
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:42,976	| IOT223 |	And it's just her and I
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:48,608	| IOT223 |	Read this. The tile system
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:50,144	| IOT223 |	And I just added her
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:52,448	| IOT223 |	Under one account
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:55,520	| IOT223 |	That's the question
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:57,312	| IOT223 |	Kristoff
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:36:00,896	| IOT223 |	Congratulations for a big step in your relationship
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:03,200	| IOT223 |	There's a couple ways to answer this one is
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:04,480	| IOT223 |	By no means
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:08,576	| IOT223 |	No means at all due to accounts because you will end up doubling up on all of your stuff
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:10,112	| IOT223 |	I have tried this it
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:12,672	| IOT223 |	Not good
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:14,208	| IOT223 |	Amazon will think you have
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:15,232	| IOT223 |	Two lights
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:16,768	| IOT223 |	When you really only have one
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:18,816	| IOT223 |	And state gets messed up
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:19,840	| IOT223 |	It doesn't work just don't
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:21,632	| IOT223 |	Now
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:26,752	| IOT223 |	If it's already under your name and you don't want to mess with anything just keep it there and she can still do the commands of that sort of thing
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:29,056	| IOT223 |	This is for Madame a household
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:30,336	| IOT223 |	And then
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:32,384	| IOT223 |	The other option though
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:34,432	| IOT223 |	In their pros and cons to this
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:37,248	| IOT223 |	Is creating an email app
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:38,528	| IOT223 |	Your house
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:39,808	| IOT223 |	So
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:42,112	| IOT223 |	Have a house account
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:44,416	| IOT223 |	That you tie into your
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:44,928	| IOT223 |	Madam
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:47,232	| IOT223 |	The advantages are things like
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:51,840	| IOT223 |	I don't know if you Spotify but certain certain things that have limits associated with them
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:53,632	| IOT223 |	Well now
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:54,144	| IOT223 |	Be associated
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,704	| IOT223 |	The downside
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:57,472	| IOT223 |	Is
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:37:00,544	| IOT223 |	I don't remember how many adults you can have in a household
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:03,360	| IOT223 |	And you want your house email
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:04,384	| IOT223 |	An account to be
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:04,896	| IOT223 |	An adult
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:07,712	| IOT223 |	Then you may not be able to add your girlfriend to your car
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:12,064	| IOT223 |	Might be awesome for her cuz she could like order things on
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:12,576	| IOT223 |	Your account
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:17,184	| IOT223 |	So we'd have to check that but
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:20,000	| IOT223 |	The challenge if you don't do that is
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:21,280	| IOT223 |	Location stuff
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:23,328	| IOT223 |	Will still work but things like ordering
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:25,888	| IOT223 |	If you order stuff from Amazon it will
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:28,960	| IOT223 |	That's taking your relationship to a whole new level.
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:35,872	| IOT223 |	I do have a question only because you have multiple devices in multiple family members
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:37,920	| IOT223 |	Would you recommend
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:41,760	| IOT223 |	In either platform golang with like a voice match as well
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:42,272	| IOT223 |	No
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:44,320	| IOT223 |	I thought you might not
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:45,600	| IOT223 |	I hate the voice match
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:46,368	| IOT223 |	It doesn't work well for us
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:53,280	| IOT223 |	Because you also mentioned and you said you might be switching
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:56,352	| IOT223 |	Situation
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:03,776	| IOT223 |	Don't do voice match at all if you do Google home you can each have your separate accounts and tie them to one
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:05,824	| IOT223 |	Google device
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:10,432	| IOT223 |	At that actually solve the problem because you're going to have that individual
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:13,504	| IOT223 |	Accounts and data all tied into one platform
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:19,648	| IOT223 |	Voice match has to work a hundred percent or you're going to be miserable
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:25,280	| IOT223 |	Brightside my family refuses to be trained so I can't speak to it either
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:26,048	| IOT223 |	So there's your
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:29,888	| IOT223 |	You could always try the voice match if it doesn't work
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:32,448	| IOT223 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,984	| IOT223 |	That helps Larry and
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:34,496	| IOT223 |	Now
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:35,776	| IOT223 |	It is time
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:37,568	| IOT223 |	To say goodbye to Kevin
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:38,592	| IOT223 |	And say hello
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:39,872	| IOT223 |	Guest
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:45,760	| IOT223 |	Our guests coming up after the break is Andy Lowry who is the CEO of real where they make a
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:47,808	| IOT223 |	Connected
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:49,856	| IOT223 |	Head-mounted display
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:51,904	| IOT223 |	It is a voice-controlled for industrial settings
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:56,000	| IOT223 |	It's pretty cool and they just raised 80 million dollars which
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:57,792	| IOT223 |	It's kind of a lot so he's going to talk about
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:59,072	| IOT223 |	Why people use these
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:02,144	| IOT223 |	Some use cases and what they're going to do with it
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:07,008	| IOT223 |	For this
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:13,408	| IOT223 |	Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:19,808	| IOT223 |	Sponsor is Dell Technologies and I have Jason Sheppard who is CTO of iot in
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:22,624	| IOT223 |	Edge at Dell Technologies here to talk to us
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:23,392	| IOT223 |	So json
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:27,232	| IOT223 |	Last week we talked about edgex Foundry and how that's going
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:29,792	| IOT223 |	This week let's talk about your
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:34,144	| IOT223 |	Scaling to the grey Lyndell strategy what is Dells as strategy
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:36,448	| IOT223 |	And how does it relate to Edge X Foundry
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:39,264	| IOT223 |	Yeah so basically the strategy was
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:45,664	| IOT223 |	Get an architecture that works for the edge out in the open crate open interoperability through that collaboration and then attached
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:46,944	| IOT223 |	Best commercial value add to it
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:52,064	| IOT223 |	Where infrastructure provider we bring Partners in for their domain expertise and we wanted that edge X
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:54,624	| IOT223 |	API that's developed through that collaboration
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:58,208	| IOT223 |	Value-add not only from ourselves but also partners
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:40:04,096	| IOT223 |	So this openedge stack is taking VMware pulse iot Center as a device management platform
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:06,656	| IOT223 |	Bison application
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:07,936	| IOT223 |	Are Photon OS
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:12,288	| IOT223 |	Which is a Linux variant running containers you can use any what you want but that Jack's that looks rating
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:14,080	| IOT223 |	Experience with a tough course Ajax
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:14,848	| IOT223 |	Is part of that
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:16,640	| IOT223 |	Where you get the benefit of
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:20,992	| IOT223 |	Consistent security and Management Open API driven by The Edge X Eco cyst
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:27,904	| IOT223 |	And then you were choices application stack so it's developer you can get get started really quickly and easily build on something that scale
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:31,232	| IOT223 |	But not get locked into any given platform which is currently this
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:37,632	| IOT223 |	The case with many of the platforms that are creating their own apis are on sdks who kept to get connected to their ass if they want to
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:39,424	| IOT223 |	Milwaukee went early and we're getting people choice
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:40,960	| IOT223 |	Okay and
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:47,104	| IOT223 |	Get our conversations around this you keep talking about scaling to the Grail and data monetization
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:48,640	| IOT223 |	Around the edge
EDL	00:40:49,152	00:40:50,432	| IOT223 |	What do you mean by that
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:53,504	| IOT223 |	Yes it's going to look really nice talk about that
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:57,088	| IOT223 |	My stuff online it's really about this notion of pervasive
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:41:00,672	| IOT223 |	Steering or monetization especially on your terms
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:02,464	| IOT223 |	Of data which is the obvious one
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:02,976	| IOT223 |	Resource
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:05,024	| IOT223 |	Compute storage networking
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:07,072	| IOT223 |	Rideshares anything consumable
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:08,352	| IOT223 |	Knowledge
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:10,400	| IOT223 |	Feeling like that sharing selling
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:11,168	| IOT223 |	Across
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:11,936	| IOT223 |	Complete strangers
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:14,240	| IOT223 |	I've never built a relationship with you
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:18,848	| IOT223 |	Able to sell you something in the way you do that is he build pervasive Truss
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:20,384	| IOT223 |	I need to get to the base of trust
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:24,736	| IOT223 |	You cannot have any single entity on the trucks he was in a water system system
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:27,296	| IOT223 |	Public and private domains Etc and sew
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:30,112	| IOT223 |	To get to the Grail you need technology to help
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:31,648	| IOT223 |	And you need an open Edge
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:37,792	| IOT223 |	This is why you know we're investing heavily here and then that enables you it's me sound far-fetched as notion of pervasive
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:40,096	| IOT223 |	Date of motivation but also the only
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:41,632	| IOT223 |	Pastor is it open
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:47,776	| IOT223 |	Edge and so the scale of the Grail is starting out with a simple use case just get going
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:50,080	| IOT223 |	Towards that ultimate goal
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:54,943	| IOT223 |	That's right Jason so where can we go to find out more about Dell Technologies
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:42:02,111	| IOT223 |	Dell Technologies. Com coyote is a good starting point and then there's been some banks offer their took over more
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:08,511	| IOT223 |	Hey every
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:13,887	| IOT223 |	I would welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:16,703	| IOT223 |	Is Andy Lowry who is the CEO of
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:19,263	| IOT223 |	Hi Andy how are you doing
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:21,055	| IOT223 |	Good Stacy
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:26,431	| IOT223 |	Man I am super excited to have you here about to talk about something
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:32,063	| IOT223 |	Oh I don't know if I've been skeptical but we're about to talk about using AR in
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:35,391	| IOT223 |	The workplace in the Enterprise all the way from manufacturing to
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:39,487	| IOT223 |	Back in warehouses even two people riding around an ambulance
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:41,791	| IOT223 |	So there's a lot of stuff here first off
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:44,863	| IOT223 |	And let's talk about what it is the real where does
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:47,935	| IOT223 |	Our mission here at real where is
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:48,959	| IOT223 |	Train
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:52,031	| IOT223 |	Skilled industrial workers
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:53,567	| IOT223 |	We provide knowledge
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:56,895	| IOT223 |	And what I mean by that is there's tons of data
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:43:00,223	| IOT223 |	Out there in Cloud
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:04,063	| IOT223 |	What we do is we provide class
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:05,599	| IOT223 |	Hardware
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:10,719	| IOT223 |	Wearable computer heads up display computer that's a Android driven
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:11,487	| IOT223 |	Tablet
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:13,023	| IOT223 |	But it's shaped in a way that
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:17,631	| IOT223 |	Baseball caps that you can wear it hands-free
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:21,471	| IOT223 |	And you communicate and control the system using your voice
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:23,519	| IOT223 |	Particular voice
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:25,567	| IOT223 |	That allows this hands-free control
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:29,919	| IOT223 |	How's the computer that you're wearing is done and very very high noise
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:30,431	| IOT223 |	Environment
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:32,735	| IOT223 |	100 decibels you can barely
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:33,503	| IOT223 |	Kill yourself
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:34,271	| IOT223 |	Ekans
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:40,415	| IOT223 |	You can still control the system much better than most people's opinion
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:41,695	| IOT223 |	Home system
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:46,303	| IOT223 |	The device itself if I were to give you an elevator pitch were in an elevator going up
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:47,327	| IOT223 |	New York Tire
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:48,863	| IOT223 |	Taking only a few floors
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:49,887	| IOT223 |	The simplest way
EDL	00:43:50,399	00:43:52,703	| IOT223 |	The pictures is that it's an Android tablet
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:54,239	| IOT223 |	So start with that
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:55,263	| IOT223 |	It's got Wi-Fi
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:58,079	| IOT223 |	Bluetooth has got a nice Qualcomm processor
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:44:01,151	| IOT223 |	Has a little micro display that looks like a heads-up display
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:02,431	| IOT223 |	Which one dude
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:04,479	| IOT223 |	Looks about like a 7-inch tablet
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:05,503	| IOT223 |	Held at arm's length
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:06,783	| IOT223 |	Then you have a voice
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:11,135	| IOT223 |	System that uses a little bit of gestures like your head moving left and right
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:11,647	| IOT223 |	Keep scrolling
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:14,975	| IOT223 |	White things like that as a secondary input modality
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:17,535	| IOT223 |	The primary modality is just voice
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,303	| IOT223 |	And so
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:22,143	| IOT223 |	Where a lot of systems out there today have swipes or gestures
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:24,703	| IOT223 |	Halloween people are familiar with the hololens
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:27,007	| IOT223 |	Types of gestures there this blue man
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:27,775	| IOT223 |	Poke drag
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:30,079	| IOT223 |	What we do is we do
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:31,871	| IOT223 |	All of the heads-up display database
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:34,943	| IOT223 |	And that's just in a very big differentiator
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:36,223	| IOT223 |	Compared to a lot of the other
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:38,015	| IOT223 |	Systems that are out there
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:40,063	| IOT223 |	Something a little bit more Blended
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:43,135	| IOT223 |	Okay so
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:45,183	| IOT223 |	We figured out what it is you guys do
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:50,303	| IOT223 |	Where does it make sense what are the use cases that people are predominantly choosing
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:51,839	| IOT223 |	Your system for
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:54,911	| IOT223 |	What are the simplest ways
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:56,959	| IOT223 |	Disfigured stats at at the beginning
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:44:58,751	| IOT223 |	A lot of people talk about
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:00,543	| IOT223 |	Digitizing iot
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:02,591	| IOT223 |	Industrial iot
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:05,407	| IOT223 |	And what we see him on the home side is
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:09,759	| IOT223 |	You know a lot of sort of fragmented but ever-growing iot Solutions

EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:12,319	| IOT223 |	Stove mr.
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:13,855	| IOT223 |	On our side of the fence
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:14,623	| IOT223 |	Coyote takes
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:16,671	| IOT223 |	Extra step
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:19,999	| IOT223 |	And I tell a lot of folks that worked at Raytheon as a chief engineer
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:22,559	| IOT223 |	And iPhones came out in Circa 08
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:24,095	| IOT223 |	Raytheon didn't allow an iPhone
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:29,215	| IOT223 |	And the reason was all the stuff we're dealing with now in the iot
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:31,007	| IOT223 |	I said stuff like security
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:33,055	| IOT223 |	Safety ergonomics
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:34,847	| IOT223 |	Stability stability of the software
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:41,247	| IOT223 |	Need to check the block on
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:42,015	| IOT223 |	Actually
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:43,551	| IOT223 |	Moving towards an acquisition or
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:45,599	| IOT223 |	I'm more significant roll out
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:49,951	| IOT223 |	Consumers on the other side new Gadget comes out they want to see the latest
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:51,999	| IOT223 |	Greatest to go to the Best Buy that buy it
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:53,279	| IOT223 |	Integrated math Sawdust
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:57,887	| IOT223 |	Show in general what we're doing is taking those same digital stuff
EDL	00:45:57,887	00:45:59,167	| IOT223 |	FaceTime Netflix
EDL	00:45:59,167	00:46:01,215	| IOT223 |	Applying it to the industrial sector
EDL	00:46:01,727	00:46:06,079	| IOT223 |	What we're doing it a way that conforms to all the industry
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:07,871	| IOT223 |	That's about losing data.
EDL	00:46:07,871	00:46:10,943	| IOT223 |	Sure has to be 6 war in all of these different things
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:13,503	| IOT223 |	And what about the use cases for these head-mounted
EDL	00:46:13,503	00:46:14,527	| IOT223 |	Displays in general
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:19,135	| IOT223 |	Now if you're asking specifically what it when they get out there and they get the
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:20,159	| IOT223 |	All connected
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:22,719	| IOT223 |	What is it doing with these HMT
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:25,023	| IOT223 |	Well apart from doing
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:26,303	| IOT223 |	Capturing video and all that stuff
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:27,583	| IOT223 |	Which was
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:30,399	| IOT223 |	Stop sort of the elements of the digitization
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:33,471	| IOT223 |	Revolution that we need we need videos we need content
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:34,495	| IOT223 |	Get stuffed
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:36,287	| IOT223 |	Put into these systems that aren't
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:40,639	| IOT223 |	A pieces of paper and write written down notes Wheatley the actual digital content
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:42,175	| IOT223 |	So it's a great machine
EDL	00:46:43,455	00:46:48,831	| IOT223 |	Cuz you can wear it and can move the boom arm out of the way with no display just where is a GoPro on your heart
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:52,415	| IOT223 |	And everything you were doing you could capture all day long work
EDL	00:46:52,415	00:46:57,023	| IOT223 |	If you're in the warehouse you might have a baseball cap on you can capture your activity
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:47:01,887	| IOT223 |	And then those films can be basically slice two dice and they little YouTube videos on
EDL	00:47:01,887	00:47:03,935	| IOT223 |	How to do things inside the factory
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:05,983	| IOT223 |	Barbie on the concert
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:07,007	| IOT223 |	Three major classes
EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:08,287	| IOT223 |	Software
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:11,103	| IOT223 |	That get deployed the first is collaboration software
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:13,407	| IOT223 |	Her folks are talking to each other
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:13,919	| IOT223 |	Come up remotes
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:20,063	| IOT223 |	Before maybe someone would call a headquarters and use your telephone to just get a voice
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:21,855	| IOT223 |	Walkthrough on how to fix something
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:23,903	| IOT223 |	Now with the today's text it's not
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:25,183	| IOT223 |	I required to have only
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:26,975	| IOT223 |	You can actually do video and voice
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:29,535	| IOT223 |	So with video and voice will you
EDL	00:47:29,535	00:47:32,351	| IOT223 |	You're sharing a screen and your doing this hands-free
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:36,447	| IOT223 |	You're able to talk to the person coach the person but then show the person
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:38,751	| IOT223 |	In the real world what were talking about
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:40,543	| IOT223 |	That you need to go do so maybe
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:41,823	| IOT223 |	Switch the switch off
EDL	00:47:41,823	00:47:43,871	| IOT223 |	Pekin Circle that switch with his lap
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:45,663	| IOT223 |	On his laptop with his Mouse
EDL	00:47:45,663	00:47:47,967	| IOT223 |	And see that switch from your camera
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:49,759	| IOT223 |	And then apply those to your circles
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:52,063	| IOT223 |	Huron your little screen
EDL	00:47:52,063	00:47:54,111	| IOT223 |	And then the third category
EDL	00:47:54,623	00:47:58,975	| IOT223 |	Is the category of human machine interface and this has to do with the data visualization but it also
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:04,095	| IOT223 |	You can think of Rockwell Collins Mitsubishi ABB Emerson
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:05,631	| IOT223 |	A number of folks are have
EDL	00:48:06,143	00:48:08,191	| IOT223 |	Iot systems that basically have
EDL	00:48:11,519	00:48:13,055	| IOT223 |	Giving machine interface in
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:15,871	| IOT223 |	Control things and push buttons and do that sort of stuff
EDL	00:48:16,383	00:48:20,223	| IOT223 |	Well in our system you can take that software put it on our computer
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:23,039	| IOT223 |	Now you can roll over on the plant in summer
EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:24,319	| IOT223 |	500 yards away
EDL	00:48:24,831	00:48:28,159	| IOT223 |	The machine that has an alarm or or overheats and you can
EDL	00:48:28,159	00:48:29,183	| IOT223 |	Pull up that data
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:30,975	| IOT223 |	Control the machine from
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:32,767	| IOT223 |	500 meters away in in
EDL	00:48:35,327	00:48:36,863	| IOT223 |	All of these things have been
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:40,447	| IOT223 |	Really powerful from an Roi perspective Soak City
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:41,215	| IOT223 |	Come back to me and say
EDL	00:48:41,727	00:48:45,567	| IOT223 |	Charlotte like BMW came back inside a 75% reduction
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:49,663	| IOT223 |	In time to fix things and then all that and so there's no question
EDL	00:48:50,175	00:48:50,943	| IOT223 |	Return on investment
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:56,575	| IOT223 |	I believe I have actually played with your glasses I believe I tried them on an Emerson user event
EDL	00:48:57,087	00:48:57,855	| IOT223 |	One point in time
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:48:59,391	| IOT223 |	I'm so now I'm like oh
EDL	00:48:59,391	00:49:00,159	| IOT223 |	I think I found this
EDL	00:49:00,671	00:49:06,815	| IOT223 |	There are actual practical use cases you mentioned that BMW is seeing a 75% increase in productivity
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:08,351	| IOT223 |	Using this system
EDL	00:49:08,863	00:49:09,631	| IOT223 |	But
EDL	00:49:09,631	00:49:10,655	| IOT223 |	Why is it everybody used
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:13,215	| IOT223 |	Well it's just the time
EDL	00:49:13,215	00:49:14,751	| IOT223 |	I think it takes really to get
EDL	00:49:14,751	00:49:16,031	| IOT223 |	The Enterprise
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:16,799	| IOT223 |	Shillings
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:18,079	| IOT223 |	Face picture
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:19,871	| IOT223 |	Unstable enough with the
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:22,687	| IOT223 |	Device the technology and then the ecosystem
EDL	00:49:22,687	00:49:23,455	| IOT223 |	Support around
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:30,367	| IOT223 |	Specifically in the security Dimension you've got a lot of corporate forms and devices they absolutely have
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:31,135	| IOT223 |	Have to be encrypted
EDL	00:49:31,135	00:49:34,463	| IOT223 |	You can't take us with a backend API and have
EDL	00:49:34,463	00:49:38,815	| IOT223 |	Unencrypted data going from sap to a device I cars
EDL	00:49:38,815	00:49:40,351	| IOT223 |	It's absolutely has to have the rights
EDL	00:49:43,167	00:49:46,495	| IOT223 |	Deploy something to your folks that hopefully makes them work faster
EDL	00:49:48,287	00:49:52,127	| IOT223 |	It just doesn't work it just can't do that everything has to
EDL	00:49:52,127	00:49:54,175	| IOT223 |	Start with safety in today's day and age
EDL	00:49:54,175	00:49:57,759	| IOT223 |	And then finish with a higher productivity so safeties II
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:49:58,527	| IOT223 |	7/3 is
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:49:59,807	| IOT223 |	Just the
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:02,111	| IOT223 |	Stability and and what I mean by that is
EDL	00:50:02,111	00:50:03,903	| IOT223 |	When we get into the deployments at
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:08,255	| IOT223 |	Scale we're not talking about this
EDL	00:50:08,255	00:50:08,767	| IOT223 |	200 South
EDL	00:50:09,535	00:50:12,607	| IOT223 |	What are you talkin about that amount of scale and investment
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:16,447	| IOT223 |	Companies like Mitsubishi Electric Japanese company wants to see
EDL	00:50:16,447	00:50:19,519	| IOT223 |	Stability in space and stability
EDL	00:50:19,519	00:50:21,823	| IOT223 |	To ensure that the support will be there for
EDL	00:50:22,335	00:50:23,103	| IOT223 |	Perpetuity
EDL	00:50:24,127	00:50:27,199	| IOT223 |	So let's talk about some of the use cases you got here
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:31,807	| IOT223 |	Such as in remote guidance you were telling me a little bit about some of the medical use cases
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:32,831	| IOT223 |	What are people doing
EDL	00:50:33,599	00:50:35,647	| IOT223 |	Those are the type of use cases that get me
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:37,695	| IOT223 |	Excited due to the impact
EDL	00:50:38,975	00:50:41,023	| IOT223 |	We've got a couple different case
EDL	00:50:43,583	00:50:46,911	| IOT223 |	The Radio podcast show people are listening to imagine
EDL	00:50:46,911	00:50:48,447	| IOT223 |	The first thing we're talking about here
EDL	00:50:49,215	00:50:50,751	| IOT223 |	What were literally talking about
EDL	00:50:52,287	00:50:54,591	| IOT223 |	I think those people know what that is where you have
EDL	00:50:54,591	00:50:59,455	| IOT223 |	The video and the voice in your kind of at the same time collaborating what we're doing this from
EDL	00:50:59,455	00:51:00,991	| IOT223 |	Perspective the eyes out
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:01,759	| IOT223 |	Versus Two-Face
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:05,343	| IOT223 |	Are cameras focused out into the world
EDL	00:51:05,343	00:51:07,647	| IOT223 |	So can see through your eyes basic
EDL	00:51:07,647	00:51:08,159	| IOT223 |	What you're looking
EDL	00:51:08,671	00:51:10,719	| IOT223 |	Join the case of EMTs
EDL	00:51:10,719	00:51:14,559	| IOT223 |	In both the countries of Finland and Norway
EDL	00:51:14,559	00:51:16,351	| IOT223 |	Deploy into the axle ambulance
EDL	00:51:17,631	00:51:23,775	| IOT223 |	What they do is they come across the young boy who might have fallen down and has a very nasty abrasion
EDL	00:51:23,775	00:51:29,919	| IOT223 |	They actually use the HMT as they're treating the person insult you where they find of young man
EDL	00:51:31,711	00:51:32,735	| IOT223 |	Wasps they have an H
EDL	00:51:33,759	00:51:37,087	| IOT223 |	What the hmt-1 is doing this through cellular Networks
EDL	00:51:37,599	00:51:39,135	| IOT223 |	Screen Rant video
EDL	00:51:39,135	00:51:40,159	| IOT223 |	Back to the emerge
EDL	00:51:40,159	00:51:42,207	| IOT223 |	To see Rome. They're going to go to next
EDL	00:51:42,719	00:51:47,327	| IOT223 |	And showing these doctors what exactly is going on without the EMT having
EDL	00:51:47,327	00:51:48,095	| IOT223 |	Pause
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:48,863	| IOT223 |	Stop to do anything
EDL	00:51:49,375	00:51:50,143	| IOT223 |	MTC
EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:53,727	| IOT223 |	Turn out the resuscitative types of medical procedures
EDL	00:51:53,727	00:51:55,775	| IOT223 |	And at the same time the doctors and nurses
EDL	00:51:57,567	00:51:59,615	| IOT223 |	They can prepare that
EDL	00:51:59,615	00:52:00,895	| IOT223 |	Arrival they can
EDL	00:52:00,895	00:52:02,943	| IOT223 |	Get the right beds the right doctors
EDL	00:52:02,943	00:52:05,759	| IOT223 |	Wright Medical Equipment ready and prepared
EDL	00:52:05,759	00:52:06,783	| IOT223 |	And then
EDL	00:52:06,783	00:52:07,807	| IOT223 |	Precious minutes
EDL	00:52:07,807	00:52:08,831	| IOT223 |	But that can save
EDL	00:52:10,367	00:52:12,159	| IOT223 |	Okay well there's a lot going on there
EDL	00:52:12,159	00:52:13,951	| IOT223 |	Hair sew-in something like that
EDL	00:52:14,463	00:52:16,255	| IOT223 |	There's so many questions that start with the technical question
EDL	00:52:16,767	00:52:20,095	| IOT223 |	This seems like one of those oh my gosh 5G use cases
EDL	00:52:20,095	00:52:21,119	| IOT223 |	We don't actually have five
EDL	00:52:23,935	00:52:30,335	| IOT223 |	Is this like an LTE network or how does this work in practice from a network level and even from Abyss
EDL	00:52:30,335	00:52:31,359	| IOT223 |	Who pays for these
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:39,039	| IOT223 |	That a great questions and there's lots of answers to it cuz it depends a little bit
EDL	00:52:39,039	00:52:43,903	| IOT223 |	I even have the issues in the US because EMTs are often insured by a different insurance
EDL	00:52:44,415	00:52:46,463	| IOT223 |	Hospitals are in feathers
EDL	00:52:46,463	00:52:52,607	| IOT223 |	Conflict in the business you know he say hey let's just do what's best for patients but then you always run up against business challenge
EDL	00:52:53,119	00:52:53,887	| IOT223 |	From time to time
EDL	00:52:53,887	00:52:58,495	| IOT223 |	I guess from a technology point of view you're right you've nailed it when you focus
EDL	00:52:59,519	00:53:01,823	| IOT223 |	Connectivity is what makes us
EDL	00:53:03,103	00:53:05,663	| IOT223 |	First of all it is not an LTE
EDL	00:53:05,663	00:53:09,503	| IOT223 |	Riven Android tablet it is a wifi-only
EDL	00:53:09,503	00:53:14,879	| IOT223 |	So if we do go to LTE we connect via hotspot so Verizon has a hotspot and a number of other
EDL	00:53:15,391	00:53:18,719	| IOT223 |	Companies Huawei has one that we actually connect to
EDL	00:53:18,719	00:53:19,999	| IOT223 |	Basically that then
EDL	00:53:19,999	00:53:26,399	| IOT223 |	Kansas off into the cellular network mostly for Jeeps
EDL	00:53:26,399	00:53:29,471	| IOT223 |	Chihuahua and stuff for doing the local to an actual
EDL	00:53:29,471	00:53:31,775	| IOT223 |	Facility that they've begun to sort of
EDL	00:53:31,775	00:53:34,079	| IOT223 |	Experiment with
EDL	00:53:34,079	00:53:35,103	| IOT223 |	White area coverage
EDL	00:53:35,103	00:53:36,383	| IOT223 |	5G that's not here yet
EDL	00:53:36,895	00:53:38,943	| IOT223 |	And as we're looking at why they recover
EDL	00:53:38,943	00:53:39,967	| IOT223 |	Certified G
EDL	00:53:39,967	00:53:41,503	| IOT223 |	This frequency spectrum is
EDL	00:53:41,503	00:53:42,271	| IOT223 |	Is all over the place
EDL	00:53:42,783	00:53:45,343	| IOT223 |	Depending on where you are from a geography point of view
EDL	00:53:45,343	00:53:47,903	| IOT223 |	Until we do have plans to continue
EDL	00:53:47,903	00:53:49,439	| IOT223 |	The modularity approach
EDL	00:53:49,439	00:53:54,815	| IOT223 |	Because our customers are so global
EDL	00:53:54,815	00:53:57,119	| IOT223 |	IGN China versus 5G in the US
EDL	00:53:57,119	00:53:59,679	| IOT223 |	That's kind of Honor roadmap
EDL	00:53:59,679	00:54:04,287	| IOT223 |	For future products and everything else will come out about the time 5G starts to gain momentum
EDL	00:54:04,799	00:54:10,687	| IOT223 |	So you guys recently raised 80 million in debt and equity and that is a lot of
EDL	00:54:10,687	00:54:11,455	| IOT223 |	Money
EDL	00:54:11,455	00:54:12,991	| IOT223 |	What are you guys going to do
EDL	00:54:14,015	00:54:17,855	| IOT223 |	Two major areas of frost one is around getting these
EDL	00:54:17,855	00:54:18,623	| IOT223 |	Deployments
EDL	00:54:18,623	00:54:20,415	| IOT223 |	Be a little bit more
EDL	00:54:20,415	00:54:22,719	| IOT223 |	Easy to do and and what I mean by that is
EDL	00:54:23,231	00:54:23,999	| IOT223 |	Water solution
EDL	00:54:25,791	00:54:26,559	| IOT223 |	Weird
EDL	00:54:26,559	00:54:30,655	| IOT223 |	The moving towards sort of a real where is a service model where we'll bundle
EDL	00:54:30,655	00:54:34,751	| IOT223 |	Things together into kind of a single offering and then just drop it in
EDL	00:54:34,751	00:54:38,079	| IOT223 |	Install a train and then leave and and that sort of
EDL	00:54:38,079	00:54:41,151	| IOT223 |	Motions different than today's motion where a lot of it is
EDL	00:54:41,151	00:54:43,711	| IOT223 |	Hey do a trade study on the hardware do a trade study on the soft
EDL	00:54:47,295	00:54:51,391	| IOT223 |	ZR1 price per user per month for everything installation Hardware shopper
EDL	00:54:52,159	00:54:54,719	| IOT223 |	On the tailor that is basically and
EDL	00:54:54,719	00:54:55,743	| IOT223 |	Expansion of Versailles
EDL	00:54:57,023	00:55:03,423	| IOT223 |	Especially when it comes to the installation folks in the training folks in the technical folks sets
EDL	00:55:03,423	00:55:05,983	| IOT223 |	But nevertheless can help deploy
EDL	00:55:05,983	00:55:09,055	| IOT223 |	And then the second area is around research and development
EDL	00:55:09,055	00:55:09,823	| IOT223 |	Mostly developed
EDL	00:55:11,359	00:55:12,895	| IOT223 |	We got two classes of products
EDL	00:55:13,663	00:55:14,175	| IOT223 |	Schlitterbahn
EDL	00:55:14,687	00:55:19,551	| IOT223 |	The bounding edges of where we sit in the ecosystem and and industries
EDL	00:55:19,551	00:55:21,087	| IOT223 |	I want is the hololens which
EDL	00:55:21,087	00:55:24,159	| IOT223 |	Isaiah stereoscopic system
EDL	00:55:24,159	00:55:24,927	| IOT223 |	Ideas
EDL	00:55:24,927	00:55:28,767	| IOT223 |	Towards products that may make immersive AR a little bit more
EDL	00:55:28,767	00:55:31,327	| IOT223 |	Easy to do so there's a better way to do that
EDL	00:55:31,327	00:55:34,399	| IOT223 |	And still keep it safe than the way we're doing it today
EDL	00:55:34,399	00:55:40,287	| IOT223 |	I am we got a work-in-progress right now that will take away eventually to something that looks more
EDL	00:55:40,799	00:55:43,615	| IOT223 |	Like immersive AR or something that would be able to
EDL	00:55:44,383	00:55:45,919	| IOT223 |	Soda compared immersive AR
EDL	00:55:46,431	00:55:47,967	| IOT223 |	And then on the other end of the steps
EDL	00:55:47,967	00:55:51,039	| IOT223 |	We have folks like Google Glass and a whole bunch of
EDL	00:55:51,039	00:55:53,855	| IOT223 |	Chinese competitors in the same sort of will
EDL	00:55:54,367	00:55:58,207	| IOT223 |	Sugar is in need for lighter-weight indoor systems as well
EDL	00:55:58,207	00:56:04,607	| IOT223 |	There's a couple different ways or else we can go to market looking at lightweight systems but basically I have those from a
EDL	00:56:04,607	00:56:06,399	| IOT223 |	Hardware perspective in my bullseye
EDL	00:56:06,399	00:56:08,703	| IOT223 |	And then from a software perspective it's all about the
EDL	00:56:08,703	00:56:12,287	| IOT223 |	Platform show at each one of these
EDL	00:56:12,287	00:56:12,799	| IOT223 |	If you think of them
EDL	00:56:14,079	00:56:16,895	| IOT223 |	We need to build the nest as well make sure that Nest is
EDL	00:56:16,895	00:56:19,455	| IOT223 |	Go Boston comfortable
EDL	00:56:19,455	00:56:21,247	| IOT223 |	What about you I'm talking about his mobile device
EDL	00:56:22,015	00:56:23,295	| IOT223 |	Mobile application manager
EDL	00:56:23,295	00:56:26,623	| IOT223 |	Different microservices in the cloud to help enable these things
EDL	00:56:26,623	00:56:28,927	| IOT223 |	Because while you deploy 10000
EDL	00:56:28,927	00:56:30,463	| IOT223 |	Hmt-1 sore
EDL	00:56:30,463	00:56:33,535	| IOT223 |	Any wearable system for Enterprise or even any
EDL	00:56:33,535	00:56:34,303	| IOT223 |	Phones
EDL	00:56:34,303	00:56:35,583	| IOT223 |	Or tablets for Enterprise
EDL	00:56:36,095	00:56:42,495	| IOT223 |	Is very different than the way you do it as a consumer because there's a consumer kind of your own admin your own it it's sort of us
EDL	00:56:42,495	00:56:43,007	| IOT223 |	Team of one
EDL	00:56:43,519	00:56:48,127	| IOT223 |	Whereas in Enterprise you're deploying 10,000 systems you might have one admin
EDL	00:56:48,639	00:56:49,919	| IOT223 |	She's running all 10006
EDL	00:56:52,991	00:56:54,527	| IOT223 |	Needs to be a little bit different
EDL	00:56:54,527	00:56:58,111	| IOT223 |	Then what Google provides consumers and others like that and that's what we're building
EDL	00:56:59,391	00:57:03,999	| IOT223 |	In a world where we have these this awesome connectivity and we have
EDL	00:57:03,999	00:57:08,095	| IOT223 |	This sort of technology in the in the nest that you are so thoughtfully build for us
EDL	00:57:08,095	00:57:10,143	| IOT223 |	What becomes possible what is that look for
EDL	00:57:11,167	00:57:14,239	| IOT223 |	What we love to think about it real where what we're doing is
EDL	00:57:14,751	00:57:18,335	| IOT223 |	Enabling sort of the 21st century maker
EDL	00:57:18,335	00:57:21,151	| IOT223 |	Jones furniture makers are Folks at work with their hands
EDL	00:57:21,663	00:57:25,759	| IOT223 |	I come from a family of sheet metal workers
EDL	00:57:26,271	00:57:27,551	| IOT223 |	Grassland
EDL	00:57:27,551	00:57:29,087	| IOT223 |	Next Generation
EDL	00:57:29,087	00:57:29,599	| IOT223 |	Digital worker
EDL	00:57:30,111	00:57:31,135	| IOT223 |	With the same sort of
EDL	00:57:34,207	00:57:35,487	| IOT223 |	The Clark College of the road
EDL	00:57:35,487	00:57:37,535	| IOT223 |	Where we sit here and Vancouver Washington
EDL	00:57:38,047	00:57:40,095	| IOT223 |	I bet trains new automotive tech
EDL	00:57:40,095	00:57:40,863	| IOT223 |	Patience
EDL	00:57:40,863	00:57:42,399	| IOT223 |	How to do edging
EDL	00:57:42,399	00:57:45,471	| IOT223 |	Well, part of their curriculum now for a day they spend
EDL	00:57:45,471	00:57:47,007	| IOT223 |	Learning about the HMT
EDL	00:57:47,007	00:57:51,103	| IOT223 |	Because how that will turn them into a 21st century worker
EDL	00:57:51,103	00:57:53,151	| IOT223 |	Is so much faster
EDL	00:57:53,151	00:57:54,175	| IOT223 |	Then the workers
EDL	00:57:54,175	00:57:55,199	| IOT223 |	20th century
EDL	00:57:55,199	00:57:56,991	| IOT223 |	Because they're able to get the
EDL	00:57:56,991	00:57:57,759	| IOT223 |	Basics
EDL	00:57:57,759	00:58:01,599	| IOT223 |	Word directly to a contributional sort of
EDL	00:58:01,599	00:58:02,879	| IOT223 |	Position on the team
EDL	00:58:02,879	00:58:06,975	| IOT223 |	Because they have with some of these digital tools to help them be the sort of half
EDL	00:58:07,487	00:58:09,791	| IOT223 |	Human half computer type
EDL	00:58:12,351	00:58:15,167	| IOT223 |	I watch did you ever hear of something called
EDL	00:58:15,167	00:58:15,935	| IOT223 |	Centaur chess
EDL	00:58:16,959	00:58:18,751	| IOT223 |	I have no idea what you're
EDL	00:58:18,751	00:58:22,079	| IOT223 |	This is a fascinating thing and trust me I mean if we
EDL	00:58:22,079	00:58:23,359	| IOT223 |	State came out with
EDL	00:58:23,359	00:58:24,895	| IOT223 |	The beat of
EDL	00:58:24,895	00:58:25,919	| IOT223 |	Kasparov
EDL	00:58:25,919	00:58:28,479	| IOT223 |	Grandmaster chess champion in 1997
EDL	00:58:28,479	00:58:29,247	| IOT223 |	Beat Buy
EDL	00:58:29,247	00:58:31,039	| IOT223 |	Deep blue with IBM computer
EDL	00:58:31,039	00:58:32,063	| IOT223 |	We all kind of
EDL	00:58:32,063	00:58:34,623	| IOT223 |	Echoed across the whole globe about this idea
EDL	00:58:34,623	00:58:36,415	| IOT223 |	Oh man the computers are smarter than people
EDL	00:58:36,927	00:58:39,231	| IOT223 |	But what Gary did was say na they're not smarter than
EDL	00:58:39,743	00:58:42,303	| IOT223 |	Because the computer didn't play the game of chess that I play
EDL	00:58:42,303	00:58:42,815	| IOT223 |	However
EDL	00:58:44,351	00:58:48,191	| IOT223 |	Computer to maximize with a computer
EDL	00:58:50,239	00:58:51,263	| IOT223 |	Centaurs
EDL	00:58:51,263	00:58:52,031	| IOT223 |	Mythological creature
EDL	00:58:52,031	00:58:53,055	| IOT223 |	Half horse half man
EDL	00:58:53,567	00:58:55,871	| IOT223 |	The idea would be the man would be the
EDL	00:58:56,383	00:58:57,151	| IOT223 |	Intuitive
EDL	00:58:57,151	00:58:57,919	| IOT223 |	Creative
EDL	00:58:57,919	00:58:59,199	| IOT223 |	Type source of knowledge
EDL	00:58:59,711	00:59:00,991	| IOT223 |	And the horse would be your bootstrap
EDL	00:59:01,503	00:59:02,527	| IOT223 |	Powercranks rocks
EDL	00:59:03,551	00:59:05,343	| IOT223 |	Make sure it's Eric fruits that sort of thing
EDL	00:59:05,343	00:59:07,647	| IOT223 |	It was a little bit
EDL	00:59:07,647	00:59:09,951	| IOT223 |	More harmonious than a cyborg
EDL	00:59:10,719	00:59:12,511	| IOT223 |	Some people caught cyborg chest
EDL	00:59:12,511	00:59:15,071	| IOT223 |	But this chess is played at the highest level of chest
EDL	00:59:15,071	00:59:15,839	| IOT223 |	History
EDL	00:59:15,839	00:59:16,607	| IOT223 |	Play time
EDL	00:59:16,607	00:59:20,191	| IOT223 |	It's virtually are proof and you got the greatest chess Minds the world
EDL	00:59:20,191	00:59:20,959	| IOT223 |	Creatively
EDL	00:59:20,959	00:59:22,239	| IOT223 |	Doing each other
EDL	00:59:22,239	00:59:24,799	| IOT223 |	On a chessboard at a very high high high level
EDL	00:59:25,311	00:59:29,151	| IOT223 |	What we're doing is doing the same work reading a centaur works
EDL	00:59:30,431	00:59:32,479	| IOT223 |	This Workforce of centaurs
EDL	00:59:32,479	00:59:34,015	| IOT223 |	That'll be
EDL	00:59:34,015	00:59:35,039	| IOT223 |	Digital
EDL	00:59:35,039	00:59:37,343	| IOT223 |	What's the tools like the HMT that
EDL	00:59:37,343	00:59:39,903	| IOT223 |	Go into the field and take a vacation
EDL	00:59:39,903	00:59:42,719	| IOT223 |	It's a very well take these folks will be welcome
EDL	00:59:43,487	00:59:47,071	| IOT223 |	Because other skills are so much higher than a conventional
EDL	00:59:48,351	00:59:50,911	| IOT223 |	That has to go back home not sure how to fix this
EDL	00:59:50,911	00:59:52,191	| IOT223 |	Let me get someone else out there
EDL	00:59:53,215	00:59:54,495	| IOT223 |	I get my supervisor there
EDL	00:59:55,007	00:59:56,287	| IOT223 |	Additional worker
EDL	00:59:56,287	00:59:57,823	| IOT223 |	Will be able to diagnose people in
EDL	00:59:58,335	01:00:00,895	| IOT223 |	Pedialyte
EDL	01:00:00,895	01:00:01,919	| IOT223 |	Minor it is
EDL	01:00:03,455	01:00:04,479	| IOT223 |	When you try to make
EDL	01:00:04,479	01:00:09,599	| IOT223 |	Translate that out to a global scale and as we're building infrastructure of things like
EDL	01:00:09,599	01:00:10,623	| IOT223 |	Wind power
EDL	01:00:10,623	01:00:11,391	| IOT223 |	Geothermal
EDL	01:00:11,903	01:00:14,719	| IOT223 |	And all of these things that will begin a world that will be
EDL	01:00:15,231	01:00:17,279	| IOT223 |	Truly lower lower marginal cost
EDL	01:00:17,791	01:00:20,863	| IOT223 |	Truly less and less dependent on scarce resources
EDL	01:00:20,863	01:00:24,191	| IOT223 |	So that the idea of sharing economy something that is
EDL	01:00:25,727	01:00:28,543	| IOT223 |	Jeremy Rifkin does a very good speech on this
EDL	01:00:28,543	01:00:31,871	| IOT223 |	About a sharing economy where we reduce the margin
EDL	01:00:32,895	01:00:35,455	| IOT223 |	Anything that we do energy we make Logistics
EDL	01:00:35,967	01:00:36,735	| IOT223 |	The knowledge
EDL	01:00:36,735	01:00:39,551	| IOT223 |	She nearly zero and then in that sort of contest
EDL	01:00:40,319	01:00:41,855	| IOT223 |	We told the world that is
EDL	01:00:42,367	01:00:44,927	| IOT223 |	A lot less prone to have us fighting over
