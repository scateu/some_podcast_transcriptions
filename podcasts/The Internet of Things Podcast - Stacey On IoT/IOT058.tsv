EDL	00:00:06,656	00:00:12,032	| IOT058 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house
EDL	00:00:12,032	00:00:13,056	| IOT058 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:13,056	00:00:14,336	| IOT058 |	And this is your co-host
EDL	00:00:14,336	00:00:14,848	| IOT058 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:15,360	00:00:17,664	| IOT058 |	And we have a great show
EDL	00:00:17,664	00:00:18,944	| IOT058 |	For you I know I always say that
EDL	00:00:20,224	00:00:21,760	| IOT058 |	It is it is always great
EDL	00:00:22,272	00:00:23,552	| IOT058 |	It is fantastic
EDL	00:00:23,552	00:00:24,064	| IOT058 |	6o
EDL	00:00:24,576	00:00:25,856	| IOT058 |	We thought we kick it off with the
EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:27,392	| IOT058 |	The story for the New York Times
EDL	00:00:27,392	00:00:28,160	| IOT058 |	Which is
EDL	00:00:28,160	00:00:31,232	| IOT058 |	Just how much power do your electronics use
EDL	00:00:31,232	00:00:32,000	| IOT058 |	Kodak put
EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:34,816	| IOT058 |	And the answer is
EDL	00:00:34,816	00:00:35,584	| IOT058 |	A lot
EDL	00:00:35,584	00:00:36,608	| IOT058 |	Good question
EDL	00:00:36,608	00:00:38,144	| IOT058 |	Yes it's great
EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:43,264	| IOT058 |	Kevin you said that you actually started deal out so the story is actually all about
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:44,544	| IOT058 |	Vampire power draw
EDL	00:00:44,544	00:00:46,336	| IOT058 |	Which was a big deal a couple
EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:51,200	| IOT058 |	A couple years ago because of steady came out showing that your game consoles in your
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:52,736	| IOT058 |	Cable boxes
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:54,784	| IOT058 |	Just sucked power like there was no tomorrow
EDL	00:00:55,296	00:00:57,088	| IOT058 |	That does kind of
EDL	00:00:57,600	00:00:58,880	| IOT058 |	Version that we got here
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:00,672	| IOT058 |	The newest kind of
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:01,952	| IOT058 |	Twisting the story
EDL	00:01:02,464	00:01:03,232	| IOT058 |	Is
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:05,536	| IOT058 |	The burgeoning kind of smart devices
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:07,328	| IOT058 |	Because they're connected
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:12,704	| IOT058 |	Are always on because they got you no Wi-Fi connection they need to maintain and they need to send data back
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:16,032	| IOT058 |	They're also
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:20,128	| IOT058 |	You get that always listening kind of affecting that takes a small power draw to
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:21,664	| IOT058 |	So
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:26,784	| IOT058 |	Yeah the time study shows some actual power drains on devices where
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:32,928	| IOT058 |	Most people probably think while I'm not using my cable box about watching TV so it's not using any power but
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:38,560	| IOT058 |	Perfect example is the Samsung cable box and then not paying on Samsung this is pretty prevalent in the industry
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:40,096	| IOT058 |	They use a 26 Watts
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:41,888	| IOT058 |	The power when it's off
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:43,680	| IOT058 |	Turn phone off and not recording
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:47,008	| IOT058 |	When you're actually using it when you're watching TV
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:49,312	| IOT058 |	And recording something
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:51,872	| IOT058 |	Additional to watts of power so it's
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:53,152	| IOT058 |	Most of the power
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:54,176	| IOT058 |	Consumption
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:56,480	| IOT058 |	Is happening all the time with a device like that
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:02:01,088	| IOT058 |	And as you said Stacy you got always on devices connected devices that
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:03,904	| IOT058 |	Many updates are there always listening or
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:06,720	| IOT058 |	In the case of cable box it's getting guide information which is
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:09,792	| IOT058 |	Just changing every 30 minutes as you know show cycle through
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:12,864	| IOT058 |	List of ads oven and I knew this a couple years back
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:20,032	| IOT058 |	It was a big meme about the whole vampire power Drano people finally started understanding that device
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:22,336	| IOT058 |	Isis use power even when they're cooling Court off
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:26,944	| IOT058 |	So the two ways you can deal with us one is it just obviously on plug
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:27,712	| IOT058 |	My device
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,736	| IOT058 |	But I took a more
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:32,320	| IOT058 |	And I guess I'll call it a technical approach anyway I can spend money I do
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:34,880	| IOT058 |	I bought these so-called smart strips
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:37,952	| IOT058 |	Which there power outlets in a Rossini Stacy
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,976	| IOT058 |	I have
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:39,744	| IOT058 |	Yeah
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:46,912	| IOT058 |	Oh okay I have one almost in every room of the house and I know that adds up and it yeah there's a cost-benefit analysis of
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:48,192	| IOT058 |	How much does electricity cost
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:51,008	| IOT058 |	Versus paying for these things still use less electricity
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:52,288	| IOT058 |	We won't get into the mat
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,056	| IOT058 |	Regardless
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:56,128	| IOT058 |	What disease do is they have a master Outlet
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:03:02,272	| IOT058 |	And you plug in a a device into that and when that device is turned on like in my case
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,808	| IOT058 |	In my office right now
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:08,416	| IOT058 |	This iMac I'm using is the master device when I turn the iMac on
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:12,256	| IOT058 |	The smart strip says okay now we can let power flow to all the other Outlet
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,792	| IOT058 |	So
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:18,656	| IOT058 |	Other peripherals and they have connected that I wouldn't want draining power when the iMac is off
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,960	| IOT058 |	Now start using power as they should
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:22,496	| IOT058 |	When I shut my iMac off
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:25,824	| IOT058 |	The smart strip says no more power for anything else connected to this thing
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:28,384	| IOT058 |	There are some hot Outlets as well so you don't have to
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,920	| IOT058 |	We totally depend on a single device
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:34,016	| IOT058 |	Comes in handy for say living room situation
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:36,576	| IOT058 |	Your TV when your TV is on you can want
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:39,392	| IOT058 |	If your Blu-ray player your DVD player to your stereo
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:41,440	| IOT058 |	Your Apple TV
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:44,256	| IOT058 |	You want all those on as well when the TV is off you don't need those on
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:49,632	| IOT058 |	Suck my TV is my main device and the smart turn my family room for Snapple so
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:52,704	| IOT058 |	It kind of hopefully save me money in the long run
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:55,776	| IOT058 |	So I just looked at the 10 Outlet smart strip
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,568	| IOT058 |	On Amazon is
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,080	| IOT058 |	35
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:01,920	| IOT058 |	Wow it seems high compared to what I paid but
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:04,224	| IOT058 |	You know
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,528	| IOT058 |	Yeah there's a bunch of
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:08,576	| IOT058 |	So actually has one
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,880	| IOT058 |	Maybe slightly
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,928	| IOT058 |	Another option is just to have a
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:17,280	| IOT058 |	Straight up switch with an on-off outlet and then you can just turn those off
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:21,119	| IOT058 |	This one I like because it's little bit more automated
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:24,191	| IOT058 |	You don't have to actually reach behind something and be like
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,983	| IOT058 |	Now I want all my stuff
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:26,495	| IOT058 |	Exactly
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:30,335	| IOT058 |	It's okay to just happens you turn on the master device and
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:32,895	| IOT058 |	Advantages manage for yuan Roth
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:34,687	| IOT058 |	So in the other thing
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:38,527	| IOT058 |	That we talked about doing his I had installed a device called a curb
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:40,575	| IOT058 |	I actually had it installed by a certified doula
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,343	| IOT058 |	Electrician
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:44,415	| IOT058 |	I'm in my house that tracked my energy use
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,951	| IOT058 |	Buy Appliance
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:49,535	| IOT058 |	And that was really interesting cuz I saw what was sucking power all the time
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:54,399	| IOT058 |	I saw the impact from changing my incandescent to LED
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:57,727	| IOT058 |	And they have a couple of these kind of devices
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:59,007	| IOT058 |	And even a nap
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:00,287	| IOT058 |	So curb is a device
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:01,823	| IOT058 |	Anime
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:06,687	| IOT058 |	Quick ask your card gets installed at the circuit breaker level
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,479	| IOT058 |	So you have to have an electrician do it
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,247	| IOT058 |	Unless you were
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,271	| IOT058 |	Really really comfy
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:13,087	| IOT058 |	Barbara Stager
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:13,599	| IOT058 |	With your
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,159	| IOT058 |	Add your circuit box
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:19,999	| IOT058 |	Actually take the data from
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:20,767	| IOT058 |	Each
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,303	| IOT058 |	Individual circuit
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:24,863	| IOT058 |	They have a one 4:16 and I think one for 8
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,911	| IOT058 |	So you can actually see
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,471	| IOT058 |	Your air conditioning and how much that's using
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:29,983	| IOT058 |	Versus something
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:32,287	| IOT058 |	Actually two of those
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:38,431	| IOT058 |	There's also another device you can install in your circuit
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:39,967	| IOT058 |	Am I just make
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,831	| IOT058 |	Panel
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:48,927	| IOT058 |	The Box the rectangular thing with the switches
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:51,487	| IOT058 |	Switch off
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,791	| IOT058 |	So the device
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:57,887	| IOT058 |	Just call dinner Rio and that also installs there that doesn't actually
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,935	| IOT058 |	Deal with each individual breaker
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:03,775	| IOT058 |	It's for the whole box and it measures electricity consumption
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:06,847	| IOT058 |	I'm just going to call and fancier algorithms it's
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,615	| IOT058 |	Trying to detect
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:09,919	| IOT058 |	The patterns in various
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,711	| IOT058 |	Types of energy flows to tell you what's happen
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,759	| IOT058 |	So that's another thing
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:14,271	| IOT058 |	You can use
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,063	| IOT058 |	Overall energy consumption
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,855	| IOT058 |	Figure out what's sucking
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:22,463	| IOT058 |	I just got turned onto an app that will help you as well
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:25,279	| IOT058 |	It's called chai energy chai like the tea
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,583	| IOT058 |	It's a free app
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:33,983	| IOT058 |	And the way gets the data it actually reads in What's called the green button data which is the like this
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:37,823	| IOT058 |	Smart meter type information that's being fed to electricity providers
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:39,871	| IOT058 |	So why let them have all that information
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:42,175	| IOT058 |	Chai actually guess it the same way they get it
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:46,527	| IOT058 |	And shows you graphs and such on your phone of electricity usage
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:51,391	| IOT058 |	And gives you ways to save says maybe your AC is running more than should buy
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:53,183	| IOT058 |	Compare the average Etc
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:58,047	| IOT058 |	Unfortunate for me even though this does work on IOS and Android
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:01,375	| IOT058 |	My electricity provider is not yet participating in
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:04,191	| IOT058 |	Either getting the data or sharing the day that was chili
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:06,239	| IOT058 |	I can't say I've tested it
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:10,591	| IOT058 |	But I should also mention if you want to get the data I think on your own
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:13,663	| IOT058 |	They do so it's called the chai energy Pro
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:16,479	| IOT058 |	Which is a box don't know how much it cost
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:20,319	| IOT058 |	But it will actually read it directly from the smart meter
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:22,623	| IOT058 |	Itself as opposed to getting it
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:25,695	| IOT058 |	Through the electricity provider Alex it's only $50
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:27,999	| IOT058 |	The curb which I think
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:33,887	| IOT058 |	Expensive I don't know if it's that expensive but
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,679	| IOT058 |	I'm am looking at
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:43,359	| IOT058 |	While you're doing that the difference between the chai energy app and the trainer do pro as obviously there's Hardware buy with the pro
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:45,663	| IOT058 |	Chai energy app only get you
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:50,015	| IOT058 |	Once a day energy usage monitoring it's not constantly pinging and pulling and getting information
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:52,063	| IOT058 |	The pro Hardware device
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:54,111	| IOT058 |	Is real-time energy usage monitoring
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:57,695	| IOT058 |	You can even tag appliances so you can specifically say
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:00,767	| IOT058 |	I don't know how much power the dishwasher uses and so on so forth so
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:04,095	| IOT058 |	Said some interesting intelligence
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:07,935	| IOT058 |	Yes and your Bo is $180
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:11,007	| IOT058 |	On Amazon plus you're going to need the electrician in
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,775	| IOT058 |	Install that
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,799	| IOT058 |	And
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:15,615	| IOT058 |	Curb it was hundreds so I don't remember how many hundreds
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,431	| IOT058 |	And it may vary by how many
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:20,479	| IOT058 |	Sensors you actually put into the breaker as well
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,271	| IOT058 |	It is $400
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,551	| IOT058 |	400
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,063	| IOT058 |	So that's the sick
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:25,855	| IOT058 |	Zones
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,367	| IOT058 |	So that's not
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,647	| IOT058 |	Crystal Tarot
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,183	| IOT058 |	But the 200 is the
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:29,951	| IOT058 |	The 2 pack for large
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:30,975	| IOT058 |	Looks like I have to
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,023	| IOT058 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:38,143	| IOT058 |	I wonder how it would be actually interesting to compare this $50
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,191	| IOT058 |	Chai energy Pro
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:41,727	| IOT058 |	2 m solution
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:43,263	| IOT058 |	Just because the massive cost difference
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:46,335	| IOT058 |	And see that the data is
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:49,407	| IOT058 |	Any better more fine and so on a more expensive one
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,687	| IOT058 |	I will call them bingo
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:55,295	| IOT058 |	There we go right there also say that
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,575	| IOT058 |	Check how much your
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:58,111	| IOT058 |	Devices are consuming
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:02,975	| IOT058 |	With the WeMo Insight switch and actually there are a couple
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:03,743	| IOT058 |	Smart outlet
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,535	| IOT058 |	Let's I just happen to have a WeMo insight
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,303	| IOT058 |	Text Wichita
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:06,815	| IOT058 |	What does this
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,095	| IOT058 |	It also is
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:09,631	| IOT058 |	By the way
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:10,143	| IOT058 |	But
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:13,727	| IOT058 |	When you plug a device and you can see how much power
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:14,239	| IOT058 |	It's using
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,847	| IOT058 |	For a while but now
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,895	| IOT058 |	For next week show I'm going to plug
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:26,783	| IOT058 |	My echo and I'm going to plug a couple other kind of connected devices into this and I'll take some
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:30,111	| IOT058 |	Readings measurements and we'll we'll come back to this because
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,159	| IOT058 |	It sucks being a lot of money for electricity
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:37,023	| IOT058 |	The story says that about a quarter of residential home energy use
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:38,815	| IOT058 |	Tron from Vampire power
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:43,679	| IOT058 |	Sounds high but I mean I'm sure there are cases of that and I
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,191	| IOT058 |	Is there's a lot of cons
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,031	| IOT058 |	Yeah it adds up
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:48,799	| IOT058 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:49,823	| IOT058 |	So that's your grim
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:52,639	| IOT058 |	How much are spending on electricity
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:54,431	| IOT058 |	You're not even using it
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,807	| IOT058 |	Moving right along
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:00,575	| IOT058 |	We're going to talk about
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:01,855	| IOT058 |	Open
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,367	| IOT058 |	Thread
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:06,463	| IOT058 |	Wait wait is that like thread from nest
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:10,303	| IOT058 |	Except now it's open source and you can pull it down from
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:12,095	| IOT058 |	And
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:15,167	| IOT058 |	The catch it so there's a couple things
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,959	| IOT058 |	Cuz they catch
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,775	| IOT058 |	Before I get to the catch let's just stay with
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,799	| IOT058 |	This is
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:21,823	| IOT058 |	Basically
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,103	| IOT058 |	The thread
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,895	| IOT058 |	Protocol in
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:29,247	| IOT058 |	Prayers because you may not remember thread as a wireless protocol so it's like zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:32,831	| IOT058 |	Except it is using the 802.
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:35,391	| IOT058 |	Oh man I hated seeing
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:40,511	| IOT058 |	So it's the same radio IEEE radio standard that should be uses
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,535	| IOT058 |	Except
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:43,071	| IOT058 |	Thread is both a mesh
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,631	| IOT058 |	And it's also IPv6 compatible
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:49,727	| IOT058 |	That means any device that uses thread can go straight to the internet
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:52,031	| IOT058 |	Itself without going through a hub
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:56,639	| IOT058 |	Friend so those are the things his nest Samsung silicon labs freescale
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:11:00,223	| IOT058 |	Bigassfans a couple other companies created this couple
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:00,991	| IOT058 |	How to say was
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:01,759	| IOT058 |	2 years ago now
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:03,807	| IOT058 |	Time flies when you're having fun and
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:07,135	| IOT058 |	They introduced a certification program last November
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:09,439	| IOT058 |	For this and kind of devices are coming out
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,207	| IOT058 |	So
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:11,487	| IOT058 |	What they've done now is there like
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,511	| IOT058 |	Hey
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,303	| IOT058 |	Momentum we got it
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,607	| IOT058 |	Let's open this up to the community
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:19,935	| IOT058 |	Your devices will still have to get certified
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:23,007	| IOT058 |	So basically what you're doing is you are
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:24,543	| IOT058 |	Able to download this
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:27,359	| IOT058 |	Work it into your devices but they are going to still have to
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,407	| IOT058 |	But if you want them to be
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:34,015	| IOT058 |	Which is slightly better I think from a financial standpoint cuz I think
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:38,367	| IOT058 |	Beforehand you had to pay to have access to the specs of
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:38,879	| IOT058 |	Thread
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,415	| IOT058 |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:42,207	| IOT058 |	So now I assume you
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:44,511	| IOT058 |	Don't you just need a paper certification
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:46,047	| IOT058 |	Bright I'm guessing that was a
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:46,559	| IOT058 |	The control thing
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:50,399	| IOT058 |	But this is good news because
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:52,703	| IOT058 |	Thread is actually a really useful
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,751	| IOT058 |	It's got a different kind of mash than the Bluetooth
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,031	| IOT058 |	Mesh
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:59,615	| IOT058 |	It can handle more devices basically is the bottom line
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:03,455	| IOT058 |	And it's a little bit more modern with the IPv6
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:08,319	| IOT058 |	Compared to say pee in the zigbee guys have actually done a really close alignment with
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,599	| IOT058 |	The thread group
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:10,879	| IOT058 |	So
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:14,719	| IOT058 |	Which is smart I think it's super smart so some zigbee devices
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:15,999	| IOT058 |	Will be
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,279	| IOT058 |	Thread compatible
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:19,839	| IOT058 |	The chipset is backwards compatible
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:21,631	| IOT058 |	You know what else is compatible
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:25,471	| IOT058 |	My onhub router which is a Google router
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:27,263	| IOT058 |	I'll have the thread compatible radio in it
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,847	| IOT058 |	Using it as far as I know
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:34,175	| IOT058 |	But maybe they will and now that this is open-source another peep
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:34,687	| IOT058 |	Download it
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:39,295	| IOT058 |	That would be cool don't forget to that next week which
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,831	| IOT058 |	I will not be here on the show
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:41,855	| IOT058 |	Because
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,903	| IOT058 |	I will be at Google IO
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:44,671	| IOT058 |	And I
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:50,815	| IOT058 |	I think there's something on the schedule or in the sandbox demonstration areas about open thread
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,327	| IOT058 |	There is
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:54,399	| IOT058 |	Maybe you'll get to see that
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:57,471	| IOT058 |	Next week show we're going to have yonko
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:59,263	| IOT058 |	Another word
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:01,311	| IOT058 |	Lake who actually is at CES Asia this week
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:02,335	| IOT058 |	And
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:04,895	| IOT058 |	We're going to have lots of fun on that so
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:05,663	| IOT058 |	Sneak peek
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:06,687	| IOT058 |	Okay next
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,455	| IOT058 |	Topic
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,223	| IOT058 |	What is RNA
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:08,735	| IOT058 |	Stop it Kevin
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:12,319	| IOT058 |	How about the Almond router then we got a question about that off
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,719	| IOT058 |	Couple weeks ago
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,815	| IOT058 |	What's up with that
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,631	| IOT058 |	I've seen all these new router kind of things happening in
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,655	| IOT058 |	Nothing from them
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,423	| IOT058 |	So
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:32,799	| IOT058 |	4 people who aren't aware of the Almond router is from a company called securifi it came out probably like
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:35,103	| IOT058 |	Two or three years ago actually with
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:41,247	| IOT058 |	The idea that the router is the hub for the smart home and they had all these radios at a zigbee I think they might have had a Z-Wave version
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:45,599	| IOT058 |	You don't think they were just chugging along but it was also pretty kind of
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,367	| IOT058 |	Easy interface
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:48,415	| IOT058 |	So Cut Above the modern routers that
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:53,023	| IOT058 |	Well they got a new router
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:56,607	| IOT058 |	Actually they call it a home wi-fi system
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,631	| IOT058 |	Abby Allman
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,399	| IOT058 |	3
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:01,983	| IOT058 |	And this may sound familiar to people this implementation I'll basically
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:08,383	| IOT058 |	It is a as you said it's a lot of the smart home stuff in there we'll talk about that in a minute but it's a router for your home available for pre-order
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,919	| IOT058 |	11999
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:12,479	| IOT058 |	Will retail for 149 99
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:17,343	| IOT058 |	You can get a bundle a pack of three of them with Mesh networking
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:20,671	| IOT058 |	For 299 Grand Prix motor and retails for 399
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:23,999	| IOT058 |	So obvious comparisons to the ear OST
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:25,535	| IOT058 |	Thank you
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,071	| IOT058 |	Obvious comparisons
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:27,839	| IOT058 |	To that
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:30,911	| IOT058 |	But what's different here I don't think those
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:36,031	| IOT058 |	Other products have physically radio inside nor do they have touch screens and
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,567	| IOT058 |	And so on so forth so
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:39,103	| IOT058 |	This is kind of interesting
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:44,479	| IOT058 |	In addition to the ziggurat inside you're like okay well maybe we're going to do with it
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,527	| IOT058 |	It actually and I've done the sound off
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:49,855	| IOT058 |	Three other routers the new one the Almond plus as well as
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:51,391	| IOT058 |	The Omen 2015
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,927	| IOT058 |	They all now work with
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,207	| IOT058 |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:56,255	| IOT058 |	So it's almost
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:58,815	| IOT058 |	Yeah it's interesting that they created a skill set
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:03,679	| IOT058 |	We talked about skills before this small program that you can enable on your Echo
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,959	| IOT058 |	Use voice commands
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,775	| IOT058 |	So what they've done here is they've
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:11,615	| IOT058 |	I must you like it if this then that approach we can create rules
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,895	| IOT058 |	Through the
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:14,943	| IOT058 |	Skillset and the Almond router
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:18,015	| IOT058 |	So there is ample as you know party scene where you could say
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:21,855	| IOT058 |	I won't say her name but tell almond to activate party scene
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:25,695	| IOT058 |	In which case the temperature goes down on your thermostat
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:29,279	| IOT058 |	The lights go down your music starts playing and so on so you could do
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,303	| IOT058 |	Multiple
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,071	| IOT058 |	Actions
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,607	| IOT058 |	With one voice command so
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:37,983	| IOT058 |	That is kind of cool for all of the Almond routers that I have to say I'm more interested in the
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:39,775	| IOT058 |	Newest one just because of the Mesh networking
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,055	| IOT058 |	Yeah me too
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:44,639	| IOT058 |	We want to talk about outside of the universe
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:49,503	| IOT058 |	Sandy crazy radio protocol universe is something a little bit more fun at the application layer
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:50,783	| IOT058 |	Apple
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:51,295	| IOT058 |	Homekit
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:53,087	| IOT058 |	Somak world
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:57,183	| IOT058 |	Published a story saying that we might with iOS 10
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:58,975	| IOT058 |	CA Unified
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:03,071	| IOT058 |	Which we call this like a software-based hub for homekit
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,351	| IOT058 |	And it would be called
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,631	| IOT058 |	Home now
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,655	| IOT058 |	With all Apple news
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:08,703	| IOT058 |	This could be changed at any point in time
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:10,751	| IOT058 |	So knowing this
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,031	| IOT058 |	It's a huge gap
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:18,687	| IOT058 |	Right now if you have a homekit certified device you can use the app that comes with your device so if you've got the
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,991	| IOT058 |	The eve sensors from Elgato
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:27,391	| IOT058 |	They've got an app but you have to download third-party apps to actually create scenes that might Bridge like
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:32,511	| IOT058 |	That you sensors with your Philips Hue Lights there's no like universal control there
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:36,095	| IOT058 |	And so basically this would be
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:39,935	| IOT058 |	I've still hearing things from the community about Apple
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,727	| IOT058 |	That make me feel like
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,775	| IOT058 |	This could still be a long time coming
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:46,335	| IOT058 |	This is good news
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:48,127	| IOT058 |	Especially for people who are
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:48,639	| IOT058 |	Still waiting
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:55,807	| IOT058 |	Yeah there was talk about this happening in iOS 9 obviously it didn't happen so maybe this is the time
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:17:01,439	| IOT058 |	It kind of needs to happen I mean I'll be honest I'm sitting here and I'm looking at all this smart home
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,463	| IOT058 |	Apps that I have
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:05,535	| IOT058 |	Granted having root in a folder called home
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:09,375	| IOT058 |	So it's like okay at least they're all easily accessible in one place on my phone but
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:12,191	| IOT058 |	Some type of consolidation or centralized management
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,983	| IOT058 |	On the hand side or whatever
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:16,287	| IOT058 |	Just makes so much more sense I think and
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:21,919	| IOT058 |	Everybody was involved in the spaces working on their platforms to integrate the hardware and the
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:22,431	| IOT058 |	The functions
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:26,015	| IOT058 |	But I don't see any integration on the user interface
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:28,063	| IOT058 |	And that's really what I'd like to say
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:32,159	| IOT058 |	And you know there's there's a couple software programs out there
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,439	| IOT058 |	To do this
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,975	| IOT058 |	Actually work
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,255	| IOT058 |	Catso
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:38,047	| IOT058 |	Will keep you updated on that
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:40,095	| IOT058 |	It would be a nice thing to have
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:43,167	| IOT058 |	And then finally we have some Industrial iot
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,959	| IOT058 |	Iot world is this week
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:47,519	| IOT058 |	It happened to this week I guess in the
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:50,335	| IOT058 |	Magical time travel of the show so
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:53,151	| IOT058 |	The two biggest companies that came out this week with like
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:55,967	| IOT058 |	Basically internet-of-things divisions are Hitachi
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:57,247	| IOT058 |	Which is
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:18:01,855	| IOT058 |	I talked to them about this already made five
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,135	| IOT058 |	Play 4 billion and stuff that we
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:05,951	| IOT058 |	We consider internet of things so what the heck
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:06,719	| IOT058 |	What's created division
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,535	| IOT058 |	With Itachi what they're doing is
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:10,303	| IOT058 |	They have pulled
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:13,375	| IOT058 |	Used to be there
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,143	| IOT058 |	Group with
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:18,751	| IOT058 |	Tahoe and stuff and they basically put that aside and said that group is going to be
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:19,519	| IOT058 |	Working
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:21,823	| IOT058 |	With all the different Hitachi divisions
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:25,407	| IOT058 |	And you know whatever you get to be these conglomerates it's pretty difficult
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:27,455	| IOT058 |	They have over 900
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:27,967	| IOT058 |	Hitachi company
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:32,319	| IOT058 |	It's ridiculous wow but they pulled it out until like 12 big groups
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:37,439	| IOT058 |	I'm so let's say they're there bullet train division wants to do some sort of iot based
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:38,719	| IOT058 |	Track management system
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:43,327	| IOT058 |	That division would actually work with this new iot division
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:49,471	| IOT058 |	To get get a real-time Data Insights maybe some cool algorithms they work very closely together to serve the cuss
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:53,055	| IOT058 |	TN customer though would work with the
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,079	| IOT058 |	Hitachi rail division
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:56,127	| IOT058 |	So basically
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,919	| IOT058 |	The way they set it up as Caesar
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:00,991	| IOT058 |	It's like an internal service provider to the division
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:05,599	| IOT058 |	Spear not going to be a customer of this company or division
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,927	| IOT058 |	Yes that's kind of how they
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:10,719	| IOT058 |	Is a notch
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:15,327	| IOT058 |	I'm in a lot of organizations which is you know
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:18,143	| IOT058 |	It just serves the whole company that was like
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,447	| IOT058 |	Cloud so
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,471	| IOT058 |	We'll see
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:24,543	| IOT058 |	Hitachi did as they created a platform called
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,055	| IOT058 |	Gumada
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:30,175	| IOT058 |	OU Mata
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:32,991	| IOT058 |	This is their iot platform effort
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,783	| IOT058 |	Schleich bluematrix
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,063	| IOT058 |	Is IBM's
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,855	| IOT058 |	Pot Farm effort Around The Internet of Things
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:41,951	| IOT058 |	And then moving on to HP
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,487	| IOT058 |	Who is also
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,279	| IOT058 |	Doing an iot
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:47,071	| IOT058 |	Kind of effort in platform
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:49,631	| IOT058 |	Hpe Universal
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:50,655	| IOT058 |	Platform which
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:56,799	| IOT058 |	Well it's interesting that I see the e in there after HP so it's
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,335	| IOT058 |	HP Enterprise
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:02,175	| IOT058 |	Oh yes I can't referred it because they split their Enterprise business with
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:02,687	| IOT058 |	Printing
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:06,527	| IOT058 |	The server the cloud computing all of that is
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,391	| IOT058 |	So yes
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:13,951	| IOT058 |	So basically
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:15,999	| IOT058 |	Again this is HP
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:18,047	| IOT058 |	Coming in
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:22,399	| IOT058 |	Against Amazon
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:24,191	| IOT058 |	IBM Microsoft
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:25,215	| IOT058 |	Everybody
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,263	| IOT058 |	Last week Honeywell
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:33,151	| IOT058 |	In everybody's got the same thing hey will take a lot of your data
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:35,711	| IOT058 |	Will format it to something that you
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,223	| IOT058 |	You can use
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,527	| IOT058 |	And we make it easy
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:39,807	| IOT058 |	It's interesting says almost
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:45,439	| IOT058 |	Then it's not just hpe that students it's almost like a big data play on IRT really
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:48,255	| IOT058 |	It is I mean that's that's what this is about
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:51,839	| IOT058 |	The differences that you'll want to look for in your platforms
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:53,631	| IOT058 |	There's a bunch
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:57,471	| IOT058 |	Everyone's calling it a platform in the platform is kind of like open it
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:59,263	| IOT058 |	Disguise any number of Shenzhen
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:20:59,775	| IOT058 |	Emissions
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:02,079	| IOT058 |	With many of these
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:04,127	| IOT058 |	It's mostly a
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:06,687	| IOT058 |	Send your data to our cloud
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:10,015	| IOT058 |	And we will make it something that a web
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:13,855	| IOT058 |	Like a web service will turn it into something people in the web can access
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:19,232	| IOT058 |	Or it is send your stuff like connect your product to our cloud and we handle everything
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:22,560	| IOT058 |	Termite provisioning to making programs to handling data
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:26,144	| IOT058 |	It's really important that you make the distinction you understand what you really
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:28,448	| IOT058 |	You go with
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,472	| IOT058 |	The platform providers
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:30,496	| IOT058 |	It offers that
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:36,128	| IOT058 |	An impersonal note it's interesting to me because I look at the way the 41 solar panels on a roof
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:37,408	| IOT058 |	We have a small web server
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:39,712	| IOT058 |	Hardware box that's connected to
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:43,552	| IOT058 |	All the micro inverters and all the panels that data is fed from
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,856	| IOT058 |	The panels to the web server
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:48,416	| IOT058 |	And then that information is available
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:52,512	| IOT058 |	To me in a dashboard on the web and act freely available like I've actually share the link in the past
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:55,328	| IOT058 |	But I wonder if the company that I'm using
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:56,864	| IOT058 |	An outsourced at 2
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:22:01,216	| IOT058 |	Someone liking hpe I mean obviously not HP since they just launched this but
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:02,752	| IOT058 |	We're doing it themselves
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:04,288	| IOT058 |	Most do it through AWS
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,568	| IOT058 |	Like
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:07,872	| IOT058 |	Probably 90% of the companies that aren't
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:08,640	| IOT058 |	Huge Enterprise
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:10,176	| IOT058 |	Do it through
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:11,712	| IOT058 |	Sure
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:15,296	| IOT058 |	And that makes total sense for scalability reliability and so when I'm wondering
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:16,320	| IOT058 |	Who did the actual
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:17,856	| IOT058 |	Coding for
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:21,696	| IOT058 |	Taking the data and presenting it and so was it worth it you know AWS
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:24,000	| IOT058 |	Didn't do that they probably host it
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:26,048	| IOT058 |	Yes okay so what's the name of your app
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:26,560	| IOT058 |	Maybe we can figure
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,864	| IOT058 |	Well it's Enphase energy
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:29,376	| IOT058 |	Ian
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:31,168	| IOT058 |	Phase
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:33,216	| IOT058 |	They're the ones who make them microinverters themselves
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:35,520	| IOT058 |	Which feed the data to their little
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:37,056	| IOT058 |	Enphase branded box
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:40,896	| IOT058 |	Okay well if anyone is out there
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:46,784	| IOT058 |	So many mysteries on this week's show

EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:33,536	| IOT058 |	What are the only homes that is
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:35,328	| IOT058 |	A smart or maybe smarter than mine
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:37,888	| IOT058 |	With like DIY kind of installed project
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:38,912	| IOT058 |	So
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:41,472	| IOT058 |	Yeah thank you
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:44,032	| IOT058 |	Sexy. I'm psyched about this we've been working on it
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:51,200	| IOT058 |	So let's let's have a house in Kentucky
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:53,504	| IOT058 |	I've got here about 3 years ago
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:55,552	| IOT058 |	And we hired a bunch of people
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:56,576	| IOT058 |	Launch
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:58,112	| IOT058 |	Are appliances
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:59,136	| IOT058 |	Smart home coverage
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,928	| IOT058 |	And this is before we even had the house
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,696	| IOT058 |	So
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:05,024	| IOT058 |	You before then we were testing all the stuff going around homes
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,048	| IOT058 |	Yeah
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,328	| IOT058 |	She likes the whole deal
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:09,376	| IOT058 |	Is that two years ago where
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:11,424	| IOT058 |	Wieser decided you know what we need
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:12,448	| IOT058 |	We need a real house
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:12,960	| IOT058 |	Judith bright
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:15,008	| IOT058 |	This is awesome because I've
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:16,032	| IOT058 |	Actually
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:18,336	| IOT058 |	Probably the last two years I realized
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:19,104	| IOT058 |	As
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:22,432	| IOT058 |	Connected appliances come out on the market it is impossible
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,712	| IOT058 |	To actually install
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:28,576	| IOT058 |	A washer and dryer
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:35,488	| IOT058 |	Swapping between refrigerators that's crazy so you guys are doing
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:41,376	| IOT058 |	We haven't done a lot of large appliances at the house for the reasons that you stayed for example we had said no
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:42,656	| IOT058 |	Countertops
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,424	| IOT058 |	To get in
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:44,704	| IOT058 |	The Samsung Wi-Fi ranges
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:47,264	| IOT058 |	The large Appliance
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:47,776	| IOT058 |	Testing
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:50,336	| IOT058 |	Pretty much stays out at the warehouse
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:51,360	| IOT058 |	A hole
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:52,384	| IOT058 |	Sort of climate
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:54,688	| IOT058 |	Controlled test chamber for each each category
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:58,528	| IOT058 |	Okay and why do you guys think it's so important to test these
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:25:59,808	| IOT058 |	In a house
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,088	| IOT058 |	Well
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,880	| IOT058 |	For us it's really about
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:04,160	| IOT058 |	Seeing how well
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,440	| IOT058 |	These devices work
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:07,232	| IOT058 |	Part of the Holy Ghost
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:10,304	| IOT058 |	Write me that if something says that it works with nest
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:12,608	| IOT058 |	We want to be able to see how it works with nest
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:14,656	| IOT058 |	And how well what's another product would say they work
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:17,472	| IOT058 |	I totally agree
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:19,776	| IOT058 |	Now you guys don't live in the house though
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,056	| IOT058 |	Actually lives there
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:22,592	| IOT058 |	That's right
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,616	| IOT058 |	Got it okay
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:28,480	| IOT058 |	Let's talk about what you discovered in the 10 months that you've been playing around with all this stuff
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:29,760	| IOT058 |	What are your favorite products
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,808	| IOT058 |	Call Manuel
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,088	| IOT058 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:34,112	| IOT058 |	Just meet our lives
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:34,880	| IOT058 |	Really easy
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:37,440	| IOT058 |	And it's good that it kind of
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:40,000	| IOT058 |	Matured when it bitter a really kind of
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:40,768	| IOT058 |	Brought on
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,792	| IOT058 |	A whole bunch of connected
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:45,632	| IOT058 |	Devices into its ecosystem when it did because that's right about when
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:47,680	| IOT058 |	The SmartThings Hub that we were using
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:48,192	| IOT058 |	Willie
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,240	| IOT058 |	Unfortunate
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:55,360	| IOT058 |	Okay so you like the echo on your thermostats I see that you did not go with
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:57,152	| IOT058 |	Traditional Nest you went with
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,176	| IOT058 |	My personal favorite
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:00,992	| IOT058 |	What was the thought process
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:04,064	| IOT058 |	Yet so we you know this is
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:05,856	| IOT058 |	The second one
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:06,880	| IOT058 |	Things in the house so we started out with
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:09,696	| IOT058 |	And I think it was when
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:11,744	| IOT058 |	Ecobee announce it's echoing
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:13,280	| IOT058 |	Integration
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,816	| IOT058 |	The punch that's only said
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:18,912	| IOT058 |	All right we're switching over we already were leaning towards ecobee because of the
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:20,192	| IOT058 |	Thermal sensor
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,216	| IOT058 |	They came in the Box
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:21,728	| IOT058 |	But you know
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:24,544	| IOT058 |	He said hey you know words
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:27,872	| IOT058 |	Ecobee and pulled ahead we're going to ecobee3 instead
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:29,920	| IOT058 |	Axanthic ancestor we have a 2 zone system
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:32,480	| IOT058 |	Also on the first floor we have ecobee
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:34,528	| IOT058 |	Hilltop Ford
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:35,808	| IOT058 |	Because there's some things we want
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,320	| IOT058 |	Try out there
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:39,392	| IOT058 |	And at this point with given that
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:41,952	| IOT058 |	That's why they added location-based tracking
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,720	| IOT058 |	For your phone
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:43,744	| IOT058 |	The recent update
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,024	| IOT058 |	The kind of
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:48,096	| IOT058 |	Home Depot
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:52,192	| IOT058 |	Comparable I have the same setup actually have a nest upstairs and you could be downstairs
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:54,496	| IOT058 |	And I would say
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:56,544	| IOT058 |	Cuz I don't carry the phone
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:57,824	| IOT058 |	With me
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:28:00,128	| IOT058 |	I like having a sensor in
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:02,432	| IOT058 |	It just is in that room
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:03,712	| IOT058 |	I will to say though
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:09,088	| IOT058 |	All the other kind of temperature sensing devices that I've been adding to my house
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:10,880	| IOT058 |	They also talk to the nest
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:13,440	| IOT058 |	Kind of make the ecobee sensor a bit of a
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:16,000	| IOT058 |	That's true and that's
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,280	| IOT058 |	Partly why
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:20,096	| IOT058 |	We tried that out in upstairs in the master bedroom where we in
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:22,912	| IOT058 |	Installed a I swear the nest up there their generation
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:23,936	| IOT058 |	And we have
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:24,960	| IOT058 |	Big Ass Fans
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:26,496	| IOT058 |	I just want to say
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:28,032	| IOT058 |	Haiku ceiling fan
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:29,568	| IOT058 |	And then we saved
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,848	| IOT058 |	Keen smart vent
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,640	| IOT058 |	Up there in the master bedroom and in the kids
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:35,712	| IOT058 |	Oh my gosh tell me how this works I'm loving it
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:39,040	| IOT058 |	You know we really wanted to see what it was like to have the nest
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:40,320	| IOT058 |	Haiku fan
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:43,136	| IOT058 |	And Hakeem all working in his own soda
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:44,672	| IOT058 |	Really regulate temperature in
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:46,976	| IOT058 |	A little more precisely than you got juice
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:48,000	| IOT058 |	This is one thermostat
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:48,768	| IOT058 |	Tahoe floor
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:51,840	| IOT058 |	I'd say that I would feel better reporting an actor
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:53,632	| IOT058 |	Christine that if we had someone spend the night
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:55,424	| IOT058 |	With all that said not done yet
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:57,216	| IOT058 |	But that's
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:57,984	| IOT058 |	Hopefully we'll be able to
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:28:59,520	| IOT058 |	But I
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:02,336	| IOT058 |	We go all in on that Netflix
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:08,736	| IOT058 |	Because
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:12,320	| IOT058 |	It's the optimization of algorithms that need to
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:16,928	| IOT058 |	Like once you get all these working together and I've discovered this in
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:18,464	| IOT058 |	Drinking any number of devices
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:20,256	| IOT058 |	It's nice in theory
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:26,656	| IOT058 |	Machine learning models that actually
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:29,216	| IOT058 |	Take into account all of these things
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:33,056	| IOT058 |	Maybe you'll get some of the Comfort but you won't get the Energy savings
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:36,384	| IOT058 |	Discovered in my own testing
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,688	| IOT058 |	I'm curious to see what you guys do
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:41,760	| IOT058 |	You know I really wish
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:43,808	| IOT058 |	This is one area where
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:45,856	| IOT058 |	Temperature are Appliance testing Warehouse
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:48,672	| IOT058 |	Traditional lab setup
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:50,464	| IOT058 |	It's here where we have
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:53,536	| IOT058 |	A small integrating Sphere for example to throw
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:55,328	| IOT058 |	Are LED bulbs anywhere we really do
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:57,632	| IOT058 |	You pretty rigorous color temperature testing all that stuff
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:58,912	| IOT058 |	What I really
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:00,192	| IOT058 |	Wish we could do the house
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:02,496	| IOT058 |	We haven't done is just
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:03,520	| IOT058 |	Time and cost
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:04,544	| IOT058 |	And everything else prohibitive
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:08,384	| IOT058 |	Is that really really proper lab environment there was like
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:09,152	| IOT058 |	True climbing
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:10,176	| IOT058 |	Control where everything is
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:13,248	| IOT058 |	Temperature regulated air flow regulator and all that
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:17,344	| IOT058 |	I think for that reason I don't know if I'll ever really be comfortable reporting on energy force
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:21,952	| IOT058 |	Really help climate controls but
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:23,488	| IOT058 |	Jessica produce ballpark
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,512	| IOT058 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:28,864	| IOT058 |	Your favorite light switch is the Belkin WeMo and your favorite security camera is the nest
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:31,680	| IOT058 |	And I am kind of curious
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:32,448	| IOT058 |	About
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:38,592	| IOT058 |	The WeMo because in the lights what did you like limited to only Bluetooth and Wi-Fi because I found the WeMo light switch to be
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:40,896	| IOT058 |	Not everything I hoped for in a
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:41,408	| IOT058 |	Connect a light switch
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:43,200	| IOT058 |	Driving
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:46,528	| IOT058 |	Tracker behind the WeMo switches that at work so she who shall not be named
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,552	| IOT058 |	That's why we don't duck
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:49,856	| IOT058 |	I know the history of
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:50,624	| IOT058 |	Frustration
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:51,392	| IOT058 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:54,464	| IOT058 |	Getting getting we must have set up on Wi-Fi I've experienced it
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:56,512	| IOT058 |	We've got to learn to live with it I guess
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:58,304	| IOT058 |	Yeah that was why we went
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:30:59,072	| IOT058 |	We went
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:00,352	| IOT058 |	Which ones do you like
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:02,656	| IOT058 |	So I haven't found a Wi-Fi switch I like it
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:04,704	| IOT058 |	So my switches when I in
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:05,984	| IOT058 |	I put them in
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:07,264	| IOT058 |	Which is because I've got a wink
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:09,568	| IOT058 |	Steph
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:12,384	| IOT058 |	And that talks to the echo as well so
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:15,456	| IOT058 |	I would love to find a great Wi-Fi switches
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:16,992	| IOT058 |	A really common question I get
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:21,600	| IOT058 |	But we know it's just it doesn't of the features there's a new task called The Plum
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:23,648	| IOT058 |	Which is Wi-Fi
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:25,952	| IOT058 |	I don't know if they have a skill for the
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:31,584	| IOT058 |	So
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:33,376	| IOT058 |	You guys also
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:36,448	| IOT058 |	Just do a quick run down your favorite security camera
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:40,032	| IOT058 |	Torn between
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,824	| IOT058 |	Emma Chamberlain
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,896	| IOT058 |	Your vacuum is Bonito
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:47,968	| IOT058 |	I've got a room but it doesn't have Wi-Fi
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:51,296	| IOT058 |	Can you tell me why I would want
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:56,928	| IOT058 |	It's really what it does is it
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:57,952	| IOT058 |	Brings the remote
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:00,000	| IOT058 |	That might come with your vacuum on your phone
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:01,536	| IOT058 |	That's a primary thing
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:04,608	| IOT058 |	You know you can do scheduling you can manually drive it around
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:05,888	| IOT058 |	That
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:06,400	| IOT058 |	For us
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,192	| IOT058 |	Was probably secondary
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:11,520	| IOT058 |	What we like about that whenever the Roomba is that
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,544	| IOT058 |	It's a better vacuum
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:13,056	| IOT058 |	AR testing
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:16,896	| IOT058 |	In room clean quickly
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:18,176	| IOT058 |	That was really bad
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:18,688	| IOT058 |	Driving
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:22,784	| IOT058 |	Okay so those are kind of your main
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:23,296	| IOT058 |	Products
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:25,344	| IOT058 |	Are there things that you guys
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:26,624	| IOT058 |	Tested and thought
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:30,464	| IOT058 |	Hey this is pretty cool but it's such a niche case that no one would ever want this
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:38,912	| IOT058 |	Ashley Clark Thompson hair is
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:40,192	| IOT058 |	Does one of our smart
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:40,960	| IOT058 |	Kitchen testing
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:42,240	| IOT058 |	And
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:44,032	| IOT058 |	There's a thing called the pantelligent
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:45,312	| IOT058 |	Was she loves
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:46,592	| IOT058 |	Oh yes
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:47,616	| IOT058 |	But our readers
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:49,920	| IOT058 |	And Arduino she did a Facebook live session
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,992	| IOT058 |	And people are not into that thing
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:55,296	| IOT058 |	I don't think it's the
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:57,856	| IOT058 |	If your listeners are familiar it's connected
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:00,672	| IOT058 |	Saucepan frypan essentially I had sense
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:01,952	| IOT058 |	The bottom of it has a Bluetooth
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:03,488	| IOT058 |	Receiver
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:05,280	| IOT058 |	And the handle and it can give you kind of
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:05,792	| IOT058 |	Precise
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:08,096	| IOT058 |	Instructions on as far as
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:09,632	| IOT058 |	What the heat of the pandas
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:10,912	| IOT058 |	If you put it on a
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:12,448	| IOT058 |	Stand-alone
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:16,800	| IOT058 |	Burner and plug it into a Wiimote switch it can actually control the temperature itself
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:18,080	| IOT058 |	And it's $200
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:19,616	| IOT058 |	Which I think
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:21,408	| IOT058 |	It's 199
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:24,736	| IOT058 |	Yeah there's one point of criticize
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:29,600	| IOT058 |	I don't know if you
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:30,880	| IOT058 |	Feel the same way but I'd heaven
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:32,672	| IOT058 |	Seen much
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:34,208	| IOT058 |	In the way of connecting
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:36,512	| IOT058 |	Devices that really make me excited that really sank like
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:42,656	| IOT058 |	I'm with you on this site again the one thing that I've asked for
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:43,680	| IOT058 |	A thousand times
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:44,960	| IOT058 |	What is a refrigerated crock pot
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:46,240	| IOT058 |	Because
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:49,056	| IOT058 |	And not think about it
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:53,152	| IOT058 |	I have a dream
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:55,712	| IOT058 |	Well okay
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:57,248	| IOT058 |	Meli Melo right
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:58,016	| IOT058 |	So I have
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:03,648	| IOT058 |	What day is it
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:04,928	| IOT058 |	It's not
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:10,048	| IOT058 |	Try to have an imaginary Crock-Pot
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:11,072	| IOT058 |	Concept
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:12,352	| IOT058 |	I think
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:15,680	| IOT058 |	Big promise with a connected kitchen is
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,448	| IOT058 |	The expertise
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:17,216	| IOT058 |	Second
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:19,008	| IOT058 |	Copper supplement so I really like
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:23,360	| IOT058 |	Like the concept behind intelligent I like the concept behind the June oven
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:26,176	| IOT058 |	But I don't know if people are going to really pay those prices for
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:26,688	| IOT058 |	Worcester
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:31,296	| IOT058 |	A fridge
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:33,088	| IOT058 |	It doesn't have a giant phone on the front
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:34,624	| IOT058 |	But actually has
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:36,416	| IOT058 |	A camera inside that takes
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:37,184	| IOT058 |	Pictures that says
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:41,536	| IOT058 |	But I can call up a picture of my last name
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:45,632	| IOT058 |	I should totally get milk
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,400	| IOT058 |	Annex
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:48,192	| IOT058 |	You know we have that straight drive timeout
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:51,520	| IOT058 |	The giant Samsung fridge
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,824	| IOT058 |	Guess that's what it's got the family Hub fridge
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:57,152	| IOT058 |	And there's the LG fridge that they showed off at CES where you
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:58,944	| IOT058 |	Knocked on it in the door went clear yes
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:03,040	| IOT058 |	Is that out
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,576	| IOT058 |	You know it's not my knowledge no
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:09,184	| IOT058 |	There's a whole world
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:11,488	| IOT058 |	I don't know
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:12,512	| IOT058 |	Pet stuff
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:14,816	| IOT058 |	Get connected baby stuff for I think we're going to do
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:17,120	| IOT058 |	Maggie's around right now
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:19,424	| IOT058 |	You know the Sleep Number bed thing with inter
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:22,240	| IOT058 |	Christine and I mentioned that earlier where we have my daughter spend the night
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:24,032	| IOT058 |	Yeah we can tell you
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:27,360	| IOT058 |	It's really expensive is a Sleep Number bed right now you can't even going in
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:29,152	| IOT058 |	With an extensive platform
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:31,456	| IOT058 |	They can tell you what you know basic
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:34,528	| IOT058 |	Sleeping pattern so I can play how long your kid was asleep how long
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,576	| IOT058 |	Playing around bed for whatever
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:40,672	| IOT058 |	This was a handy thing from there you can kind of gamify the bedtime routine
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:42,464	| IOT058 |	Where you can if you can get a little love
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:43,744	| IOT058 |	Yeah Rewards
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:45,536	| IOT058 |	If you lie
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:47,584	| IOT058 |	Go to bed on time you brush your teeth
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:48,352	| IOT058 |	Considered cetera
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:50,400	| IOT058 |	I think there's something there
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:51,424	| IOT058 |	But price
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:54,240	| IOT058 |	This is probably need to get a little more realistic I think the bedroom
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:56,288	| IOT058 |	Quotes about $2,000
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:36:00,640	| IOT058 |	Definitely not the most expensive but
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:01,920	| IOT058 |	Okay
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:02,688	| IOT058 |	So
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:04,480	| IOT058 |	Those are kind of some of the devices
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:04,992	| IOT058 |	End
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:09,344	| IOT058 |	What still needs work I mean we should spend a lot of time talking about interoperability
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:11,392	| IOT058 |	Siri is a huge
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:12,160	| IOT058 |	You know issue today
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:15,232	| IOT058 |	Are there other things
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:16,256	| IOT058 |	You're thinking of
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:18,048	| IOT058 |	Because we kind of cover those others to death
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:19,072	| IOT058 |	I think
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:20,864	| IOT058 |	That what I would
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:21,632	| IOT058 |	Really
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:22,656	| IOT058 |	Like to see
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:23,168	| IOT058 |	Is
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:25,216	| IOT058 |	We went with Echo
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:28,544	| IOT058 |	Largely because videos easy
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:33,664	| IOT058 |	You'll get a lot of automation with Echo as you know right now you can't it's not really designed for setting up
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,944	| IOT058 |	Seems our kind of
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:36,992	| IOT058 |	Kalmar Nation type stuff and
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:39,296	| IOT058 |	Anyway that made our lives easier but
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:41,600	| IOT058 |	What is really good at is
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:42,368	| IOT058 |	Multi-user
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:43,904	| IOT058 |	Better for worse
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:47,488	| IOT058 |	But you know anybody can walk in the room
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:49,024	| IOT058 |	With initial command
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:50,048	| IOT058 |	And it will respond
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:52,352	| IOT058 |	Not all the other systems
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,376	| IOT058 |	You got very well
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:57,472	| IOT058 |	So it's not a very Democratic set up in the house to have
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:59,008	| IOT058 |	SmartThings or
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:01,824	| IOT058 |	Wink I think of running everything you know
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:03,616	| IOT058 |	This one person is going to end up being the
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:06,176	| IOT058 |	The main control point and then everything else to run
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:08,224	| IOT058 |	Jordan Peterson our experience
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:09,760	| IOT058 |	I would love to see that
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:11,296	| IOT058 |	Work a little better
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:12,064	| IOT058 |	Without having
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:12,832	| IOT058 |	Lindsay Ellis
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:13,856	| IOT058 |	Guest account
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:16,416	| IOT058 |	Another crazy longest log into the NFL
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:17,952	| IOT058 |	Because it really is
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:18,464	| IOT058 |	Precinct
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:20,512	| IOT058 |	That's great what about
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:22,560	| IOT058 |	Getting things online just the ease-of-use
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:26,400	| IOT058 |	I mean I still feel like this isn't ready for the mainstream
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:28,704	| IOT058 |	The echo brings a Little Closer
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:32,032	| IOT058 |	Partly for reasons you said but also because there's no
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:32,800	| IOT058 |	Recipes
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:35,616	| IOT058 |	Scenes that you said it's it's pretty easy
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:37,920	| IOT058 |	Do you think this is at the mainstream yet
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:38,944	| IOT058 |	Are still early adopter
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:41,248	| IOT058 |	It's so early.
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:42,016	| IOT058 |	Yeah
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:47,136	| IOT058 |	Yeah I don't know if you agree but I sent to me it's it's yes you can have the pain of getting things online
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:53,792	| IOT058 |	I think an extent what kind of used to that at this point right in the USA with a lot of things around the house
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:58,656	| IOT058 |	Sign up for grocery put your email in there put a password in there would do that with a PlayStation
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:01,984	| IOT058 |	We do that with Nest Thermostat you know looks different sing with you
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:03,776	| IOT058 |	What's a lifesaver lock whatever
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:06,848	| IOT058 |	Depending on how it gets online but
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:09,152	| IOT058 |	The basics of that I don't think you're too bad I think
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:10,176	| IOT058 |	Where
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:14,016	| IOT058 |	The early adopter thing comes in is just a share my risk
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:15,040	| IOT058 |	Involved in
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:17,344	| IOT058 |	Buying into the smart home right now
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:18,112	| IOT058 |	You know
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:19,392	| IOT058 |	You got the revolve
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:20,160	| IOT058 |	Beds
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:21,952	| IOT058 |	Staples connect looks like it's almost dead
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:26,560	| IOT058 |	Wake was looking taxi there although I guess it's back on now or has them back on
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:29,632	| IOT058 |	Forgot sex
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:31,168	| IOT058 |	The standard-bearer
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:33,984	| IOT058 |	If I was going to try to out to the whole home
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:37,056	| IOT058 |	And that's a whole lot of money doing that all that volatility
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:38,848	| IOT058 |	Would really give me a lot
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:41,920	| IOT058 |	Got it so then what's the hope for the smartphone
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:42,944	| IOT058 |	There's been
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:47,808	| IOT058 |	How do you think this is going to
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:48,576	| IOT058 |	Play outside
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:49,344	| IOT058 |	Annies
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:51,136	| IOT058 |	Your guess is as good as mine
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:51,904	| IOT058 |	Suppose
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:52,928	| IOT058 |	Ever murdered anybody
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:56,512	| IOT058 |	You know I don't know that I would have predicted a lot of drama around nest
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:57,792	| IOT058 |	A year ago
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:58,560	| IOT058 |	But here we are
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:38:59,328	| IOT058 |	You know I think
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:01,632	| IOT058 |	There's a lot of enthusiasm around Echo
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:02,144	| IOT058 |	And that's the
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:03,936	| IOT058 |	I'm still
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:05,472	| IOT058 |	Fingers crossed that
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:07,776	| IOT058 |	It will eventually emerge as
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:09,824	| IOT058 |	Apply from the people are excited about
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:12,896	| IOT058 |	Doing
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:15,200	| IOT058 |	I'll take a side bed
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:16,224	| IOT058 |	Not how well
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:19,552	| IOT058 |	I'm very down on
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:21,856	| IOT058 |	I feel like apple bit off more than
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:27,488	| IOT058 |	And it's kind of trying to figure out how to think about the Smart Home
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:28,256	| IOT058 |	Because it's
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:29,280	| IOT058 |	It's base assumptions
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:31,840	| IOT058 |	It's not wrong just
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:33,120	| IOT058 |	They were too narrow is probably
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:34,912	| IOT058 |	The way to think about it I think
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:39,264	| IOT058 |	The most successful companies are going to be those with kind of an open and flexible mindset
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:41,312	| IOT058 |	And I think the way Apple
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:44,896	| IOT058 |	Controls things and that's a huge advantage to its user base
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:46,432	| IOT058 |	What kind of
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:47,456	| IOT058 |	Haunted in the smartphone
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:48,736	| IOT058 |	That's my take
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:52,576	| IOT058 |	That's why I'm willing to be wrong because I would love for
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:53,856	| IOT058 |	There to be a beautiful
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:56,160	| IOT058 |	Interface for the smart home I just don't
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:57,696	| IOT058 |	Think we're going to see it
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:39:58,976	| IOT058 |	From Apple
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:00,256	| IOT058 |	At least not for a really low
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:02,560	| IOT058 |	I totally agree with
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:04,864	| IOT058 |	Open versus closed
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:06,656	| IOT058 |	Issues going on there that you mentioned
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:07,936	| IOT058 |	And I will be
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:11,008	| IOT058 |	Surprised
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:12,544	| IOT058 |	I really like this
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:13,824	| IOT058 |	Security story they have to tell
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:15,872	| IOT058 |	As far as
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:17,408	| IOT058 |	Certifying every devices
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:19,712	| IOT058 |	Comes in both on the hardware and software level
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:22,016	| IOT058 |	Fingers crossed there
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:24,832	| IOT058 |	Does if it does get get any traction I think it's
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:26,368	| IOT058 |	I'm hopeful anyway.
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:28,416	| IOT058 |	It lives up to its
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:30,976	| IOT058 |	Okay
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:32,256	| IOT058 |	Thank you so
