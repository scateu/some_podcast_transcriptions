EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:29,504	| IOT126 |	An intense
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:30,016	| IOT126 |	Topic that
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,808	| IOT126 |	People have very strong
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:32,320	| IOT126 |	My feelings about
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,600	| IOT126 |	It is not
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:34,624	| IOT126 |	Politics
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:37,184	| IOT126 |	Sonos is new
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:40,512	| IOT126 |	Terms of service in this is part of an overall trend that we
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,048	| IOT126 |	A lot actually
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:45,120	| IOT126 |	Are we buying Hardware are we buying
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:46,144	| IOT126 |	Services for
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,680	| IOT126 |	We pick up its neck
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:52,544	| IOT126 |	Kevin you want to break down 10 of the Sonos drama for us
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:54,848	| IOT126 |	Yeah
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:55,872	| IOT126 |	And I do not have a
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,664	| IOT126 |	As soon as I know you do something curious separate
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,712	| IOT126 |	Now
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,992	| IOT126 |	Alright then overachiever
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:03,040	| IOT126 |	So I am not
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,320	| IOT126 |	Affected by this
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:10,464	| IOT126 |	Basically Sonos has said that users must accept the new privacy policy
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:15,072	| IOT126 |	Weather devices the Sonos audio devices May cease to function
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,864	| IOT126 |	They're not letting you up
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:19,680	| IOT126 |	Out of their new privacy policy
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:23,264	| IOT126 |	And that's not good I mean it's pretty much a
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:25,568	| IOT126 |	All or none situation the way things
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,848	| IOT126 |	Are looking right now
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:31,200	| IOT126 |	I am very curious what you think about this because you have a
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:33,760	| IOT126 |	And I have some just hide
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,832	| IOT126 |	What is your feeling as a Sonos customer
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,112	| IOT126 |	So
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:38,880	| IOT126 |	I was so disgust
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:40,672	| IOT126 |	I
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:43,488	| IOT126 |	Understandably miffed
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,280	| IOT126 |	At the idea that might
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,304	| IOT126 |	Devices
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,072	| IOT126 |	That I bought
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:49,376	| IOT126 |	I bought my first Sonos back
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,192	| IOT126 |	It was like
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:52,704	| IOT126 |	Yeah it was
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:54,240	| IOT126 |	It was a weird mm
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:57,824	| IOT126 |	Baby 2009 my first one
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:01,920	| IOT126 |	And then when we moved I spend another $2,000 by
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:06,016	| IOT126 |	I can't remember the part names but little connectors Ono's things for my
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:08,064	| IOT126 |	In-ceiling speakers in
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:08,576	| IOT126 |	That wasn't
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,368	| IOT126 |	12 Sol
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:13,184	| IOT126 |	As an existing Sonos customer I'm probably going to
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:13,952	| IOT126 |	Well I am going to
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:17,280	| IOT126 |	Except these and I would accept it almost blindly just be
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,303	| IOT126 |	Because I want
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:18,815	| IOT126 |	Dysfunctional
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:20,351	| IOT126 |	Play Lose My Soul
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:22,655	| IOT126 |	But
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,423	| IOT126 |	For people who are
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,703	| IOT126 |	Upset
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,751	| IOT126 |	I understand they're upset in this
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:27,775	| IOT126 |	Because
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,567	| IOT126 |	Buying something
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,359	| IOT126 |	Even if you just bought it last year
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:34,175	| IOT126 |	One of the questions I have is how long before they
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:35,199	| IOT126 |	Degrade the server
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:35,967	| IOT126 |	Best rate
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:37,759	| IOT126 |	2 years
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,039	| IOT126 |	Terrible if it's
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:39,807	| IOT126 |	10 years
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,087	| IOT126 |	I feel like
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:45,951	| IOT126 |	Maybe a bit more reasonable although this is why I think
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,231	| IOT126 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:49,023	| IOT126 |	Expiry date basically
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:52,095	| IOT126 |	Appoint over which you would not support the software because
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:53,887	| IOT126 |	Front about this kind of thing
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:57,215	| IOT126 |	From Sonos is perspective I understand why they're doing
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:02,591	| IOT126 |	If they're going to start offering Integrations with other devices
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:04,383	| IOT126 |	And if they're going to
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,943	| IOT126 |	Do these Services All In
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:09,247	| IOT126 |	They're going to have to have a measure of control
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,271	| IOT126 |	Over how they purr
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,575	| IOT126 |	Pro-Med customer relations
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:16,415	| IOT126 |	Soto says you don't have to send all of your data
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:18,207	| IOT126 |	But you will have to send what
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:18,975	| IOT126 |	Functional
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:24,863	| IOT126 |	Email address IP addresses account login information
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:27,935	| IOT126 |	As well as device date information about Wi-Fi internet
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:30,239	| IOT126 |	Other Hardware
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,775	| IOT126 |	Information
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,543	| IOT126 |	And
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:35,103	| IOT126 |	Location is in there as well
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:35,615	| IOT126 |	Okay
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,175	| IOT126 |	You can't opt out of it
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:40,735	| IOT126 |	You can't opt out of the functional data
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:41,247	| IOT126 |	Right
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,551	| IOT126 |	Privacy people are
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,575	| IOT126 |	Understandably
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,879	| IOT126 |	And I get it
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:47,903	| IOT126 |	But I also see
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,951	| IOT126 |	Why sodas wants
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:52,255	| IOT126 |	If your Sonos isn't
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,279	| IOT126 |	Performing well
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:54,815	| IOT126 |	With another device
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:55,839	| IOT126 |	It needs to be able to
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,399	| IOT126 |	Now the question
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,679	| IOT126 |	Personas dispersed
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:05,055	| IOT126 |	Is if no one wants to add these additional features and just wants to use their
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,079	| IOT126 |	Old Sonos has
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,103	| IOT126 |	Until
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,383	| IOT126 |	Brake switch
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,247	| IOT126 |	How to play five
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:15,551	| IOT126 |	Almost eight years and it's
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,599	| IOT126 |	Looks great
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,623	| IOT126 |	Works fine but
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,415	| IOT126 |	For Sonos sub
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,951	| IOT126 |	Sporting those devices
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:28,863	| IOT126 |	Plus another set of software for the new gradle with other connected devices system
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:31,423	| IOT126 |	Good become cost-prohibitive really quickly
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,471	| IOT126 |	So I think that
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:34,495	| IOT126 |	The challenge
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:36,543	| IOT126 |	And I would agree that
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:37,823	| IOT126 |	What song is this
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,127	| IOT126 |	Trying to do at least partially is
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:46,015	| IOT126 |	To lack of better term control the experience or offer a guaranteed minimum level of positive
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:50,623	| IOT126 |	They need to have some control over the devices to make sure
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:52,415	| IOT126 |	Everything's working the way it should
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,951	| IOT126 |	So that its customers are happy
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,999	| IOT126 |	Flipside is
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:58,303	| IOT126 |	Support
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:01,631	| IOT126 |	I use the June oven as an example you and I both purchased one
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:03,935	| IOT126 |	I had some problems with my first one
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,983	| IOT126 |	And when I reach out to support they said okay
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,519	| IOT126 |	Will you give us
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:10,847	| IOT126 |	You're okay to go into the logs of your device
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,871	| IOT126 |	So we can troubleshoot it
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:13,407	| IOT126 |	Absolutely I said
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:15,711	| IOT126 |	They normally would not be looking at that
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:18,015	| IOT126 |	So it's a way to do this on a case
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:19,551	| IOT126 |	Space spaces from support standpoint
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:22,111	| IOT126 |	Yes but they were collect
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:22,623	| IOT126 |	Data
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:28,767	| IOT126 |	So
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,047	| IOT126 |	Do all these they're just saying
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,583	| IOT126 |	Hey we used to not collect
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:32,863	| IOT126 |	This data and now we have to
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:34,911	| IOT126 |	Now we want to
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:37,983	| IOT126 |	I would say there's a couple things they could do he
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:40,543	| IOT126 |	The closest example I can think of
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:43,103	| IOT126 |	What is Google when it bought revolve
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:43,871	| IOT126 |	Call Cyn
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:46,431	| IOT126 |	This revolver was a smart home hub that Google bought
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:47,967	| IOT126 |	Mostly for the engineering
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:52,063	| IOT126 |	Revolve worked on a completely different set up the nest
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,367	| IOT126 |	Which is Google's other Hardware
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:54,879	| IOT126 |	Platform
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:55,903	| IOT126 |	Thing at the time
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,951	| IOT126 |	Google shut revolved
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:02,815	| IOT126 |	It just didn't make sense to operate those two things and have the move them over
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,863	| IOT126 |	Have those soccer teams basic
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,143	| IOT126 |	And so
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:12,031	| IOT126 |	When they shut it down they did so very poorly they were more than 10,000 customers
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,663	| IOT126 |	People freaked out
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,711	| IOT126 |	And as a result Google said okay
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:20,991	| IOT126 |	Will do
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,783	| IOT126 |	So they did
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:25,855	| IOT126 |	Refunds I don't know if they were hold a partial refunds
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,367	| IOT126 |	For this device
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:28,159	| IOT126 |	Sonos has a
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,183	| IOT126 |	Heart problems
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,719	| IOT126 |	Because they have way more devices
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,023	| IOT126 |	A full refund
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:37,119	| IOT126 |	Do a partial refund
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:40,191	| IOT126 |	Coupon they could do something for the customers
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:40,959	| IOT126 |	Don't
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,471	| IOT126 |	What
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:42,751	| IOT126 |	Their sister
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,799	| IOT126 |	And they should
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,311	| IOT126 |	Also
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,871	| IOT126 |	Not say that it will cease to work
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:50,431	| IOT126 |	In some nebulous future although I understand why that's
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,455	| IOT126 |	EOS
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,223	| IOT126 |	Are privacy policies
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:55,039	| IOT126 |	But they should actually come up with a plan
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:57,343	| IOT126 |	Say something like hey your devices
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:57,855	| IOT126 |	Spell failing
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,415	| IOT126 |	We pledge to
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,439	| IOT126 |	Support these devices
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:04,511	| IOT126 |	Till this time frame and it should be
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,023	| IOT126 |	Reasonable time
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,815	| IOT126 |	It should be
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:09,887	| IOT126 |	These devices in this service as you
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,655	| IOT126 |	No
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:11,935	| IOT126 |	Evolve
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,471	| IOT126 |	Pretty quickly
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:15,263	| IOT126 |	New hardware features
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:17,823	| IOT126 |	New services and so on anycast 2.4
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:19,359	| IOT126 |	Carpenters Tipping Point
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:22,431	| IOT126 |	Hey I just got a really old one of our products
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:27,807	| IOT126 |	We're just we just can't support you anymore because we've always you Advanced features in the newer products and so on so forth so
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:30,623	| IOT126 |	That's a little concerning me but that's the way this industry is right now
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:35,487	| IOT126 |	Well it would function they would have to pledge to keep a functional version
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:36,511	| IOT126 |	Of what they offered
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:37,535	| IOT126 |	Today on those device
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:40,863	| IOT126 |	I don't think that's crazy although with like
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,679	| IOT126 |	Eventually
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:45,727	| IOT126 |	Sonos works on your wi-fi system
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:46,751	| IOT126 |	But it also has appropriate
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:47,263	| IOT126 |	Network
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:52,127	| IOT126 |	And I don't know but if you could support that for an additional 10 years beyond your
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,919	| IOT126 |	I think that would actually
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,943	| IOT126 |	It even say that
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:59,039	| IOT126 |	I think that would go a long way to curbing some of this out
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,855	| IOT126 |	So that's just the sort of stuff
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,903	| IOT126 |	Another challenge
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:04,927	| IOT126 |	Experiencing right now
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:05,695	| IOT126 |	How is this
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:07,487	| IOT126 |	Oh my God what am I
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:11,583	| IOT126 |	We are still working that out
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,631	| IOT126 |	And there are not a lot of Protections in
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:15,935	| IOT126 |	Place for consumers as this happen
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:18,495	| IOT126 |	And Kevin and I talked about this
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:19,519	| IOT126 |	Ear when you buy a Kinect
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:23,359	| IOT126 |	It does behoove you to read the terms
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:26,175	| IOT126 |	In conditions that terms of service to privacy policy
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,479	| IOT126 |	Pretension
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:30,527	| IOT126 |	And not every company has that
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:32,319	| IOT126 |	I will call again
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,599	| IOT126 |	And for some sort of standard
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,647	| IOT126 |	How
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,927	| IOT126 |	We communicate
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,719	| IOT126 |	Data practices
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,231	| IOT126 |	To consume
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:41,535	| IOT126 |	In every device should come with a label
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:42,047	| IOT126 |	That says
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:44,863	| IOT126 |	In plain English we followed you
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,631	| IOT126 |	Practices
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:48,191	| IOT126 |	Right maybe something as simple as a Good Housekeeping seal of a
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,215	| IOT126 |	Although you can buy
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,847	| IOT126 |	We are but something something before
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,895	| IOT126 |	A consumer makes a purchase
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,919	| IOT126 |	They need to understand
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:59,711	| IOT126 |	For they make the purchase of my penny
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,479	| IOT126 |	Right
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:02,015	| IOT126 |	Because once you've made the purchase
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:04,063	| IOT126 |	You opted with
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:07,647	| IOT126 |	It's clicking on this thing and then you're like
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:09,951	| IOT126 |	Rap I've been selling my
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:12,255	| IOT126 |	My grocery list every week
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:13,535	| IOT126 |	That sucks
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,375	| IOT126 |	That's what
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,399	| IOT126 |	And then to
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:20,959	| IOT126 |	Is I think we really need some legal protections
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,799	| IOT126 |	Probably a few class action lawsuits to settle this
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:27,103	| IOT126 |	So in other news on this front
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:28,639	| IOT126 |	Anti-consumer kind of
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:30,175	| IOT126 |	Device Services challenge
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:34,271	| IOT126 |	The second court of appeals for the southern district of New York
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:37,599	| IOT126 |	Actually overturned a lower Court's decision
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:39,391	| IOT126 |	About Uber
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:40,415	| IOT126 |	And it's terms of sir
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,463	| IOT126 |	Basically a complaint
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,231	| IOT126 |	Was made
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:43,999	| IOT126 |	That
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:46,047	| IOT126 |	Uber's terms of service should be valid
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:47,327	| IOT126 |	Because you get it on your phone screen
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,631	| IOT126 |	Like I need a ride okay
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,399	| IOT126 |	Click yes
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,167	| IOT126 |	And you don't read it
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,703	| IOT126 |	And basically the court said
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,239	| IOT126 |	You know what you have
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,007	| IOT126 |	How to read those so
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,543	| IOT126 |	It said that
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,847	| IOT126 |	The arbitration clauses
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:01,407	| IOT126 |	Uber's terms of service
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,687	| IOT126 |	We're actually fine
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,711	| IOT126 |	They were legal in
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,735	| IOT126 |	This person
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,015	| IOT126 |	Click through to it
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:07,039	| IOT126 |	And said yes
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,831	| IOT126 |	Search two things that are bad
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,855	| IOT126 |	About this one
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:10,879	| IOT126 |	Terms of service
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,647	| IOT126 |	Terrible
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:12,671	| IOT126 |	They can take
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:13,951	| IOT126 |	Literally
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:15,231	| IOT126 |	Over an hour.
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:18,815	| IOT126 |	Like I will be to turn the service
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:20,607	| IOT126 |	Because legal jargon
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,191	| IOT126 |	By forcing
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:28,543	| IOT126 |	Arbitration arbitration clauses that are in these terms of sir
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:32,383	| IOT126 |	The court has basically said
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,943	| IOT126 |	All of the litigation or
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:39,039	| IOT126 |	Maturity is a litigation that we're going to have around the Internet of Things
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:41,855	| IOT126 |	It's going to happen behind closed doors
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,647	| IOT126 |	And that's terrifying
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,951	| IOT126 |	Yeah and any
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:47,743	| IOT126 |	For one thing you may have
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:51,327	| IOT126 |	Similar situations arbitrated differently so you'll have different outcomes
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:55,935	| IOT126 |	Secondly as you said behind closed doors we don't know we as consumers don't know
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,471	| IOT126 |	What's really being
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,239	| IOT126 |	Disgust
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:13:00,287	| IOT126 |	Decided and so on and
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,311	| IOT126 |	These are products
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:04,127	| IOT126 |	And services that millions of people use so
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:04,895	| IOT126 |	We need to know this
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:06,943	| IOT126 |	So
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,735	| IOT126 |	Sonos perspective
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,039	| IOT126 |	It's someone's like a su about this I think this
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,831	| IOT126 |	It's a sucky that they're breaking my device
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:17,183	| IOT126 |	If they had a terms of service originally that says hey you're going to arbitration
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,207	| IOT126 |	That could happen
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:19,231	| IOT126 |	Replicas
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,255	| IOT126 |	Customer support
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:25,119	| IOT126 |	Waive the right to sue the company as a result of agreeing to the terms of service if they have arbitration clauses in there
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,399	| IOT126 |	So
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:27,679	| IOT126 |	What are we saying to you
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,703	| IOT126 |	Find connected Hardware
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,495	| IOT126 |	You should read the terms of service
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:32,799	| IOT126 |	And
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,079	| IOT126 |	I'm also saying that we
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:37,151	| IOT126 |	Probably need to come up with more consumer-friendly
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:39,455	| IOT126 |	Explain privacy
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:41,503	| IOT126 |	Explain data retention policy
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,783	| IOT126 |	Also
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:45,343	| IOT126 |	Understand that there's a reason companies are
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,879	| IOT126 |	Selecting some of this data
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:50,463	| IOT126 |	If a company wants to change the terms of service on it
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:51,487	| IOT126 |	An existing device
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:52,511	| IOT126 |	I actually think that's
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,327	| IOT126 |	Because I get why they're doing it
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:57,631	| IOT126 |	If you're going to break some
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:03,007	| IOT126 |	You know it's funny because
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,287	| IOT126 |	A lot of this
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:08,127	| IOT126 |	Has happened in the past and it wasn't really highlighted people didn't realize
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:09,407	| IOT126 |	The computer world
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,431	| IOT126 |	If you're on Windows
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:16,831	| IOT126 |	There's a lot of telemetry data captured by these
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,855	| IOT126 |	Computers and devices
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,391	| IOT126 |	That's not new
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,415	| IOT126 |	That's actually
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,439	| IOT126 |	Happened four years
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:25,023	| IOT126 |	And there's a reason for an estimate the products better and see
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:28,863	| IOT126 |	Maybe people are clicking a start button windows
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:31,679	| IOT126 |	Don't need to because they have what they want is already
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:34,239	| IOT126 |	Shown their you know so that tells Microsoft
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:37,055	| IOT126 |	Tweak rui and saucer with make it better
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:42,175	| IOT126 |	It's a little different I think with these very personal type devices though
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:43,967	| IOT126 |	I meant I think that's why it's getting more attention now
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:45,503	| IOT126 |	Agreed
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:46,527	| IOT126 |	Okay

EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,743	| IOT126 |	Compete with
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:35,071	| IOT126 |	Either the Amazon Echo dot or possibly
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:40,191	| IOT126 |	Oh okay well there's a homepod

EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:51,455	| IOT126 |	Right and I I don't I don't think it's a true
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:55,295	| IOT126 |	Apples to Apples comparison to punto because the homepod
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:17:02,719	| IOT126 |	I believe is going to debut at $349 where is a smaller Google home would be more like an
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,999	| IOT126 |	Can Echo dot work
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:06,047	| IOT126 |	Where are you feed we talked about last week
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,583	| IOT126 |	And
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,375	| IOT126 |	Should I hope cost $50 or less
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:10,399	| IOT126 |	I would have
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:11,935	| IOT126 |	Show Kevin
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:16,543	| IOT126 |	You doing some research here whatever happened to the Nvidia spot what is the
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:20,127	| IOT126 |	What a great Segway because I just talked about
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,919	| IOT126 |	Home assistance for $50 or less
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:25,247	| IOT126 |	I don't know if folks remember but back at CES in
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:27,039	| IOT126 |	January Nvidia
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:32,415	| IOT126 |	Debuted its newest version of the Nvidia Shield TV which is an Android TV set-top box
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:33,695	| IOT126 |	And you haven't
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:36,255	| IOT126 |	I do I bought one and I use it all the time
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,023	| IOT126 |	Fantastic
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:41,887	| IOT126 |	Sky 4K support for streaming HDR support
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,911	| IOT126 |	Android

EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,799	| IOT126 |	A voice remote
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:51,359	| IOT126 |	My TV my game is everything through it
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:55,967	| IOT126 |	Part of the reason I bought it was because the day they debuted this
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:58,015	| IOT126 |	Sexy as they also said coming soon
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:00,319	| IOT126 |	Will be our Nvidia spot
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,087	| IOT126 |	Which is a
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,879	| IOT126 |	$50
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:04,415	| IOT126 |	Little microphone
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:09,791	| IOT126 |	That you plug in I believe to an outlet and you buy multiple inputs
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:13,887	| IOT126 |	And basically turn your whole house into a giant microphone
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,935	| IOT126 |	Nile Clinic do that my whole house but I thought
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:20,031	| IOT126 |	I can put this in a couple rooms that way I don't need to be
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:21,823	| IOT126 |	You're my one single Google home
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,615	| IOT126 |	Get information song
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:25,663	| IOT126 |	They said
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:30,527	| IOT126 |	Coming in months and months and months are past now because we're now into she's almost September
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:33,599	| IOT126 |	I don't know what's happened to this it still
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:37,183	| IOT126 |	On the website the website you can still cook to notify me
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:42,047	| IOT126 |	I just think it's almost a missed opportunity each day goes by in this video is not available
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:43,583	| IOT126 |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,119	| IOT126 |	So you don't actually know
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:47,935	| IOT126 |	I just saying
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:50,495	| IOT126 |	If you find this service
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:52,799	| IOT126 |	Okay
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:55,871	| IOT126 |	Tucson news
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:19:00,735	| IOT126 |	Speculation is that AT&T Digital Life Division that is there connected
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:03,039	| IOT126 |	Home automation and security offering
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,063	| IOT126 |	Is for sale
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:07,903	| IOT126 |	AT&T Apple back on this couple years ago Verizon's actually

EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,975	| IOT126 |	Meanwhile
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:11,743	| IOT126 |	In the ISP world
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:13,023	| IOT126 |	Comcast
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:14,559	| IOT126 |	Des Moines
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:16,863	| IOT126 |	It makes sense
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,911	| IOT126 |	AT&T separately
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,215	| IOT126 |	So we'll see
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,751	| IOT126 |	Who might buy it
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:23,263	| IOT126 |	Gosh
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:25,823	| IOT126 |	Companies
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:26,847	| IOT126 |	We talked about 1
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:29,151	| IOT126 |	Couple weeks ago called perdia that is
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:30,687	| IOT126 |	Offering the back
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:31,455	| IOT126 |	Software
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,223	| IOT126 |	For this type of
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:33,759	| IOT126 |	Service
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:35,807	| IOT126 |	I don't think they would want
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:37,855	| IOT126 |	Actually manage the footprints oh my
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:38,879	| IOT126 |	I'm just someone like ATT
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:41,951	| IOT126 |	Which are also really bacon homeschool
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:46,047	| IOT126 |	That makes sense for purchase and interesting
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:46,815	| IOT126 |	Glen
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,583	| IOT126 |	Blurry
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,863	| IOT126 |	From AT&T
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:49,631	| IOT126 |	He is
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:51,167	| IOT126 |	Stepping down
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:55,775	| IOT126 |	Yes the president CEO of AT&T Mobility operations I believe that
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,823	| IOT126 |	Blake suit next month or two
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:04,479	| IOT126 |	What would I find super interesting he says his house has a hundred and sixty-five connected devices
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:07,039	| IOT126 |	So I'm curious who does by this because
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:09,599	| IOT126 |	I'm sure that his all-round AT&T Digital Life
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,367	| IOT126 |	165
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:11,391	| IOT126 |	Cheese
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,951	| IOT126 |	Combined
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:15,999	| IOT126 |	Although it may not be more than Charlie King
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:18,815	| IOT126 |	Tesla
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:25,727	| IOT126 |	Hot robots
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:31,103	| IOT126 |	I love the now robot
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,407	| IOT126 |	It is 6
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:33,919	| IOT126 |	Good thing
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:39,551	| IOT126 |	No amount of money can keep you safe
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:41,343	| IOT126 |	Basically
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,135	| IOT126 |	What they did
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:47,743	| IOT126 |	Basically control the arm of a collaborative multi-jointed
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:48,511	| IOT126 |	Robot
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:51,071	| IOT126 |	These robots can extend as far as
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,095	| IOT126 |	Lift up to 22
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:54,143	| IOT126 |	2 lb industrial setting
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,703	| IOT126 |	Is airsoft
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:58,239	| IOT126 |	Caesars
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:01,567	| IOT126 |	These robots that use what's called a buffer overflow attack
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:04,639	| IOT126 |	And that's basically so you send all kinds of data until the
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:06,175	| IOT126 |	Did Isis like
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,455	| IOT126 |	And
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:09,503	| IOT126 |	Then they overwrote the safety file
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:12,831	| IOT126 |	And so then you could make it they could control.

EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:19,232	| IOT126 |	That is a problem
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:24,096	| IOT126 |	These are the robots that use in the game soccer robotics soccer games on TV ever watch those
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:24,864	| IOT126 |	Music
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,376	| IOT126 |	I have no
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:29,984	| IOT126 |	Control Alexa remotely and make my team win
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:31,776	| IOT126 |	What if someone had a hacker
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,104	| IOT126 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,640	| IOT126 |	You want to know more about the
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:40,224	| IOT126 |	It's pretty creepy and videos
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,808	| IOT126 |	In the show
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:46,624	| IOT126 |	Project this weekend
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:48,416	| IOT126 |	I don't want to tell you about it this week I'm going to tell you about it
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:50,464	| IOT126 |	Going to tell you about it
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:52,512	| IOT126 |	Because we're almost out of time but first
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:54,048	| IOT126 |	I want to answer
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:54,816	| IOT126 |	A reader question
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:58,144	| IOT126 |	And
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:59,168	| IOT126 |	Some of you may have this problem
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:02,240	| IOT126 |	So it's a question
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,776	| IOT126 |	This guy has for security camera
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:05,056	| IOT126 |	This question is
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:05,824	| IOT126 |	Dave
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,592	| IOT126 |	Upstate New York
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,616	| IOT126 |	Hello Dave
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:09,664	| IOT126 |	He has for security cameras installed
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:12,480	| IOT126 |	And they're all power over ethernet
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:15,808	| IOT126 |	Are HD cameras three of them having to be pause cams in one or trend
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:17,344	| IOT126 |	He's
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:20,672	| IOT126 |	Tie them all together using software called I spy which is a
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,952	| IOT126 |	Open source software
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:23,488	| IOT126 |	To make them all run together
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,256	| IOT126 |	It's on Eazy-E
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,816	| IOT126 |	But he really wants a unifying platform
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:28,864	| IOT126 |	Form for security and iot devices
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:32,192	| IOT126 |	And so he's got the hard wire traditional alarm system
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:35,776	| IOT126 |	He's got Google home Google Wi-Fi he's got SmartThings
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:36,544	| IOT126 |	She's got cameras
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:38,080	| IOT126 |	State wants to integrate
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:40,640	| IOT126 |	And he wants this unifying popcorn
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:45,504	| IOT126 |	So he's thinking he might use a Raspberry Pi to create a web server so he doesn't
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:47,040	| IOT126 |	Computer all the time
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,576	| IOT126 |	Yay
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,368	| IOT126 |	But she's wondering if there's another
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:57,280	| IOT126 |	It sounds like it really that the sticking point here is the cameras themselves getting
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:23:00,096	| IOT126 |	Using camera things to trigger
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,888	| IOT126 |	Kemmerer events to trigger automation
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,424	| IOT126 |	If I'm understanding it
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:04,448	| IOT126 |	That's my boy
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:07,520	| IOT126 |	It's a little Leah this is what
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:11,104	| IOT126 |	We're going to recommend Blue Iris
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:15,456	| IOT126 |	Softer and I know there are issues with blue iris but people have loved it in the past
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:17,504	| IOT126 |	A lot of Peter questions actually it
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:22,880	| IOT126 |	And blue iris has an integration with the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:23,392	| IOT126 |	Google
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,184	| IOT126 |	Now
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:26,976	| IOT126 |	The Amazon Echo integration
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:29,536	| IOT126 |	Is actually an official Blue Iris skill
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:30,304	| IOT126 |	And so
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:32,352	| IOT126 |	The link to how this works
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:32,864	| IOT126 |	Accurately
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,400	| IOT126 |	So you can do that day
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:38,240	| IOT126 |	There's also other services that will tie together
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:41,056	| IOT126 |	Blue Iris with Google home
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,104	| IOT126 |	Called Dash Runner
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:45,408	| IOT126 |	That's her voice commands for both
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:50,272	| IOT126 |	It will it will I use blue iris
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:56,160	| IOT126 |	A couple years ago with the couple of Ip webcams but at that point I didn't know how that automated system here
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:24:01,280	| IOT126 |	The only thing I could do is actually a kind of automated that it's like send a tweet
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,328	| IOT126 |	Every hour of what was outside my window just for
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:05,632	| IOT126 |	Profundus I was hacking kicking things around
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:06,912	| IOT126 |	But there may be
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:12,032	| IOT126 |	Some scripting that you can do with it might even be some ways to tie things together with
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,312	| IOT126 |	Honest-1
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:18,688	| IOT126 |	Well so I also found a blue iris Fusion software this is on the SmartThings platform
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:23,040	| IOT126 |	So if you search for Blue Iris on SmartThings you're going to find
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:26,368	| IOT126 |	Actually says it ties everything together
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:30,208	| IOT126 |	It's going to be a little complicated but
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:32,512	| IOT126 |	I think they gave you were up to it since you were going to build your own
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:33,792	| IOT126 |	Using the pie in
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,072	| IOT126 |	All this yourself
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:37,632	| IOT126 |	Set rich with IP camera this is a challenge
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,400	| IOT126 |	If you go with
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,424	| IOT126 |	Say I nest
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:45,056	| IOT126 |	Or another similar type device that is more of a service-based things cuz IP cameras too.
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:47,360	| IOT126 |	Get a camera and you make it work yourself
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:47,872	| IOT126 |	Where at
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:51,712	| IOT126 |	Nasty they have a service for you and
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:54,272	| IOT126 |	You can build off of that or they can go outside so that's
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:56,832	| IOT126 |	That's the tricky part that's kind of getting away from IP webcam
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,928	| IOT126 |	So that's our thought on that
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:04,000	| IOT126 |	My sponsor and
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:04,768	| IOT126 |	Foreign

EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,064	| IOT126 |	The data they collect
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:05,440	| IOT126 |	So let's dig into that a little bit more can you explain what the service is that your
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:06,464	| IOT126 |	Providing
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:09,024	| IOT126 |	Requires
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:11,584	| IOT126 |	Real world data to be sourced from a thing
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,096	| IOT126 |	Or not
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:13,888	| IOT126 |	You need to transmit
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:17,216	| IOT126 |	Through the internet to some form of backend
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:18,496	| IOT126 |	Were you practicing
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,008	| IOT126 |	You also
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,056	| IOT126 |	Time to activate a phone
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:23,104	| IOT126 |	On the side of the object based on

EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:29,504	| IOT126 |	Entails a variety of operation
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:31,552	| IOT126 |	Baleful requires number of
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:32,832	| IOT126 |	The first
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:38,464	| IOT126 |	Resource from a sensor and then transmitted either directly or through a gate with a Q
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:41,280	| IOT126 |	System work can be analyzed or visualize
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:43,328	| IOT126 |	The other way around Dayton
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:45,120	| IOT126 |	To be transferred back to the object
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:46,400	| IOT126 |	Where it causes
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,424	| IOT126 |	A desired app
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:49,216	| IOT126 |	And that's usually outside
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:54,848	| IOT126 |	Wow that's going to cover a lot of things so what kind of skills do you employee
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:55,616	| IOT126 |	Provide
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:56,128	| IOT126 |	Disservice
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:58,432	| IOT126 |	We have experts
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:00,224	| IOT126 |	An analog and digital electronics
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:02,016	| IOT126 |	An embedded software engineering
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:03,040	| IOT126 |	They focused on
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:04,320	| IOT126 |	The size of the thing
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,088	| IOT126 |	Orgeat
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:06,368	| IOT126 |	Then we need to cover
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,136	| IOT126 |	Communication
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:09,440	| IOT126 |	And that was done by Engineers who understand
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,976	| IOT126 |	OSI stack
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:11,488	| IOT126 |	And then we
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,024	| IOT126 |	Various
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:15,072	| IOT126 |	Data scientist
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:17,120	| IOT126 |	Mapreduce algorithm
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:18,912	| IOT126 |	Which analyze the data
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:21,728	| IOT126 |	Front-end software developers to create the user interface
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:22,752	| IOT126 |	Is Rudy a range
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,032	| IOT126 |	Back in Turkey
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:27,104	| IOT126 |	That does sound like a lot of interface
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:28,384	| IOT126 |	Is that something
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:29,664	| IOT126 |	Concerned about
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:33,760	| IOT126 |	Well you have the coordination of different skills is most
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:36,320	| IOT126 |	There are differences
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:37,856	| IOT126 |	Language or terminology
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:40,928	| IOT126 |	A good example would be an electronic in
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,976	| IOT126 |	Together with him
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,024	| IOT126 |	Visalia Dental
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:47,072	| IOT126 |	The mathematician
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:49,120	| IOT126 |	Expresses the imaginary part of
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:50,912	| IOT126 |	Complex number as the letter i
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,704	| IOT126 |	Where's the electronic
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:54,240	| IOT126 |	Give me will understand
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,008	| IOT126 |	Current
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:56,800	| IOT126 |	Port a tectonic engineer
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:59,360	| IOT126 |	An imaginary number is represented by the letter j
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,152	| IOT126 |	So we need to make
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:02,176	| IOT126 |	The date
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:02,688	| IOT126 |	Understand
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:04,224	| IOT126 |	Speak the same language
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:06,272	| IOT126 |	How does Ico a
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:06,784	| IOT126 |	Address that

EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:10,624	| IOT126 |	Training programs
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:13,184	| IOT126 |	That makes sure the teams collaborate efficiently
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:14,464	| IOT126 |	This is also
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:16,256	| IOT126 |	Why are combined experiences
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:19,328	| IOT126 |	Cindy found in areas I was incredibly valuable.
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:22,144	| IOT126 |	We remove this learning curve

EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:44,160	| IOT126 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:46,464	| IOT126 |	And today's guest we have
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:47,744	| IOT126 |	Nick Dawson
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:50,048	| IOT126 |	Who is the executive director of innovation for the
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:52,352	| IOT126 |	Johns Hopkins Sibley Innovation Hub
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:53,632	| IOT126 |	Hello Nick
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,936	| IOT126 |	Hey good morning Stacy
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:58,496	| IOT126 |	Man I am super excited to have you on the show beat
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:28:59,008	| IOT126 |	Because
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:03,616	| IOT126 |	I'm really excited about what you're doing for innovation in iot and hot
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:06,432	| IOT126 |	Herself
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:09,248	| IOT126 |	Let's just get started with telling me a little bit about
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:10,016	| IOT126 |	What you do
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:13,088	| IOT126 |	For the Johns Hopkins community hospital in
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:13,600	| IOT126 |	But you work
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:20,768	| IOT126 |	I have tried for wieden here for about 4 years and I tried for four years to come up with a really short pixie way of saying
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:22,304	| IOT126 |	Saying this and I still stumble on it but
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:27,936	| IOT126 |	In short we are a team of human-centered designers and technologists
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:28,704	| IOT126 |	Sand
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:33,312	| IOT126 |	Project people in the heart of literally sitting in a space in the main lobby
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:34,848	| IOT126 |	Of a hospital
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,872	| IOT126 |	In our job
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:37,920	| IOT126 |	To constantly look for
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:42,016	| IOT126 |	Ways to reinvent reimagine improve and fix Healthcare
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:46,112	| IOT126 |	Mostly we try to do that Through The Eyes of patients and Families
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:47,648	| IOT126 |	That was pretty good
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:51,488	| IOT126 |	It's hard to be pissy when you're talking about the lives of patients and Families
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:53,024	| IOT126 |	So you're on the show
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:55,584	| IOT126 |	Because you and I've had this amazing conversation about
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,352	| IOT126 |	Putting
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:58,400	| IOT126 |	Technology into patients rooms
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:01,216	| IOT126 |	Let's get started by it with you just sharing what your journey
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:05,824	| IOT126 |	Maybe two years ago two and a half working on a project
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:11,968	| IOT126 |	Try to give patients more control over their room in their experience in your laying in a hospital bed
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:18,112	| IOT126 |	You don't have a lot of control even over the physical environment let alone what happens to you and in this is right about the time the
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:20,928	| IOT126 |	I guess I got to be careful about it I can't say the a word the
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:22,208	| IOT126 |	Padme is what week
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:24,000	| IOT126 |	Matinee
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:26,816	| IOT126 |	Had just come on to seeing it we said alright let's experiment
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:28,096	| IOT126 |	Let's just prototype
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:30,656	| IOT126 |	The concept of giving people voice control
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:36,800	| IOT126 |	Over a root and so we bought a couple of them and that's when we said oh my gosh how are we going to get Madame a connected to this
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:38,080	| IOT126 |	Highly secure
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:39,872	| IOT126 |	Appropriately secured
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:40,640	| IOT126 |	Corporate Network
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:44,736	| IOT126 |	And you can imagine that inside this corporate network is
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:46,016	| IOT126 |	Highly regulated
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:48,320	| IOT126 |	Protected patient information and
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:54,208	| IOT126 |	Clinical information in medical science information and then there's also the all the gear there's MRI machines that are network
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:54,976	| IOT126 |	Connected
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:59,328	| IOT126 |	IV pumps and sore pretty particular about what can go on to a hospital Network
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:30:59,840	| IOT126 |	Working what can
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:02,656	| IOT126 |	We got no problem with a guest Network
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:04,192	| IOT126 |	Work we can get this thing on the guest Network
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:06,496	| IOT126 |	Work but the guest network has a captive portal
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:10,848	| IOT126 |	And there was no way without an interface to clear the captive portal we can we talk about
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:13,152	| IOT126 |	Spoofing the MAC address and he said you know
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:15,200	| IOT126 |	This is our chance to do something a little bit
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:16,224	| IOT126 |	And so we ended up
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:19,040	| IOT126 |	Running a completely separate line
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:25,952	| IOT126 |	Call the local ISP and said would you come install a line in our hospital that's separate from the hospital Network
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:26,976	| IOT126 |	Set up our own
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:29,536	| IOT126 |	Infrastructure in here and
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:33,120	| IOT126 |	It kind of laid the groundwork to say oh my gosh what can we do now
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:35,168	| IOT126 |	That we have this
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:35,936	| IOT126 |	Separate
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:36,960	| IOT126 |	Air gap
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:38,496	| IOT126 |	Non-clinical Network
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:39,520	| IOT126 |	On which two
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:44,128	| IOT126 |	To start innovating in and open the door to saying all of these consumer things
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:48,224	| IOT126 |	That we said wouldn't be need to try that in the hospital oh yeah but we can't
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:51,040	| IOT126 |	Now all the sudden he said well we can't Miss Israel easy we can put
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:57,440	| IOT126 |	Hue Lights and Sonos in Chromecast in a room and start to see if that at least provides a little bit of Creature Comforts
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:31:59,488	| IOT126 |	And kind of gone from there
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:02,048	| IOT126 |	Okay so did you ask
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:03,840	| IOT126 |	Permission before you installed the Sip
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:06,144	| IOT126 |	How did that go over
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:06,656	| IOT126 |	With corporate it
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:08,960	| IOT126 |	This is just between us right
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:09,728	| IOT126 |	Pegasus
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:12,800	| IOT126 |	Nobody will hear that I said all of the 25000
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:14,848	| IOT126 |	So we did
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:18,432	| IOT126 |	We're we're having a lot of those conversations now and it will
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:19,968	| IOT126 |	Beebe Road we didn't say work
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:21,248	| IOT126 |	Explicitly not going to have
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,272	| IOT126 |	Conversation
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:24,320	| IOT126 |	But we were tapping into I think
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:25,856	| IOT126 |	It's really special
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,904	| IOT126 |	Unique about our setup
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:30,208	| IOT126 |	Is we're chartered by our CEO
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:32,256	| IOT126 |	And part of that Charter was
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:33,024	| IOT126 |	Do things differently
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:35,584	| IOT126 |	We looked at it and said we're not
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:36,864	| IOT126 |	Substantial risks
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:40,960	| IOT126 |	One of the members of our team is a cyber-security researcher from DARPA
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:41,728	| IOT126 |	Zoe
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:42,752	| IOT126 |	We had a pretty good
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:44,032	| IOT126 |	Putting stand on
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:47,360	| IOT126 |	So we didn't we kind of just built this separate Shadow Network
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,128	| IOT126 |	End
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:50,944	| IOT126 |	Instead of having the conversation about is that okay
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:55,808	| IOT126 |	We had the conversation instead about what can we do for doctors nurses and patients
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:58,624	| IOT126 |	Add value or make your jobs or days easier
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:32:59,392	| IOT126 |	In
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:00,160	| IOT126 |	Those things
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:00,928	| IOT126 |	Became
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:04,000	| IOT126 |	More of the story than this separate Network
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:06,304	| IOT126 |	It's workout mostly we started to
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:07,584	| IOT126 |	Like any innovation
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:09,120	| IOT126 |	I think there's a point where if you
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:10,144	| IOT126 |	When you start to
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:12,192	| IOT126 |	Really create a lot of value and change
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:19,104	| IOT126 |	You got a bubble up over the surface a little bit then people start poking around and see will hang its make sure everything here is kind of copacetic
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:20,128	| IOT126 |	Enterprise in Byram
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:21,408	| IOT126 |	It's a good conversation to have
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:24,480	| IOT126 |	Okay well let's not skip ahead to that
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:28,320	| IOT126 |	Conversation let's talk about what you guys actually have done let's start with
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,088	| IOT126 |	Patient rooms
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:32,928	| IOT126 |	First of all just to say I keep going back
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:37,536	| IOT126 |	What does it do to say we've got this high speed
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:38,304	| IOT126 |	Robots
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,584	| IOT126 |	Non-clinical net
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:44,192	| IOT126 |	Networking once we started using that phrase in our own heads is it okay that opens up a lot of opportunity
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:45,216	| IOT126 |	In that same
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:49,056	| IOT126 |	That we were originally prototyping some voice stuff around when I
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:52,384	| IOT126 |	How do we get madhumeh connected to our Network more
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:55,712	| IOT126 |	And became this design-driven project who he said
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:56,992	| IOT126 |	How could we give somebody
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:00,320	| IOT126 |	Device an interface to do two things
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:01,088	| IOT126 |	Let's get
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:02,112	| IOT126 |	Real-time feedback
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:04,160	| IOT126 |	So if something is going well
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:05,184	| IOT126 |	We're not going well
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:06,720	| IOT126 |	We know in the moment
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:07,744	| IOT126 |	So we wanted to have this
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:08,512	| IOT126 |	This way of getting
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:10,304	| IOT126 |	Real-time feedback
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:16,192	| IOT126 |	There's also something else really powerful as we were interviewing patients and families in
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,984	| IOT126 |	That deep design-driven works
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:24,128	| IOT126 |	We'll just have to learn what's wrong we can give people the tools in the services in the ability to control
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:26,176	| IOT126 |	And have more empowerment
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:27,712	| IOT126 |	Turns out when you get
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:32,576	| IOT126 |	Choice and give them control that leads to more dignity and there's this incredible halo effect
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:33,344	| IOT126 |	Comes with it
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:35,904	| IOT126 |	And so we were setting out from this path we said
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:40,256	| IOT126 |	The thing that makes sense is some kind of tablet interface and we didn't know if that was going to be like
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:44,864	| IOT126 |	Custom thing built into the bed that we would build me a box that up in
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:47,936	| IOT126 |	Belittle 3D printed version above of an iPad holder that
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:51,520	| IOT126 |	Baby clip window bed stand and ended up finding kind of fortuitously
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:53,056	| IOT126 |	Is this incredible
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:53,824	| IOT126 |	Partner
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:55,360	| IOT126 |	Who's a startup company
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:58,688	| IOT126 |	Makes these tablets and custom interfaces for hotels
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:34:59,968	| IOT126 |	So you're
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:03,808	| IOT126 |	Checking into a hotel you walk in your room and they're sitting next to the bed stand is a
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:04,576	| IOT126 |	Is a tablet
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:06,880	| IOT126 |	It says welcome Stacy to your room
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:13,280	| IOT126 |	Can you tap it and you can say I want room service at this time I need a new pillow I need an Uber to come pick me up and it
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:16,608	| IOT126 |	Knows which room you're in in so it'll buys you when you were gets there
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:23,008	| IOT126 |	It has Pandora built-in inside had some entertainment stuff and I had to delete order Postmates and headed Bill directly to your room and he said
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:27,872	| IOT126 |	If we trying to coat our own version of this I will take us a year to not even do half as men
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:29,920	| IOT126 |	Many things is they figured out how to do at a hotel
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:30,688	| IOT126 |	So
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:32,992	| IOT126 |	We said would you ever come work in a hospital
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:35,040	| IOT126 |	And they said we don't know anything about Healthcare it
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:37,088	| IOT126 |	It terrifies us I know it's highly regulated
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,368	| IOT126 |	By the way
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:40,416	| IOT126 |	We can get our device on your network
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:46,816	| IOT126 |	Working me Centro that's where the magic comes in we're a team that can help you Shepherd you through so that was the thing that really became
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:49,632	| IOT126 |	Our biggest use case was he's tablets in patient rooms
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:55,008	| IOT126 |	To give people the ability to give us real-time feedback and have control over their experience
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:56,800	| IOT126 |	And it kind of snowballed from there
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:35:58,080	| IOT126 |	So you got this tablet
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:00,128	| IOT126 |	One of the things that we
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:02,432	| IOT126 |	We talked about previously was this idea
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:04,224	| IOT126 |	That you are not solving
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:05,760	| IOT126 |	Medical
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:07,040	| IOT126 |	Problems
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:09,600	| IOT126 |	We talked about iot and hospitals is being
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:10,624	| IOT126 |	Part of patient care
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:13,696	| IOT126 |	But what you guys are actually doing is taking the load off
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:14,464	| IOT126 |	From nurses
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:16,000	| IOT126 |	Spike reading the side Network
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:17,280	| IOT126 |	Requesting
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:22,400	| IOT126 |	Yeah that's exactly it in the clinical care is in
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:23,168	| IOT126 |	Credit report
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:25,984	| IOT126 |	And their people with high levels of domain expertise
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:28,544	| IOT126 |	It ought to be able to focus on just doing that
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,824	| IOT126 |	But there is so much more
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:30,848	| IOT126 |	About being a patient
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:36,992	| IOT126 |	It gets not being able to do the things that you would normally do during your day in the grief you might feel of having
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:39,040	| IOT126 |	The ability taken away from you. Because
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:39,552	| IOT126 |	Cuz of the hospital
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:41,600	| IOT126 |	Just your illness
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:42,624	| IOT126 |	Air condition taking it away
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:44,928	| IOT126 |	And so giving the separate Channel
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:45,952	| IOT126 |	To have more
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:47,488	| IOT126 |	Controlling your life whether it's
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:51,584	| IOT126 |	And we look at reset if somebody's not on a restricted diet why can't they order Postmates
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:56,448	| IOT126 |	Why can't they get their favorite food delivered if your 2 days out of a knee replacement you're really in pain
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:36:57,984	| IOT126 |	Face but you're not
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:58,752	| IOT126 |	Appreciably sick
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:00,544	| IOT126 |	When I get your favorite meal
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:03,104	| IOT126 |	And little things like that
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:04,640	| IOT126 |	It's not clinical care
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:05,920	| IOT126 |	But it is care for the patient
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:06,688	| IOT126 |	In a way
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:08,224	| IOT126 |	It has a profound effect
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:12,320	| IOT126 |	It's beyond just what we might think of this country or service in a hotel
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:13,856	| IOT126 |	You mail the other part of it is
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:18,208	| IOT126 |	We're taking that burden off the nurses so they can focus on the parts of the job that
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:20,768	| IOT126 |	They find really rewarding that's the calling of being a nurse
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:23,840	| IOT126 |	It's the bedside care stuff if it's a win-win for everybody
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:26,656	| IOT126 |	So in the patient room experience
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:28,192	| IOT126 |	It feels like we've covered a lot of that
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:29,216	| IOT126 |	Now you guys have also
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:32,544	| IOT126 |	Done some things inside the hospital with
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:33,568	| IOT126 |	I think it was kiosk
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:36,896	| IOT126 |	Maybe there's a slack integration somewhere in here
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:39,968	| IOT126 |	Outside
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:40,480	| IOT126 |	The patient room
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:43,296	| IOT126 |	Banneker it'll tell you started in the page
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:46,112	| IOT126 |	And it just kind of blew up in a good way from there
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:48,160	| IOT126 |	We saw we recognize that if there's a number of
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:49,440	| IOT126 |	People because they might just
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,720	| IOT126 |	Did you sick or tired they don't want rap
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:53,280	| IOT126 |	Turns out it is not a Jew
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:58,400	| IOT126 |	We have plenty of older adults who are every bit it's not more tablet savvy
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:38:00,448	| IOT126 |	Then younger people
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:02,496	| IOT126 |	Some people
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:03,520	| IOT126 |	Just want to push a button
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:04,288	| IOT126 |	Swiss re
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:06,848	| IOT126 |	How can we create a non-clinical called
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:08,896	| IOT126 |	I want to push a button to have somebody come
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:12,480	| IOT126 |	And that person then we'll go get me food or get me a blanket or get me something
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:16,064	| IOT126 |	Like a newspaper we look around you said we need a Wi-Fi button
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:18,880	| IOT126 |	In the Amazon dash button
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:20,160	| IOT126 |	Was perfect
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:22,208	| IOT126 |	How are we going to know
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:23,232	| IOT126 |	If somebody pushes that button
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:29,632	| IOT126 |	Are technologist on our team said no problem I will give each button the unique identifier you will know which room it to sign to
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:31,680	| IOT126 |	And it'll peanuts in Slack
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:36,032	| IOT126 |	Are we going to know who to pick any sorry we're going to create a Google spreadsheet
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:38,592	| IOT126 |	And my code goes and checks
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:39,360	| IOT126 |	The spreadsheet says
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:43,968	| IOT126 |	Kind of who's on call amazing are quotes but we all take turns being on call
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:46,784	| IOT126 |	And so it's somebody in the room push that button
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:48,576	| IOT126 |	It says okay right now in the spreadsheet
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:49,600	| IOT126 |	Nick's on call
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:50,880	| IOT126 |	I get a pic on Slack
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:51,648	| IOT126 |	Everybody
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:52,672	| IOT126 |	I can see it and it says Nick
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:54,976	| IOT126 |	Patient in room so and so
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:56,256	| IOT126 |	Is requesting services
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:39:00,096	| IOT126 |	And then we get to go answer that neat and then we started saying what where else can we use the
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:02,656	| IOT126 |	These buttons and this is the cool part about having a
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:04,192	| IOT126 |	An integrated team
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:05,984	| IOT126 |	Arlene engineers said
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:09,568	| IOT126 |	Are you kidding me this is data collection in a way we've never been able to do before
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:13,408	| IOT126 |	Today started taking Moline buttons and mocking up of the IP pot
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,432	| IOT126 |	And mocking up
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:16,736	| IOT126 |	Ways to collect data from a patient
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:18,016	| IOT126 |	And the staff
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:19,040	| IOT126 |	One of the first things they do
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:20,064	| IOT126 |	It was made a little kiosk
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:21,856	| IOT126 |	In our x-ray department
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:22,624	| IOT126 |	It said
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:23,648	| IOT126 |	Were you running late
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:30,048	| IOT126 |	If so why in one of the buttons is labeled traffic one of them is I got lost one of them is Mickey
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:32,608	| IOT126 |	The other something like that
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:33,376	| IOT126 |	Play more like
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:38,752	| IOT126 |	Because you're late you're not going get your point and it was more like let us understand what were the barriers to getting here
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:40,288	| IOT126 |	So we can start to fix them
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:42,080	| IOT126 |	And every time we hit one of those buttons
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:44,384	| IOT126 |	It logs an entry into a Google spreadsheet
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,176	| IOT126 |	And concise on Slack
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:48,736	| IOT126 |	It's amazing to watch this data
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:49,760	| IOT126 |	Coming in real time
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:51,808	| IOT126 |	And it's one of those things that
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:53,344	| IOT126 |	Healthcare
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:55,904	| IOT126 |	Traditionally doesn't have that
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:56,928	| IOT126 |	Skillset internally
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:58,208	| IOT126 |	We're really good
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:40:00,512	| IOT126 |	Really complex it systems
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:03,584	| IOT126 |	But this idea taking something and
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:09,472	| IOT126 |	Kind of quickly cobbling together a little bit of python a little bit Google API a little bit of it eight of us
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:12,032	| IOT126 |	And a network that's designed for non clinical care
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:14,336	| IOT126 |	Made it happen in hours
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:15,104	| IOT126 |	And
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:16,384	| IOT126 |	You can really valuable really quickly
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:18,944	| IOT126 |	That's awesome and
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:21,504	| IOT126 |	In addition to doing all this you've also
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:24,576	| IOT126 |	When someone's on call for like
EDL	00:40:24,576	00:40:25,600	| IOT126 |	Patient care needs
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:30,208	| IOT126 |	Sometimes I think you said some of those are met by like interns so is by your staff
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:33,792	| IOT126 |	You've also brought that out to other people in the
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:37,376	| IOT126 |	I love these Ripple effects that
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:40,960	| IOT126 |	Can happen when you move really quickly
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:44,544	| IOT126 |	We say it's how do you go from years to weeks or Days Inn
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:47,104	| IOT126 |	What's next
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:50,688	| IOT126 |	We're getting pretty good at answering a lot of these patient care requests and
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,968	| IOT126 |	He said who else would benefit
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:54,272	| IOT126 |	We realized it was filling our souls
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:59,136	| IOT126 |	Holes in a way that was really special it was giving us a reason to be in a patient's space
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:00,672	| IOT126 |	And to be of service to the patient
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:02,464	| IOT126 |	We looked around and we said
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:03,488	| IOT126 |	There is a
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:07,072	| IOT126 |	A small percentage about 20% of people who work in the hospital who are not clinical
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:08,864	| IOT126 |	Or his main job duties
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:10,144	| IOT126 |	Play but all of this
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:11,680	| IOT126 |	People talk about coming in to help
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:12,960	| IOT126 |	All care for calling
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:16,800	| IOT126 |	And we started to Seroquel how could we onboard them and so we asked a couple of our
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:17,824	| IOT126 |	Executive
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:19,616	| IOT126 |	Alex if they'd be willing to take call
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:21,408	| IOT126 |	We added to the Google spreadsheet
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:25,760	| IOT126 |	And wish we had a prototype that so we hold their hands and we had to Shadow them so they never
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:28,064	| IOT126 |	Garfield
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:29,344	| IOT126 |	Houston
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:31,392	| IOT126 |	To delivering Care at the bedside but
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:32,672	| IOT126 |	Bape head for the same response
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:33,440	| IOT126 |	Don't swear
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:35,744	| IOT126 |	It's instead of going in in feeling
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:40,352	| IOT126 |	I feel like I'm going in and being of service to somebody and I hope it has a
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:41,376	| IOT126 |	Cultural impact
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:43,424	| IOT126 |	That we haven't even started to see yet
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:44,704	| IOT126 |	Okay
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:48,800	| IOT126 |	What have your Executives what's changed because
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:52,128	| IOT126 |	People are interacting with patients in it
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:52,895	| IOT126 |	I am not saying that
EDL	00:41:53,407	00:41:54,431	| IOT126 |	People don't care but
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:55,967	| IOT126 |	It's very different to make
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:57,247	| IOT126 |	Decision
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:41:58,527	| IOT126 |	Running a hospital
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:01,343	| IOT126 |	Versus fetching blankets
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:05,695	| IOT126 |	And in one of them had that exact moment of okay I followed this project Nick on paper
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:08,255	| IOT126 |	We were unsure about this it thing
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:14,655	| IOT126 |	And we've been looking at the data coming in on this real-time feedback and then holy cow I had no idea I was
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:20,031	| IOT126 |	Went and delivered a warm blanket in this it changed my whole day and I had no idea
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:21,311	| IOT126 |	I was looking at this
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:23,359	| IOT126 |	Is a system is a data thing
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:25,407	| IOT126 |	It's not it's much more than that
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:30,527	| IOT126 |	It's this whole week in fact it's where we going to tournaments this whole non-clinical ecosystem of care
EDL	00:42:30,527	00:42:31,551	| IOT126 |	So what do you want
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:33,343	| IOT126 |	Wow
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:35,903	| IOT126 |	We're piloting a couple things that feel
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:39,743	| IOT126 |	Kind of pretty practically Within Reach so particularly in
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:42,303	| IOT126 |	The outpatient Cancer Center
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:44,095	| IOT126 |	And if you're going through chemotherapy
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:47,679	| IOT126 |	For cancer or you might go through infusion therapy for some other conditions
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:49,215	| IOT126 |	You might sit in a room
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:50,495	| IOT126 |	From anywhere from
EDL	00:42:50,495	00:42:51,775	| IOT126 |	228 hours
EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:55,359	| IOT126 |	The average of 46 hours a year ago
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:58,175	| IOT126 |	Outpatient infusion rooms on credit
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:42:59,711	| IOT126 |	They private rooms
EDL	00:42:59,711	00:43:05,087	| IOT126 |	I have recliners that turn into sleepers and each one has a private TV and each one has a view of the outside with
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:06,879	| IOT126 |	Greenery and by the end of the day
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:09,695	| IOT126 |	You're sitting there for eight hours in the middle of the day in
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:13,535	| IOT126 |	Daytime TV is still Judge Judy and cooking shows and you can only watch so many of it
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:18,143	| IOT126 |	I have nothing
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:18,655	| IOT126 |	But love for judge
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:22,239	| IOT126 |	But there's only so much of that you're also reminded
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:23,775	| IOT126 |	You're F Where You Are
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:29,407	| IOT126 |	Right you're being pumped full of medicine that may cause you discomfort in
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:30,431	| IOT126 |	A lot of success
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:32,735	| IOT126 |	Some of this stuff in that setting
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:34,783	| IOT126 |	Because again it's just giving somebody
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:36,063	| IOT126 |	Just a choice a binary choice
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:38,367	| IOT126 |	Do you want to watch TV or do you want to watch net
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:39,391	| IOT126 |	When is taboo
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:41,951	| IOT126 |	People will often just look through nest
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:45,023	| IOT126 |	Because it's a choice
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:45,535	| IOT126 |	Cast in every room
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:53,471	| IOT126 |	It's starting to turn a couple of those rooms into basically Smart Home
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:54,239	| IOT126 |	Rooms
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:59,359	| IOT126 |	And getting people full control just like they have it home but with somebody like standing there and showing them
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:01,407	| IOT126 |	How you can change the lights here's how you can
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:03,711	| IOT126 |	But your favorite music on it's a really cool thing in
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:06,527	| IOT126 |	Is
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:07,551	| IOT126 |	Playing around with VR
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:08,831	| IOT126 |	So
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:11,647	| IOT126 |	We said alright let's get a couple VR headsets we have done this before
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:12,415	| IOT126 |	Before different
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:18,815	| IOT126 |	Setting where we are talking to a patient in a room and they said it's not that I mind being here I don't mind being interviewed about how you could
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:21,119	| IOT126 |	Improve my experience I just don't want to be here
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:22,655	| IOT126 |	Anywhere But Here
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:24,703	| IOT126 |	Where would you want to be
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:27,519	| IOT126 |	And she said they grew up on a Seaside town
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:28,031	| IOT126 |	Croatia
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:31,103	| IOT126 |	One of my colleagues said I've been there I know that
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:32,639	| IOT126 |	And so we went down and got
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:34,431	| IOT126 |	A Google cardboard
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:35,199	| IOT126 |	And
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:35,967	| IOT126 |	Aspera phone
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:38,783	| IOT126 |	And use Google Street View and pulled up the
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:40,063	| IOT126 |	The same town
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:40,831	| IOT126 |	Took it back
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:41,599	| IOT126 |	To her and said
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:43,647	| IOT126 |	Would you would you look through this
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:48,511	| IOT126 |	And she said I don't really want to do anything technical related in simple just try it and she sat there for
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:52,095	| IOT126 |	For 10 minutes looking around single I know that restaurant
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:54,655	| IOT126 |	I know that oh my gosh I know that that
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:55,423	| IOT126 |	Little shop in
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:57,983	| IOT126 |	It was this really profound emotional experience
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:59,007	| IOT126 |	For 10 minutes
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:45:00,799	| IOT126 |	She wasn't in the hospital room
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:02,335	| IOT126 |	She was in this town she grown up in
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:06,175	| IOT126 |	Wait a little while and then now we took
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:10,271	| IOT126 |	Tianjin got some VR kits in first thing we thought we would do is get people like
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:11,295	| IOT126 |	Guided meditation
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:13,087	| IOT126 |	Mother going through chemotherapy because
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:16,927	| IOT126 |	Because you're going through chemo you must be fragile you're probably queasy and
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:19,231	| IOT126 |	And we want to give you something to be mindful about
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:20,767	| IOT126 |	It turns out
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:22,047	| IOT126 |	People want to play games
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:26,143	| IOT126 |	There's a great Vibe there's a bow and arrow demo
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:28,447	| IOT126 |	People have more fun with that bow and arrow demo
EDL	00:45:28,447	00:45:29,215	| IOT126 |	Then
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:31,519	| IOT126 |	Anything else so the next thing we try
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:34,335	| IOT126 |	We're just beginning of prototype it is
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:35,615	| IOT126 |	What would happen if you had a surrogate
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:37,407	| IOT126 |	So where in Washington DC
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:39,711	| IOT126 |	We're full of incredible Monument
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:43,551	| IOT126 |	There a lot of still very beautiful parts of beautiful things about this city
EDL	00:45:43,551	00:45:48,927	| IOT126 |	So what if somebody was only to go down to the National Mall and walk around with a life VR camera
EDL	00:45:48,927	00:45:49,951	| IOT126 |	360 camera
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:50,975	| IOT126 |	Envy your search
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:56,607	| IOT126 |	And you could lay in your bed and say I really want to go to the Lincoln Memorial I really want to go see the washing I want you to go in that museum
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:58,143	| IOT126 |	And we're just
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:46:02,495	| IOT126 |	It's not even going to Monument maybe it's like go to your favorite restaurant with your family
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:05,055	| IOT126 |	If you're going to be happy in the hospital but your family is out
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:07,871	| IOT126 |	I do need the regular Friday night thing when I'm done with them
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:14,783	| IOT126 |	Basically borrowing a terrible internet connection
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:15,807	| IOT126 |	This over
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:16,319	| IOT126 |	Over the mile
EDL	00:46:17,087	00:46:17,855	| IOT126 |	Right yeah
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:21,951	| IOT126 |	Transmitter
EDL	00:46:22,463	00:46:23,999	| IOT126 |	Cool so how do you guys
EDL	00:46:23,999	00:46:26,559	| IOT126 |	Pay for all this cuz what you're talking about is
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:27,071	| IOT126 |	Not cheap
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:28,863	| IOT126 |	We're lucky in a couple ways
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:29,631	| IOT126 |	1 is
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:30,399	| IOT126 |	We're
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:31,167	| IOT126 |	Part of
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:34,751	| IOT126 |	The heavy very small part of the operating budget
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:36,031	| IOT126 |	The hospital with less than
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:39,359	| IOT126 |	.01% of the operating budget
EDL	00:46:39,359	00:46:40,127	| IOT126 |	Which is a
EDL	00:46:40,127	00:46:43,199	| IOT126 |	A pretty small amount compared to things like life-saving
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:43,967	| IOT126 |	Equipment
EDL	00:46:43,967	00:46:45,759	| IOT126 |	All the stuff that goes into clinical care
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:51,903	| IOT126 |	Have a little bit of philanthropic support but the be honest answer is a lot of this stuff it's expensive from a consumer
EDL	00:46:52,415	00:46:54,207	| IOT126 |	But it's not that Out Of Reach
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:54,975	| IOT126 |	From
EDL	00:46:54,975	00:46:57,023	| IOT126 |	For prototyping in this kind of setting
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:46:58,047	| IOT126 |	So to get
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:46:59,327	| IOT126 |	Philips Hue starter kit
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:01,631	| IOT126 |	To get a VR kit
EDL	00:47:01,631	00:47:03,935	| IOT126 |	The ark it's one of the more expensive things we buy
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:05,983	| IOT126 |	But mostly our costs are
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:06,751	| IOT126 |	That hottie
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:10,591	| IOT126 |	Turns out to be a very expensive Endeavor to try some of this stuff
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:11,615	| IOT126 |	And if it has a return
EDL	00:47:12,127	00:47:18,527	| IOT126 |	The return in one can of little Healthcare nerdy Nuance is our reimbursement what we get paid
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:20,575	| IOT126 |	Is is affected by
EDL	00:47:20,575	00:47:21,343	| IOT126 |	Patient experience
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:22,879	| IOT126 |	If
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:24,671	| IOT126 |	A lot of patients have a negative experience
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:25,951	| IOT126 |	We lose money on
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:28,255	| IOT126 |	And patience have a really good experience
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:29,279	| IOT126 |	We stand to benefit
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:33,375	| IOT126 |	From that and so we look at it as saying all we got to do is affect that
EDL	00:47:33,375	00:47:34,143	| IOT126 |	Needle
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:36,191	| IOT126 |	A little bit and wheel offset our cost
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:36,703	| IOT126 |	Several times over
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:37,727	| IOT126 |	And have you
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:40,543	| IOT126 |	We're trying to measure up for the first couple years we
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:42,847	| IOT126 |	You can put off measuring it we knew that
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:43,615	| IOT126 |	We would
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:50,015	| IOT126 |	We were going to have to be temporarily lost in the wilderness to figure out what it is we're really good at what it is we can do
EDL	00:47:50,015	00:47:53,343	| IOT126 |	And so we're just at the point now starting to pull that data and then saying
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:54,879	| IOT126 |	Because we did these things
EDL	00:47:55,391	00:47:56,415	| IOT126 |	We affected
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:47:58,463	| IOT126 |	The patient experience measurement in this way
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:47:59,999	| IOT126 |	And that's worth XML
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:02,047	| IOT126 |	It's on early days
EDL	00:48:02,047	00:48:04,607	| IOT126 |	Let's get back to this this idea
EDL	00:48:04,607	00:48:05,375	| IOT126 |	You're bigger
EDL	00:48:05,375	00:48:06,655	| IOT126 |	And people are paying attention
EDL	00:48:07,167	00:48:12,287	| IOT126 |	What are the worries that you have to dress with your corporate officers with your it
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:14,079	| IOT126 |	Do you have to make this enterprise-class
EDL	00:48:15,359	00:48:17,663	| IOT126 |	Yeah this is one of those places where
EDL	00:48:17,663	00:48:19,199	| IOT126 |	I have a foot in both camps
EDL	00:48:19,199	00:48:19,967	| IOT126 |	And
EDL	00:48:19,967	00:48:20,735	| IOT126 |	The
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:21,759	| IOT126 |	Optimistic

EDL	00:48:41,471	00:48:47,871	| IOT126 |	The last thing so Hopkins is one of the top three Health Systems in the world and our patient data
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:48,895	| IOT126 |	Includes
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:50,175	| IOT126 |	High level

EDL	00:48:59,391	00:49:01,439	| IOT126 |	Not just from our clinical you stamp
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:02,719	| IOT126 |	Magic imagine
EDL	00:49:02,719	00:49:03,487	| IOT126 |	Target
EDL	00:49:03,487	00:49:05,023	| IOT126 |	Adida breech for us
EDL	00:49:05,023	00:49:05,791	| IOT126 |	With
EDL	00:49:05,791	00:49:12,191	| IOT126 |	Be incredibly expensive from a regulatory fine standpoint it would be it would be caustic to the organization's
EDL	00:49:12,191	00:49:13,727	| IOT126 |	Reputation in
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:16,543	| IOT126 |	Frankly it's also we have a moral obligation to protect
EDL	00:49:16,543	00:49:17,823	| IOT126 |	Patients privacy
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:18,335	| IOT126 |	People's privacy
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:21,407	| IOT126 |	We have to kind of balance that line and say
EDL	00:49:21,919	00:49:22,687	| IOT126 |	We think there's no
EDL	00:49:23,199	00:49:25,503	| IOT126 |	Rainbow putting this tablet in front of somebody
EDL	00:49:26,015	00:49:27,807	| IOT126 |	Itani non-clinical net worth
EDL	00:49:27,807	00:49:29,855	| IOT126 |	We think it's relatively safe
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:32,159	| IOT126 |	But if we're going to roll it out Housewives
EDL	00:49:32,159	00:49:33,439	| IOT126 |	The cross every bed in the hospital
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:35,743	| IOT126 |	And then maybe to every hospital
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:36,767	| IOT126 |	In our system
EDL	00:49:36,767	00:49:41,119	| IOT126 |	And then hopefully get other hospitals to follow that are works all open source we want everyone else to
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:42,399	| IOT126 |	Try the same things were trying
EDL	00:49:42,911	00:49:44,959	| IOT126 |	If it works great if it fails let's learn together
EDL	00:49:44,959	00:49:46,495	| IOT126 |	So we're going to push that model
EDL	00:49:46,495	00:49:47,519	| IOT126 |	We got to make sure it's
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:48,543	| IOT126 |	Free
EDL	00:49:48,543	00:49:50,335	| IOT126 |	And it's great to have
EDL	00:49:50,335	00:49:53,407	| IOT126 |	DARPA research on RT and it's great to have somebody who says
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:56,991	| IOT126 |	I do pin testing against government government hardened systems
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:59,039	| IOT126 |	I can do this on our Network
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:50:03,135	| IOT126 |	To ask the question of
EDL	00:50:03,135	00:50:06,719	| IOT126 |	How can we in this is this is the way we ask it how might we
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:10,303	| IOT126 |	Innovate securely and innovate with our Enterprise partner
EDL	00:50:11,071	00:50:13,631	| IOT126 |	But make sure that it's a partnership so that we're
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:14,655	| IOT126 |	Valuing
EDL	00:50:14,655	00:50:16,447	| IOT126 |	The risks and
EDL	00:50:16,447	00:50:19,007	| IOT126 |	Their conservative point of view in their valuing
EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:19,775	| IOT126 |	AR
EDL	00:50:19,775	00:50:20,799	| IOT126 |	Innovation
EDL	00:50:20,799	00:50:23,359	| IOT126 |	Ends in priority of speed and testing
EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:24,639	| IOT126 |	It's a delicate dance
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:25,407	| IOT126 |	To say the least
EDL	00:50:25,919	00:50:28,223	| IOT126 |	Wow alright Nick thanks so much
