EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:50,944	| IOT148 |	Post it is incredibly Epic
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:53,504	| IOT148 |	He distills all of that down
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:54,272	| IOT148 |	1 in an interview
EDL	00:00:56,832	00:01:00,416	| IOT148 |	Is the Memory Maker of iot
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:02,720	| IOT148 |	And this is not a 500 swiper
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:05,792	| IOT148 |	It is pretty long but it's not five
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:07,840	| IOT148 |	The first
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,120	| IOT148 |	Let's go to a message from

EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:15,520	| IOT148 |	How does the iot change the way we do business
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:21,920	| IOT148 |	For many organizations it means a proliferation of devices and tools and every device connected to your network is another
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:28,320	| IOT148 |	Potential vulnerability you may think your greatest security threat is malicious hackers but really it's an unsecured Smart Watch worn by
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:34,720	| IOT148 |	But if everyone on your team is trained in security best practices it significantly reduces your chance of
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:41,120	| IOT148 |	Data breach for the severity of that bridge CBT Nuggets has been a top training choice for it Professionals for decades
EDL	00:01:41,120	00:01:47,520	| IOT148 |	And now they're making the same high-quality online training solutions for end-user security so your team can read
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:50,080	| IOT148 |	Recognize and stop threats before they make it
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:56,480	| IOT148 |	Go to CBT Nuggets. To find out more about how end-user security training can protect your
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:57,760	| IOT148 |	Network in the iot
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,808	| IOT148 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,088	| IOT148 |	So much news
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,624	| IOT148 |	So they could add some
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:04,416	| IOT148 |	The pad but let's kick it off with
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:07,232	| IOT148 |	News on Apple's homepod
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:08,512	| IOT148 |	Which was due out
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,816	| IOT148 |	He was an early January
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:16,192	| IOT148 |	Yeah before the end of the year and they deleted come December they announced the delay
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:18,752	| IOT148 |	If you're listening to this podcast on Thursday
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:20,032	| IOT148 |	Comes out you have
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:24,384	| IOT148 |	Friday until Friday to get ready to order your homepod for
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,152	| IOT148 |	300
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:26,176	| IOT148 |	At 49
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:26,944	| IOT148 |	Dollars
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:28,736	| IOT148 |	It will be delivered on February
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:32,576	| IOT148 |	Correct correct and I have an alarm set to get a
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,880	| IOT148 |	At 3 a.m. eastern time
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:36,416	| IOT148 |	I can order one for us
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,696	| IOT148 |	So we can test it
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:40,512	| IOT148 |	Obviously won't have it till February 9th at the earliest but
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:45,888	| IOT148 |	I was actually thinking about this would I buy this if we weren't going to review this
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,680	| IOT148 |	Am I answer is probably not
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:48,960	| IOT148 |	But obviously we're still going to
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,752	| IOT148 |	And you're not an
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:53,824	| IOT148 |	Apple ecosystem user so I'm assuming you would not buy this either
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:56,128	| IOT148 |	I'm not even sure we should
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:56,640	| IOT148 |	Buy it
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:03:00,224	| IOT148 |	Chicken spot
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,760	| IOT148 |	We are going to buy it
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:05,088	| IOT148 |	For the show because I think a lot of you guys are listeners really want
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:07,392	| IOT148 |	To understand what this products about and I totally get
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:09,440	| IOT148 |	So we're doing it
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:14,048	| IOT148 |	I will say looking at the features it really does not seem like a smart home
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,328	| IOT148 |	At all
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:18,912	| IOT148 |	And that is because they were not marketing it primarily as one
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:22,496	| IOT148 |	And that kind of fits in with apples standard operating for
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:24,288	| IOT148 |	Procedure what they'll do is they will
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:27,104	| IOT148 |	Look at the highlights of something and stress those
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:30,688	| IOT148 |	Like such as it's going to have awesome music and sound quality inn
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:32,992	| IOT148 |	You can pair two of these and a stereo sound like
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:37,344	| IOT148 |	Other devices that are used today although that's a feature that's coming later in the year with a soft
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:40,416	| IOT148 |	It's all about the sound and everything else
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,696	| IOT148 |	And the Siri
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,720	| IOT148 |	Part of it
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:45,024	| IOT148 |	Is all about music Control
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:48,352	| IOT148 |	And oh by the way you can control homekit stuff
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:50,400	| IOT148 |	How to I think it's because they just
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:52,448	| IOT148 |	Have a
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:57,312	| IOT148 |	A ton of slew of homekit devices out there on the market by comparison a relatively speaking
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,592	| IOT148 |	Other platforms
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,616	| IOT148 |	NP
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:00,640	| IOT148 |	Siri just
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:03,968	| IOT148 |	Isn't still that good I mean I don't know how else to say it
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:05,248	| IOT148 |	Acceptable at best
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,552	| IOT148 |	It seems so
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:11,392	| IOT148 |	I because everyone who's following in the footsteps of
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:14,208	| IOT148 |	Everyone is following in the footsteps of Apple in the developing
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:14,976	| IOT148 |	App Store
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,256	| IOT148 |	Right so back
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:19,327	| IOT148 |	2008
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:20,351	| IOT148 |	To develop
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:22,911	| IOT148 |	Like their developer programs for
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:23,679	| IOT148 |	Voice
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,191	| IOT148 |	Smart Switch
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:26,495	| IOT148 |	I just
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:32,895	| IOT148 |	Apples either apples got some magical big plan that we don't see and it sees the market going in a totally
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,175	| IOT148 |	Different direction which
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:36,223	| IOT148 |	Maybe but it feels like
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:41,855	| IOT148 |	It's coming out in the smart speaker space with a product that ignores what people seem to be mostly doing
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,367	| IOT148 |	What smart speaker
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:45,183	| IOT148 |	Although most people are setting timers and listening to
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,207	| IOT148 |	So we could be
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:53,887	| IOT148 |	True true I mean there's a lot of people affect Apple even said they now have 500 million people using Siri through all
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:57,215	| IOT148 |	All devices and obviously iOS devices through
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:58,495	| IOT148 |	Do they count when I ask
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,007	| IOT148 |	Accidentally activate
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:08,479	| IOT148 |	You know I I don't know the details but it would not surprise me to be honest but it is what it is it's just a number so
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,527	| IOT148 |	Sure people are using Siri but
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:16,159	| IOT148 |	Are they frustrated by Siri I'd say not an equal number of series or but I had a heck of a lot of them certainly are
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:23,071	| IOT148 |	I read through Forums on the other products that are out there and then they're like yep I went with Google home or an echo because
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:26,655	| IOT148 |	Siri just isn't cutting it for me I can do so much more and so on and so forth
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:31,007	| IOT148 |	So there are some unsatisfied series with out there in that 500 million number
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:31,519	| IOT148 |	For sure
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:33,311	| IOT148 |	Will this product
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,079	| IOT148 |	Sway them
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:36,639	| IOT148 |	Not on day one I don't think
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,407	| IOT148 |	Because
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:41,759	| IOT148 |	There's no major Siri improvements that have been mentioned or expected
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:45,087	| IOT148 |	My guess is to get this out there focus on the home
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,111	| IOT148 |	Audio features
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,159	| IOT148 |	In Italian with Apple
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,951	| IOT148 |	Music subscriptions and so on
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:53,023	| IOT148 |	And then later at WWDC
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:56,863	| IOT148 |	Show off some better series Smart's cuz it's just
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:02,751	| IOT148 |	But I actually expected that when this came out or last year's WWDC so I was disappointed in both instances
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:05,055	| IOT148 |	So I could will be disappointed this
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:07,103	| IOT148 |	Summer when WWDC happens in
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:10,943	| IOT148 |	I really don't do much with Siri in terms of smart on
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:15,807	| IOT148 |	And we should not forget that actually the Amazon Echo when it came out as a
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:19,135	| IOT148 |	One of the weird beta products where you had to get an invite to order it
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:22,719	| IOT148 |	When that came out in December 2014
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:24,255	| IOT148 |	It didn't have any smart home stuff
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,791	| IOT148 |	I didn't get that until
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:26,559	| IOT148 |	March Bible
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:31,167	| IOT148 |	So and that's actually when I ordered it I did not order it out of the box
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:35,263	| IOT148 |	Because of that reason once they added the partners and the
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:37,567	| IOT148 |	Smart home stuff that's when I went all-in
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:38,591	| IOT148 |	So you're right
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:39,615	| IOT148 |	Possible
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,663	| IOT148 |	It's coming I don't know
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:44,223	| IOT148 |	Swedish will be a homekit hub for what it's worth
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,271	| IOT148 |	So you can remotely access things
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:47,807	| IOT148 |	Google Now
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,319	| IOT148 |	Multi-room audio
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:49,599	| IOT148 |	It does not
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,879	| IOT148 |	Launch
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:55,487	| IOT148 |	And it does not have the ability to use other music Services which I actually thought was
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:57,023	| IOT148 |	Kind of astonishing
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,327	| IOT148 |	Deckstats app
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:06:59,839	| IOT148 |	I know but
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,911	| IOT148 |	Even put Google actually
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:07,007	| IOT148 |	Compared to Amazon Google is very limited in its Music Services
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,543	| IOT148 |	And again that may be a reason to go to
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:11,103	| IOT148 |	We'll talk about Google in a
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:14,943	| IOT148 |	In a bit because we've actually both transitioned to try and use
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:15,967	| IOT148 |	Local Taco
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:18,015	| IOT148 |	Homepod
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,807	| IOT148 |	We are on the fence
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:20,575	| IOT148 |	Where can I buy it
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:22,367	| IOT148 |	Heaven's going to test it
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:24,671	| IOT148 |	And then we're going to come back and tell you what we think
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:26,463	| IOT148 |	And it's probably just going to be an ongoing segna
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:28,255	| IOT148 |	As hopefully features are added
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,303	| IOT148 |	So I would say to you guys
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,839	| IOT148 |	If you're all in an apple
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:34,655	| IOT148 |	And you got 350 bucks burning a hole in your pocket
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:42,847	| IOT148 |	If you don't already have like a similar system such as a Sonos or or something else with your bottom speaker
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:45,663	| IOT148 |	Yeah okay that I see but
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,687	| IOT148 |	It's like what you already have
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:51,039	| IOT148 |	I tend to agree with you and that and I say that as a
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:54,367	| IOT148 |	Person who in a family of four we all use iOS devices
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,903	| IOT148 |	We have an apple music subscription
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,671	| IOT148 |	Family subscription
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,207	| IOT148 |	I would still
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:58,719	| IOT148 |	Be hesitant
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,303	| IOT148 |	Coyote park
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:04,863	| IOT148 |	All right
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:05,631	| IOT148 |	Bad news
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,167	| IOT148 |	Layoffs in the
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,191	| IOT148 |	Samurai
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,983	| IOT148 |	I didn't realize you're going to make yourself
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:14,591	| IOT148 |	All right
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:16,895	| IOT148 |	TechCrunch is reporting that Sparrow
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:17,663	| IOT148 |	Laid off
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,431	| IOT148 |	Dozens of
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,711	| IOT148 |	People as
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:23,551	| IOT148 |	It had a bad holiday season and also reported the tile
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,831	| IOT148 |	Laid off dozens of
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,623	| IOT148 |	People after a disappointing holiday season
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,159	| IOT148 |	And
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:30,207	| IOT148 |	That is unsurprising
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:33,279	| IOT148 |	Consumer electronics are merciless and the holiday season
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:33,791	| IOT148 |	Make a break
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,607	| IOT148 |	But it is kind of
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:39,167	| IOT148 |	It's a sad sign for the consumer
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,191	| IOT148 |	Iot Market
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:42,239	| IOT148 |	Get in we're just talked about this with our guests met her
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,519	| IOT148 |	But later
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:45,567	| IOT148 |	Short of it is
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,335	| IOT148 |	Man
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,103	| IOT148 |	Fisher
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,639	| IOT148 |	2017 has been brutal
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:50,175	| IOT148 |	For consumer
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,199	| IOT148 |	Hardware iot
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,735	| IOT148 |	And I don't seek it.
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:55,551	| IOT148 |	It has I think the companies that are doing
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,831	| IOT148 |	Better or have a
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:09:00,159	| IOT148 |	More brighter future are the ones that are expanding their product line
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:03,999	| IOT148 |	When I look at something like a tile they make a great product as a Bluetooth tracker
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:07,583	| IOT148 |	And they tweet the design and then features little bit but
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,863	| IOT148 |	That's all they make
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:09,375	| IOT148 |	Well that's not true
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:11,167	| IOT148 |	So they actually
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:11,935	| IOT148 |	Have a platform
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:13,727	| IOT148 |	They're trying to be a platformer
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:16,799	| IOT148 |	Capabilities of tile into lots of
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:20,383	| IOT148 |	Products so they have a deal with an umbrella maker they had a deal with
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:22,175	| IOT148 |	Land Rover
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,455	| IOT148 |	They have deals with
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,479	| IOT148 |	Companies
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,527	| IOT148 |	Fix your phone
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,831	| IOT148 |	So
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:31,647	| IOT148 |	Okay let me just stop or say about because that
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,439	| IOT148 |	Well I didn't know about that and that is good
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,743	| IOT148 |	It's still the underlying
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:39,327	| IOT148 |	Product feature and they're trying together Partners as opposed to
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:41,375	| IOT148 |	Creighton work a range of devices
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:45,215	| IOT148 |	And Gathering Partners is not always easy and especially when it's something that
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:48,543	| IOT148 |	SS fundamental as Bluetooth tracking when there are
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,335	| IOT148 |	Multiple products that can do this
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,383	| IOT148 |	Either apps on your phone that can do
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:53,663	| IOT148 |	I mean
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,431	| IOT148 |	That's
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:56,223	| IOT148 |	Just not an expansion of
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,247	| IOT148 |	Products to me
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:59,039	| IOT148 |	Well so I think it's actually a smarter
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,063	| IOT148 |	Business
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,135	| IOT148 |	Kind of Port Hardware
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,183	| IOT148 |	I just think it does
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:05,951	| IOT148 |	Take a lot
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:06,719	| IOT148 |	It takes time
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,767	| IOT148 |	So that makes sense and
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:11,839	| IOT148 |	On Spiro that what they just were bitten by the fact that
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:15,679	| IOT148 |	You know if you bought one round bb8 saying he probably didn't need the next version
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,727	| IOT148 |	And they basically
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,263	| IOT148 |	Trying to shift its focus from
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:20,543	| IOT148 |	Education
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:23,359	| IOT148 |	Which is where they kind of started
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:29,759	| IOT148 |	Out a little bit so we'll see I mean it's possible that Sphero is a decent company but it's probably never going to be that big
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,039	| IOT148 |	Maybe I could spot by another
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,063	| IOT148 |	Toy company
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:35,135	| IOT148 |	Speaking of
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,159	| IOT148 |	Consumer iot
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,975	| IOT148 |	Ring is raising money
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:42,559	| IOT148 |	Evaluation of almost 1 billion dollars according to the information
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:45,119	| IOT148 |	This is a story I too was chasing
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:45,887	| IOT148 |	They just snack
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,935	| IOT148 |	Snack before I could
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:48,447	| IOT148 |	Fully confer
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:51,007	| IOT148 |	Is it good publication I trust him
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,287	| IOT148 |	I've heard the Same Rivers
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:53,567	| IOT148 |	I am
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:55,615	| IOT148 |	By this news
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:58,431	| IOT148 |	I cannot fathom
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,967	| IOT148 |	The ring would be worth
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,271	| IOT148 |	Billion dollars
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,039	| IOT148 |	They sell
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,087	| IOT148 |	Granite they've done what you said
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,367	| IOT148 |	They've expanded their product line
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,159	| IOT148 |	But with her
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:10,975	| IOT148 |	Their lawsuit with ADT which I have also heard
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:13,023	| IOT148 |	Is close to or has reached a set
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:15,327	| IOT148 |	It doesn't make sense to me
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:17,119	| IOT148 |	If it would be worth that much
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,399	| IOT148 |	I just don't see it
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:23,263	| IOT148 |	Well I tend to agree with you when I just look at the numbers but then when I step back
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,287	| IOT148 |	I can like what was
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:24,799	| IOT148 |	Net worth
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:27,871	| IOT148 |	When they only had a couple products
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:30,943	| IOT148 |	Nest was in a fluffy exciting time back in
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:33,759	| IOT148 |	In 2014 and they had Tony fadell who by the way just moved
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:34,271	| IOT148 |	France
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:40,159	| IOT148 |	Okay yeah he's got offices now and some French Hardware
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:40,927	| IOT148 |	Startup
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,999	| IOT148 |	Oh I can't think of the French word for cool
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,303	| IOT148 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:48,351	| IOT148 |	True. Very true
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,631	| IOT148 |	I don't I'm not saying I see
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:53,471	| IOT148 |	Ring is worth a billion dollars it's not for me to say anyway cuz I'm not a financial analyst
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,775	| IOT148 |	I sort of get it
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:59,615	| IOT148 |	I mean the smart home and iot space is all you see is
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:00,895	| IOT148 |	Reports of
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:02,687	| IOT148 |	X billion devices
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:04,735	| IOT148 |	The next five years and summer
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,783	| IOT148 |	I'm really from a consumer standpoint
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:08,319	| IOT148 |	At the very beginning of this Market
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:11,135	| IOT148 |	So you're going to have inflated value so I'm not saying again
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:13,183	| IOT148 |	They're worth a billion but I can see
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,207	| IOT148 |	Why people think they might be
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:16,767	| IOT148 |	I feel like
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:18,047	| IOT148 |	If I look at
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,327	| IOT148 |	The stuff in it
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,607	| IOT148 |	And I'm talk to some of their
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,375	| IOT148 |	Pliers
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:23,423	| IOT148 |	I don't think they're making much margin
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:25,215	| IOT148 |	Countertop corbels
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:27,007	| IOT148 |	They still have
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:32,127	| IOT148 |	It's a relatively High bomb but they also pay licensing fees for all of their video processing
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:33,919	| IOT148 |	So I look at that and I'm like
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:34,943	| IOT148 |	That could be
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,479	| IOT148 |	And
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,503	| IOT148 |	The security products
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,295	| IOT148 |	Is actually really calm
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,831	| IOT148 |	Telling but it's not on the market
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,623	| IOT148 |	And meanwhile dark
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,391	| IOT148 |	Senators are
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,927	| IOT148 |	Going all out to
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,207	| IOT148 |	Black security available
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:47,231	| IOT148 |	Michelle
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:49,535	| IOT148 |	Briefly talk about that because Comcast
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,815	| IOT148 |	Actually reported
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,607	| IOT148 |	Their earnings on
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,119	| IOT148 |	Wednesday 12
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:56,191	| IOT148 |	And they now have one point
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:57,215	| IOT148 |	13 billion
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,775	| IOT148 |	Home automation and Security customer
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,311	| IOT148 |	Merced CS
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,591	| IOT148 |	They basically made
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:03,615	| IOT148 |	Home automation
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:06,175	| IOT148 |	Available to 15 million
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,455	| IOT148 |	After customers with
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,223	| IOT148 |	Their fanciest
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:10,271	| IOT148 |	Right
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,551	| IOT148 |	So I look at that I'm like
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:14,367	| IOT148 |	The holy cow 4% of Comcast
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,391	| IOT148 |	Broadband subscribe
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:17,183	| IOT148 |	Drivers have made the choice
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,975	| IOT148 |	Call Beth and said I want this
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,023	| IOT148 |	Right and I'm willing to pay for it
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:23,071	| IOT148 |	And I'm willing to pay for it and now
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:24,863	| IOT148 |	Everyone can have it
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,375	| IOT148 |	And call up in
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:26,911	| IOT148 |	It's on like
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:27,935	| IOT148 |	They don't have to call
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,215	| IOT148 |	I should have to do
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,519	| IOT148 |	I'm sure they do with God
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,055	| IOT148 |	That's all I'm going to say
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:35,103	| IOT148 |	I know you have strong feel
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:42,271	| IOT148 |	So so I look at that and then alarm.com has about 5 million
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:49,695	| IOT148 |	ATT is getting actually more active with SmartThings and they've got 7.2 million business and
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,207	| IOT148 |	Presidential Kush
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,231	| IOT148 |	That's a little different
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,583	| IOT148 |	Maybe ring is
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:14:01,471	| IOT148 |	This is just me off the top of my head maybe ring is positioning itself to be purchased by another security company
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:04,031	| IOT148 |	Yes they have their own security products coming out
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,823	| IOT148 |	They do have the doorbells
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:06,591	| IOT148 |	They have
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:08,895	| IOT148 |	It just announced at CES some new outdoor
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:12,991	| IOT148 |	Lights as a result of purchasing mr. beams
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:15,295	| IOT148 |	I don't recall how much they paid for mr. Bean's butt
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:17,343	| IOT148 |	They're getting to outdoor LED lighting
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:20,927	| IOT148 |	Maybe they're just set themselves up to be to be blunt I don't know
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,463	| IOT148 |	I would not need none of the security cam
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:23,487	| IOT148 |	Buy them at
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:28,607	| IOT148 |	We're just
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:30,399	| IOT148 |	Let's talk
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:30,911	| IOT148 |	Briefly
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,727	| IOT148 |	It's because I
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:36,543	| IOT148 |	Transitioned in the last week to using
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,823	| IOT148 |	My Google home
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:38,847	| IOT148 |	And a Google mini
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:41,151	| IOT148 |	Tell Google home what downstairs in my
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:43,199	| IOT148 |	Open plan living dining
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:43,967	| IOT148 |	Kitchen area
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,271	| IOT148 |	And then a Google mini
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,039	| IOT148 |	It is in my bedroom
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:48,575	| IOT148 |	I'm trying to force my
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:51,647	| IOT148 |	They're like
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,927	| IOT148 |	Metal
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,695	| IOT148 |	Tell me this
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:56,767	| IOT148 |	Come up with
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:59,583	| IOT148 |	So you sound flummoxed
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:05,215	| IOT148 |	It's a frustrating experience in part just because now I have to touch all of these things that
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:05,727	| IOT148 |	Previously worked
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:07,519	| IOT148 |	Work cell
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,287	| IOT148 |	Keeping that in mind
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,335	| IOT148 |	I will say first off
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:13,407	| IOT148 |	Google has some awesome features like the ability to add
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:14,943	| IOT148 |	Really easily
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:16,223	| IOT148 |	Things to my Google Calendar
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:19,295	| IOT148 |	The challenges I can't use the Google home with my
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:19,807	| IOT148 |	Professional
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,087	| IOT148 |	Google
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:21,855	| IOT148 |	Accounts
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:25,183	| IOT148 |	Right not a Google Apps account that is correct and that is just
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:26,463	| IOT148 |	Cos Amino end of
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,231	| IOT148 |	Pain
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:29,279	| IOT148 |	Because I add things but it goes to the
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:31,583	| IOT148 |	Open calendar and I share the calendars but
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:35,167	| IOT148 |	I apparently can't share them both ways I'm experiencing some
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,935	| IOT148 |	Trouble
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:41,567	| IOT148 |	This has been a long-term challenge for Google and a lot of people validly complain about it
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:45,407	| IOT148 |	And I keep coming back to the fact that from a business standpoint
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:47,711	| IOT148 |	People use Google Apps own their data
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,991	| IOT148 |	So Google
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:49,759	| IOT148 |	Doesn't
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:55,135	| IOT148 |	Put a lot of functionality smart functionality in those accounts it doesn't work with them because
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,159	| IOT148 |	You know
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,207	| IOT148 |	It's different on the consumers
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:00,255	| IOT148 |	I would actually give Google
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:03,839	| IOT148 |	Cuz I think there's a huge value-add to being able to ask
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:05,887	| IOT148 |	Cuz right now if I ask Google what's on my
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,911	| IOT148 |	My calendar for the day
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:08,703	| IOT148 |	It doesn't cuz most of my
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,471	| IOT148 |	Appointments are on my
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:10,495	| IOT148 |	Apps
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,311	| IOT148 |	And so
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:14,591	| IOT148 |	It's like
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,871	| IOT148 |	You don't have anything today
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:19,455	| IOT148 |	Yes madam
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,735	| IOT148 |	Can tie into my Google
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:22,271	| IOT148 |	And this is
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:24,063	| IOT148 |	I'm like
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:26,111	| IOT148 |	NN people are probably people who
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:28,159	| IOT148 |	Use it for work I probably like this is awesome
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:32,511	| IOT148 |	But they're giving up something that they said they never want to give up on that is giving a work date at 2
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:36,351	| IOT148 |	Right but I'm okay and I don't know if we get it
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:43,263	| IOT148 |	Yeah but I have to make some major policy changes terms of service and so on I don't know that all the people who are try or you
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:46,335	| IOT148 |	Using say a Amazon Echo with a work Google account
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:51,455	| IOT148 |	Understand that the very thing they said they never wanted to do they're actually doing I don't think they're putting two and two together
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:53,503	| IOT148 |	But hopefully now they
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:54,527	| IOT148 |	Cuz you adjust
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,319	| IOT148 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:58,879	| IOT148 |	The other thing that is driving me bonkers
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:16:59,391	| IOT148 |	Outside the musical
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:01,951	| IOT148 |	Is
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:02,975	| IOT148 |	The Google shortcut
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:06,047	| IOT148 |	Some of my work
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,583	| IOT148 |	Some of mine
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:10,399	| IOT148 |	But Lord I cannot tell
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:11,423	| IOT148 |	Why they don't
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:13,215	| IOT148 |	And this is driving me bonkers
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:15,775	| IOT148 |	They're also very limited in my experience
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:18,847	| IOT148 |	They are limited it is also I will say it was frustrating
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,359	| IOT148 |	Like to do my
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:21,663	| IOT148 |	Harmony so with my television
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:26,271	| IOT148 |	When I because Harmony is not a device that
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,295	| IOT148 |	You can add from
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,855	| IOT148 |	App you have to verbally say
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,391	| IOT148 |	Okay g
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,671	| IOT148 |	Add Harmony
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,207	| IOT148 |	And then it says
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:37,279	| IOT148 |	Okay I'm showing you a card to link your account
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,047	| IOT148 |	And then you link
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,863	| IOT148 |	But then when you say you have to then say
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:44,191	| IOT148 |	Call me to okg ask Harmony to turn on
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:45,983	| IOT148 |	Yes
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,263	| IOT148 |	And what's weird
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:48,031	| IOT148 |	Is then
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,567	| IOT148 |	Your TV turns on
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:50,847	| IOT148 |	And then
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:51,615	| IOT148 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:53,151	| IOT148 |	Completely do voice comes on
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,431	| IOT148 |	I'm Harmony
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:57,247	| IOT148 |	How can I help you
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:00,319	| IOT148 |	So it's funny you mention that to me it's almost like
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,343	| IOT148 |	Adding a bot
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,903	| IOT148 |	That's what they've done Nevada. Chatbot for
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,183	| IOT148 |	Some of these products
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:10,303	| IOT148 |	Like I have the canary and I added finally got the canary linkage to work with Google Assistant
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,839	| IOT148 |	And it's exact same thing
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:16,703	| IOT148 |	So when I want to find out who is home or was not home which Canary can do that with his geolocation
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:20,543	| IOT148 |	I have to say you have to ask G to talk to Canary
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:23,615	| IOT148 |	And then the different voice because it's a canary bot comes in and says
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:24,639	| IOT148 |	What can I help you
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:25,919	| IOT148 |	Who is home
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:28,223	| IOT148 |	And it will tell me who is Homer
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:30,527	| IOT148 |	So it's
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,807	| IOT148 |	It's a freaking point
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:35,135	| IOT148 |	Because it's not a native integration and it's very I totally read this very first
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:37,951	| IOT148 |	So that was that and I did turn in the other
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:41,535	| IOT148 |	Harmony is a good example of this actually because then I created a short
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:43,583	| IOT148 |	That's so now I can say Okay g turn on TV
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:45,375	| IOT148 |	I can also turn on
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,191	| IOT148 |	Options to SATA
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,007	| IOT148 |	Then you have to make a second
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,543	| IOT148 |	Turn off TV
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,311	| IOT148 |	Adventure
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:54,591	| IOT148 |	Volume
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:57,663	| IOT148 |	And each time Harmony comes back on even though you
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:58,943	| IOT148 |	And talk to you
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:02,783	| IOT148 |	Yes to thoughts on that one I actually don't have that problem only
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:03,295	| IOT148 |	Because
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:07,647	| IOT148 |	My TV is connected to the Nvidia Shield which is an Android TV box
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:09,951	| IOT148 |	So I can just say Okay g
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:12,255	| IOT148 |	Turn TV on and it fires up both my
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:15,839	| IOT148 |	My TV and the shield box because it's actually working through the shield box
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:18,399	| IOT148 |	And I can do the same thing with turn off and it shuts both of them off
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:20,447	| IOT148 |	So if you go with an a native
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:23,263	| IOT148 |	Chromecast capable thing it works well
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,799	| IOT148 |	And I know that you're not doing that
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:26,591	| IOT148 |	I'm just pointing out for those who have that
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,383	| IOT148 |	If you have Chrome Cast
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:30,687	| IOT148 |	Yes
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:32,735	| IOT148 |	My other thought on these shortcuts is
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,015	| IOT148 |	I can't
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:37,599	| IOT148 |	When do scenes or routines with multiple things happen
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,623	| IOT148 |	I think so what I did was
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:42,463	| IOT148 |	I hooked up with has a recent integration I hooked up you know me
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,487	| IOT148 |	Into Google
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:46,559	| IOT148 |	And now when I walk into my room which I typically
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,839	| IOT148 |	Want to chill out
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:53,215	| IOT148 |	At night time and watch TV or something listen to music I say Haji activate relaxation
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:55,007	| IOT148 |	And I set that up and you know me too
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:56,799	| IOT148 |	Turn on the light at 50%
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:20:02,175	| IOT148 |	It's not you bright and fire up my Sonos with some easy listening music so I tie together things that weigh
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,199	| IOT148 |	And by the way
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,735	| IOT148 |	Because we did have someone ask this question
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,015	| IOT148 |	We're bad people
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:06,527	| IOT148 |	Coconut
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:07,807	| IOT148 |	Has a problem
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:11,391	| IOT148 |	You know me is spelled y o n o m
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,183	| IOT148 |	Augmentin
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:17,023	| IOT148 |	All of your Googling in the world may not get you there
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:17,535	| IOT148 |	But let us know
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,071	| IOT148 |	So
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:20,607	| IOT148 |	Tell me if you can spell me
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:24,191	| IOT148 |	Roof
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:30,079	| IOT148 |	Disappointed as one of their labs
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:30,591	| IOT148 |	Hurts so
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,127	| IOT148 |	Your mileage may vary
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,919	| IOT148 |	All right
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:39,039	| IOT148 |	Google Voice match works with Netflix profiles now which would be
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:40,575	| IOT148 |	Be cool if Google Voice match actually
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:49,791	| IOT148 |	Yeah that's true and then because I'm the only one who talked to anything in my house and my family still is not even on The Voice
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,327	| IOT148 |	I can only test
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,607	| IOT148 |	I can't really test voice match
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,167	| IOT148 |	Just throw that out there
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:59,775	| IOT148 |	But that's handy if it does work for you because we have multiple profiles in Netflix
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,311	| IOT148 |	If I could get them to use it
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:03,871	| IOT148 |	You know my daughter could say hey G
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:10,527	| IOT148 |	Watch whatever it was Grey's Anatomy on Netflix a would pick up where she left off versus where I left off a little I don't watch crazy
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:12,319	| IOT148 |	Netflix
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:16,672	| IOT148 |	All right and then Kevin you found a smoking hot
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:17,184	| IOT148 |	Google home Mini
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:24,096	| IOT148 |	Yes and I just verify before the show that it's still active Google how many was easy to get on sale over the holidays but all those say
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:26,400	| IOT148 |	Disappear now it's full price pretty much
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:32,032	| IOT148 |	Because you and I are making this move to kind of transition away and test the waters more with Google home
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:35,360	| IOT148 |	I went and found a Google home Mini 2 pack deals
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:38,944	| IOT148 |	You got one in charcoal one and chalk you cannot pick the color to get one of each
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:40,480	| IOT148 |	For $88
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:41,248	| IOT148 |	Shipt
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:43,040	| IOT148 |	Expedited shipping is included
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:46,880	| IOT148 |	88 bucks no sales tax either unless you live in New Jersey or New York
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,416	| IOT148 |	Go to B&H
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:51,232	| IOT148 |	Toto and you can get two Google home minis for 88 bucks
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,024	| IOT148 |	Which is what I did
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:55,072	| IOT148 |	I think that delivered yesterday
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:57,888	| IOT148 |	Call me based on what we're saying you may not get excited about the
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:00,192	| IOT148 |	We're still experimenting
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,472	| IOT148 |	It's possible.
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:02,240	| IOT148 |	Even out the Kinks
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:04,288	| IOT148 |	All right
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:05,824	| IOT148 |	We got some quick news bits
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,336	| IOT148 |	So
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:08,128	| IOT148 |	Trouble in the world of
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:10,432	| IOT148 |	Low-power wide area
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:12,992	| IOT148 |	Networks this is from fiercewireless
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:14,784	| IOT148 |	Cuz they've been following this
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:17,088	| IOT148 |	Sigfox
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:20,672	| IOT148 |	Confirmed earlier this year that it's us Chief is no longer with the
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:24,512	| IOT148 |	The company and that it didn't reach its network coverage goals for 27
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:26,816	| IOT148 |	Which feels like bad news
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,888	| IOT148 |	Allen poythress
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:32,960	| IOT148 |	Who is president of sick-box North America
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:33,472	| IOT148 |	Is left
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:35,776	| IOT148 |	Is Secaucus station to part ways
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,312	| IOT148 |	Which feels like you
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:39,360	| IOT148 |	And then
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:42,944	| IOT148 |	In the story they also talked about John Horn who would left ingenue
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:44,992	| IOT148 |	Which was another low power wide area Networks
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:48,576	| IOT148 |	Last spring I haven't heard much at all from ingenue
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:49,600	| IOT148 |	Can you
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,952	| IOT148 |	Since probably 2016
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:57,024	| IOT148 |	I feel that that's probably
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,304	| IOT148 |	I would not be excited about
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:00,352	| IOT148 |	So just to step back on both of these
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,632	| IOT148 |	Companies that you're mentioning
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:05,728	| IOT148 |	These are I don't want to leave incorrect made out of these proprietary low power
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:06,752	| IOT148 |	Their proprietary
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:09,568	| IOT148 |	Right End to me
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:11,104	| IOT148 |	At this point in time
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:14,176	| IOT148 |	You know when they conceived the idea I think it was a great idea
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:16,736	| IOT148 |	But at this point in time I think they're challenge
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:17,760	| IOT148 |	Is obviously
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:18,528	| IOT148 |	The more standard
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:21,600	| IOT148 |	Wireless protocols and implementation
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:28,000	| IOT148 |	That carriers are starting to pick up on but I don't know if you agree or not I think there's still a role for these kinds of
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:30,304	| IOT148 |	They're going to be increasingly pressed between
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,072	| IOT148 |	Laura
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:33,120	| IOT148 |	Which is kind of a white area but
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:33,888	| IOT148 |	It doesn't have to have
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:35,168	| IOT148 |	Play Nationwide coverage right
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:36,704	| IOT148 |	And these private Networks
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:37,216	| IOT148 |	People are setting
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,776	| IOT148 |	Using Laura and then also
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:42,336	| IOT148 |	Nb-iot and Cat
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:43,872	| IOT148 |	At 1 a.m.
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:45,408	| IOT148 |	Networks that the carriers are
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:49,248	| IOT148 |	Exactly that's the issue I think it is a matter of timing
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:50,528	| IOT148 |	And more
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:51,552	| IOT148 |	Standard
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:53,856	| IOT148 |	Implementation send anything else but that's just my guess
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,392	| IOT148 |	Indeed
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:56,928	| IOT148 |	And this is a little bit of
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:57,696	| IOT148 |	Sad song
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,976	| IOT148 |	Security news but
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,768	| IOT148 |	Rescue button
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,304	| IOT148 |	People buy
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:04,352	| IOT148 |	These are Bluetooth face buttons
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:10,752	| IOT148 |	Women or protesters or anybody who worries about personal safety you can press the button on these and they're supposed to alert
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,032	| IOT148 |	Someone with like
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:13,312	| IOT148 |	Hey I've arrived at the
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,592	| IOT148 |	This place or it might be like
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:17,152	| IOT148 |	Attacked help
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:18,688	| IOT148 |	And it sends data
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:20,480	| IOT148 |	From the device to your phone and then the
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:21,248	| IOT148 |	The phone sends usually at
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:25,856	| IOT148 |	So Duo security has done research and they found
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:27,136	| IOT148 |	But unfortunately
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:29,696	| IOT148 |	Three major devices we're safe revolar
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:31,232	| IOT148 |	And
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:34,048	| IOT148 |	The roar personal safety system known as
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:36,096	| IOT148 |	Athena all have some sort of
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:36,864	| IOT148 |	Compromised
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:40,704	| IOT148 |	So the best one is the Athena from
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,728	| IOT148 |	Roar personal safety
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:44,288	| IOT148 |	The other two have some issues
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:46,592	| IOT148 |	On their Bluetooth security so they can be
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:47,872	| IOT148 |	You could be trapped
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:48,896	| IOT148 |	Using Bluetooth
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:52,480	| IOT148 |	On both of these other devices and they are subject to denial
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:52,992	| IOT148 |	Service attack
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:59,904	| IOT148 |	And this is a problem I think the denial-of-service attack is probably not some random guy is going to bug you is probably more for like
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:02,720	| IOT148 |	Local government using it against protesters but
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,000	| IOT148 |	The fact that you can be
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:10,400	| IOT148 |	Tracked via Bluetooth is a problem because this is a kind of device that women who have stalkers often
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,424	| IOT148 |	Look for
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:15,264	| IOT148 |	And if you have a stalker it's possible that they will actually just instead use it to track you
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:18,848	| IOT148 |	The actual problem is trying to solve actually contribute to the
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:24,992	| IOT148 |	Pulling to this in the show notes cuz it's an interesting study is it important
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:25,760	| IOT148 |	Issue ID
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:28,576	| IOT148 |	I've never bought one of these but I have considered them
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:31,136	| IOT148 |	And I have a daughter and I'm like hey you know
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:33,952	| IOT148 |	It might be nice for her to have just a quick button
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:34,464	| IOT148 |	Although
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:35,744	| IOT148 |	Probably just forget it
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:40,864	| IOT148 |	That is
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:43,936	| IOT148 |	All our news basically so let's talk about
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:45,472	| IOT148 |	Kevin has bought a new
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:52,128	| IOT148 |	Yeah you called it a curable before the show which is sorta is but at my first true hearable
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:52,640	| IOT148 |	Was purchased
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:54,688	| IOT148 |	Just to level set
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:58,272	| IOT148 |	I have noticed over the past several years that I am having problems
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:26:01,088	| IOT148 |	Scaring people in conversation when
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,880	| IOT148 |	There's a lot of background noise multiple
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:04,160	| IOT148 |	People talking and so on
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:07,744	| IOT148 |	And I don't think it's an issue when I listen to music more than that because I crank
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:08,768	| IOT148 |	Turn the volume up
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:11,584	| IOT148 |	Seems my TV and pack my family is like
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:15,168	| IOT148 |	Why is your TV so loud in your office and we're down here we can hear your TV
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:17,216	| IOT148 |	It sounds great to me but that's because
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:20,032	| IOT148 |	I'm obviously starting to experience some hearing challenges
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:21,568	| IOT148 |	And
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:24,384	| IOT148 |	I mean I know that embarrasses some people that I've no issue
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:26,432	| IOT148 |	You know admitting to it so I'd rather fix it
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,200	| IOT148 |	So
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:28,480	| IOT148 |	What I did was
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:31,040	| IOT148 |	I actually found a free app
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:36,416	| IOT148 |	And it's you can get it at for iOS only it's called FedEx Fe and NEX
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:40,768	| IOT148 |	Go to FedEx. IO to hear about it it's an augmented hearing application
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:44,608	| IOT148 |	It's free it works with Bluetooth headphones and iPhone
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:50,752	| IOT148 |	What does is it basically pipes the sound from an iPhone to your headphones
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:53,568	| IOT148 |	She put an iPhone next to say the TV
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:56,384	| IOT148 |	And it captures through the microphone of the phone
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:57,664	| IOT148 |	All of the audio
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:03,296	| IOT148 |	Comes up to your ears and you can adjust the sound and so on so I can turn the TV down so my family doesn't hear it
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:09,696	| IOT148 |	But I hear it just as loud because it's being Bluetooth fed to my ears it was free and then like Alyssa's not
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:11,232	| IOT148 |	Bad but I would have to use the
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:17,632	| IOT148 |	The phone has the microphone all the time so it's not ideal as a long-term solution for me
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:20,192	| IOT148 |	Purchased iqbuds witch
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:22,496	| IOT148 |	Are basically Bluetooth wireless
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,264	| IOT148 |	Earbuds
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:24,288	| IOT148 |	Just like the airpod
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:27,872	| IOT148 |	How to put one in each ear but they also have two microphones
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:28,640	| IOT148 |	In each
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,408	| IOT148 |	Earbud
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:31,968	| IOT148 |	And that will amplify sounds you can
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:35,552	| IOT148 |	Get rid of some noise as noise suppression which is fully configurable
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:36,832	| IOT148 |	There a difference
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:39,392	| IOT148 |	Cenarios wrecking Sam at home I'm in a meeting I'm in a
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,160	| IOT148 |	Cara
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:40,928	| IOT148 |	Plane
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:42,208	| IOT148 |	You can set different environments
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:43,488	| IOT148 |	And
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:45,280	| IOT148 |	Maybe they look a little goofy to me
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:48,096	| IOT148 |	But I'm certainly not ready for a hearing aid yet
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:52,960	| IOT148 |	They're working really well they're not cheap they're a lot cheaper than during any other $299
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:54,240	| IOT148 |	Battery life is not
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,520	| IOT148 |	Mary exceptionalists
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:28:01,664	| IOT148 |	Literally four hours if you're going to listen to music and hear the outside world with eight hours if you just want to hear and amplify
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:03,200	| IOT148 |	Sound for conversation
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:07,552	| IOT148 |	In such a little wireless charging case airpods 2
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:12,672	| IOT148 |	Overall I'm pretty happy with them they have great conversations in my family to test them
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:14,464	| IOT148 |	Pictures of much better
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:19,584	| IOT148 |	I could turn my TV down in my office late at night and still hear the sound really really loud if I want
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:24,192	| IOT148 |	So you know you've mentioned parables in the past they sit and Ivory
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:26,240	| IOT148 |	It's always kind of scoffing at am I let's just silly butt
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:27,776	| IOT148 |	Now that I need the money
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:32,128	| IOT148 |	What's coughing anymore and this is an interesting experience
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:38,016	| IOT148 |	That's why we don't use video when we do the podcast I be shaking my head like Yoruba
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:38,784	| IOT148 |	That's just silly
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:42,880	| IOT148 |	What I bought Heroes
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:45,184	| IOT148 |	All right and then you've got another
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:45,696	| IOT148 |	Project
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:50,304	| IOT148 |	Yeah you want make a quick
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:54,912	| IOT148 |	I always have a project and I can probably talk for 2 hours on this. Don't worry
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:59,264	| IOT148 |	Yes I will yes I will and I will share code and so on and so forth
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:03,616	| IOT148 |	So I have long said I want my smart home to be smarter
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:07,200	| IOT148 |	It has so much data but I can't get it that day though
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:12,832	| IOT148 |	I can't make things talk to each other unless the device makers make things talk to each other not frustrate as all heck
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:15,904	| IOT148 |	So as a programming newbie
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:21,280	| IOT148 |	I decided to start tackling some of these personal challenges and my smart home to get more value
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:22,304	| IOT148 |	Of the date of its being
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:28,192	| IOT148 |	In this particular instance I'm not capturing data from the home I'm having my home intelligently
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:29,984	| IOT148 |	Notify me with Ambien notify
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:30,752	| IOT148 |	Vacations
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:33,824	| IOT148 |	Things that are happening in the world that I care about
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:35,104	| IOT148 |	In particular
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:35,872	| IOT148 |	I have
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:38,176	| IOT148 |	Tied into the API
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:42,528	| IOT148 |	Of a crypto coin exchange I used to buy and trade coins
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:46,368	| IOT148 |	I want to know when I wake up or anytime of the day without going out
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:48,416	| IOT148 |	Route to an app or the Weber thanks
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:51,744	| IOT148 |	How am I doing on my coins making money today or they losing money
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:53,280	| IOT148 |	So I tied into the
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:56,608	| IOT148 |	API for binance which is the exchange of values
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:30:00,192	| IOT148 |	And I also tied into the API for lifx bulbs
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:05,824	| IOT148 |	Which are homekit compatible bulbs similar to Philips Hue in that you can change the color of them
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,104	| IOT148 |	And so on so forth
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:08,128	| IOT148 |	What I did was
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:12,736	| IOT148 |	Every two minutes I have a python if I created that uses an API to get
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:13,760	| IOT148 |	The value of
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:16,320	| IOT148 |	Acrylic point and then it takes that data
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:22,464	| IOT148 |	And conditionally changes the light bulb color from green to red I mean the plus a negative
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:24,000	| IOT148 |	And it
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:26,304	| IOT148 |	Take the percentage gain or loss
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:28,608	| IOT148 |	And be that as a brightness
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:30,400	| IOT148 |	Parameter to the lifx bulb
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:34,752	| IOT148 |	So if I wake up and I've got a bright green light in my office I know
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:36,544	| IOT148 |	I had a good night in the crypto coin invest
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:37,824	| IOT148 |	I don't want to see red obviously
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:40,128	| IOT148 |	Right now I'm seeing a little bit of red
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:40,640	| IOT148 |	As we speak
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,944	| IOT148 |	Not good but
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:44,736	| IOT148 |	It's really interesting to me to
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:46,784	| IOT148 |	Have my home
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:48,064	| IOT148 |	Notify me of
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:49,088	| IOT148 |	External
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:51,136	| IOT148 |	Data such as that like I care about
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:53,952	| IOT148 |	And people may not care about crypto coins you could have caused anything
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:55,232	| IOT148 |	You could make a quick
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:55,744	| IOT148 |	Weather
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:58,816	| IOT148 |	App that scans for the actual temperature outside and
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:00,352	| IOT148 |	Lights the bulb 2
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:03,680	| IOT148 |	A certain color and so much there's a lot of implementation so you could do
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:05,216	| IOT148 |	So I'm going to say I've been doing this for
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:05,728	| IOT148 |	4 years using
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:13,152	| IOT148 |	I've told you for years from
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:17,248	| IOT148 |	Used it to show like I actually used to have a light that lit up in my
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:18,528	| IOT148 |	My office if
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:20,576	| IOT148 |	Stock that I followed on Yahoo
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:22,368	| IOT148 |	Finance was moving more than
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:23,392	| IOT148 |	5%
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:29,280	| IOT148 |	Which
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:30,560	| IOT148 |	It's awesome
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:33,632	| IOT148 |	If you are and you should follow Kevin cuz he can probably get more granular
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:35,168	| IOT148 |	Left and there's less of latency
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:38,496	| IOT148 |	But if you're not you can do a similar thing
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:43,616	| IOT148 |	Absolutely absolutely
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:45,920	| IOT148 |	No no no you're hungry
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:47,456	| IOT148 |	Can't write because not everybody wants
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:48,480	| IOT148 |	2 code
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,504	| IOT148 |	And I
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:51,040	| IOT148 |	Took this as a to
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:52,832	| IOT148 |	Factor thing one I want
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:54,880	| IOT148 |	To get that information with a glance
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:57,440	| IOT148 |	Batu and also trying to learn to code
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:58,464	| IOT148 |	Let me know when
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:01,792	| IOT148 |	Stops and starts and what not as I get older it's just it's a fun thing for me
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:03,840	| IOT148 |	So I'd like to even expand this
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:05,632	| IOT148 |	Yes to having notifications
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,912	| IOT148 |	From a voice assistant
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:07,936	| IOT148 |	That says
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:09,728	| IOT148 |	So-and-so is home now
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:14,080	| IOT148 |	Meaning to my canary has that it tells me in the timeline of events
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:14,848	| IOT148 |	I just got home
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:20,736	| IOT148 |	And that data is available in the event logs for an API so I just need to figure that out
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:24,832	| IOT148 |	It's a wide range of applications that you could do any right you don't have a code for it but it's
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:25,344	| IOT148 |	It's really
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:27,136	| IOT148 |	Really a fun experience for me
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:32,768	| IOT148 |	So I will write this out and again you could apply at theoretically to any bit of information or any type of
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:36,096	| IOT148 |	Device that might give you ambien or actual notifications
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:39,168	| IOT148 |	It is time for our
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:40,448	| IOT148 |	Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:41,472	| IOT148 |	Listener
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:42,752	| IOT148 |	Brought you
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:43,264	| IOT148 |	Ashley
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:45,056	| IOT148 |	Maker of electronic
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:50,688	| IOT148 |	Clocks with slate you can have a brand new electronic lock installed in minutes with just a screwdriver and your own two hands
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,736	| IOT148 |	And they're easy to setup and use
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:55,296	| IOT148 |	To see what's possible is it schlage.com
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:56,320	| IOT148 |	To learn more
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:57,600	| IOT148 |	So
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:58,368	| IOT148 |	Here's this week's
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:00,928	| IOT148 |	Stacey Kevin
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:03,232	| IOT148 |	Thank you for the continuous flow of great information
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:06,560	| IOT148 |	When I bought my home it had a pre-existing home security system
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:08,608	| IOT148 |	Hardwired window and doors
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:09,632	| IOT148 |	Pictures Etc
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:11,936	| IOT148 |	Play Never activated it for monitoring little security
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:15,776	| IOT148 |	Do you know of any iot type devices or systems
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:21,664	| IOT148 |	I can tap into this pre-existing Hardware I would love to use the existing sensors to either build my own
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:23,456	| IOT148 |	Do-it-yourself security system
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:24,992	| IOT148 |	Or just incorporate them
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:26,016	| IOT148 |	It's my smartphone
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:28,576	| IOT148 |	I've been looking your system such as SimpliSafe
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:34,976	| IOT148 |	Sensors from Elgato
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:35,744	| IOT148 |	Sensors
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:40,352	| IOT148 |	Windows and doors right next to the listing sensors that are already hard-wired in
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:42,656	| IOT148 |	Thank you for anybody she might have
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:44,960	| IOT148 |	Okay we have
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:46,496	| IOT148 |	An easy solution for you
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:53,152	| IOT148 |	And it's actually very recent solution so you should enjoy this I actually have tested this device out I need to write a
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:55,456	| IOT148 |	But connected
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:56,992	| IOT148 |	That is connected with a k
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:58,784	| IOT148 |	And it's connected. IO
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:03,136	| IOT148 |	Cells and they will ship in March a connected alarm pad
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:04,928	| IOT148 |	That is basically
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:07,232	| IOT148 |	Like a little Arduino that
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,512	| IOT148 |	Hooks into your
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:12,864	| IOT148 |	Existing alarm system and you wire the individual wires
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:13,888	| IOT148 |	To the
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:15,168	| IOT148 |	Arduino and
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:18,240	| IOT148 |	Poop it converts those Wyatt signals into digital signals
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:19,776	| IOT148 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:22,336	| IOT148 |	When it arrives you're going to be like what the what
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:24,640	| IOT148 |	Because I'm basically bored
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:26,432	| IOT148 |	But if you can install a thermostat
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:27,200	| IOT148 |	You can install this
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:28,224	| IOT148 |	And
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:31,296	| IOT148 |	Once you have installed you install SmartThings
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:33,856	| IOT148 |	And you tie it to that and then you have
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:35,904	| IOT148 |	The ability using SmartThings to
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:37,440	| IOT148 |	You control this if you don't have summer things
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:38,464	| IOT148 |	I don't think you can
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:41,792	| IOT148 |	Right right so you can look a little daunting if you
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:43,072	| IOT148 |	He purchases thing in
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:45,120	| IOT148 |	Like you said to take out the box and go what the what
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:48,704	| IOT148 |	You were literally getting a small microprocessor board
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:49,984	| IOT148 |	And
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:50,752	| IOT148 |	You got a
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:52,800	| IOT148 |	Isomers instructions that explain what
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:56,640	| IOT148 |	Wires may go to what IO ports and pins on this thing
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,688	| IOT148 |	But you're literally bridging digital
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:00,736	| IOT148 |	In a wireless and wired with us
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:02,784	| IOT148 |	That's exactly what I think somebody
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:05,344	| IOT148 |	Cool as a wire system wired sensors
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:06,368	| IOT148 |	Would want to
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,392	| IOT148 |	Cortical modernized
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:12,000	| IOT148 |	It certainly is a lot cheaper than ripping everything out and replacing all your sensors because it
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:13,280	| IOT148 |	Depending on how many
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:16,864	| IOT148 |	Sensors that you have makeup but I probably say sensors
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:19,168	| IOT148 |	They range from sickness zones to 24 zones
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:23,776	| IOT148 |	And the prices anywhere from Etsy $675
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:27,360	| IOT148 |	In 24 zones would be up to $165 if you have
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:32,736	| IOT148 |	24 less sensors or up to 20% and 165 bucks is a lot cheaper than replacing All Those sensors
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:35,296	| IOT148 |	And if it looks truly intimidating
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:39,136	| IOT148 |	I'm a magic video installs
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:40,416	| IOT148 |	So
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:41,952	| IOT148 |	Video insults video instructions
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:45,792	| IOT148 |	So they were almost 1800 backers of this
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:46,816	| IOT148 |	Kickstarter and
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:52,448	| IOT148 |	A percentage of those people are going to share their experiences that God chose how they did it what work what did
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:55,520	| IOT148 |	These type of devices usually have a fanbase for a crowd that is
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:58,848	| IOT148 |	More than willing to share information so that everybody benefits
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:03,200	| IOT148 |	Yes and remember you will have to buy a SmartThings Hub but I think those are
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:05,248	| IOT148 |	Or somewhere between fifty and a hundred bucks
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:06,528	| IOT148 |	Depending on sales and
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,832	| IOT148 |	They're very expensive
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:10,880	| IOT148 |	Relatively speaking yes
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:13,184	| IOT148 |	That is our advice
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:13,696	| IOT148 |	To you
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:15,488	| IOT148 |	If you have an iot

EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:24,960	| IOT148 |	And maybe we'll play on the air and
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:27,264	| IOT148 |	We probably will
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:27,776	| IOT148 |	Cuz we're so nice
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:30,336	| IOT148 |	Hats
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:31,616	| IOT148 |	That's a lot of stuff

EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:42,624	| IOT148 |	Brother this year
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:44,928	| IOT148 |	Can The Internet of Things
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:51,328	| IOT148 |	Hey rewind we are taking a break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:53,120	| IOT148 |	Weather is point Central
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:55,168	| IOT148 |	And I have Sean Miller president
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:55,936	| IOT148 |	A poinsettia
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:56,704	| IOT148 |	Scared to talk to her
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:58,496	| IOT148 |	Let's kick it off with
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:36:59,520	| IOT148 |	Ascent
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:00,544	| IOT148 |	Point Center
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:01,824	| IOT148 |	What is it
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:03,616	| IOT148 |	Pointcentral is a leading
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:07,200	| IOT148 |	Provider of home automation technology to short and long-term
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:07,712	| IOT148 |	Property manager
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:10,016	| IOT148 |	What we've done is turn
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:16,160	| IOT148 |	Home automation Tech from Individual gadgets that a homeowner made deploying their individual home into an Enterprise
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:17,952	| IOT148 |	Sweet the property managers do
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:20,768	| IOT148 |	Deploy software and Hardware costs all the homes they manage
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:24,096	| IOT148 |	They both improve their operational efficiency and Delight the resident
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:26,400	| IOT148 |	Okay so you probably have a good sense of
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:27,168	| IOT148 |	What's happening
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:28,704	| IOT148 |	The Smart Home
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:29,216	| IOT148 |	What's new
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:31,264	| IOT148 |	Coming off the heels of Cs
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:33,056	| IOT148 |	One of the big trends that
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:35,104	| IOT148 |	Seems to be continuing to grow with voice
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:41,504	| IOT148 |	We're really excited about voicemail voice has come a long way in three years to feel like it's in the research get the same approximate penetration
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:43,552	| IOT148 |	Home automation in that time
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:44,832	| IOT148 |	And it really helps
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:51,232	| IOT148 |	Residents who are for the first time stepping into a smart home in arcade paid the way for them interact that home and away they find
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:52,000	| IOT148 |	Comfortable
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:55,840	| IOT148 |	Boise and credited with doing away with a lot of the standards drama around the smart
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:57,120	| IOT148 |	For consumers
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:59,424	| IOT148 |	But if someone is actually enabling Smart Home
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:00,448	| IOT148 |	Spore customer
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:01,984	| IOT148 |	You still have to
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:02,752	| IOT148 |	Think about that
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:03,776	| IOT148 |	What are some of the technology
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:08,128	| IOT148 |	When you look at the space out there today they're Z-Wave zigbee
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:08,896	| IOT148 |	Thread
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:11,456	| IOT148 |	Bluetooth Wi-Fi we rely on
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:16,320	| IOT148 |	Z-Wave for the predominant amount of our device communication because we can encrypt it
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:18,880	| IOT148 |	And being in a mesh Network that allows us to
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:20,416	| IOT148 |	To make sure the communication is
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:22,208	| IOT148 |	Reliable and also very low power
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:23,744	| IOT148 |	Turn Wii U
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:25,024	| IOT148 |	A private
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:25,792	| IOT148 |	Encrypted
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:26,816	| IOT148 |	Cellular line
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:28,608	| IOT148 |	You get the data
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:30,912	| IOT148 |	Security Torx
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:35,008	| IOT148 |	Purse I think you'll see a lot of the conversations around
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:36,032	| IOT148 |	What's the right
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:37,056	| IOT148 |	Protocol
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:38,592	| IOT148 |	Settle down probably two winners
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:44,992	| IOT148 |	This year really excited about outside of that was this other thread that was prevalent in CS with this idea
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,016	| IOT148 |	Home start to become smart
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:47,808	| IOT148 |	Write that kind of convenience
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:52,160	| IOT148 |	Savings of people may see as you can look at a mass adopter really needs to
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:52,672	| IOT148 |	Beacon proact
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:56,256	| IOT148 |	I'm at something Point Central really excited about and then
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:59,584	| IOT148 |	With a company alarm.com if you put a lot of resources into
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:00,608	| IOT148 |	What is that look
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:03,424	| IOT148 |	1 servers were rolling out
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:05,728	| IOT148 |	This year is an actual HVAC
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:07,008	| IOT148 |	Predictive notification
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:11,872	| IOT148 |	Conservice so collectively with our parent company alarm.com we have over 5 million homes on her sister
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:13,408	| IOT148 |	Look across
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,432	| IOT148 |	AutoZone jumper
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:15,200	| IOT148 |	Performing
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:19,296	| IOT148 |	Dive into a specific area and notice an average so for example
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:23,904	| IOT148 |	We may see in Phoenix in summer time that it takes 2 hours for home decor for degree
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:26,720	| IOT148 |	Them something when we noticed one home
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:28,768	| IOT148 |	Take 6 hours to cool those same
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:32,096	| IOT148 |	2 degrees we can driving notification to the property manager that says hey
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:33,632	| IOT148 |	There's something going on
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:36,192	| IOT148 |	But you now have the option to go take care of
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:38,752	| IOT148 |	This problem before the resident is upset
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:39,520	| IOT148 |	B
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:40,800	| IOT148 |	Allura cosplay
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:44,128	| IOT148 |	Because you won't be rushing someone out there and dealing with a big problem
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:49,248	| IOT148 |	But rather now can go out and deal with the problem proactively when it's a lower-cost and probably just part of making
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:50,528	| IOT148 |	Gosh
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:51,552	| IOT148 |	I want that now
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:53,344	| IOT148 |	Where can I go to find out more about boys
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:57,952	| IOT148 |	The best place to learn about us is point central.com

EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:30,368	| IOT148 |	Company failure but I think what I have
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:32,160	| IOT148 |	Beyond
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:32,672	| IOT148 |	There is
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:37,536	| IOT148 |	Mystic way of looking at the states which is that
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:38,560	| IOT148 |	Thank you very much

EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:54,943	| IOT148 |	Computing
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:00,063	| IOT148 |	Because it's more

EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:14,655	| IOT148 |	2017 and is continuing
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:17,215	| IOT148 |	I think to struggle going into
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:18,239	| IOT148 |	This year
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:21,055	| IOT148 |	Holiday layoffs
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:22,079	| IOT148 |	Are post-holiday layoffs
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:25,407	| IOT148 |	If I

EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:32,063	| IOT148 |	Do I just give up and go home I think this year is about to be about
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:33,343	| IOT148 |	Major price pressure
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:33,855	| IOT148 |	China
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:36,159	| IOT148 |	So I am curious what your advice to the

EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:17,887	| IOT148 |	By the way
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:18,399	| IOT148 |	China
EDL	00:43:18,911	00:43:23,007	| IOT148 |	Companies that are
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:25,567	| IOT148 |	Absolutely no longer

EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:41,695	| IOT148 |	Space but I've already started coming to the stage
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:43,743	| IOT148 |	In the Life 2
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:46,303	| IOT148 |	I think she looks very particular at 1
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:51,423	| IOT148 |	Space with you
EDL	00:43:51,423	00:43:52,191	| IOT148 |	Voice platforms
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:54,239	| IOT148 |	You see that very quickly has become
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:56,543	| IOT148 |	Racine Country Club
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:44:01,663	| IOT148 |	Google
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:03,199	| IOT148 |	Coming into the state as well

EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:16,511	| IOT148 |	Companies
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:20,095	| IOT148 |	To be able to play in this
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:33,919	| IOT148 |	Now
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:34,943	| IOT148 |	But yeah
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:38,783	| IOT148 |	Ultimately what you want to be
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:39,551	| IOT148 |	Buy The Watch Company
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:46,463	| IOT148 |	We are witnessing Vienna of sage
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:47,743	| IOT148 |	Electrical fire
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:48,255	| IOT148 |	Yours
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:50,559	| IOT148 |	That could perhaps Colby Brenda experiment
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:54,399	| IOT148 |	Yorkshire yours then
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:55,679	| IOT148 |	The Hope was running
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:57,983	| IOT148 |	1
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:59,519	| IOT148 |	Why I didn't connect
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:00,287	| IOT148 |	Dumb products
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:02,847	| IOT148 |	Smart products
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:05,407	| IOT148 |	You could create
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:09,503	| IOT148 |	Products products that brought so much more value
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:13,855	| IOT148 |	Rush to buy them
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:15,135	| IOT148 |	Much higher prices
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:16,927	| IOT148 |	And then the other part was
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:20,255	| IOT148 |	That's hardware was finally getting less hard
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:22,815	| IOT148 |	Your Hardware was
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:25,375	| IOT148 |	But you can go much faster
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:26,143	| IOT148 |	Getaway.
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:32,799	| IOT148 |	So fast forward to
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:34,079	| IOT148 |	Today
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:35,103	| IOT148 |	I think we need
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:37,663	| IOT148 |	The end of that phase
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:40,223	| IOT148 |	Where
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:43,039	| IOT148 |	To posting quite pan out
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:44,831	| IOT148 |	Maybe it's because I started out in the
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:45,599	| IOT148 |	Enterprise
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:48,415	| IOT148 |	It always struck me as odd
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:49,183	| IOT148 |	Having
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:50,719	| IOT148 |	Venture firms investing
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:51,999	| IOT148 |	Consumer products
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:52,767	| IOT148 |	That were
EDL	00:45:52,767	00:45:54,815	| IOT148 |	Hardware-based and had fundamentally
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:45:56,607	| IOT148 |	So
EDL	00:45:57,119	00:45:59,167	| IOT148 |	Do you think Venture firm should still
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:00,703	| IOT148 |	Be investing in
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:01,215	| IOT148 |	In consumer

EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:09,663	| IOT148 |	This is where you like them
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:14,783	| IOT148 |	Even
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:16,831	| IOT148 |	Cordon of course
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:17,343	| IOT148 |	I love you
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:25,023	| IOT148 |	Because
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:26,815	| IOT148 |	Marv Jenson
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:31,679	| IOT148 |	Part of the excitement
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:34,239	| IOT148 |	Was that affected connectivity
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:35,519	| IOT148 |	The hardware parts
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:37,055	| IOT148 |	Would become less important
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:38,079	| IOT148 |	N.
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:40,127	| IOT148 |	Software update
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:42,431	| IOT148 |	Woodstock Outlet
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:43,967	| IOT148 |	Entirely different category
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:45,759	| IOT148 |	Business model
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:51,135	| IOT148 |	And open the door to Ultrazone
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:51,903	| IOT148 |	Business model
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:56,767	| IOT148 |	2 today
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:46:58,047	| IOT148 |	Tianjin Pool Products
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:02,911	| IOT148 |	So let's move
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:03,935	| IOT148 |	From consumers
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:05,983	| IOT148 |	It's so dead
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:08,543	| IOT148 |	Let's talk about this idea
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:10,847	| IOT148 |	Building infrastructure for the iot
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:13,151	| IOT148 |	Because I think that's going to get us into some
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:15,967	| IOT148 |	Enterprise efforts and some of the Industrial
EDL	00:47:16,735	00:47:17,247	| IOT148 |	So
EDL	00:47:18,015	00:47:19,039	| IOT148 |	When you're talking about
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:22,623	| IOT148 |	Infrastructure you brought it to Cloud Edge
EDL	00:47:22,623	00:47:23,135	| IOT148 |	Connectivity
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:25,439	| IOT148 |	I'm curious
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:27,743	| IOT148 |	Where you sink kind of the most action
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:30,047	| IOT148 |	Happened in the most mature sex
EDL	00:47:34,655	00:47:35,423	| IOT148 |	CBD
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:35,935	| IOT148 |	In the lab
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:40,799	| IOT148 |	You're good news for the entire space
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:42,335	| IOT148 |	Thundercloud
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:43,359	| IOT148 |	Pink weave
EDL	00:47:44,895	00:47:48,735	| IOT148 |	The first phase were a lot of the top 5 providers
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:50,527	| IOT148 |	Largely assumed that
EDL	00:47:50,527	00:47:53,599	| IOT148 |	Their core Legacy Cloud offering
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:55,903	| IOT148 |	Turn the needs of iot companies
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:47:57,439	| IOT148 |	Pretty well
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:58,463	| IOT148 |	But I think
EDL	00:47:58,463	00:48:00,511	| IOT148 |	As always
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:04,863	| IOT148 |	The detail nothing Quinn company started working on top of the clouds
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:10,239	| IOT148 |	The good news is that so
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:14,079	| IOT148 |	You're the story of announcements providers offering
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:24,319	| IOT148 |	Google jumped into The Fray and launched the iot Cloud Core
EDL	00:48:24,319	00:48:25,087	| IOT148 |	So now you have
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:32,767	| IOT148 |	Which Cloud offering Hawaii
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:35,327	| IOT148 |	Because
EDL	00:48:35,839	00:48:38,143	| IOT148 |	As we all know cloud computing
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:40,191	| IOT148 |	Accelerate
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:40,703	| IOT148 |	The number
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:51,455	| IOT148 |	Edge computing
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:51,967	| IOT148 |	No mortgage
EDL	00:48:59,135	00:48:59,903	| IOT148 |	Intelligence
EDL	00:49:00,415	00:49:05,279	| IOT148 |	Two node level sensor
EDL	00:49:05,279	00:49:08,351	| IOT148 |	They can do different things we can decide what
EDL	00:49:09,375	00:49:10,911	| IOT148 |	Come to the cloud
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:22,431	| IOT148 |	Send everything
EDL	00:49:29,343	00:49:30,367	| IOT148 |	That's even better
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:32,927	| IOT148 |	Is true actually have the notes
EDL	00:49:32,927	00:49:33,951	| IOT148 |	Decision
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:35,231	| IOT148 |	That's one step
EDL	00:49:35,231	00:49:38,047	| IOT148 |	Direction intelligence
EDL	00:49:38,047	00:49:42,143	| IOT148 |	Connect to eventually
EDL	00:49:42,143	00:49:43,423	| IOT148 |	And what about the
EDL	00:49:44,191	00:49:45,727	| IOT148 |	Connectivity is Richmond
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:49,055	| IOT148 |	Shooting range connectivity witches in the world
EDL	00:49:49,055	00:49:50,847	| IOT148 |	Your Bluetooth and wifi

EDL	00:49:58,271	00:49:59,807	| IOT148 |	That is a Shelly
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:00,831	| IOT148 |	Well-dressed problems
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:04,671	| IOT148 |	Up until now how much
EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:05,695	| IOT148 |	Lift well
EDL	00:50:05,695	00:50:07,487	| IOT148 |	Problem with long range

EDL	00:50:13,887	00:50:18,239	| IOT148 |	So early entrance like the clock example that's created a
EDL	00:50:18,751	00:50:19,775	| IOT148 |	Network
EDL	00:50:21,567	00:50:23,103	| IOT148 |	Connect in a way that
EDL	00:50:25,151	00:50:26,175	| IOT148 |	Consuming too much
EDL	00:50:26,175	00:50:31,551	| IOT148 |	Battery for the question
EDL	00:50:31,551	00:50:32,063	| IOT148 |	Things to do
EDL	00:50:34,623	00:50:37,439	| IOT148 |	Waiting for a response
EDL	00:50:43,583	00:50:49,471	| IOT148 |	NB iot
EDL	00:50:56,127	00:50:57,919	| IOT148 |	Call Frank
EDL	00:51:08,927	00:51:12,767	| IOT148 |	Launch carriers as well as some during 15
EDL	00:51:12,767	00:51:16,607	| IOT148 |	Are thinking about this issue and that therefore this issue
EDL	00:51:16,607	00:51:17,631	| IOT148 |	Eventually go away
EDL	00:51:18,911	00:51:20,447	| IOT148 |	Picture if I think about
EDL	00:51:20,447	00:51:21,727	| IOT148 |	In the space force
EDL	00:51:22,751	00:51:23,775	| IOT148 |	I'm interested
EDL	00:51:23,775	00:51:25,311	| IOT148 |	Space but just technology
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:27,615	| IOT148 |	Feel like we have
EDL	00:51:27,615	00:51:28,383	| IOT148 |	Moved
EDL	00:51:28,383	00:51:29,151	| IOT148 |	Towards
EDL	00:51:29,151	00:51:30,687	| IOT148 |	More distributed
EDL	00:51:30,687	00:51:31,455	| IOT148 |	Ways of
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:33,247	| IOT148 |	And now
EDL	00:51:33,759	00:51:35,295	| IOT148 |	With the Internet of Things
EDL	00:51:35,295	00:51:36,575	| IOT148 |	We're trying to make something
EDL	00:51:37,343	00:51:38,367	| IOT148 |	Even more disturbing
EDL	00:51:38,367	00:51:39,135	| IOT148 |	More diffuse
EDL	00:51:40,159	00:51:42,719	| IOT148 |	And so when I look at startups in this space
EDL	00:51:43,231	00:51:45,023	| IOT148 |	That's what gets me really excited
EDL	00:51:46,047	00:51:47,583	| IOT148 |	Sinister decentralisation aspect
EDL	00:51:47,583	00:51:49,119	| IOT148 |	You mentioned in your
EDL	00:51:49,119	00:51:49,631	| IOT148 |	SA
EDL	00:51:50,911	00:51:53,471	| IOT148 |	So I feel like we should talk about the rule of blotchy
EDL	00:51:55,775	00:52:02,175	| IOT148 |	The blockchain conceptually
EDL	00:52:02,175	00:52:03,455	| IOT148 |	Well with the name
EDL	00:52:03,455	00:52:06,271	| IOT148 |	Call Steve mobile
EDL	00:52:06,271	00:52:08,575	| IOT148 |	Connected objects one
EDL	00:52:08,575	00:52:09,855	| IOT148 |	Kia Spectra
EDL	00:52:11,391	00:52:11,903	| IOT148 |	Providing
EDL	00:52:13,183	00:52:13,951	| IOT148 |	Shorty
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:15,999	| IOT148 |	Which says that we know has become
EDL	00:52:17,279	00:52:18,047	| IOT148 |	Dairy
EDL	00:52:18,047	00:52:19,839	| IOT148 |	Important aspect
EDL	00:52:22,143	00:52:24,191	| IOT148 |	Wait. You're moving into my next topic
EDL	00:52:24,703	00:52:25,727	| IOT148 |	So
EDL	00:52:27,007	00:52:30,335	| IOT148 |	We'll talk about that in the second like I think it's interesting
EDL	00:52:30,335	00:52:31,103	| IOT148 |	One of the things I can
EDL	00:52:32,383	00:52:33,151	| IOT148 |	Authentication
EDL	00:52:33,663	00:52:35,455	| IOT148 |	Which is sort of like secure
EDL	00:52:36,735	00:52:37,247	| IOT148 |	Credibility
EDL	00:52:37,759	00:52:39,295	| IOT148 |	And I also think it's interesting
EDL	00:52:39,295	00:52:40,319	| IOT148 |	For things like
EDL	00:52:40,319	00:52:40,831	| IOT148 |	Micropenis
EDL	00:52:41,599	00:52:43,647	| IOT148 |	Antenna digital transactions
EDL	00:52:43,647	00:52:46,207	| IOT148 |	Without between are things which I think is
EDL	00:52:46,207	00:52:49,023	| IOT148 |	I think that is if that's not going to be a big trend
EDL	00:52:49,023	00:52:51,071	| IOT148 |	This coming year it should be a big trend
EDL	00:52:51,071	00:52:51,583	| IOT148 |	The following
EDL	00:52:52,351	00:52:54,399	| IOT148 |	Because it's essential and we can't get any
EDL	00:52:56,191	00:52:57,471	| IOT148 |	The General
EDL	00:52:57,471	00:52:59,263	| IOT148 |	Concepts of data Exchange
EDL	00:53:08,479	00:53:08,991	| IOT148 |	Your
EDL	00:53:10,527	00:53:13,087	| IOT148 |	Temperature to talk to your connected
EDL	00:53:13,087	00:53:16,159	| IOT148 |	Refrigerator
EDL	00:53:16,671	00:53:17,439	| IOT148 |	Or
EDL	00:53:17,439	00:53:18,463	| IOT148 |	Object
EDL	00:53:18,463	00:53:21,279	| IOT148 |	But if you can tie those objects
EDL	00:53:21,279	00:53:22,047	| IOT148 |	What's the blockchain
EDL	00:53:27,679	00:53:30,495	| IOT148 |	Where is the other objects next week
EDL	00:53:34,335	00:53:34,847	| IOT148 |	Friction labs
EDL	00:53:36,383	00:53:36,895	| IOT148 |	Kill
EDL	00:53:38,431	00:53:38,943	| IOT148 |	Skip forward to
EDL	00:53:39,455	00:53:42,015	| IOT148 |	Security and it's cousin privacy
EDL	00:53:42,015	00:53:42,783	| IOT148 |	Because
EDL	00:53:42,783	00:53:44,575	| IOT148 |	You talked a lot about security
EDL	00:53:44,575	00:53:47,391	| IOT148 |	Port so I'm curious but then you didn't talk at all about
EDL	00:53:47,391	00:53:48,159	| IOT148 |	Privacy
EDL	00:53:48,159	00:53:54,559	| IOT148 |	And I'm really interested in how both on the consumer side and on the Enterprise how concerns about
EDL	00:53:54,559	00:53:56,095	| IOT148 |	Privacy and what happens to people
EDL	00:53:56,095	00:53:58,655	| IOT148 |	Will stay that changes your investment PCS
EDL	00:53:58,655	00:54:00,191	| IOT148 |	How the sort of thing will develop what we
EDL	00:54:01,983	00:54:03,775	| IOT148 |	So let's kick it off with security
EDL	00:54:04,287	00:54:05,823	| IOT148 |	Assurity is
EDL	00:54:10,175	00:54:15,295	| IOT148 |	Ultimate
EDL	00:54:18,111	00:54:19,903	| IOT148 |	Look at the time
EDL	00:54:20,927	00:54:23,231	| IOT148 |	Enterprise
EDL	00:54:23,231	00:54:26,815	| IOT148 |	Security and the cheerleaders to Portuguese there
EDL	00:54:30,655	00:54:32,447	| IOT148 |	Security for
EDL	00:54:32,447	00:54:33,983	| IOT148 |	The company's
EDL	00:54:33,983	00:54:37,055	| IOT148 |	People building products that don't
EDL	00:54:39,871	00:54:42,687	| IOT148 |	Emergency
EDL	00:54:42,687	00:54:46,271	| IOT148 |	API type company books
EDL	00:54:50,367	00:54:51,135	| IOT148 |	Bill
EDL	00:54:51,135	00:54:56,767	| IOT148 |	And I used to products
EDL	00:54:57,279	00:55:00,351	| IOT148 |	Can you get insurance in your product
EDL	00:55:00,351	00:55:01,631	| IOT148 |	YouTube
EDL	00:55:01,631	00:55:03,167	| IOT148 |	Security Experts
EDL	00:55:04,447	00:55:04,959	| IOT148 |	How do you spell
EDL	00:55:06,239	00:55:12,639	| IOT148 |	Problem for the industry in general because he continues to be
EDL	00:55:12,639	00:55:13,663	| IOT148 |	Not because
EDL	00:55:13,663	00:55:15,199	| IOT148 |	They don't think that's dirty
EDL	00:55:15,711	00:55:16,991	| IOT148 |	Is importance butts
EDL	00:55:16,991	00:55:18,527	| IOT148 |	Because
EDL	00:55:20,575	00:55:22,879	| IOT148 |	To be able to ship the products
EDL	00:55:26,719	00:55:30,047	| IOT148 |	Product review
EDL	00:55:31,071	00:55:37,215	| IOT148 |	Sell more products
EDL	00:55:37,727	00:55:41,055	| IOT148 |	And then you know I have a little bit of sincerity but then.
EDL	00:55:41,055	00:55:42,335	| IOT148 |	Later when
EDL	00:55:44,127	00:55:46,175	| IOT148 |	Global products in the field
EDL	00:55:46,175	00:55:47,967	| IOT148 |	So now let's talk about privacy
EDL	00:55:48,479	00:55:49,247	| IOT148 |	Because
EDL	00:55:49,247	00:55:51,551	| IOT148 |	I didn't see it and I'm curious about your thoughts
EDL	00:55:52,063	00:55:52,831	| IOT148 |	How
EDL	00:55:52,831	00:55:55,135	| IOT148 |	Concerns over privacy and data
EDL	00:55:55,135	00:55:56,671	| IOT148 |	On the consumer
EDL	00:55:56,671	00:55:57,183	| IOT148 |	Enterprise side
EDL	00:55:57,951	00:55:59,231	| IOT148 |	Affect us in the area
EDL	00:55:59,743	00:56:01,023	| IOT148 |	Privacy

EDL	00:56:20,479	00:56:22,527	| IOT148 |	Something that the entire industry need to
EDL	00:56:23,039	00:56:24,063	| IOT148 |	Think about
EDL	00:56:25,855	00:56:27,391	| IOT148 |	Becoming

EDL	00:56:45,055	00:56:46,335	| IOT148 |	Tricky situations tomorrow
EDL	00:56:49,151	00:56:52,223	| IOT148 |	In some cases a lack of privacy in the ability to
EDL	00:56:52,223	00:56:53,247	| IOT148 |	Collect data
EDL	00:56:53,247	00:56:54,783	| IOT148 |	Core of a lot of these business model
EDL	00:56:55,295	00:56:57,087	| IOT148 |	Whether it's consumer or if it
EDL	00:56:57,087	00:56:57,599	| IOT148 |	Is aggregating
EDL	00:56:58,111	00:56:58,879	| IOT148 |	Information on
EDL	00:56:58,879	00:57:00,415	| IOT148 |	Like what how a motor sound so you
EDL	00:57:01,183	00:57:01,951	| IOT148 |	Predictably predict
EDL	00:57:03,231	00:57:04,255	| IOT148 |	I think that is
EDL	00:57:04,255	00:57:06,303	| IOT148 |	True at the same time
EDL	00:57:06,303	00:57:08,351	| IOT148 |	Think you can address
EDL	00:57:08,863	00:57:09,375	| IOT148 |	Privacy
EDL	00:57:10,399	00:57:14,239	| IOT148 |	Fairly effectively
EDL	00:57:14,239	00:57:15,007	| IOT148 |	Priority
EDL	00:57:15,007	00:57:16,031	| IOT148 |	So they are

EDL	00:57:27,039	00:57:28,575	| IOT148 |	Locally
EDL	00:57:28,575	00:57:29,599	| IOT148 |	For example
EDL	00:57:29,599	00:57:31,135	| IOT148 |	Benton deicide

EDL	00:57:43,935	00:57:45,983	| IOT148 |	State a test but you can make
EDL	00:57:45,983	00:57:50,079	| IOT148 |	The business decision to spend a fair amount of time and effort
EDL	00:57:50,079	00:57:52,127	| IOT148 |	To make sure that whatever you provide to
EDL	00:58:00,063	00:58:01,343	| IOT148 |	Let's do one
EDL	00:58:01,343	00:58:02,367	| IOT148 |	Final question
EDL	00:58:02,879	00:58:03,647	| IOT148 |	You witches
EDL	00:58:03,647	00:58:04,671	| IOT148 |	What are you
EDL	00:58:04,671	00:58:05,439	| IOT148 |	Excited about

EDL	00:58:15,679	00:58:20,799	| IOT148 |	Don't have the hardware components that are
EDL	00:58:20,799	00:58:21,567	| IOT148 |	Interesting
EDL	00:58:26,175	00:58:29,759	| IOT148 |	Usually important and Aries that's far as I know no
EDL	00:58:29,759	00:58:31,551	| IOT148 |	Clear winner
EDL	00:58:31,551	00:58:35,391	| IOT148 |	I think that's such a good investment
EDL	00:58:38,207	00:58:41,023	| IOT148 |	Thomas vehicle to Vertical farming
EDL	00:58:41,023	00:58:42,559	| IOT148 |	Is interesting a thing

EDL	00:58:49,727	00:58:50,751	| IOT148 |	Because you
EDL	00:58:50,751	00:58:53,055	| IOT148 |	Do you work with industrial that comes
EDL	00:58:54,591	00:58:55,615	| IOT148 |	Software background

EDL	00:59:24,287	00:59:27,359	| IOT148 |	Has been built a company that experiment
EDL	00:59:31,711	00:59:32,223	| IOT148 |	And what
