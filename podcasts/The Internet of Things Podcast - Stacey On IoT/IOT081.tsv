EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:13,728	| IOT081 |	Update
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:16,800	| IOT081 |	All right
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:20,384	| IOT081 |	First we have a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:21,408	| IOT081 |	Arm

EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:58,272	| IOT081 |	A-arm petco.com
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:58,784	| IOT081 |	So
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:00,064	| IOT081 |	Let's gets
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:01,088	| IOT081 |	Started with the show
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:02,112	| IOT081 |	Kevin guess what I did
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:05,184	| IOT081 |	I'm guessing you got a new wink
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:10,560	| IOT081 |	I did actually I got that earlier but they told me to wait to make sure my my software was all up-to-date
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:15,936	| IOT081 |	So last night I transferred my old wink Hub my V1
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:18,496	| IOT081 |	To the V2 version 2 Hub
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:20,288	| IOT081 |	And I will say two things about
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,336	| IOT081 |	It worked
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:24,896	| IOT081 |	Two words
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:26,944	| IOT081 |	This is really exciting it actually work
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,480	| IOT081 |	So
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:29,760	| IOT081 |	So what's the process like
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:31,040	| IOT081 |	The process is like
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:32,320	| IOT081 |	This you
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,088	| IOT081 |	Plug-in
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:34,880	| IOT081 |	The new hub
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:37,696	| IOT081 |	You keep your ass so you keep your old Hub plugged in
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:38,720	| IOT081 |	You plug in the new hub
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:39,744	| IOT081 |	You can either connect
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:42,560	| IOT081 |	Headed to ethernet or you can use because now it has an Ethernet port
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:48,192	| IOT081 |	Or you can connect to Wi-Fi I like to just to do it over Wi-Fi because
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,472	| IOT081 |	One of the hubs to
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:49,984	| IOT081 |	Senior each other
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,776	| IOT081 |	So
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:52,544	| IOT081 |	You
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,568	| IOT081 |	Open your Wink app
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:54,848	| IOT081 |	And it's like
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,384	| IOT081 |	Wink
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:00,224	| IOT081 |	It's okay I think there's any wink you're like there is anyway
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,504	| IOT081 |	And you put it on your network
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:06,368	| IOT081 |	And this is the first time as an Android User that I've had something come on to my network
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,416	| IOT081 |	In a way
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:12,000	| IOT081 |	It was seamless because normally I actually have to turn off my
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:14,304	| IOT081 |	Cellular data on the Android because it's constantly
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:15,840	| IOT081 |	Trying to
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:20,192	| IOT081 |	Whenever I try to connect to a connected device the Wi-Fi process
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,216	| IOT081 |	Becomes all wacky
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:21,984	| IOT081 |	My phone's like
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:25,312	| IOT081 |	No we cannot be connected to the internet so that it dries and it messes up
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,104	| IOT081 |	Right because
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:28,128	| IOT081 |	Four people have
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:31,456	| IOT081 |	No setup say it echo or something similar
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,736	| IOT081 |	When can your case
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:38,368	| IOT081 |	You're actually connecting your phone for the app to whatever the device is directly over Wi-Fi
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:41,952	| IOT081 |	So the phone says hey I need my connectivity and that's probably what happens if
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:43,488	| IOT081 |	Falling back to Cellular
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:44,768	| IOT081 |	Exactly in
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,560	| IOT081 |	It's big frustrating thing
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:50,144	| IOT081 |	Is it happens to you a lot in her life is that happening just turn off your cellular
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:53,216	| IOT081 |	Temporarily just temporarily
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:54,752	| IOT081 |	Unless you like me and you
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,824	| IOT081 |	Please call me
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,872	| IOT081 |	Nobody calling me anymore
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,664	| IOT081 |	That's true
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,688	| IOT081 |	All right
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:05,248	| IOT081 |	That was a notable thing and I was excited about that
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,272	| IOT081 |	Sewveryeasy
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,320	| IOT081 |	Then it's like
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:13,952	| IOT081 |	You got an old wake up and would you like to transfer your programs and everything over
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:15,488	| IOT081 |	Like people yes I would
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:20,863	| IOT081 |	So if it bought for a minute and said the process will take approximately 10 minutes
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:24,447	| IOT081 |	And you will have to manually reconnect your Lutron light
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,215	| IOT081 |	And I was like
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,823	| IOT081 |	I was like that's okay cuz I've got a couple
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:30,335	| IOT081 |	What programs
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,383	| IOT081 |	So I said yes
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,687	| IOT081 |	The lights flashed it was very exciting
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:37,247	| IOT081 |	Pink blue green colors
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,015	| IOT081 |	And then
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:40,063	| IOT081 |	It was like hey I'm done
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,343	| IOT081 |	Now let's connect your Lutron
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:44,927	| IOT081 |	Actually it was really nice because it said hear the
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,463	| IOT081 |	Here are the four light switches we see
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:48,255	| IOT081 |	Do you want to connect them
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:55,935	| IOT081 |	It's at and I was like okay so I clicked on the connect button I walked over to the light switch and you basically hold down your light switch
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:58,239	| IOT081 |	Until it flashes
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,007	| IOT081 |	And then
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:01,567	| IOT081 |	Stop holding on and the wink makes his connection
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,103	| IOT081 |	So
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:07,199	| IOT081 |	That's how it's supposed to happen and that's actually what it does but for me and this is
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,479	| IOT081 |	This is actually been abuse of mind
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:09,759	| IOT081 |	For like
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:11,039	| IOT081 |	Ears
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:12,831	| IOT081 |	It has this affirmation error
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,367	| IOT081 |	It never tells you it's succeed
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:17,695	| IOT081 |	Might only about 50% of the time will tell me that
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:19,231	| IOT081 |	The connection has been successful
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:22,303	| IOT081 |	So mine actually timed out was like
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,095	| IOT081 |	Something's gone wrong
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,631	| IOT081 |	And then when it
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:27,167	| IOT081 |	I was like okay cancel
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:27,935	| IOT081 |	Then it would show up as
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,263	| IOT081 |	So
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,287	| IOT081 |	That's kind of odd
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,335	| IOT081 |	It is but it's not
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,103	| IOT081 |	For me it wasn't it
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:38,431	| IOT081 |	Especially
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,735	| IOT081 |	If you guys are going to do this and you know that's going to happen
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:43,551	| IOT081 |	Just wait and see if it connects cuz I was like dang it
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,087	| IOT081 |	I'm failing at this
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,623	| IOT081 |	But then I was like
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:51,999	| IOT081 |	YouTube manually had to do your Lutron stuff
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,279	| IOT081 |	But did you have other
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:54,303	| IOT081 |	Other things
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:06:00,191	| IOT081 |	Yeah okay so we'll be so it just carry over all the connections as for lack of a better word
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:01,727	| IOT081 |	To your other devices
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:04,031	| IOT081 |	And probably any robots and
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,079	| IOT081 |	Shortcuts on
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:06,847	| IOT081 |	Song
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:08,127	| IOT081 |	I was mid
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:11,199	| IOT081 |	Schedule item so my Halloween lights were on
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:14,271	| IOT081 |	They were scheduled to go off later that night
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:18,111	| IOT081 |	And lo and behold they did it was like nothing had changed
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,391	| IOT081 |	Titan Magic
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:21,695	| IOT081 |	And my doors unlocked and lock
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:22,975	| IOT081 |	So the Z-Wave
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:23,999	| IOT081 |	Just fine
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,535	| IOT081 |	Yes yes
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,071	| IOT081 |	It also works with the Zippy stuff
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:30,655	| IOT081 |	Garage door open and close just fine
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:32,703	| IOT081 |	And
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,727	| IOT081 |	I'm trying to think what else might be on there
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:38,847	| IOT081 |	I have some outlets on there and they worked so everything transferred seamlessly and it was
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:41,151	| IOT081 |	Other than the minor like
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:42,687	| IOT081 |	The Lutron isn't working
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:43,967	| IOT081 |	Oh wait it is
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,759	| IOT081 |	It was great so
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,039	| IOT081 |	If you're going to buy a new wink
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:50,879	| IOT081 |	I haven't live with it long enough to say wow this is
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:51,647	| IOT081 |	A real Improvement
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:54,975	| IOT081 |	Write more processing power there's
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:55,743	| IOT081 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:56,511	| IOT081 |	In here
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,047	| IOT081 |	I don't have anything that I was like
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:00,607	| IOT081 |	So
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:03,423	| IOT081 |	I haven't lived with it enough to know that like
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:05,215	| IOT081 |	Do you really need this Hub if
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,239	| IOT081 |	If you have an existing
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:06,751	| IOT081 |	Happy wink
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:13,407	| IOT081 |	When this was first announced that's kind of where I was. I do I'm very happy with the wink Hub. I haven't liked do I need to upgrade
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:17,503	| IOT081 |	People again why I think the big draw here is the
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,271	| IOT081 |	Ethernet port
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:19,551	| IOT081 |	Ethernet maybe blue
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:20,831	| IOT081 |	Who has more things
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:21,343	| IOT081 |	StarTalk
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,671	| IOT081 |	You haven't
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:32,351	| IOT081 |	Right I don't have a lot of fun fact I don't think I have any Bluetooth devices in the house or smart home anyway
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:37,471	| IOT081 |	If I were looking at something then maybe I would upgrade of the sea
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:40,031	| IOT081 |	It would be nice I mean cuz like Bluetooth Mash isn't
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:40,543	| IOT081 |	All that
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,103	| IOT081 |	Two lights
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,407	| IOT081 |	Alps
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:46,943	| IOT081 |	A little bit better
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:48,735	| IOT081 |	But that's really the only reason I can think
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:50,527	| IOT081 |	Pick up right now or if you have the locks in your life
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:51,039	| IOT081 |	Woobox
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:55,135	| IOT081 |	That is the wink Hub and I really enjoyed it
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,927	| IOT081 |	And now Kevin
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,951	| IOT081 |	It's time for your show
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,487	| IOT081 |	Oh
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:03,839	| IOT081 |	Well actually not show until cuz I don't have something in hand to
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,887	| IOT081 |	Talk about
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:10,239	| IOT081 |	Oh okay so yes yes I do I'm holding right now
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:12,031	| IOT081 |	To the Google pixel
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:13,311	| IOT081 |	Reviews came out
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:15,359	| IOT081 |	And why do we care about that on the show
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,663	| IOT081 |	Welco's Google
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,943	| IOT081 |	As assistant
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:21,759	| IOT081 |	Built into the phone it's baked right in and
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,527	| IOT081 |	In fairness
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:28,671	| IOT081 |	Google Assistant if you're not familiar it really is a updated or rehash version of the
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:31,999	| IOT081 |	I don't want to say it so I'll just say the assistant
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:34,303	| IOT081 |	I want to say in exit off people's phones right now
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:37,119	| IOT081 |	The assistant feature that's already been an Android
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,911	| IOT081 |	Plus the Google on tap
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:45,823	| IOT081 |	Function which could scan your screen and show you web information based on what's on your screen so if your
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,103	| IOT081 |	You know searching for
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,895	| IOT081 |	Hotel monatik
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:50,687	| IOT081 |	Could pop up with directions and such
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:54,527	| IOT081 |	In any case it's all Now call Google assistance what's a rebranding its
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:56,575	| IOT081 |	Exclusive to the Google pixel phone
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:03,743	| IOT081 |	And you can speak to it and it's like a boss that will when teligent we speak back to you and
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,023	| IOT081 |	Show you information
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:06,303	| IOT081 |	But what it doesn't do
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:07,583	| IOT081 |	Yet
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:11,167	| IOT081 |	It really didn't somebody over computer wrote this article answer
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,703	| IOT081 |	It's actually pretty good article it says
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:15,007	| IOT081 |	Google pixel phone packs a powerful
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,031	| IOT081 |	Voice assistant
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,823	| IOT081 |	But it's no
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,591	| IOT081 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:21,151	| IOT081 |	And actually the article is dubbed
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,175	| IOT081 |	By The Echoes
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,199	| IOT081 |	Name
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:24,223	| IOT081 |	An impression
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,015	| IOT081 |	They were exactly
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,783	| IOT081 |	And that's really
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,087	| IOT081 |	A good observation and good point
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,111	| IOT081 |	Why isn't that
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:30,879	| IOT081 |	You know it
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:33,695	| IOT081 |	There just isn't enough third-party integration yet
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:34,975	| IOT081 |	And yet this
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:39,071	| IOT081 |	Service has been around for at least two maybe three years
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:42,911	| IOT081 |	And I would love to be able to get my new pixel which does arrive next
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:45,215	| IOT081 |	Text will have it not to show and tell but I'll have it
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,239	| IOT081 |	For the show
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,263	| IOT081 |	Next week
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:48,543	| IOT081 |	But it's just like
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:52,127	| IOT081 |	Will the episode which untapped potential there
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,663	| IOT081 |	And I'm sure Google is
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:55,967	| IOT081 |	Google is play nicely with others in the
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:56,991	| IOT081 |	Past so
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,015	| IOT081 |	You know it took
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:04,927	| IOT081 |	People forget this but Wendy Echo launched in December in the preview mode it didn't actually have any of the smart home stuff until
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:08,511	| IOT081 |	March and I didn't buy it until March 4th at recent that's a good point
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:14,143	| IOT081 |	And in it we also do have Google home that is
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:14,911	| IOT081 |	Coming out
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:15,423	| IOT081 |	Which
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:18,239	| IOT081 |	When I get mine
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:22,847	| IOT081 |	Yes or yes we are so that will actually directly
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,383	| IOT081 |	Compete against the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:28,479	| IOT081 |	For music and information and Smart Home
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:29,759	| IOT081 |	Capabilities although
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,807	| IOT081 |	Again comes down to Partners
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,343	| IOT081 |	There are not as many partners
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:36,415	| IOT081 |	With Google home there are with Amazon Echo so
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:42,559	| IOT081 |	Nests and if this then that I think
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:46,911	| IOT081 |	Yeah so it's on my wings not going to work with and that's all I can live with that
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:48,959	| IOT081 |	A Time
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:53,311	| IOT081 |	ESO the pieces are all there but they're still being put together I guess is my point it's kind of
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:55,871	| IOT081 |	I'm just disappointed that they're not on this
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:11:02,271	| IOT081 |	True first Google made by Google phone which is really one of the Keef exclusive features is the Google app
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:02,783	| IOT081 |	Assistant
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:08,159	| IOT081 |	But yet you're not going to be able to at least yet you don't control things with your voice from your phone
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,743	| IOT081 |	Just another Asian little disappointment on my part
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,559	| IOT081 |	I'll get over
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,095	| IOT081 |	With the echo
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:16,607	| IOT081 |	You can't control
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:19,935	| IOT081 |	Phone unless you download something like Rogers or
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,447	| IOT081 |	Lexi
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:23,007	| IOT081 |	I've been disappointed that for a while
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:24,543	| IOT081 |	Download Lex
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:28,383	| IOT081 |	INRI I know I could do that absolutely
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,407	| IOT081 |	Play it just it just
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:31,199	| IOT081 |	Now Amazon if you're listening
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:35,295	| IOT081 |	We don't need Bluetooth remotes when we have bluetooth on a phone that has a microphone
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:36,831	| IOT081 |	Anyway
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,343	| IOT081 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:38,367	| IOT081 |	Start
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,207	| IOT081 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:43,743	| IOT081 |	Stats
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:44,255	| IOT081 |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:45,535	| IOT081 |	What do we have here
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:50,655	| IOT081 |	What do we have here what we talked about the ecobee Lite
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:54,239	| IOT081 |	That was sleet rumored Etc official
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,519	| IOT081 |	And it really is
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:59,359	| IOT081 |	Light because it's lighter and price at $169
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:06,527	| IOT081 |	Enoch little later and functionality because I do not see any mention of the ability to add one of the key feature
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,831	| IOT081 |	Pictures of ecobee remote sensors
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,647	| IOT081 |	I love Simon on that one
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:15,743	| IOT081 |	I can see their thinking in the thinking here is
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:17,023	| IOT081 |	They want to compete
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,071	| IOT081 |	With Nest at a lower price point
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,095	| IOT081 |	So
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:20,863	| IOT081 |	David she's not here
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:22,143	| IOT081 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:23,935	| IOT081 |	Kananaskis
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:24,703	| IOT081 |	Full price
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:25,215	| IOT081 |	Ss250
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:30,335	| IOT081 |	A lot of people actually say that they don't the sensor functionality isn't a huge thing to
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,615	| IOT081 |	The people who aren't crazy Cooling
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,919	| IOT081 |	Right right so
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:37,247	| IOT081 |	You know it's a learning thermostat connect all these things they're like
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,783	| IOT081 |	Hey that's cool I'll take it
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:41,343	| IOT081 |	So I can see is this like
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:42,367	| IOT081 |	World-changing news
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,671	| IOT081 |	Is it smart
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,719	| IOT081 |	And maybe we'll see a lower price nest
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,487	| IOT081 |	Possibly
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:48,511	| IOT081 |	And I
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,279	| IOT081 |	Because Honeywell
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:52,607	| IOT081 |	Actually just a couple weeks ago released
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:55,679	| IOT081 |	There were they actually change their thermostat lineup down for
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,191	| IOT081 |	I'm like 32
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,799	| IOT081 |	The lyric T5
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:03,615	| IOT081 |	And that is $149
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,663	| IOT081 |	Tyler's basically does everything
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,455	| IOT081 |	The Nest Inn
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,479	| IOT081 |	I guess that you could be like that
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,295	| IOT081 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,087	| IOT081 |	$150
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:14,623	| IOT081 |	Right
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,159	| IOT081 |	Directions to home
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:16,671	| IOT081 |	Catan
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,279	| IOT081 |	Isn't that so
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:23,839	| IOT081 |	It's a learning thermostat as well it's just not a
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:25,119	| IOT081 |	Not a digital thermostat
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,655	| IOT081 |	Yeah it looks what is it
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:27,679	| IOT081 |	Avenue said it look
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:30,495	| IOT081 |	It looks to me
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:35,103	| IOT081 |	Like an Apple Watch just not on your resident with a strap it's a it's a square
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,895	| IOT081 |	With rounded Corners thermostat
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:39,199	| IOT081 |	Just very basic looking
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:41,247	| IOT081 |	Looks nice I think it's appealing
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:46,367	| IOT081 |	It's kind of funny because Honeywell actually sued Nest over there circular design
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,951	| IOT081 |	How do you spell pioneer that circular
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:53,279	| IOT081 |	Babies harder to
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,559	| IOT081 |	Build I don't know enough
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,327	| IOT081 |	Enough about Manufacturing
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:59,935	| IOT081 |	So the other thermostat news in the section
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:00,703	| IOT081 |	Because why not
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:03,007	| IOT081 |	Nest changed its Auto away
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,543	| IOT081 |	Praising to eco
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:08,639	| IOT081 |	Because AutoWay confused people or people would put their
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:11,455	| IOT081 |	Thermostats on to Auto away to try to get the little leaves
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,015	| IOT081 |	Sleeveless vest
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,295	| IOT081 |	I forgot how to say
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:20,927	| IOT081 |	So they were like you know what let's just call it go and make people feel good cuz that's what they're being
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,695	| IOT081 |	Eco-friendly
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:25,023	| IOT081 |	Yeah I'm just looking at the
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:27,071	| IOT081 |	The news on this
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:30,399	| IOT081 |	Didn't really it like so now you've got you know
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:33,983	| IOT081 |	You can actually turn it to Ego in like turn it automatically to the leaf
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:35,519	| IOT081 |	Used to be
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:36,543	| IOT081 |	Like if you were right
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:38,591	| IOT081 |	Really jonesing for a leaf you had to turn in
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:39,871	| IOT081 |	Up in the
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:41,407	| IOT081 |	Summer or down in the winter
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,735	| IOT081 |	For me it's always up
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,527	| IOT081 |	Because Texas is still ungodly High here
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,063	| IOT081 |	October
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:48,575	| IOT081 |	But
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:50,111	| IOT081 |	That's how
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:51,647	| IOT081 |	I triggered Alief but
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:54,207	| IOT081 |	Now you can just turn it to eco
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:54,975	| IOT081 |	Feel good about yourself
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:56,767	| IOT081 |	Interesting
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:59,071	| IOT081 |	And you have to manually switch it back
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,143	| IOT081 |	Correct
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:05,983	| IOT081 |	Integer multiples of deer on each one of those Nest thermostats
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,335	| IOT081 |	There we go
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:13,407	| IOT081 |	Then they still have a way so
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,431	| IOT081 |	When you wander off
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:17,503	| IOT081 |	Your home will still going to a way and will trigger all these other thing
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,015	| IOT081 |	EXO
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:22,879	| IOT081 |	One of the reasons they did it is because people would be like let's tell that I'm away
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:26,207	| IOT081 |	And then like their lights and all sorts of stuff would go
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:27,743	| IOT081 |	Go crazy another were still at home and
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:29,791	| IOT081 |	Make sense
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,583	| IOT081 |	Make sense
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,863	| IOT081 |	So there we go
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,143	| IOT081 |	Very exciting
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:39,263	| IOT081 |	Like I said there was a light section
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:40,287	| IOT081 |	Light section
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:41,823	| IOT081 |	Alright so
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,847	| IOT081 |	The other thing
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:44,127	| IOT081 |	I wanted to talk about this week
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:45,407	| IOT081 |	Is Phillips
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,711	| IOT081 |	Neither is there we go
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:53,855	| IOT081 |	I had to talk about these because I got the new richer color
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:54,879	| IOT081 |	Philips Hue
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:55,391	| IOT081 |	Light bulb
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:56,927	| IOT081 |	And
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:16:01,279	| IOT081 |	Amazing I used it like the gold standard for me was the life Expo
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:06,143	| IOT081 |	Because they could do these amazing greens and it made this beautiful turquoise blue that I love
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:08,703	| IOT081 |	Philips conduit
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:10,495	| IOT081 |	Until now
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:12,543	| IOT081 |	So now they have the richer color light bulbs
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:14,591	| IOT081 |	And I'm like well hot diggity
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:18,431	| IOT081 |	Everything is better although I still have unifor of the
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,967	| IOT081 |	Actually I like six of the old
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:23,295	| IOT081 |	Choose him like I don't want to upgrade them but
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,855	| IOT081 |	They can't do turquoise
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,391	| IOT081 |	I'm not spinning
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:34,303	| IOT081 |	How much are these out of curiosity are the same price as the old Philips Hue bulbs so that is 60
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,071	| IOT081 |	Taxable for
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:37,375	| IOT081 |	Downlights and
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:39,679	| IOT081 |	204 a starter kit with
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,191	| IOT081 |	The Hub Ann
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,215	| IOT081 |	3 volts
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,263	| IOT081 |	Ceph
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:45,055	| IOT081 |	It's not like I'm more expensive
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,335	| IOT081 |	They're the same price
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:50,175	| IOT081 |	Are you to replace with wood cost a lot of money but for people are buying the first time
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:51,711	| IOT081 |	The same price as before
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:52,991	| IOT081 |	Enable
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:54,527	| IOT081 |	And I like them
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,039	| IOT081 |	And
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:17:00,415	| IOT081 |	You know I know that I talked about a lot of different light bulbs on the show off tuck also
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,439	| IOT081 |	Starting this month
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:05,279	| IOT081 |	The new Philips Hue down lamps that I've been
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,559	| IOT081 |	Denso jonesing for
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,583	| IOT081 |	The last few years
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,119	| IOT081 |	BR30 flood lights that are
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:11,167	| IOT081 |	Are the white ones those are out
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,471	| IOT081 |	Now I believe
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:15,519	| IOT081 |	And they or maybe next week
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,823	| IOT081 |	And they're going to be 40 bucks Apple
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,383	| IOT081 |	So
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,151	| IOT081 |	Yay
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,175	| IOT081 |	Very exciting
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:27,295	| IOT081 |	And all the accessories that Phillips has makes this
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:31,647	| IOT081 |	Really like it's hard for me to go into other light bulbs now
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,183	| IOT081 |	Cuz they got everything
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:36,511	| IOT081 |	Fairly reasonable price these are $10 more than I think
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:38,559	| IOT081 |	Actually only $5 more than the osram
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:39,327	| IOT081 |	In color
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:41,631	| IOT081 |	Osram white lights in the BR30 s
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:42,655	| IOT081 |	So
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,471	| IOT081 |	I just feel like
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:47,263	| IOT081 |	Because of the The Hub that you need
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:49,311	| IOT081 |	For Philips bulbs
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:53,407	| IOT081 |	I just feel like there's a lock in kind of thing there because
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:57,759	| IOT081 |	But github doesn't work with many other things
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,783	| IOT081 |	Github works with
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,295	| IOT081 |	Everything
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:01,599	| IOT081 |	It even works with the Google home Kevin
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:05,951	| IOT081 |	Well I'm not saying it right you're you're correct your
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:08,255	| IOT081 |	I don't know
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:11,839	| IOT081 |	No yeah I guess that's what it is I guess that's what it is
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:14,399	| IOT081 |	Observing like you should see my little
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:17,215	| IOT081 |	Yeah I did
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:22,079	| IOT081 |	I don't want a hug for everything I add to my house I mean that just kind of silly to me
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:22,847	| IOT081 |	Do you know
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:25,151	| IOT081 |	I'm in Ontario makes a Drake has so many things
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:26,943	| IOT081 |	Work with existing outside I get that
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:32,575	| IOT081 |	You enjoy them that's all music
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:39,231	| IOT081 |	A picture a picture of your house like the Willy Wonka Factory with all these colors and
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,023	| IOT081 |	Lights go in them
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,375	| IOT081 |	Chocolate River
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:51,519	| IOT081 |	No chocolate River in Filipino you have to buy all these apps to actually do some really cool stuff with it because their app is pretty
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,799	| IOT081 |	Like run-of-the-mill
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:56,639	| IOT081 |	And nobody has a great UI yet for doing color transfer like
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:58,943	| IOT081 |	Changing colors in lights I'll be honest
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:03,295	| IOT081 |	Now if you want to change the color or cetacean you got to manually create it and then you
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:05,599	| IOT081 |	Call it something that you remember and then
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,903	| IOT081 |	You know you can you can do like
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,951	| IOT081 |	You can tell the echo
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,463	| IOT081 |	Pocono
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:11,743	| IOT081 |	Turn it to Sunset
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:14,047	| IOT081 |	That feels real
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:15,839	| IOT081 |	Silly silly
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:17,631	| IOT081 |	So
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,399	| IOT081 |	That's still something
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:20,191	| IOT081 |	Like I can't say make it turkey
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:24,543	| IOT081 |	All right final little thing because
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:28,639	| IOT081 |	Maybe you guys are as obsessed about this as I am but I like
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:33,503	| IOT081 |	Actually I don't like counting calories I theoretically want to count calories but I'm really lazy
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:35,551	| IOT081 |	I'd also like to eat so it
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:36,831	| IOT081 |	Depressing
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,855	| IOT081 |	I like consuming them
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,135	| IOT081 |	I like
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:42,207	| IOT081 |	But you can now ask the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,743	| IOT081 |	Hey
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,255	| IOT081 |	A
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:46,559	| IOT081 |	How many calories are in
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:48,095	| IOT081 |	A cinnamon roll
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,631	| IOT081 |	And she will tell you
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,167	| IOT081 |	Yes
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:57,823	| IOT081 |	And that's yes and that thank you Stacey for making me do that before the show detest it I will never have one again that I love them
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:58,591	| IOT081 |	I love.
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,871	| IOT081 |	How many calories are in a
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:07,551	| IOT081 |	I think it was around 330 per hundred grams of cinnamon roll at 9 just ordered 100 grams of 7
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:08,319	| IOT081 |	I can tell you that
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:11,903	| IOT081 |	But I actually have no idea what I
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:16,511	| IOT081 |	About a hundred pickup weight of a hundred paper clips which is
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:18,815	| IOT081 |	Not that much
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,095	| IOT081 |	Thank you
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,631	| IOT081 |	Not that much
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,423	| IOT081 |	So there we have it
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:27,519	| IOT081 |	A lot of calories in a cinnamon roll the echo will tell you in
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,287	| IOT081 |	You will probably
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,103	| IOT081 |	All right
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,639	| IOT081 |	Stay tuned
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,407	| IOT081 |	We have
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:38,015	| IOT081 |	A message from our sponsor HP and then we also after that
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:39,807	| IOT081 |	A conversation with Michael Wolff
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:40,575	| IOT081 |	About
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,343	| IOT081 |	The smart kitchen
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:45,439	| IOT081 |	Where the service fits Reddit
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:51,839	| IOT081 |	Hey everyone we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast for a word from our sponsor this we sponsor is Hewlett-Packard
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:56,959	| IOT081 |	Enterprise in to talk to us today about analytics at the edge we have dr.tom
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:21:02,847	| IOT081 |	Brad it she was a VP and general manager for servers and iot systems at hpe
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:04,383	| IOT081 |	Tom
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:07,967	| IOT081 |	We talked about the internet of things being about data
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:14,111	| IOT081 |	And you want to take it further and say that it's also about insights
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:16,416	| IOT081 |	And in fact the data
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,184	| IOT081 |	At the edge
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:18,976	| IOT081 |	At The Internet of Things
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:22,048	| IOT081 |	Is older and faster and bigger than all
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:23,584	| IOT081 |	All the types of Big Data come on
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:29,728	| IOT081 |	But what is more profound and I like to take to another level is it's the inside that's the right from the day
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,752	| IOT081 |	That's the Renwick
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:33,824	| IOT081 |	And then further after the inside is dry what action
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:38,688	| IOT081 |	Staking and I like to look at innisfree age there's the acquisition of the data analysis
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,224	| IOT081 |	Ebony action
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:41,760	| IOT081 |	And the business value or the
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:45,600	| IOT081 |	Scientific or engineering value is manifested in that flask
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,880	| IOT081 |	That's what you called the action
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:52,768	| IOT081 |	This whole segment is on analytics at the edge so why is doing this at the edge so essential
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:55,840	| IOT081 |	Action is the address where the Saints resign
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:59,680	| IOT081 |	NBC15 Flora city tram

EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:04,288	| IOT081 |	And doing analytics at the edge
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:06,336	| IOT081 |	It's so crucial for 7
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:08,640	| IOT081 |	I'm very very quickly
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:11,200	| IOT081 |	It takes time to go to the cloud or just a location
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:13,248	| IOT081 |	With the information and get an answer back
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:15,040	| IOT081 |	What is bandwidth
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:18,112	| IOT081 |	Internet of Things presents a big analog data
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:20,672	| IOT081 |	Tremendous amount of data logging
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,696	| IOT081 |	Bamboo spikes
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:22,720	| IOT081 |	30 cost
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,000	| IOT081 |	One has to pay for
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,560	| IOT081 |	The bandwidth even if one has the bandwidth
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,840	| IOT081 |	Security

EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:33,984	| IOT081 |	Is exposing more vulnerable to cyber attacks and hack
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:35,008	| IOT081 |	This is
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:40,640	| IOT081 |	A duplication of resources when one caches and storage data at the engine the needs to send it all back to
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:42,944	| IOT081 |	Play center there will be some
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:47,808	| IOT081 |	Duplication of resource is this notion of corruption and reliability
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:48,832	| IOT081 |	It's too flat
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:50,112	| IOT081 |	And packets to drop
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:52,416	| IOT081 |	And descendants of 7 is
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:56,768	| IOT081 |	Are there a corporate or federal rules and regulations that govern
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:58,816	| IOT081 |	A transfer of data
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:00,608	| IOT081 |	Alright give him those 7 reasons
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:01,632	| IOT081 |	What is h
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,168	| IOT081 |	Have. For hair
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:05,472	| IOT081 |	Hpe offers both
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:10,080	| IOT081 |	The cloud approach to doing analytics in the aisle seat and also the edge approach
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:11,360	| IOT081 |	Two doing analytics in the iot
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:14,432	| IOT081 |	Depending on what is needed we offer very deep

EDL	00:23:55,648	00:24:02,048	| IOT081 |	Hey everyone this is Stacey Higginbotham and we are back with the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:06,400	| IOT081 |	Today's guest is Mike Wolfe who is the creator of the smart Kitchen Summit
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:08,192	| IOT081 |	And an analyst who covers this Ma
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,984	| IOT081 |	Hey Mike how are you doing
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,032	| IOT081 |	You forgot friend of the show
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:15,616	| IOT081 |	Download why did I forgot friendship not just a friend of the show but if
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:16,128	| IOT081 |	A friend of mine
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:18,688	| IOT081 |	Work together known each other
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:19,456	| IOT081 |	For a long time
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:22,784	| IOT081 |	Before I had this show and even worked with him at gigaom I used to
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,064	| IOT081 |	Call him because he was a
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,624	| IOT081 |	Your wireless analyst covering things like Bluetooth
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:29,696	| IOT081 |	Wireless in digital home
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:32,256	| IOT081 |	At ABI research way-back-when about 10 years ago
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,280	| IOT081 |	I know
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:34,304	| IOT081 |	We're so old
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:34,816	| IOT081 |	We are
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:36,096	| IOT081 |	I'm old
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,888	| IOT081 |	You look the same I've got a lot of gray hair
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:41,216	| IOT081 |	I'm a vampire in
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:41,728	| IOT081 |	You got gray hair
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:43,008	| IOT081 |	Here we go
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:44,800	| IOT081 |	So Mike you recently did
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,848	| IOT081 |	This event is smart
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:48,384	| IOT081 |	Kitchen Summit which was
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,152	| IOT081 |	Awesome
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:50,944	| IOT081 |	I loved it I loved attending it
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:52,736	| IOT081 |	And I walked away from it and I said
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:55,552	| IOT081 |	Bismarck kitchen is dumb
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:58,368	| IOT081 |	So that was my take
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,416	| IOT081 |	You'd loved it
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,952	| IOT081 |	But then you said this Market
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,720	| IOT081 |	Is dumb
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,256	| IOT081 |	You know nothing works together
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:05,792	| IOT081 |	You tell me
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,840	| IOT081 |	What is the smart
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:11,680	| IOT081 |	Kitchen what is this tell me what your vision is here
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:14,240	| IOT081 |	It's about
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:18,080	| IOT081 |	New technologies coming into the kitchen surrounding food
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:23,712	| IOT081 |	And in just kind of hoping to reinvent that way then that's something as simple as that connected
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,736	| IOT081 |	Meat thermometer
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:27,552	| IOT081 |	To something like the juicero which isn't it
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:28,576	| IOT081 |	Like an entire
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:33,184	| IOT081 |	Indecision trees were like an ecosystem where this is complete vertical integration
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:34,208	| IOT081 |	Based on the fact that
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,512	| IOT081 |	Music connected device
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:38,048	| IOT081 |	It looks up and down
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:39,840	| IOT081 |	Of the supply chain
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:43,424	| IOT081 |	There's a lot of different aspects to it enough reasonable to read mention of cooking
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:45,216	| IOT081 |	Was that Sia Precision cooking
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:47,520	| IOT081 |	Etc there's just a lot of different
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:51,872	| IOT081 |	Things that are now trying to change the way we cook Away by food we eat
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:55,968	| IOT081 |	That's one of the reasons I wanted Savannah just kind of Explorer all that together
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:56,736	| IOT081 |	So
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:59,040	| IOT081 |	Let's break this down because you have
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:01,088	| IOT081 |	Basically cover the entire
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:03,648	| IOT081 |	Basically what you're talking about is like adding intelligence to the
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:05,952	| IOT081 |	Where is the most
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:10,816	| IOT081 |	Stuff happening where is the real like where where we making actual strides here
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,608	| IOT081 |	There's obviously
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:18,752	| IOT081 |	Big Appliance makers that are looking at okay now we can actually connect these things at intelligence
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:21,568	| IOT081 |	And have data you know we've never really had
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:25,920	| IOT081 |	If you're an appliance manufacturer even you're a food maker you never had
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:27,712	| IOT081 |	Point of consumption data
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:28,736	| IOT081 |	Before
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:31,552	| IOT081 |	And so that's actually possible you're starting to see
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:36,928	| IOT081 |	These platforms be put in place with an arsenic in it but also you know, like perfect company
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:43,584	| IOT081 |	Jackie spun out of data business I'm were there actually doing datametrics for people who sell things like vodka
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:44,864	| IOT081 |	And they can give you
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:51,776	| IOT081 |	Did around the types of drinks people are making it in Fairly real time so that's actually pretty fascinating stuff all that
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:54,592	| IOT081 |	Information that Sgt based probably on surveys before
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:56,640	| IOT081 |	Or Nielsen type of panels
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,944	| IOT081 |	That's why I think that's really exciting
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:27:00,992	| IOT081 |	If you're some sort of company that
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:04,064	| IOT081 |	The mix food or provides consumables into the home
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:05,344	| IOT081 |	Okay and we should
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:07,392	| IOT081 |	Stop here and say the perfect company
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:08,672	| IOT081 |	Makes
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:10,464	| IOT081 |	It's a scale
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:10,976	| IOT081 |	For the kitchen
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,000	| IOT081 |	And
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:15,584	| IOT081 |	It is a scale that can be used to measure out cocktails
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:17,376	| IOT081 |	Stood for baking
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:19,680	| IOT081 |	Or even they just launched at your show
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,216	| IOT081 |	Making like
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:22,240	| IOT081 |	Smoothies in a blender
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:24,032	| IOT081 |	That's
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:25,568	| IOT081 |	For everyone who's like what who's this
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:31,968	| IOT081 |	It's a cheap scale it's a cheap scale but it's a skill that actually provides metrics they actually partnered with Vitamix
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:34,016	| IOT081 |	Two people probably know from
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:37,088	| IOT081 |	People making platters slender Evergreen
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:39,648	| IOT081 |	And they met last year might have been
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:40,672	| IOT081 |	I think big
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:46,816	| IOT081 |	Harder makers who sell stuff in the small pint division at Target or whatever want to make these things more intelligent
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:49,888	| IOT081 |	Where you at you and I know that this is true that is okay
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:53,216	| IOT081 |	What can you do with that makes it interesting I think
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:54,496	| IOT081 |	Xiaomi providing data metric
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:57,568	| IOT081 |	To the people are selling food and somebody that is interesting
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:04,224	| IOT081 |	Prophetic a lot of it's about like how can you make the consumers lives better cuz the consumers who's the one who puts down the hard-earned cash
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:08,576	| IOT081 |	Two different themes I saw emerging out of this as you know
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:11,648	| IOT081 |	Automation and intelligence could be out at 2
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,672	| IOT081 |	Devices for cooking
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:14,464	| IOT081 |	So let's go into this cuz
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:15,744	| IOT081 |	There are
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:19,584	| IOT081 |	I heard two kind of different audiences kind of jumped out at me
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:20,352	| IOT081 |	83
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:21,120	| IOT081 |	At your show
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:22,400	| IOT081 |	When was
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:26,752	| IOT081 |	We're going to teach people who don't know how to cook how to cook cuz Millennials have grown up and they know nothing about cooking
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:30,336	| IOT081 |	To was
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:31,616	| IOT081 |	People who want to make
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:34,176	| IOT081 |	Crazy fancy or esoteric stuff
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,736	| IOT081 |	Like the picobrew and all the sous vide
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:42,624	| IOT081 |	And there's the Practical Cooks who just want a fast dinner on the table this is me I was bugging people I was like
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:48,768	| IOT081 |	When can you have something that looks at what I have in cheddar it's a grocery list or looks at my family's likes it is like
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:49,536	| IOT081 |	Like cures like
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:51,328	| IOT081 |	4 meals you can make this week in less than 30
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:53,376	| IOT081 |	So
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:56,704	| IOT081 |	Starting with that let's talk about what you saw for the kind of
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:58,240	| IOT081 |	Learn docker
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:00,800	| IOT081 |	Can a fancy expertise kind of
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:01,312	| IOT081 |	Area
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:03,360	| IOT081 |	What interesting things I think
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:07,200	| IOT081 |	A lot of the same underlying technology service both of those archetypes
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:08,736	| IOT081 |	Is Iran a panel
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:11,808	| IOT081 |	During the day and we talked about this some of these archetypes
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:13,856	| IOT081 |	What are things we can I reach the conclusion of
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:15,648	| IOT081 |	I may be one of these
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,928	| IOT081 |	These people in the middle wig
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:18,464	| IOT081 |	And I may be a different person
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:20,768	| IOT081 |	On the weekend so if I'm tired
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:22,560	| IOT081 |	My kids are beating it out for me
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:24,864	| IOT081 |	I know I have to provide them with some food I made
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:25,632	| IOT081 |	Have some sort of
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:28,960	| IOT081 |	Device that has a web automation that makes my life easier
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:35,616	| IOT081 |	Button on the weekend I want maybe some sort of guidance to give me a safety net to take my scrap a higher level
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:38,944	| IOT081 |	I don't know if you served those two audiences with the same piece of technology
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:41,504	| IOT081 |	Maybe you can with something like a thermomix
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:48,160	| IOT081 |	Or or something like the Hess in Q thermomix is like I had never heard of this but this is like
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:49,952	| IOT081 |	$1,800 piece of
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:56,096	| IOT081 |	It's a crazy I have one of my house I'm trying it out it's mainly been sold in Europe
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:59,168	| IOT081 |	To the tune of a couple million a year
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:29:59,936	| IOT081 |	Well in Europe
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:02,752	| IOT081 |	Just now bringing it to the US it's
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:05,056	| IOT081 |	It's a device that's like one of these 10 in one devices
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,848	| IOT081 |	It's like the instant pot
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:07,360	| IOT081 |	Steroids
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:09,408	| IOT081 |	Is it is it is
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:13,504	| IOT081 |	But it's not when he's crazy and if you seen in these are craske robotic
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:16,832	| IOT081 |	Types of cooking devices from somebody San Francisco
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:19,392	| IOT081 |	Took him to sing is more
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:21,952	| IOT081 |	Two more practical and then ready for Market
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:24,768	| IOT081 |	To get back to where you asked about there are these different
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:25,280	| IOT081 |	Audiences
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:29,888	| IOT081 |	A lot of the same technology in particular Automation and in some sort of like intelligence
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:30,912	| IOT081 |	Surenos
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:33,216	| IOT081 |	But ultimately is probably different type of product
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:39,360	| IOT081 |	That is serving those types of people and we have both cuz I I have two practical me that I have like the guy wants
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,640	| IOT081 |	To be like a better home chef
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:43,712	| IOT081 |	What seems like a good idea for
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:44,480	| IOT081 |	People who are like
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:49,344	| IOT081 |	For People Like Us in the middle of the week
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,112	| IOT081 |	My weekday shift
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:55,232	| IOT081 |	Acting like a really cool party sure could be something like the Artesian like actually some sort of like robotic
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:58,048	| IOT081 |	Drink mixer I think with itin terrible mixing drinks
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:31:00,352	| IOT081 |	That was another start that we had
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:03,936	| IOT081 |	Call the bar startups I will say I love them and Theory
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:05,216	| IOT081 |	And for a party trick
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:12,128	| IOT081 |	But they all have these tubes and you got to fill things up with alcohol
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:18,272	| IOT081 |	I feel like something like that the scales are a little bit nicer because you could just stick everything on there and they take care
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:19,296	| IOT081 |	Portions for
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:25,952	| IOT081 |	I will say it having you use the thermomix which is a scale bass system that there's real utility there cuz you just
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:29,792	| IOT081 |	You're literally just pouring drinks in it and you watch the little
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:32,096	| IOT081 |	Geico
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:33,376	| IOT081 |	So you're right that actually
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:37,728	| IOT081 |	That works really well scale BAE systems work really well if you
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:41,056	| IOT081 |	Don't want to pull up measuring cups to catch raso
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:45,664	| IOT081 |	Yeah
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:48,480	| IOT081 |	The Gooden Center I think it was called the the Nema
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:51,040	| IOT081 |	I like that I mean I do think
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:51,808	| IOT081 |	Having
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:54,368	| IOT081 |	Routers with serious food allergies
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:56,160	| IOT081 |	If that they could provide some sort of
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:58,464	| IOT081 |	Device where they can go out
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:02,304	| IOT081 |	Teeter or even something at home then know that they're not going to flake pop up like a
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:03,584	| IOT081 |	Puffer fish
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:05,376	| IOT081 |	I think there's real value in that
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:08,704	| IOT081 |	Those are just a couple of Pokemon that I think there's a lot of different technology
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:10,752	| IOT081 |	Did you try the juicero juice did you like it
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:12,032	| IOT081 |	I did like the juicero
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:13,824	| IOT081 |	Snail to me this feels
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:15,104	| IOT081 |	Less like a home Gadget
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:16,896	| IOT081 |	More like a
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:18,944	| IOT081 |	A commercial kitchen kind of
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:20,224	| IOT081 |	Anything because
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:23,296	| IOT081 |	There are two things that I learned about
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:26,624	| IOT081 |	Did you Sarah is a $700 device
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:29,696	| IOT081 |	What is 5 to $7
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:31,488	| IOT081 |	Packets and it's cold pressed
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:34,816	| IOT081 |	Juice in the ingredients take hold the whole time
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:38,144	| IOT081 |	The first thing that was really cool is
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:42,240	| IOT081 |	The CEO is trying to build a business around basically
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:43,008	| IOT081 |	Iot everywhere
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:45,824	| IOT081 |	So he's taking for granted that he's got to guarantee
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:47,616	| IOT081 |	Cold Supply Chain which is really awesome
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:49,152	| IOT081 |	Cuz that's
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:52,480	| IOT081 |	So far been really hard to do really Out Of Reach unless you're like
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:52,992	| IOT081 |	Like really wealthy
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:54,272	| IOT081 |	Refrigerated
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:56,064	| IOT081 |	Tracks right
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,856	| IOT081 |	That I didn't know is that
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:03,488	| IOT081 |	These juice packets because they're fresh fruits and vegetables you can actually use them in cooking which I thought
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:04,000	| IOT081 |	It's kind of fun
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:06,048	| IOT081 |	The reason I wanted
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:11,680	| IOT081 |	Him to get out season 2 like a kind of almost a case study because Lake Easton something really unique way
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:13,728	| IOT081 |	What you would do with this end-to-end
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:15,008	| IOT081 |	From the home all the way back
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:16,544	| IOT081 |	Supply chain created this entire
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:19,360	| IOT081 |	Secretion and delivery system
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:22,432	| IOT081 |	If he talked about how he tried to go out and talk to food processing plants
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:23,712	| IOT081 |	Create this
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:24,224	| IOT081 |	In Dino
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:28,064	| IOT081 |	Tino Martinez, she really did that in her how much she had this vision is headphone
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:28,832	| IOT081 |	Beginning
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:32,160	| IOT081 |	Yeah that's why they raised on $1000000 to kind of Bill out this entire
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:33,952	| IOT081 |	Everything I think you're right
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:37,024	| IOT081 |	I think initially it'll do well in
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:39,328	| IOT081 |	Restaurants near Michael vultaggio
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:40,864	| IOT081 |	This that's what we chef
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:41,888	| IOT081 |	He really said about the juicer
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:45,472	| IOT081 |	Because he says don't want to necessarily put cold pressed juice
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:46,752	| IOT081 |	Juicers in there in there
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:48,288	| IOT081 |	Space-constrained kitchens
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:50,592	| IOT081 |	I also they're going to do well in my
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:54,176	| IOT081 |	Cafeterias like places like Google
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:56,992	| IOT081 |	High-end cafeterias within not Heinz Ketchup
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:03,648	| IOT081 |	But over time if they get to the point where they can reduce the cost and I could see you like this one really popular
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:06,464	| IOT081 |	I think you get it pulled out of three or four in the dollar price point
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:11,072	| IOT081 |	This is a premium product people who get cold pressed juice or not
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:12,096	| IOT081 |	People hurting for money
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:15,680	| IOT081 |	They're willing to spend $10 at retail for a glass of juice
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,704	| IOT081 |	So I don't think this
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:19,520	| IOT081 |	The sticker shock of $7 is really that shocking to them
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:22,336	| IOT081 |	Cuz they have this lifestyle with their want to spend that type of money
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:23,616	| IOT081 |	That is a lot of money
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:30,016	| IOT081 |	That was one of the other things I noticed so all of these devices that you know oven is $1,500 I can't remember
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:31,296	| IOT081 |	How much the hestan cue
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:33,856	| IOT081 |	Cooking setup which is a pan and
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:36,160	| IOT081 |	Induction cooker that
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:39,744	| IOT081 |	You don't know what's the temperature of the pan and what you're trying to cook it
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:40,512	| IOT081 |	Basically cook set
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:42,816	| IOT081 |	All of these things feel
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:47,680	| IOT081 |	Like I don't know you remember bread machines from like the 80s
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,704	| IOT081 |	They feel like
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:49,472	| IOT081 |	Bread machine
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:50,240	| IOT081 |	Switch
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:54,592	| IOT081 |	You know everyone loves warm baked bread but very few people kept their bread machine somewhere like
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:56,896	| IOT081 |	Yeah. I'm still making it
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:01,248	| IOT081 |	When asked
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:04,320	| IOT081 |	Chris Young chefsteps hear what is going to be
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:07,904	| IOT081 |	The fondue Machine versus like something that has
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:09,696	| IOT081 |	Real sticking power that's still
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:11,232	| IOT081 |	Ultimate Eternal question ever talk about
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:15,072	| IOT081 |	New devices in the kitchen cuz if you know it's kind of become a cliche now
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:18,656	| IOT081 |	Major Innovation microwave in the microwave
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:20,192	| IOT081 |	So you know
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:26,592	| IOT081 |	I hope you know I was just going back into asking a damn Visa buys it and I know what's going on with your cooking tonight
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:27,616	| IOT081 |	That's really interesting to me
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:29,408	| IOT081 |	Cruises embracing that
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:31,200	| IOT081 |	Cuz I feel like that that's really interesting
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:36,832	| IOT081 |	The guys from Nova Steve got up and talked about okay we want to do a Combi oven I sent you a copy of them for the kitchen
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:41,952	| IOT081 |	No one's really down a really good consumer, Ava and end in does no doubt that steam actually adds water
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:44,000	| IOT081 |	An oven that has
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:47,840	| IOT081 |	You know heating but I'll sounds like steam Alamance excetera Apso
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:49,376	| IOT081 |	They're really popular in
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:52,192	| IOT081 |	In professional kitchens but no one's really consumer eyes. Well
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:53,984	| IOT081 |	So
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:55,520	| IOT081 |	That is the ultimate ROM
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:59,616	| IOT081 |	Question what is a gadget in like a parlor trick versus what has real staying power
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:06,528	| IOT081 |	I don't think that all these things are expensive we talked about the high price but I think you know you're obviously sing low price sous vide circulator as you have another perfect
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:07,296	| IOT081 |	Scale
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:08,832	| IOT081 |	Any price went down there
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:11,136	| IOT081 |	What sticks is can be really interesting
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:16,256	| IOT081 |	I think the appliance manufacturers big Appliance manufacturers embracing things like in it is really interesting
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:21,120	| IOT081 |	How fast has become common features and how much consumers use those walls also be interesting to watch
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:22,656	| IOT081 |	Okay fair enough
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:23,936	| IOT081 |	And then
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:27,520	| IOT081 |	I feel like cooking and kitchens today like everything's pretty attitude
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:31,360	| IOT081 |	Even if I get like another device in my
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,128	| IOT081 |	My kitchen
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:33,664	| IOT081 |	Is there anything that
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:36,992	| IOT081 |	We're going to replace so should I be like hey
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:38,784	| IOT081 |	My next house isn't going to have
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,320	| IOT081 |	Adamant
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:43,648	| IOT081 |	I didn't like I-4 like in in 10 years my house will have a thermostat
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:44,416	| IOT081 |	Right
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:48,512	| IOT081 |	Some people like you won't carry Keys is there anything in the kitchen that you're like
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:49,280	| IOT081 |	Hey
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:51,072	| IOT081 |	Stacey you're going to get rid of your garbage.
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:53,376	| IOT081 |	I don't know I don't know
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:58,240	| IOT081 |	If you get rid of things I think that's one of the things we're talking about on the first day is like
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:36:59,776	| IOT081 |	Jonny Gray
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:01,568	| IOT081 |	Talk about your there's only so much space you have
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:02,848	| IOT081 |	Anyang
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:03,872	| IOT081 |	Kitchen countertops
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:06,688	| IOT081 |	That is a real consideration Bachelor
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:08,736	| IOT081 |	You're fighting for space
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:11,296	| IOT081 |	And so if something comes maybe something else
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:11,808	| IOT081 |	To go
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:14,880	| IOT081 |	So that's really interesting conversation I think that's why
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:17,952	| IOT081 |	People like home builders need to be part of this conversation
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:19,488	| IOT081 |	I think that's Broderick
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:20,768	| IOT081 |	The Justice smart kitchen right I think
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:22,304	| IOT081 |	Overtime
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:25,120	| IOT081 |	As more technology comes into our lives
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:26,912	| IOT081 |	We have technology goes into the fabric of
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:29,472	| IOT081 |	The countertops in the beams and all that
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:32,800	| IOT081 |	Like that's a really interesting conversation to have
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:35,360	| IOT081 |	So the built-in appliances
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:37,152	| IOT081 |	If you build an appliance like an oven
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:39,456	| IOT081 |	And it has technology for home builder
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:42,272	| IOT081 |	You better make sure that that has a lifespan of
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,552	| IOT081 |	10 / 20 years
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:45,600	| IOT081 |	And Samsung doesn't decide to say
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:49,184	| IOT081 |	Okay we're going to move on because we thought this would be really great I did have a Twitter client
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:50,464	| IOT081 |	In our oven
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:52,256	| IOT081 |	So we could
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:52,768	| IOT081 |	What is baking
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:56,352	| IOT081 |	Now it's not going to work this we decided not to support that software anymore so
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:38:03,008	| IOT081 |	I don't know if I answer your question directly as in the say I think that's a big important conversation for not only the pipe like home builders accept
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:04,800	| IOT081 |	You did not answer me
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:10,944	| IOT081 |	But that's okay I'm just thinking back like high-end kitchens now usually have to have a wine
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:12,224	| IOT081 |	4hr beverage fridge
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:13,504	| IOT081 |	The kitchen
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:19,904	| IOT081 |	And that's probably the last big new appliances microwave but I think wine fridges
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,416	| IOT081 |	Probably
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:25,536	| IOT081 |	Settle Inn
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:32,704	| IOT081 |	I think if you're just talking about small appliances that's a limited conversation to mean old family the appliances we buy or getting
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:34,496	| IOT081 |	Smarter whether that's like a
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:38,080	| IOT081 |	Adding Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to a coffee maker
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:42,944	| IOT081 |	But I also think it's going to go beyond that so there's a lot of starts doing things like okay how can we
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:43,712	| IOT081 |	Do
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:47,040	| IOT081 |	Right pantries that are smarter to kind of know what's in there and in
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:48,832	| IOT081 |	And how does that work
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:49,856	| IOT081 |	How does a
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:53,184	| IOT081 |	I drink a grocery list I really do I want
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:54,720	| IOT081 |	My kitchen to tell me
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:57,024	| IOT081 |	What I need to buy to make
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:38:58,048	| IOT081 |	My Nail Spa
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:39:01,376	| IOT081 |	And you want it to happen where it's not more work
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:02,144	| IOT081 |	Write like
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:03,680	| IOT081 |	That's the challenges like
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:04,192	| IOT081 |	Don't make
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:06,752	| IOT081 |	Give me at like something like a smart refrigerator
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:13,664	| IOT081 |	We're have to like inventory everything and read NFC tags like that just sounds like a nightmare so I think the challenge these guys is
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:16,736	| IOT081 |	Making things work better
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:23,136	| IOT081 |	I think the Samsung family Hub refrigerator was interesting I think the image recognition Technologies get
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:23,904	| IOT081 |	Anymore Basswood
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:25,952	| IOT081 |	I don't feel like it's quite there yet
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:27,488	| IOT081 |	I do feel like
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:28,512	| IOT081 |	With the Giant
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:31,328	| IOT081 |	Yeah yeah yeah
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:33,888	| IOT081 |	So we focus on the tablet because it is freaking
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:38,240	| IOT081 |	Ridiculous but inside it also has computer vision to recognize what's inside
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:40,288	| IOT081 |	Yeah you play with on the ratchet
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:42,592	| IOT081 |	It's pretty cool cuz you can do
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:43,616	| IOT081 |	Dragon soul
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:46,432	| IOT081 |	This has to be really hard to explain on the podcast
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:49,248	| IOT081 |	Speak to some limitations of Audio Only format
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:50,016	| IOT081 |	It's
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:53,856	| IOT081 |	Has a huge screen on the front and you can see inside and you can
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:56,160	| IOT081 |	Take your finger and say okay this item
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:59,744	| IOT081 |	The smoke I bought two on Tuesday and fairly quickly doing
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:01,024	| IOT081 |	Add a date to it
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:02,048	| IOT081 |	So it's
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:03,328	| IOT081 |	There's some
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:06,144	| IOT081 |	Pretty interesting features around adding
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:08,448	| IOT081 |	Inventory and making sure it has time stamps on a butt
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:11,008	| IOT081 |	Still a little bit too much work
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:12,800	| IOT081 |	Right now I just put a thing in the
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:15,104	| IOT081 |	Colony milk in the fridge and you know when it's gone it's gone
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:16,640	| IOT081 |	Or if it's chunky
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:17,152	| IOT081 |	Well Ico
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:24,576	| IOT081 |	But I've been really trying for last year just me personally you know cuz I've had the stomach to think about the food I buy
EDL	00:40:24,576	00:40:27,136	| IOT081 |	Because I waste so much food Stacy and for you to like
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:28,928	| IOT081 |	Maybe you're better than person I am but
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:30,464	| IOT081 |	I waste a lot of food I hate it
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:33,792	| IOT081 |	Like and I haven't found technology help me really good
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:34,304	| IOT081 |	My arms are on that
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:37,376	| IOT081 |	Exo-m better than you but I'm going to recommend
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:39,168	| IOT081 |	A wonderful curry recipe
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:40,448	| IOT081 |	Knorr vegetable soup recipe
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:41,472	| IOT081 |	Awesome
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:43,776	| IOT081 |	Quikrete
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:50,432	| IOT081 |	Put him in the show know I'll put that in the show I have leftover vegetables
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:51,456	| IOT081 |	Wasted
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:54,272	| IOT081 |	Final thoughts
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:55,040	| IOT081 |	How long
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:57,856	| IOT081 |	Let's say let's say I wanted to make a smart
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:58,368	| IOT081 |	Kitchen
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:01,696	| IOT081 |	And I wanted to do so before the holidays at this year
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:05,536	| IOT081 |	What would you recommend for people to get into it now and
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:07,840	| IOT081 |	What do you think I should wait on
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:10,144	| IOT081 |	I would suggest
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:16,544	| IOT081 |	Maybe buying like like I don't I don't want to push specific companies like I think it's scales good way to go I think that's how you got started on
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:18,080	| IOT081 |	The orange Chef scale
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:19,616	| IOT081 |	The drop scale
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:26,528	| IOT081 |	That's kind of a good Swiss army knife at a low-cost point I think you know you can get the perfect scale for like the $50 price
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:27,552	| IOT081 |	Makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:28,832	| IOT081 |	I think
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:34,976	| IOT081 |	If you want to try Precision cooking anything could get a sous-vide machine for you know hundred to $200 that's a good way
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:37,024	| IOT081 |	Obviously you know this guy
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:40,096	| IOT081 |	Freely if we're going to take the new sheptoff one is coming out in May
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:41,888	| IOT081 |	Wood product investment in their software
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:43,936	| IOT081 |	Around daddy cooking
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:46,496	| IOT081 |	So that's an interesting one
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:49,568	| IOT081 |	And you know just to talk about replenishment
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:55,711	| IOT081 |	I have diesel Dash buttons around my house that's I think that's part of Connecticut as well just Auto
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:57,247	| IOT081 |	Refinishing
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,015	| IOT081 |	Your kitchen
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:59,039	| IOT081 |	What supplies
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:00,575	| IOT081 |	Using the dash button
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:02,879	| IOT081 |	The normal street are they five bucks Maybe
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:04,671	| IOT081 |	If I bust minus a credit
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:05,183	| IOT081 |	First order Sith
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:10,559	| IOT081 |	So longer-term I think you I I don't even know 7
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:13,631	| IOT081 |	Brewing beer with my picobrew at by backing on Kickstarter
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:16,191	| IOT081 |	It's got a few Kinks to work out
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:17,471	| IOT081 |	But it's actually
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:18,751	| IOT081 |	Pretty easy to brew beer
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:21,823	| IOT081 |	So that's what happened if you want to spend a little more money
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:22,591	| IOT081 |	I might be up
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:25,919	| IOT081 |	That's probably who I think six or seven dollars post Kickstarter
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:26,687	| IOT081 |	Is your beer any good
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:27,967	| IOT081 |	It is good
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:31,295	| IOT081 |	Every all of my friends
EDL	00:42:31,807	00:42:32,319	| IOT081 |	Homebrewing expire
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:36,671	| IOT081 |	I would hesitate
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:43,583	| IOT081 |	That's why I schiphol like let's do it in my bathtub phase and I had said when technology makes us where I can make it
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:45,887	| IOT081 |	Easy I'm going to do it then so
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:47,167	| IOT081 |	That's why I backed
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:49,727	| IOT081 |	A Kickstarter what is connected bedroom appliances
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:53,311	| IOT081 |	And then what about the apply if you were going to buy an appliance
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:57,151	| IOT081 |	Like a dedicated cooking appliance what would you
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:58,687	| IOT081 |	Firewood you wait on those
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:43:01,759	| IOT081 |	I would wait cuz I think price is going to come down
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:04,575	| IOT081 |	I'm Cermak and spend over $1,000 on a
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:06,367	| IOT081 |	But you know what I think some people might
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:09,951	| IOT081 |	But I think you're going to see those overtime come down in price
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:12,255	| IOT081 |	And I see no one thing to talk about my panels
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:14,047	| IOT081 |	How do we get the entry to work
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:14,559	| IOT081 |	Together
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:17,119	| IOT081 |	You know if you're a Whirlpool within it
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:18,655	| IOT081 |	Will that work with the Samsung
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:21,983	| IOT081 |	Dishwasher you know I live in a multi-vendor
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:25,055	| IOT081 |	Kitchen like I don't have like all one manufacturer
EDL	00:43:25,055	00:43:29,919	| IOT081 |	So I want to see a world where all the stuff starts at work together so that's a conversation that she needs to have
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:31,199	| IOT081 |	Yes and they're totally not having
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:35,551	| IOT081 |	More depressed than ever after listening to the Jenn-Air Keitel
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:37,087	| IOT081 |	Well
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,879	| IOT081 |	We don't necessarily want to
