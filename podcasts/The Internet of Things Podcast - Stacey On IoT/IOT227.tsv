EDL	00:01:58,784	00:01:59,808	| IOT227 |	Already
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,088	| IOT227 |	Heaven
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:03,648	| IOT227 |	I'm going to get this started off with
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,184	| IOT227 |	Smart
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:05,696	| IOT227 |	Beds
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:08,000	| IOT227 |	This is partially because I love
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:08,512	| IOT227 |	Tracking my sleep
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,560	| IOT227 |	Fitbit
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:12,096	| IOT227 |	I think the Whiting sleep tracker
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,376	| IOT227 |	I've done a lot here
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,144	| IOT227 |	Because I am
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:15,424	| IOT227 |	About sleep
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:22,336	| IOT227 |	And what is happening is Tempur-Pedic is launching a new not connected mattress but a connected mattress
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:22,848	| IOT227 |	Bass
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:24,384	| IOT227 |	Actually
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:26,944	| IOT227 |	Detects if someone is snoring
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:29,248	| IOT227 |	And activates the bass
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:30,272	| IOT227 |	To stop
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:33,088	| IOT227 |	So my husband is really excited about it
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,368	| IOT227 |	Cuz I'll be honest you guys
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:34,880	| IOT227 |	I snore
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:36,416	| IOT227 |	I think I
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,976	| IOT227 |	If you remember but I did try that
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:39,744	| IOT227 |	Snoring device
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:43,584	| IOT227 |	And actually it did something similar that idea was
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,352	| IOT227 |	Had
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,632	| IOT227 |	Microphones
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:46,400	| IOT227 |	And when it
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:49,728	| IOT227 |	Heard me snoring it would inflate The Sting in my pillow
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,264	| IOT227 |	And lift my head up
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,824	| IOT227 |	That didn't work so well for
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:56,384	| IOT227 |	But the idea is similar on the temp
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,920	| IOT227 |	Orthopedic face except
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,712	| IOT227 |	It doesn't have any mic
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:02,272	| IOT227 |	Car phones what it does is it to text vibration
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:05,600	| IOT227 |	Set I like better than a microphone in the
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,368	| IOT227 |	Bedroom
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:10,464	| IOT227 |	That's what I thought you would say in this works with the Tempurpedic line of mattresses
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:13,280	| IOT227 |	They didn't test it with any other mattress but it's possible it
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:14,560	| IOT227 |	Other
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:20,192	| IOT227 |	And the bed doesn't just measure snoring it also measures
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:20,960	| IOT227 |	Heart and breathing
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:22,752	| IOT227 |	So
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:25,824	| IOT227 |	The tracker will sense the vibrations from snoring
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,104	| IOT227 |	Just the bed
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,640	| IOT227 |	And
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,920	| IOT227 |	It's also going to tell you how I used
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:34,016	| IOT227 |	So we have a non-connected bed
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:38,368	| IOT227 |	And base that's very similar to this we have the Sleep Number beds with the
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:44,256	| IOT227 |	Remote sensor wire remotes for each side of the bed obviously you can change your sleep number by adding more of us are
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,024	| IOT227 |	2 mattress
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:47,328	| IOT227 |	But also they raise your head and or your feet
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:49,632	| IOT227 |	When I was snoring will I do so
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,936	| IOT227 |	When I snore my wife occasionally
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:54,240	| IOT227 |	Tries to raise up the bed manually
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:55,264	| IOT227 |	And this would obviously
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:58,592	| IOT227 |	Get rid of that manual activity buddy comes in a car
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:02,176	| IOT227 |	The cost of the smart base is 1799
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:03,456	| IOT227 |	Queen size bed
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,784	| IOT227 |	I mean we paid a lot for Arnon
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,064	| IOT227 |	Non snoring
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:12,416	| IOT227 |	Sites in line that is totally in line with it
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:13,696	| IOT227 |	If
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:14,464	| IOT227 |	Now
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:15,232	| IOT227 |	I have a smart
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:18,047	| IOT227 |	Well I don't have a smart base I do have a base with Wi-Fi
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:19,071	| IOT227 |	I do not ask me why
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:22,911	| IOT227 |	The only time we've used it is when my husband was playing
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,447	| IOT227 |	Which was
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:26,751	| IOT227 |	Turning on the vibration on the bed
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,031	| IOT227 |	Itau
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,311	| IOT227 |	And I was like what is happening
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:33,663	| IOT227 |	It must be malfunctioning
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,687	| IOT227 |	And then like
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,455	| IOT227 |	He'd hit a button
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:36,479	| IOT227 |	Calculator
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:37,503	| IOT227 |	I didn't realize I had
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,319	| IOT227 |	The point is that is literally the only time
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:41,855	| IOT227 |	Here
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,159	| IOT227 |	But it does too
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,927	| IOT227 |	1
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,975	| IOT227 |	If it's with my idea
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:49,279	| IOT227 |	Which is we will start seeing smart embedded in product
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,071	| IOT227 |	Just as part of the basic
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,655	| IOT227 |	Going forward I expect this sort of thing
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,191	| IOT227 |	In a lot of
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:59,519	| IOT227 |	And it'll be just an added little bonus
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:01,055	| IOT227 |	Hey if you're storing the soul
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,079	| IOT227 |	So just out of
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:04,127	| IOT227 |	There's tons of
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:08,991	| IOT227 |	Potential products like that I mean I'm leaving back in my chair with very bad posture right now sensor could
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,015	| IOT227 |	Protect that
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:11,039	| IOT227 |	Move the chair
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,343	| IOT227 |	Color for example
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:16,159	| IOT227 |	Yeah exactly in so we'll see that and then
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:19,999	| IOT227 |	This actually is nice because it's offering you tracking
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:22,047	| IOT227 |	But it's also offering
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,583	| IOT227 |	Action so it's actually
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,375	| IOT227 |	In the sense that it's going to do some
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:26,911	| IOT227 |	Not just
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,447	| IOT227 |	So
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:29,727	| IOT227 |	Actionable information
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:30,751	| IOT227 |	There we go
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:31,775	| IOT227 |	So fancy
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:36,127	| IOT227 |	Alright so I'm Pro the Tempurpedic smart bed if that's something you want
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,431	| IOT227 |	If it's not then that's okay
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:41,503	| IOT227 |	Next up is something that Kevin and I
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,783	| IOT227 |	We don't often does a
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,575	| IOT227 |	Which probably makes the show super boring
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:47,391	| IOT227 |	No disagreement here
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,159	| IOT227 |	Google
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:48,927	| IOT227 |	Talked about
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,463	| IOT227 |	Project soli
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:51,999	| IOT227 |	Gosh
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:52,767	| IOT227 |	Five or six years
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:56,607	| IOT227 |	And I was excited about it this is a gesture-based technology
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:57,631	| IOT227 |	Ultrasonic
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:05:59,167	| IOT227 |	And
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:01,727	| IOT227 |	Now they showed a video for the pixel 4
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,519	| IOT227 |	That involves
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,287	| IOT227 |	Project soli
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:05,567	| IOT227 |	Which is gesture-based can
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:06,079	| IOT227 |	Trolls
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:08,383	| IOT227 |	And you can use it to swipe
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,407	| IOT227 |	In the air
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:10,943	| IOT227 |	To move things around
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,223	| IOT227 |	I think it's cool
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,271	| IOT227 |	I think it's
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:15,551	| IOT227 |	Cool
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:18,623	| IOT227 |	But here's there's nothing it just to be clear Google has not.
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:21,951	| IOT227 |	Announce the pixel for what they're doing slowly leaking
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,487	| IOT227 |	Information such as
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:26,303	| IOT227 |	What it's going to look like they did last month this month it's heavy
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,327	| IOT227 |	Up at the top in that
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:30,399	| IOT227 |	Paper bezel the reason has a big bezels because it's got
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:31,935	| IOT227 |	Face unlock
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:36,287	| IOT227 |	Top projectors like the iPhone and IR cameras for face unlock
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:38,591	| IOT227 |	A light sensor
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:41,151	| IOT227 |	Salon also has the project
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:42,431	| IOT227 |	Sweet radar chip
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,479	| IOT227 |	And I filled your songs that you mention
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,039	| IOT227 |	Yes it's cool
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:51,647	| IOT227 |	And they have a 20 second video showing how you can unlock your phone with your face the pics
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,415	| IOT227 |	Performing the song
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:59,071	| IOT227 |	And you can swipe over the phone or from the phone to scroll through web pages and content and such
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:03,679	| IOT227 |	And I think I'm not jazzed about it because we seen this before
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,727	| IOT227 |	Regardless of the technology used
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:09,567	| IOT227 |	It doesn't add or hasn't yet at a tremendous amount of value
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:12,639	| IOT227 |	So that's my big beef with us
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:14,431	| IOT227 |	You feel otherwise
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,967	| IOT227 |	The reason I feel otherwise
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,783	| IOT227 |	Cuz I have not changed my smartphone
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,831	| IOT227 |	This is not a smartphone
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:23,135	| IOT227 |	This is a
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,159	| IOT227 |	Television
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:30,047	| IOT227 |	This is a I'm cooking and I have a display a Google home display and I want to move it with
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,095	| IOT227 |	Touching her using my
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:33,375	| IOT227 |	My voice that is what this is
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,679	| IOT227 |	So imagine your Google display
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,471	| IOT227 |	I know we both love
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,519	| IOT227 |	Imagine being able to gesture to
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:44,383	| IOT227 |	I don't disagree with everything you said in your car
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:46,943	| IOT227 |	Their places were voice is cumbersome and like
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:47,967	| IOT227 |	You know saying
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:49,759	| IOT227 |	Haji skip
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,807	| IOT227 |	You know when you hit the microphone the Music Stops
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,343	| IOT227 |	I think so this is why
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:58,719	| IOT227 |	And I get that I think the difference is you're looking at the broader picture
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:02,047	| IOT227 |	And I'm looking at a product that has no need for
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,327	| IOT227 |	Soli radar Japan
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:05,119	| IOT227 |	So the reason they're putting it there
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:08,191	| IOT227 |	I would argue is to build the economies of scale necessary
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:09,727	| IOT227 |	Although
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,263	| IOT227 |	Not the pixel phone
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:16,895	| IOT227 |	It's basically to get the economies of scale
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,943	| IOT227 |	That make it cheap enough and reasonable enough
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:19,967	| IOT227 |	Definition of device
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:20,991	| IOT227 |	That's
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:24,063	| IOT227 |	Yeah I get it I get ice I suspect
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:27,647	| IOT227 |	So they'd be better off putting it in a new smart display
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:29,183	| IOT227 |	Because they probably sell
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:31,999	| IOT227 |	More of those and they sell pixel devices quite honestly
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:36,095	| IOT227 |	Alright Google ignore the pixel 4
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:36,863	| IOT227 |	Put it in the next
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,143	| IOT227 |	Ness
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:38,655	| IOT227 |	Set the nest
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:42,495	| IOT227 |	What is the Google Nest hub
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:43,519	| IOT227 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,567	| IOT227 |	All right
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:48,639	| IOT227 |	So that's our disagreement Dushore or of the month
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:49,919	| IOT227 |	I'd like to know
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,711	| IOT227 |	I don't know
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,479	| IOT227 |	But
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,527	| IOT227 |	Let's talk about Amazon ring
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,039	| IOT227 |	And
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:58,879	| IOT227 |	This is been coming up this idea that Amazon
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,671	| IOT227 |	With this ring doorbells is
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:01,439	| IOT227 |	Building
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:02,719	| IOT227 |	Penn Optical
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,487	| IOT227 |	And I believe will
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,023	| IOT227 |	Called it
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,839	| IOT227 |	It's that it is working with police.
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:11,935	| IOT227 |	Or ring is working with police departments
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:12,959	| IOT227 |	2
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,775	| IOT227 |	Gather data on neighborhood
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,311	| IOT227 |	Crime so when a crime
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:17,823	| IOT227 |	Occurs in
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,871	| IOT227 |	People have ring doorbells
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:20,895	| IOT227 |	There's a neighbor's app
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:23,967	| IOT227 |	And what happens is the police can ask for
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:25,759	| IOT227 |	The video doorbell
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:28,831	| IOT227 |	Recordings from people in the area
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,623	| IOT227 |	They have to have a case number
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:32,415	| IOT227 |	And they have to
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:34,719	| IOT227 |	Ask permission so they can't just pull this date
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,791	| IOT227 |	But what's squeaking people out
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,863	| IOT227 |	Is the police are actually working with ring
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,143	| IOT227 |	Inner getting incentives
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:43,423	| IOT227 |	From ring
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,959	| IOT227 |	2
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:47,519	| IOT227 |	Promote the ring doorbell specifically
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,311	| IOT227 |	And
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:52,127	| IOT227 |	The more people who sign up for the Neighbors app
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:55,199	| IOT227 |	The more doorbells
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:55,711	| IOT227 |	The police
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,503	| IOT227 |	It gets to dispense
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,551	| IOT227 |	And this rub
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,575	| IOT227 |	People the wrong way
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,599	| IOT227 |	Aniket why
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:05,439	| IOT227 |	Everyone says they put in safeguards by the fact that you know
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:07,999	| IOT227 |	Police can't just go through a database and scroll through
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:08,511	| IOT227 |	Randall
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:09,791	| IOT227 |	Doorbell sound
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,583	| IOT227 |	You have to have a case number
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:12,863	| IOT227 |	I have two requests in the
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:13,375	| IOT227 |	A person has to agree
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:17,471	| IOT227 |	But police are promoting one particular type
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,775	| IOT227 |	Because they're getting
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,311	| IOT227 |	One particular type of video.
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:21,823	| IOT227 |	About that's why
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,103	| IOT227 |	2
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,151	| IOT227 |	It does
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:28,991	| IOT227 |	Turn a neighborhood walk into kind of the potential of being
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:29,503	| IOT227 |	Surveilled
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,575	| IOT227 |	Yeah and I have a
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,855	| IOT227 |	Camera that faces
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:37,695	| IOT227 |	Front of my house in people do walk past people obviously Drive pass
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:40,511	| IOT227 |	They probably don't know that they're being caught on camera
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:44,863	| IOT227 |	I talked about this once before in the show it's a homeless feel like I should have a sign
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,631	| IOT227 |	Cat says hey
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,935	| IOT227 |	Just so you know
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,215	| IOT227 |	There's a camera here
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,007	| IOT227 |	When you walk past your going to be on it
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,567	| IOT227 |	I don't use the data for anything
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,335	| IOT227 |	Other than
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:58,943	| IOT227 |	When I need to such as when my car was hit and that was a good thing I needed to do that because the person
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,735	| IOT227 |	Said they didn't hit my car
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:01,759	| IOT227 |	And clearly they did
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,039	| IOT227 |	Let me ask you
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:04,063	| IOT227 |	And so
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:06,111	| IOT227 |	If for example there was a crime
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:09,183	| IOT227 |	Down the street or two streets over and
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:10,207	| IOT227 |	Police said hey
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:11,231	| IOT227 |	I know you
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,511	| IOT227 |	What do you have a ring
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:19,679	| IOT227 |	I don't have a ring out that that that has front camera is a wise and then my front door which is Ash on the side of the townhouse unit
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,959	| IOT227 |	Is a nest hello
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:23,007	| IOT227 |	Okay so they just maybe they saw your
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:25,567	| IOT227 |	So they call and they say hey
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:30,175	| IOT227 |	Can we get your camera data for this crime that was someone stole a computer broke in
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,455	| IOT227 |	Two streets over
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,479	| IOT227 |	We want to see if
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,015	| IOT227 |	Can catch the
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,807	| IOT227 |	Which way they turned on
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,319	| IOT227 |	On your street
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,599	| IOT227 |	Right
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,623	| IOT227 |	Would you say yes
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:41,439	| IOT227 |	I probably would've you everything first
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,463	| IOT227 |	Myself
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:48,095	| IOT227 |	Because I wouldn't want to send the video of a my neighbor's doing something else incriminating
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:50,655	| IOT227 |	Okay see ya
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,191	| IOT227 |	So then
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:55,007	| IOT227 |	You review it first and if your neighbor is out smoking weed on
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,031	| IOT227 |	Porch uibe
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:59,871	| IOT227 |	Maybe I could scrub that out in myself like a
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:02,943	| IOT227 |	I get a pet video obviously cuz it has and it's my right to do so
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:03,967	| IOT227 |	As far as I'm
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:07,295	| IOT227 |	Anna and it's not hurting the police for what they're looking for
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,575	| IOT227 |	So
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:10,111	| IOT227 |	That's probably what I would do
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:10,879	| IOT227 |	So
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,159	| IOT227 |	I'm a good neighbor I think
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:15,999	| IOT227 |	So with neighbors they just get the raw file so that's an interesting
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:18,815	| IOT227 |	Correct and there's no and I looked
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:21,119	| IOT227 |	Document cloud is some of the documentation
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,143	| IOT227 |	Between
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:23,423	| IOT227 |	Ringing in the ear
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,447	| IOT227 |	Some of the police
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:24,959	| IOT227 |	Apartments
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,007	| IOT227 |	It was nothing in there that
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,287	| IOT227 |	Kind of allows for that
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:29,311	| IOT227 |	I just get it like you said
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:34,175	| IOT227 |	Marilyn I want to help if there's if there's an issue and I can provide helpful Evan some happy to do it
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:37,247	| IOT227 |	But it's a personal choice everybody sing feel differently about this
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:40,319	| IOT227 |	Yashow Kevin isn't in conflict with me this time
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,343	| IOT227 |	Time he's now in conflict
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:42,367	| IOT227 |	With himself
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,463	| IOT227 |	All right we'll see if we're in agreement on this issue
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:51,071	| IOT227 |	The FTC last week said that it will host a workshop on
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:53,375	| IOT227 |	Coppa the children's online protection
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,143	| IOT227 |	Privacy
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,423	| IOT227 |	Rule
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:56,191	| IOT227 |	And
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:13:00,287	| IOT227 |	The idea here is there going to host a workshop to see if changes are needed
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:03,615	| IOT227 |	And this is news and I was surprised that people did not
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:08,735	| IOT227 |	Pick this up very much in the reason is because the FTC every
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,295	| IOT227 |	10 years is supposed to check out
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,063	| IOT227 |	See how the
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:13,087	| IOT227 |	A couple rules
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:13,855	| IOT227 |	Doing
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:16,671	| IOT227 |	So do they fit the current standards yes or no
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,463	| IOT227 |	The last time they did it they didn't
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,231	| IOT227 |	2013
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:23,071	| IOT227 |	So they're doing this earlier in the reason they're doing it
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:25,887	| IOT227 |	Is because they're worried about
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,655	| IOT227 |	Voice
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,167	| IOT227 |	Speakers
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:30,495	| IOT227 |	What they're going to ask is a bunch of questions of
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,007	| IOT227 |	The industry
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:38,431	| IOT227 |	They are going to be talking about websites cuz I know YouTube and children's access to advertisements and children's access to
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:40,223	| IOT227 |	Various other things on
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,271	| IOT227 |	But
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:45,599	| IOT227 |	They also are going to be talking about what are the implications for
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,879	| IOT227 |	Copa enforcement
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:50,975	| IOT227 |	Raised by technology such as interactive television Interactive
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,511	| IOT227 |	Gaming or similar in Iraq
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:57,887	| IOT227 |	And should the commission consider a specific exemption
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,911	| IOT227 |	Parental consent
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:00,191	| IOT227 |	For the use of Education Tech
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:02,495	| IOT227 |	In schools
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:05,311	| IOT227 |	And there they actually do talk about voice
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:12,735	| IOT227 |	And then should the commission modify the rule to encourage General audience platforms to identify and police
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,015	| IOT227 |	Child-directed
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:14,783	| IOT227 |	Content
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,295	| IOT227 |	Uploaded by
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:17,599	| IOT227 |	That's the YouTube
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:19,903	| IOT227 |	So
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:22,975	| IOT227 |	Did publish something in the Federal Register and I've been a link to that
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:24,511	| IOT227 |	Cuz that talks a lot about
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,535	| IOT227 |	All the questions
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,047	| IOT227 |	There
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,071	| IOT227 |	Asking
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,375	| IOT227 |	But in the education section
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:34,239	| IOT227 |	Like hey should schools use this technology and also
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:37,311	| IOT227 |	What about the collection of audio files is a
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,847	| IOT227 |	Replacement for text
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,639	| IOT227 |	Where the audio files are promptly
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,151	| IOT227 |	Deleted
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:43,455	| IOT227 |	In line with what the agency hit issue
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:44,991	| IOT227 |	Years ago
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:48,319	| IOT227 |	And this is again related to the fact that Amazon
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,647	| IOT227 |	And I believe Google have both come out saying
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:53,695	| IOT227 |	Yeah we can't delete everything
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:54,975	| IOT227 |	Because
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:55,999	| IOT227 |	Benes service
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,047	| IOT227 |	Kezar
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:00,863	| IOT227 |	I a scroll through this there are tons of questions here
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:04,191	| IOT227 |	I have a question for you and that is
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,239	| IOT227 |	Because it says
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:10,847	| IOT227 |	You can comment on this on or before October 23rd 2019
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:15,711	| IOT227 |	Does that mean this is for public, so could parents actually read this and respond to some of these things
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:16,735	| IOT227 |	Yes
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,551	| IOT227 |	I think there's a lot of
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:23,647	| IOT227 |	I'm actually going to spend a lot of time with this and I'm probably going to come up with like
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:25,439	| IOT227 |	Things that I think
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:25,951	| IOT227 |	AR
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,487	| IOT227 |	As a parent
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:28,511	| IOT227 |	That I care about
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:30,047	| IOT227 |	Cuz my daughter uses
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:30,559	| IOT227 |	A lot of this type
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:35,167	| IOT227 |	LG schools we actually just had a question from somebody was a teacher who wanted to
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,935	| IOT227 |	They have there
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,215	| IOT227 |	Class Dubois skills
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:40,543	| IOT227 |	I I think that there's a lot of
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:42,591	| IOT227 |	Stuff here like should parents be able to do
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:44,639	| IOT227 |	Request deletion of personal information
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,151	| IOT227 |	Collective II
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:46,175	| IOT227 |	Leaders of Technology
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,503	| IOT227 |	And that's within the school setting
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:56,159	| IOT227 |	But at the same time I understand why companies want some of the state up because they need to make their services better
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:16:03,583	| IOT227 |	I mean I see this as you said an early review basically because of the rise of smart speakers microphones Etc
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,375	| IOT227 |	School
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,655	| IOT227 |	Center
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:09,727	| IOT227 |	The technology is quickly changing we're finding out
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:12,799	| IOT227 |	More about what really happens with your recording or not talk about that
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,567	| IOT227 |	Some more in a second
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:19,455	| IOT227 |	I think it's smarter than to do this I think what they're trying to do is kind of educate themselves a little bit
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,223	| IOT227 |	And see
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:20,991	| IOT227 |	How well
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:26,879	| IOT227 |	Are the current laws applicable how often are they actually use such as you know if somebody
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:29,951	| IOT227 |	Request a parent request deletion or review their child's data
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:32,511	| IOT227 |	How often does it happen and how often
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:34,303	| IOT227 |	Are companies complying with that Etc
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,351	| IOT227 |	It seems to be like a
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,119	| IOT227 |	Let's
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:39,935	| IOT227 |	Research this little bit more up since the landscape has changed
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:41,983	| IOT227 |	I will say
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:43,007	| IOT227 |	There's been plenty of
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:45,823	| IOT227 |	App company instead of taking advantage of Chile
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,871	| IOT227 |	People I mean
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:50,687	| IOT227 |	If you can make money by taking advantage of children it is
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:52,223	| IOT227 |	Literally like taking candy
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:53,759	| IOT227 |	For this case money
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:54,271	| IOT227 |	From a baby
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,831	| IOT227 |	And so we see a lot of
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,111	| IOT227 |	Malicious
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,135	| IOT227 |	Is a malicious isn't
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,159	| IOT227 |	Various I feel like I've
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,183	| IOT227 |	Where is here
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,719	| IOT227 |	But shame
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,231	| IOT227 |	Slimy
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:04,767	| IOT227 |	Yes
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,559	| IOT227 |	Slimy Behavior
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,095	| IOT227 |	On behalf of certain
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:11,423	| IOT227 |	No this isn't Google this isn't
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,447	| IOT227 |	Apple but these are
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:16,543	| IOT227 |	Platforms that allow for slimy companies to come in contact
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,567	| IOT227 |	With your children and
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:19,103	| IOT227 |	Get them to
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,639	| IOT227 |	Give data
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,151	| IOT227 |	Gift I mean
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,455	| IOT227 |	I can totally see you know
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:26,271	| IOT227 |	Things asking for personal data from children
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,319	| IOT227 |	Just two
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,343	| IOT227 |	Maybe make it easier to hack
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:30,879	| IOT227 |	Neither
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:33,695	| IOT227 |	So much out there or you could ask kids questions
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:36,767	| IOT227 |	What brand of milk do you have in your fridge and it's like a little Focus
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,303	| IOT227 |	Cancel think that's fine
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,351	| IOT227 |	So
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:43,679	| IOT227 |	I think this is necessary I think research is good I'm going to spend some
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,215	| IOT227 |	Really hard
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:45,727	| IOT227 |	Time to Kill
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:47,775	| IOT227 |	What
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,799	| IOT227 |	Makes sense
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:49,567	| IOT227 |	And I should mention this
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:52,127	| IOT227 |	The FTC wants to know also
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:54,687	| IOT227 |	What kind of bird needs rules
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:55,967	| IOT227 |	Create on
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:57,503	| IOT227 |	Bigger companies smaller
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:58,527	| IOT227 |	Etcetera
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:01,343	| IOT227 |	So not every company is going to be able to create
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,135	| IOT227 |	Neutral age-gate
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,415	| IOT227 |	Concept India
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:04,927	| IOT227 |	Here which is a
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:07,743	| IOT227 |	Creating a subsection of your
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,535	| IOT227 |	Platform that is
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,583	| IOT227 |	For people who don't have it
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:12,095	| IOT227 |	NH
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:14,911	| IOT227 |	The assumption is there kids
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:17,215	| IOT227 |	And if you
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:17,983	| IOT227 |	Speak up
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:19,007	| IOT227 |	Can small cavities
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:24,127	| IOT227 |	And that's what's happening here if you want more information I
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:25,663	| IOT227 |	Link to the Federal Register
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:27,199	| IOT227 |	You guys can go read it for yourselves
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,479	| IOT227 |	And common
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:29,503	| IOT227 |	Andkon
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,039	| IOT227 |	All right
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,319	| IOT227 |	Let's do some
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:32,831	| IOT227 |	Quick bits
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:35,391	| IOT227 |	Apple also uses contractors
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:37,951	| IOT227 |	Just like Google just like Amazon
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:41,279	| IOT227 |	Just like we said everyone would have to do is a form of QA
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:43,839	| IOT227 |	And these contractors can listen to your Siri
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:45,631	| IOT227 |	Kevin event
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:49,727	| IOT227 |	Yeah I mean we just wanted to point it out because
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:52,031	| IOT227 |	It would be unfair to point out the issues
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:53,567	| IOT227 |	From
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:56,127	| IOT227 |	Other companies in an appointment for Apple
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,919	| IOT227 |	Interesting to me is that
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:58,943	| IOT227 |	The
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,735	| IOT227 |	Apple watch and the homepod
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:03,807	| IOT227 |	Apparently had the most frequent sources of mistaken
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:05,599	| IOT227 |	Activations I guess and
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,903	| IOT227 |	The contractor that regarding spoke with
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:12,511	| IOT227 |	Said they could definitely hear a doctor and a patient so they can your medical history
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:17,119	| IOT227 |	Pedir a car with engine background noise it sounded like a drug deal
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:19,167	| IOT227 |	And then of course people engaging in into
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,191	| IOT227 |	Ax
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:27,871	| IOT227 |	Apple's no different Bible says less than 1% of all
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:31,199	| IOT227 |	Are these recordings were because of
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:33,247	| IOT227 |	Norfolk positive
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,783	| IOT227 |	Inactivation that was wrong
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:37,855	| IOT227 |	But that's a big number when you think about how many iPhones watches and
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:39,391	| IOT227 |	Sutter out there with Siri
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:42,207	| IOT227 |	Oh yeah we talked about this son this weekend Google
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:43,231	| IOT227 |	Which is a show that
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,767	| IOT227 |	Kevin is sometimes on and I'm
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,279	| IOT227 |	Nicole host
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:46,559	| IOT227 |	And
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:48,095	| IOT227 |	You know we were talking about it and
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:51,935	| IOT227 |	Not this particular issue is I believe the Amazon issue and
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:54,751	| IOT227 |	Somebody's iPhone activated Siri and poop
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,799	| IOT227 |	Suddenly there's a transcript apus
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:01,407	| IOT227 |	So we all seem to trust apple and
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:07,551	| IOT227 |	What about the other companies what it companies do consumers most trust and mistrust will
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:10,111	| IOT227 |	Pcmag ran a survey on their own
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:13,951	| IOT227 |	2000 us consumers participated back in May
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:18,559	| IOT227 |	And the results are code I expected as far as the trust
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:24,191	| IOT227 |	It was actually Google first then Amazon or buy Microsoft and Samsung
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:26,239	| IOT227 |	LG products
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,007	| IOT227 |	Career
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:29,055	| IOT227 |	10% and then Facebook
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:31,359	| IOT227 |	Was actually being least trusted in fact
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:32,895	| IOT227 |	The mistress
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:39,295	| IOT227 |	Chart if you want to take a look at it will Lincoln the show notes is off the charts after Facebook the mistrust was 48
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,063	| IOT227 |	Percent of consumers
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:40,831	| IOT227 |	Mistrust
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,111	| IOT227 |	Facebook
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:45,695	| IOT227 |	Every other company in here in the survey
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:48,767	| IOT227 |	Was at 10% or less for mistrust so
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:53,375	| IOT227 |	I'm not surprised to hear you have a little surprise while they did this before
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,143	| IOT227 |	Is the big back
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:54,655	| IOT227 |	Clash over
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:56,959	| IOT227 |	Listen to my voice recordings
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:21:04,127	| IOT227 |	So is that could skew these results now sure
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:04,639	| IOT227 |	It's not a smartphone
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,175	| IOT227 |	Coyote
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:07,199	| IOT227 |	Which is why it's not on
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:10,527	| IOT227 |	Well apples not
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:15,391	| IOT227 |	How to make TVs Motors Facebook obviously they don't make smart
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,159	| IOT227 |	Displays
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:17,440	| IOT227 |	Just make
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:19,744	| IOT227 |	Psalms and the homepod
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:26,144	| IOT227 |	Yes pretty much mobile devices aside from the homepod which we know hasn't really taken off so
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:29,984	| IOT227 |	I guess they're just not a big enough player to be asking about in this particular question
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,264	| IOT227 |	Okay that would have been in
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:32,800	| IOT227 |	I would have had the mother
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:37,664	| IOT227 |	All right
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:38,688	| IOT227 |	Speaking
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:40,480	| IOT227 |	Trust
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:42,016	| IOT227 |	There's another
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,808	| IOT227 |	There's another vulnerability
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:47,648	| IOT227 |	And this one is the
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:49,696	| IOT227 |	Amcrest ip2
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,720	| IOT227 |	Um blah blah
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:52,768	| IOT227 |	It's a cheap camera
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:54,048	| IOT227 |	In this particular
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,328	| IOT227 |	Case
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:56,608	| IOT227 |	You can connect to the audio stream
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:58,400	| IOT227 |	Septimus
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:01,728	| IOT227 |	Write your Monday notes to use so somebody could be listening at all time
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:03,264	| IOT227 |	There's no record or anything it just
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:05,056	| IOT227 |	Is listening because of the abilities
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:08,896	| IOT227 |	It is a low-cost like a $58 camera
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:11,456	| IOT227 |	On Crestor amcrest rather I don't know that brand
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:15,040	| IOT227 |	And I tend to stick with brands that I know for this very reason
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:18,112	| IOT227 |	Not the brands the big Brands don't have their security issues to
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,904	| IOT227 |	What concerns me is
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:25,024	| IOT227 |	Amazon Celsius and I wish Amazon start cracking down on selling things that aren't
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:27,328	| IOT227 |	Safe number one number two
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:29,888	| IOT227 |	I think a lot of people bought this because it has
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:34,240	| IOT227 |	Nearly 12000 customer reviews + 857 answer
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:34,752	| IOT227 |	Questions
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:37,312	| IOT227 |	That leaves me to believe a lot of people at the scammer
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:39,104	| IOT227 |	Yeah and
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:39,616	| IOT227 |	They thought it was
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:42,432	| IOT227 |	So the next question is
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:43,968	| IOT227 |	What is
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:47,552	| IOT227 |	Company to get in this is a rebranded hardware from another come
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,320	| IOT227 |	Japanese
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,344	| IOT227 |	They probably did the soft
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:51,136	| IOT227 |	So the question is
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:52,416	| IOT227 |	Can you fix
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:58,560	| IOT227 |	So this has a common vulnerabilities and exposures or CVV numbers
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:22:59,584	| IOT227 |	Official reported
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,352	| IOT227 |	As far as a
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:00,864	| IOT227 |	Fix
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:03,680	| IOT227 |	It says n a for proposed
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,472	| IOT227 |	I don't know
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:06,752	| IOT227 |	It's a no sign
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:08,800	| IOT227 |	To tenable network security Inc
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,848	| IOT227 |	So as of now I do not see any
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,664	| IOT227 |	Alright so in that case unplugged
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,224	| IOT227 |	That's

EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:36,864	| IOT227 |	And I also want to say that
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:37,632	| IOT227 |	Last week
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,400	| IOT227 |	So much timing
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:41,728	| IOT227 |	Last week we talked about outdoor light bulbs
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:47,104	| IOT227 |	And we got so many people telling us that they use their Hue bulbs outdoors in
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,640	| IOT227 |	Minnesota
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:49,920	| IOT227 |	In Sweden
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:50,688	| IOT227 |	In Norway
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:51,712	| IOT227 |	So
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:54,272	| IOT227 |	We discuss the temperature ranges be
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:59,392	| IOT227 |	Because neither as well I didn't live in a place where my outdoor Hue bulbs ever got below freezing
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:00,672	| IOT227 |	And
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,440	| IOT227 |	Kevin's
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,208	| IOT227 |	Wasn't using
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:02,976	| IOT227 |	That so
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:03,744	| IOT227 |	He's not a huge fan
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:08,096	| IOT227 |	But apparently lots of people use their Hue bulbs outdoors in the
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:08,864	| IOT227 |	Just fine

EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:17,056	| IOT227 |	We have a question about ceiling fan
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:17,824	| IOT227 |	Let's
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:19,616	| IOT227 |	Stacy and Kevin
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:21,408	| IOT227 |	This is Andre in Virginia
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:23,968	| IOT227 |	Thank you for your podcast
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:25,504	| IOT227 |	All the time that you guys put into
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:27,552	| IOT227 |	I just installed a
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:28,832	| IOT227 |	Ceiling fan
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:30,112	| IOT227 |	My daughter's room
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:30,624	| IOT227 |	And
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,672	| IOT227 |	It has an RF
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:33,184	| IOT227 |	Remote
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,976	| IOT227 |	109 ideas
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:37,536	| IOT227 |	To have to find a remote to turn off the lights
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:38,560	| IOT227 |	And leave the fan one
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:39,840	| IOT227 |	So
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:41,376	| IOT227 |	I see that the
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:42,912	| IOT227 |	I just recommended
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,680	| IOT227 |	Bond
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,448	| IOT227 |	Hub
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:46,240	| IOT227 |	Thinking of your yard
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:48,032	| IOT227 |	Sycophant
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:49,824	| IOT227 |	Google home Alexa
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:50,592	| IOT227 |	So what not
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:52,128	| IOT227 |	And I'm wondering
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:56,224	| IOT227 |	If you have any other recommendations in the other alternatives to bond
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:57,504	| IOT227 |	As in
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:59,040	| IOT227 |	Really I don't
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:25:59,808	| IOT227 |	Want to spend
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:00,576	| IOT227 |	$90
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:01,856	| IOT227 |	4
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:02,624	| IOT227 |	One device
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,160	| IOT227 |	Control
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:04,672	| IOT227 |	Fan lights
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:06,208	| IOT227 |	Okay Andre
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:08,000	| IOT227 |	We have
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:08,768	| IOT227 |	More work for you to do
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,584	| IOT227 |	And we may ultimately have bad news
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:14,144	| IOT227 |	When I heard your question
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:15,168	| IOT227 |	For you said you didn't
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:19,264	| IOT227 |	That will solve all your problems
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:25,408	| IOT227 |	But I got it $90 is a lot of money you can find it for $70 on Amazon site
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:27,968	| IOT227 |	And I think sometimes it goes on sale
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:28,992	| IOT227 |	But still a lot of money
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:31,296	| IOT227 |	So we found a product
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:36,928	| IOT227 |	It depends on your fan and your remote
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:39,488	| IOT227 |	And Andre I sympathize xiamen the same
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,256	| IOT227 |	Boat as you
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:43,328	| IOT227 |	I have a Hampton Bay fan and
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:44,864	| IOT227 |	A remotes
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:46,400	| IOT227 |	And I wish I could make it smart but
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:49,216	| IOT227 |	I've been frustrated and I do want to spend $90 on the bond together
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:50,496	| IOT227 |	So
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:54,848	| IOT227 |	What Ninja for you to do is see if you can find out
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:56,128	| IOT227 |	The frequency
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:27:01,504	| IOT227 |	That your remote uses and we presume that is RF and not IR because you said RF
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:03,808	| IOT227 |	In either case if it's IR or RF
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:07,136	| IOT227 |	What do we find something from broadlink of the wave
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:09,952	| IOT227 |	Yes we found the broadlink RM 33
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:10,976	| IOT227 |	Pro
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,512	| IOT227 |	Inappropriate
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,024	| IOT227 |	Plus
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:14,560	| IOT227 |	This is like a little
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,864	| IOT227 |	What's an IR + RF
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:19,424	| IOT227 |	Plus WiFi
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,448	| IOT227 |	It's very much like the boss
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:22,496	| IOT227 |	This is a $40
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:24,032	| IOT227 |	It may be 43
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:24,544	| IOT227 |	$3
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:25,824	| IOT227 |	Depending on who
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:26,336	| IOT227 |	Do you buy it from
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,872	| IOT227 |	Device
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:29,408	| IOT227 |	The challenge is
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:31,456	| IOT227 |	It is only going to
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:32,224	| IOT227 |	Court
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:34,272	| IOT227 |	433
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,296	| IOT227 |	Hertz is the RF
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,320	| IOT227 |	So
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:37,856	| IOT227 |	If your
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:38,880	| IOT227 |	Ceiling fan
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:41,952	| IOT227 |	Is 433 megahertz
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,720	| IOT227 |	You are great
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:45,536	| IOT227 |	But ceiling fans can operate it
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:46,816	| IOT227 |	315 for 30
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:47,584	| IOT227 |	3
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:48,096	| IOT227 |	And several others
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:50,656	| IOT227 |	And the bond actually supports all of them
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:51,936	| IOT227 |	Is why they reckon
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:55,520	| IOT227 |	The two way you can call him today and figure this out
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:57,824	| IOT227 |	You could actually also look on the SEC sticker on
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,360	| IOT227 |	Spice it may tell you there
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:00,896	| IOT227 |	Or you can
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:02,432	| IOT227 |	Take the serial number of your fan
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:06,016	| IOT227 |	And look it up in the FCC database and see what
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:09,344	| IOT227 |	Or you could do what I would do
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:12,160	| IOT227 |	And that is just buy it from Amazon
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:13,696	| IOT227 |	Try it if it didn't work I would send it
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:18,048	| IOT227 |	The other thing about working with the broadly
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:21,632	| IOT227 |	In tying it into Amazon or Google
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:22,912	| IOT227 |	Is that it is
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:24,960	| IOT227 |	Works like a remote can
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:25,984	| IOT227 |	Control for a TV
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:28,288	| IOT227 |	So you're going to have to tell Amazon
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:29,824	| IOT227 |	That is a television
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:31,872	| IOT227 |	But you can also do
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:32,640	| IOT227 |	When you're setting it
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:34,176	| IOT227 |	Or
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:35,712	| IOT227 |	You can create a scene around it
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:36,736	| IOT227 |	So
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:40,576	| IOT227 |	If you do the scene then you create your own voice command and then it's going to
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:43,136	| IOT227 |	But you will still have to set it up as a
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,416	| IOT227 |	A television room
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:45,696	| IOT227 |	Just so you know
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:48,512	| IOT227 |	Yeah and one other possible got you
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:53,120	| IOT227 |	It is only supported on 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:56,960	| IOT227 |	I need the Wi-Fi to
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:57,984	| IOT227 |	Tire near me
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:59,008	| IOT227 |	Smart speakers
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:00,288	| IOT227 |	Just be aware
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:03,616	| IOT227 |	Based on your home network that this is a 2.4 gigahertz
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,384	| IOT227 |	Wi-Fi radio
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:06,688	| IOT227 |	Kind of a lot of gachas there
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:07,712	| IOT227 |	But
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:09,504	| IOT227 |	Is the bond is $70
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:11,040	| IOT227 |	And this is $40
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:13,344	| IOT227 |	Is it worth $30 to have to
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:14,112	| IOT227 |	The call into this
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,136	| IOT227 |	If it is
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,416	| IOT227 |	Do it
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:18,464	| IOT227 |	Or it maybe it's not even worth 40.
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:20,000	| IOT227 |	And then you'll be like yeah
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:21,280	| IOT227 |	We're just going to work with a non smart
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:24,352	| IOT227 |	I'm just going to make sure the remotes Always by the bedside.
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:28,704	| IOT227 |	I suppose I could always by and try it I just don't know that if I have the exact
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:30,752	| IOT227 |	Same fan configuration that Andreas
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:34,848	| IOT227 |	There is also a Hampton Bay Universal Remote
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,872	| IOT227 |	For $50
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,640	| IOT227 |	What works with wink
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,688	| IOT227 |	But you have to buy a wink
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:40,736	| IOT227 |	Which temperature
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:41,248	| IOT227 |	You back
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:42,528	| IOT227 |	The price
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:43,296	| IOT227 |	Exactly
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:43,808	| IOT227 |	We're not ready
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:45,600	| IOT227 |	For a couple
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:48,160	| IOT227 |	Already have a wink
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:49,440	| IOT227 |	If you already have a wink then

EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:55,072	| IOT227 |	Okay
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:57,632	| IOT227 |	That is a less than satisfactory
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:00,960	| IOT227 |	I just said that's not our fault
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:01,728	| IOT227 |	No
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:03,520	| IOT227 |	If you would like your own
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:08,640	| IOT227 |	Satisfactory or maybe less than satisfactory answer to a smartphone question give us a call at 5 1/2

EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:54,976	| IOT227 |	Answer is nutanix and I have
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:57,536	| IOT227 |	Sacem vakani hear from the company
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:31:01,632	| IOT227 |	So netonix we all think of that as a leader in hyper-converged

EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:43,872	| IOT227 |	Ohio State requires us to think about
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:47,712	| IOT227 |	Can you talk about some of the customer scenarios you've encountered as you go
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:53,600	| IOT227 |	There's a quite a lot of diversity in the type of use cases for instance
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:32:00,000	| IOT227 |	Customers in retail and solve problems
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:03,584	| IOT227 |	Things like loyalty number identification in their stores
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:04,864	| IOT227 |	Loss prevention
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:11,776	| IOT227 |	And we want to work with them to create new experiences

EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:48,128	| IOT227 |	And what is your high level learning so far
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:51,712	| IOT227 |	There's so many but let me share
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:52,992	| IOT227 |	For 1
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:55,296	| IOT227 |	Let It Go
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:56,064	| IOT227 |	Elan new project
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:58,368	| IOT227 |	It is asthma
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:32:59,904	| IOT227 |	About respecting the prison
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:02,720	| IOT227 |	As it is about building for the future
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:04,512	| IOT227 |	Flat affect
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,792	| IOT227 |	We need to respect
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:10,400	| IOT227 |	Although the infrastructure that is already in place and the dealer collection that is already in place
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:10,912	| IOT227 |	Why
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:16,800	| IOT227 |	Create new business processes and experiences
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:17,568	| IOT227 |	Leveraging

EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:27,040	| IOT227 |	And I are taking but they also need to plan around people
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:34,208	| IOT227 |	Different set of skills
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:35,232	| IOT227 |	Last but not the least
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:37,792	| IOT227 |	We need to budget for failure

EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:20,800	| IOT227 |	Mike nefkens who is the president and CEO of resideo
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:22,336	| IOT227 |	Hello Mike how are you
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:25,408	| IOT227 |	I said she doing great thanks for having me on the show
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:27,456	| IOT227 |	I am really excited so
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:28,992	| IOT227 |	Gosh way back
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:33,600	| IOT227 |	October of last year was video spun out of Honeywell and I'm going to ask you
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:35,136	| IOT227 |	How that's going but first
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:36,672	| IOT227 |	I have to say
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:39,744	| IOT227 |	Congratulations you moved to my former hometown of Austin and I
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:41,792	| IOT227 |	You are having a great time there
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:46,400	| IOT227 |	I've been here about two months and so far so good A bit hotter than we
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:52,288	| IOT227 |	Expected but but we're really enjoying that we opened our new headquarters about two or three weeks ago and we are fully up and running
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:54,336	| IOT227 |	Excellent all right
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:56,896	| IOT227 |	Let's just get started with getting an update
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:35:01,760	| IOT227 |	I should we should tell people who may not be familiar didn't read articles I wrote about this but
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:03,040	| IOT227 |	Talk to us about
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:05,088	| IOT227 |	Why Presidio spun out of Honeywell
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:06,368	| IOT227 |	What
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,392	| IOT227 |	Resideo is today
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:12,256	| IOT227 |	Grassy the process started about a year-and-a-half ago where a Honeywell
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:13,280	| IOT227 |	Being a
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:19,680	| IOT227 |	Omega Industrial Corporation has multiple business lines from building
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:23,520	| IOT227 |	Chemicals Etc and what they realized was they had a few businesses
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,544	| IOT227 |	It will actually be
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:25,312	| IOT227 |	Cunning
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:28,896	| IOT227 |	More consumer eyes than then what they're
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:30,688	| IOT227 |	Teaching Focus was becoming
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:35,040	| IOT227 |	Honeywell focuses on creating topics for airplanes and you know creating
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:36,576	| IOT227 |	Huge Building Solutions
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:38,880	| IOT227 |	So they were for businesses in Honeywell
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:45,280	| IOT227 |	One was all that distribution business which is low voltage security the other was a comfort business which is really focused
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:46,560	| IOT227 |	Are thermostats
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:52,704	| IOT227 |	Web security business as well and then a what we call an energy business which is really gassy
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:57,568	| IOT227 |	And they brought those for businesses into one and that is what ridiculous
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:36:03,968	| IOT227 |	Honeywell in October and turn on publicly traded companies do about at 5
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:05,760	| IOT227 |	Billion dollars annually right now
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:10,368	| IOT227 |	And we're bringing all those assets together now to really focus on the Smart Home
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:15,488	| IOT227 |	What makes us unique as we don't sell to consumer-direct we do everything through the pro Channel
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:18,816	| IOT227 |	So once or business has spent over a hundred years building up
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:21,888	| IOT227 |	Coaching with a very very loyal customer base
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:23,168	| IOT227 |	And that's what
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:24,960	| IOT227 |	Will bring those businesses together
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:31,360	| IOT227 |	To bring a really unique experience to the pros and to the homeowners and work on the company resideo Technologies
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:34,944	| IOT227 |	We do still have the Honeywell brand work on the Honeywell Home
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:37,504	| IOT227 |	On certain product over the pros will continue to see that going
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:41,856	| IOT227 |	Oh yes I was going to ask him I, but I still have Honeywell
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:48,256	| IOT227 |	In also I feel like I can buy Honeywell thermostats at Home Depot or someplace like that like the tea
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:49,792	| IOT227 |	It's maybe the T9 there's a lot of
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:51,072	| IOT227 |	Is T5
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:51,840	| IOT227 |	Also
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:52,608	| IOT227 |	That is correct
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:55,168	| IOT227 |	We do about 3% of our business
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:37:01,568	| IOT227 |	Home Depot Lone Star Best Buy really really what it is
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:04,640	| IOT227 |	Those products are not do-it-yourself products and then you can buy them
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:05,408	| IOT227 |	Do you need a prototype
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:12,320	| IOT227 |	Now we're learning about the consumer through Home Depot we want that touchpoint that late customers of ours but our Focus
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:18,464	| IOT227 |	You and my husband agree on that we need a pro to install thermos
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:20,768	| IOT227 |	I personally am
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:21,536	| IOT227 |	I could do it
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:23,584	| IOT227 |	Why we stopped people don't cut the red wire
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:27,936	| IOT227 |	All right
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:30,752	| IOT227 |	Let's talk about some of the Acquisitions you guys have
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:32,800	| IOT227 |	With me because you done about the
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:34,592	| IOT227 |	3believe Bowie
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:36,640	| IOT227 |	Was one of the first it was a
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:37,920	| IOT227 |	Device that you can stick on your
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:38,944	| IOT227 |	Your water main
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:39,968	| IOT227 |	And it
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:45,856	| IOT227 |	Monitor flow if it shut things off it was very cool I saw to see us a couple years ago
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:47,904	| IOT227 |	You'll find the IP from whisker lab
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:49,184	| IOT227 |	Angebot LifeWay
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:51,488	| IOT227 |	We're so kind of a lot happening here so
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:52,512	| IOT227 |	What is the strategy
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:56,096	| IOT227 |	Yeah so let me back in just talk about
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:57,376	| IOT227 |	What about the home itself
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:38:03,520	| IOT227 |	Soaps
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:06,080	| IOT227 |	Right where people are buying the product
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:07,616	| IOT227 |	Donald called one of the gadget
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:12,480	| IOT227 |	Now that you can put in your home and somewhere on his camera can be a doorbell whatever maybe
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:17,600	| IOT227 |	But what's really happening is there so many more critical systems and networks in the home
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:24,000	| IOT227 |	That's until those are being monitored and you're able to get the data and then really be able to understand how you can
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:25,536	| IOT227 |	People that give to those
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:27,072	| IOT227 |	We consider the homeless
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:33,216	| IOT227 |	And I really the best example I have to know what you think about that
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:35,776	| IOT227 |	Which mean the most people have some kind of
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:36,544	| IOT227 |	Security system
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:38,592	| IOT227 |	And that's the monitor
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:41,152	| IOT227 |	To the last 30-40 years you can buy
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:45,504	| IOT227 |	So you're out of the home and Intruder comes in somebody calls the police they come
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:47,808	| IOT227 |	But the rest of the home water neck
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,600	| IOT227 |	The air mattress
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:51,648	| IOT227 |	Air quality in temperature
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:53,184	| IOT227 |	The gas Network
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:54,208	| IOT227 |	Your electrical net
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:57,792	| IOT227 |	The homeowner is left all to themselves
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:39:02,912	| IOT227 |	Also have to figure out how to maintain and how to ensure that those things are working properly
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:07,264	| IOT227 |	What we're looking to do as we are looking to take monitoring
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:08,032	| IOT227 |	From
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:14,176	| IOT227 |	Security and start to monitor those other networks in the home your water your are your gas in your left
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:16,224	| IOT227 |	So we can provide
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:16,736	| IOT227 |	Call home
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:23,648	| IOT227 |	So that's the big the big chain
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:29,792	| IOT227 |	Solidify know our value proposition to the Pro-Am to the homeowner
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:34,912	| IOT227 |	We want to make sure that we can tell the homeowner
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:41,312	| IOT227 |	What's happening in the water Network in your home do you have any leaks what kind of water flow do you have the right
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:44,896	| IOT227 |	What time is your water safe to drink in all of those things in
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,944	| IOT227 |	The best example that on water is
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:49,248	| IOT227 |	Know when you leave your home if you have a leak you won't know about
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:51,040	| IOT227 |	If you're losing hundreds
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:55,648	| IOT227 |	Thousands of gallons of water because your sprinkler system is leaking you're not going to know about
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:59,744	| IOT227 |	Until you find a wet spot outside or until you see a really crazy water bill
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:06,656	| IOT227 |	We're going to be doing is just like him security if somebody breaks in your house or if you have a window open the moment that there is a pressure
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:13,056	| IOT227 |	If you were working the water losing pressure leaking between 2 and 4 in the morning we will advise the homeowner just like
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:14,848	| IOT227 |	Security that you have a problem in your house
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:18,944	| IOT227 |	And even better will send what we're calling our home hero which is our contractor
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:20,224	| IOT227 |	Immediately out to help you sleep
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:22,528	| IOT227 |	Same goes for the air Network
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:24,320	| IOT227 |	There's so much focus on thermostat
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:28,160	| IOT227 |	That's really cares about is your temperature 6970 more
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:34,816	| IOT227 |	I think the industry got that figured out what people care about now is your well-being in the home they want to know the quality is good
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,608	| IOT227 |	A window that shakes
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:43,008	| IOT227 |	And they wanted to do something about it when there's a problem so the same there were to be providing alerts when your indoor air quality is not
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:44,800	| IOT227 |	Semi satisfactory Ariel
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:47,872	| IOT227 |	And then really looking at the home Behind the Walls
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:51,712	| IOT227 |	There's so much going on behind Network young electrical Network
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:55,296	| IOT227 |	The best example I like to give there as you know your hot water heater
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:41:00,416	| IOT227 |	How many people are coming home turn on the hot water for a shower and I had a long day and there's no hot water
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:03,232	| IOT227 |	Is that hot water heater will tell you
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:09,632	| IOT227 |	A couple weeks before or Jeter using more electricity and we're going to be able to proactively tell you
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:10,656	| IOT227 |	There's a change
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:16,288	| IOT227 |	Turn on the hot water heater and we're going to send out a home here in to take a look at it in Six Pack Unit before it actually break
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:19,872	| IOT227 |	So that's what we're looking to provide to the homeowners you take a look
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:26,272	| IOT227 |	Bowie is key for us on the waterline whisker Labs is going to help us with energy management from sure we can save the homeowner
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:29,088	| IOT227 |	More money on your energy and life where is going to support us
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:30,368	| IOT227 |	On providing data
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:32,160	| IOT227 |	India on the gas electrical.
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:36,000	| IOT227 |	Excellent so it sounds like you have most of this figured out
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:39,328	| IOT227 |	I'm curious on the HVAC Network in air
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:41,888	| IOT227 |	Is that something you guys have everything there do you need to buy any bud
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:49,824	| IOT227 |	I think this will be a a constant you know as new technologies pump or will be adding insult
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:52,384	| IOT227 |	Acquisitions to help us go faster
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:58,783	| IOT227 |	You know we we have a majority but we need to have a very good offering you know we're always looking to see if you know where
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:42:01,087	| IOT227 |	Where else we can now pop in Subutex
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:02,111	| IOT227 |	Lily Drive
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:06,975	| IOT227 |	What I call your savings to the homeowner improve time improving the homeowners well-being
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:08,767	| IOT227 |	Okay and
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:10,047	| IOT227 |	With this in mind
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:13,631	| IOT227 |	And I I like to break this down cuz I feel like we're in the middle of a very big tree
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:14,399	| IOT227 |	Transition
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:15,935	| IOT227 |	That's between this
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:19,519	| IOT227 |	We're monitoring it or we're just reacting to take as they're happening to
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:20,799	| IOT227 |	What is
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:21,823	| IOT227 |	I was saying much smarter
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:25,919	| IOT227 |	And to make this happen it feels like you know we need monitoring
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:28,223	| IOT227 |	And then we need that layer of intelligence
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:34,111	| IOT227 |	It sounds like you're arguing that we need a layer of Professional Services to come in and deal with it with
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:34,879	| IOT227 |	But it's
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:35,391	| IOT227 |	What's something happy
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:37,695	| IOT227 |	It's also
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:39,999	| IOT227 |	What's really interesting is we have all the products
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:45,119	| IOT227 |	Already on those main lines remain in the house and a lot of our competitors they are dying
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:48,447	| IOT227 |	That's why they're losing hundreds of dollars on every
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:49,215	| IOT227 |	Cardwell
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:52,799	| IOT227 |	Gadget picture onto the house because they want data on the homeowner
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:55,103	| IOT227 |	We are ready at $151
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:57,919	| IOT227 |	That's what makes us unique we already have
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:59,455	| IOT227 |	The contractor Network
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:00,991	| IOT227 |	It wants to work through us
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:05,343	| IOT227 |	What you just said is exactly right but I think you use the word Gadget burnout
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:08,415	| IOT227 |	Right now so somebody's got to bring
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:10,207	| IOT227 |	This information together
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:16,351	| IOT227 |	And what we're looking at
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:18,911	| IOT227 |	And that's how you win a gray
EDL	00:43:18,911	00:43:21,983	| IOT227 |	You have been a great through these various applications and frankly
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:25,311	| IOT227 |	So what we're looking to do with we're looking to put them intelligence play on top of that
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:27,359	| IOT227 |	Bb1 application
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:29,663	| IOT227 |	It allows us to drive
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:30,431	| IOT227 |	All of them
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:32,735	| IOT227 |	Nation on those networks I just described
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:34,527	| IOT227 |	And allows your pro
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:36,575	| IOT227 |	See the data that you want them to
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:39,647	| IOT227 |	And get alerts so that they can come out and help you
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:44,511	| IOT227 |	So we are Vision in this is why we have headquartered in Austin we got a big development team here
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:47,071	| IOT227 |	Our vision is a we will build
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:48,351	| IOT227 |	An application
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:54,495	| IOT227 |	That will be an application people use no other 15 applications or so they use in their daily life
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:57,823	| IOT227 |	And it will allow you to monitor
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:59,871	| IOT227 |	And it will allow you to
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:02,687	| IOT227 |	See the information you need on those critical.
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:04,735	| IOT227 |	Examples hot water heater
EDL	00:44:04,735	00:44:07,807	| IOT227 |	Nobody wants to go deep into a hot water heater
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:14,207	| IOT227 |	And see what are the corrosive levels what's going on from the exact temperature in the tank and you know how is it
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:19,583	| IOT227 |	The gas burning in a what's the control unit doing people up here they just want to know
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:20,863	| IOT227 |	And if not let me know
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:27,007	| IOT227 |	And that's the kind of information wouldn't be providing and when we let the homeowner know we'll let the pro know as well
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:28,287	| IOT227 |	Immediate
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:31,359	| IOT227 |	Okay now this is a big shift
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:33,151	| IOT227 |	And I think
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:38,015	| IOT227 |	What happened in the smart home is people have bought gadgets because there is a subset of
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:39,295	| IOT227 |	Homeowners who are like
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:42,367	| IOT227 |	Hey meet it's a cool Gadget I want to I want to play a 1/2
EDL	00:44:42,367	00:44:43,647	| IOT227 |	And I think that's where we've been
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:46,719	| IOT227 |	The challenge here is
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:53,119	| IOT227 |	This is expensive in I don't know if a lot of people are ready to invest in something they can
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:55,423	| IOT227 |	Can't see so there's like the cedia channel
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:45:01,311	| IOT227 |	Offers you cool AV stuff like that turn on and off and it's very funky and find people
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:02,591	| IOT227 |	Pay for that
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:06,431	| IOT227 |	It seems really tough to get people to Shell out for something like
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:08,991	| IOT227 |	We're going to make sure your hot water heater doesn't light
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:13,855	| IOT227 |	And I know it's a big deal and I know people hate it when it happens but I am
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:15,391	| IOT227 |	Really impressed
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:16,671	| IOT227 |	By people short-sightedness
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:18,975	| IOT227 |	When I asked them about
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:22,815	| IOT227 |	Hey would you buy it like a belief system or something like that they're like
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:26,399	| IOT227 |	Ar500 or $600 I don't know
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:28,703	| IOT227 |	How do you convince people that they
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:30,495	| IOT227 |	They want this they need this in their car
EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:31,263	| IOT227 |	Payforit
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:31,775	| IOT227 |	How do you make
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:33,567	| IOT227 |	Pricing
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:34,335	| IOT227 |	Works for that
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:40,479	| IOT227 |	You got it to look the first thing is we're going to be launching in December when we're going to be launching exactly how these models
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:46,111	| IOT227 |	So much more to come on that but what I can tell you now is think of it really as
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:52,511	| IOT227 |	A lot of homeowners 20%
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:58,655	| IOT227 |	They bite their HVAC Pro they buy medicinal warranty that Pro comes out twice a year
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:03,007	| IOT227 |	So what we want to do what we want to do that
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:05,567	| IOT227 |	As a warranty
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:11,967	| IOT227 |	I think of it that when were everything will be included. They're going to be certain models where you you can either Buy.
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:13,503	| IOT227 |	Hardware yourself
EDL	00:46:13,503	00:46:17,343	| IOT227 |	Or you can actually do it through as you go monthly warranty
EDL	00:46:17,343	00:46:23,743	| IOT227 |	So that's our big announcement that will be having at the end of the year and we're looking to make this very simple for the homeowner
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:30,143	| IOT227 |	No you're paying for two or three warranties and different parts of your house you can come by
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:36,543	| IOT227 |	One and even even better I'll give an example if you have the water Protection Service that we have you can print off a certificate
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:39,871	| IOT227 |	Like your insurance company gets really significant discount on your insurance
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:46,271	| IOT227 |	So we were confident we're going to be able to save the Homeland quite a bit of money by doing this and save them time and hassle you know when the
EDL	00:46:46,271	00:46:48,575	| IOT227 |	I have to stop this will be able to put down
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:51,135	| IOT227 |	Given the direction that you're moving
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:53,695	| IOT227 |	In this idea of monitoring all the vital systems in the
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:55,999	| IOT227 |	How important is it that
EDL	00:46:55,999	00:46:58,047	| IOT227 |	Everything in the home be made by Honeywell
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:46:59,583	| IOT227 |	I'm sitting in a house that
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:01,887	| IOT227 |	I'm sitting in a rental house but
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:04,447	| IOT227 |	Even in my older house I
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:05,215	| IOT227 |	Mixed and matched
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:06,495	| IOT227 |	France so
EDL	00:47:06,495	00:47:07,263	| IOT227 |	What is the philosophy
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:11,871	| IOT227 |	Typically been an open company and we are
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:14,687	| IOT227 |	Looking to add many many partners
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:15,711	| IOT227 |	To our service
EDL	00:47:15,711	00:47:18,527	| IOT227 |	No just like to run ATI Branch we have
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:24,927	| IOT227 |	The largest distribution of low voltage Security in the world with 200 locations we only sell about
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:28,767	| IOT227 |	15% of what soul do that is residual products so we want to make sure that
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:31,839	| IOT227 |	No the homeowner is able to get a whole Home Solution
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:34,655	| IOT227 |	And the residual product is the best for that great
EDL	00:47:34,655	00:47:40,031	| IOT227 |	And if there are others out there they complete the solution we will partner will make sure that that's accessible to what to the homeowner
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:42,079	| IOT227 |	Okay so that makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:47:42,591	00:47:47,199	| IOT227 |	But now let's talk about kind of the role of the pro cuz I'm hearing a lot of
EDL	00:47:47,199	00:47:49,247	| IOT227 |	Pro install Pro everything
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:51,295	| IOT227 |	Does this mean you guys are going to
EDL	00:47:51,295	00:47:52,063	| IOT227 |	Back out of
EDL	00:47:52,063	00:47:52,575	| IOT227 |	The DIYs
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:58,463	| IOT227 |	Well we're really not in the DIY space like I said about 3% of our revenues isn't DIY
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:48:05,119	| IOT227 |	What you just said is it's so important in the real battle going on right now is Pro versus DIY
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:06,911	| IOT227 |	And we are doubling down on the pro
EDL	00:48:06,911	00:48:08,447	| IOT227 |	Elizabeth
EDL	00:48:08,447	00:48:10,495	| IOT227 |	The house is only going to become more complex
EDL	00:48:11,007	00:48:14,847	| IOT227 |	And with that you would support if you take a look at your daily life
EDL	00:48:14,847	00:48:18,943	| IOT227 |	Rights for your body you have a position for your car you have a mechanic
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:20,991	| IOT227 |	Office Buildings at building manager
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:26,623	| IOT227 |	But against the home we leave it was really not trains or doesn't have the time or skills
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:29,695	| IOT227 |	To manage a lot of these systems in the home that are behind the wall
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:32,255	| IOT227 |	Sure they can maybe manager Gadget or two on the wall
EDL	00:48:32,255	00:48:34,559	| IOT227 |	We're going to focus on elevating
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:37,119	| IOT227 |	The professionalism of the pro
EDL	00:48:37,119	00:48:38,911	| IOT227 |	Making them a home hero
EDL	00:48:38,911	00:48:42,239	| IOT227 |	Helping support the homeowner with all this drip system
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:48,639	| IOT227 |	You're still going to be Gadget so you can buy and we don't want to play with him
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:51,711	| IOT227 |	So there will be a DIY more Market that will continue
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:57,599	| IOT227 |	But for these big critical systems around water around gas around electrical around security
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:48:59,903	| IOT227 |	PowerPoint of Ulysses are pro products
EDL	00:48:59,903	00:49:04,767	| IOT227 |	And by doing so that we can save the homeowner time money and improve their well-being
EDL	00:49:05,535	00:49:07,583	| IOT227 |	Let's talk about the impact to your bottom line
EDL	00:49:09,375	00:49:10,143	| IOT227 |	So
EDL	00:49:10,143	00:49:10,655	| IOT227 |	This is a big
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:12,447	| IOT227 |	And
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:18,591	| IOT227 |	Part of I know that you've talked about in previous earnings calls has been the shift to recurring Revenue so things like monitoring
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:20,639	| IOT227 |	How do you guys in vision
EDL	00:49:21,151	00:49:23,967	| IOT227 |	Making that flip for my product to a
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:25,503	| IOT227 |	Services kind of company and
EDL	00:49:26,015	00:49:26,783	| IOT227 |	What's that going to look
EDL	00:49:27,807	00:49:33,951	| IOT227 |	Now we're starting that now the first piece is going to be bringing the multiple applications we have together until
EDL	00:49:34,463	00:49:35,743	| IOT227 |	So that's the first step
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:42,143	| IOT227 |	So when we do that we're going to be able to offer the pro and homeowner we're going to be a thought for them straight up
EDL	00:49:42,143	00:49:48,543	| IOT227 |	Sell a product that's what they choose for will be able to offer them a subscription service so that they can really get the service
EDL	00:49:48,543	00:49:52,127	| IOT227 |	Just pay as they go and will we will keep their Tech up-to-date in their home
EDL	00:49:53,151	00:49:59,295	| IOT227 |	You know I'm 3 years. They have a thermostat to Russian 3 years will replace it to the next newest one if they so choose so
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:03,903	| IOT227 |	We're starting at flip now we already have a chunk of our business
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:05,695	| IOT227 |	Recurring Revenue
EDL	00:50:05,695	00:50:07,487	| IOT227 |	And yes we're looking to grow that
EDL	00:50:07,487	00:50:13,631	| IOT227 |	So I told the market that know that recurring Revenue
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:14,911	| IOT227 |	What we have now
EDL	00:50:14,911	00:50:17,471	| IOT227 |	And I work all that we can make it to that knowledge
EDL	00:50:17,471	00:50:23,871	| IOT227 |	No stress the recurring Services if the quality is right and we can do this right margins movie Higher
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:29,503	| IOT227 |	And we also think their value will be better for us for the program for the homeowner so it's a win-win for everybody
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:31,039	| IOT227 |	Excellent
EDL	00:50:31,039	00:50:33,343	| IOT227 |	But how do you adjust your business
EDL	00:50:33,855	00:50:36,671	| IOT227 |	The deal with the fact that you're no longer selling a product
EDL	00:50:36,671	00:50:38,463	| IOT227 |	But you're really selling this relationship
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:41,791	| IOT227 |	Yeah that's really
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:42,559	| IOT227 |	That's exactly
EDL	00:50:43,071	00:50:44,607	| IOT227 |	What we want is we want
EDL	00:50:44,607	00:50:46,143	| IOT227 |	Proactive
EDL	00:50:46,143	00:50:47,935	| IOT227 |	Continuous relationship with
EDL	00:50:47,935	00:50:48,447	| IOT227 |	Customer
EDL	00:50:48,959	00:50:51,775	| IOT227 |	We want resideo to be the home hero
EDL	00:50:51,775	00:50:58,175	| IOT227 |	And our vision in the future is that know when homes are built they will be certified homes that have all
EDL	00:50:58,175	00:51:04,575	| IOT227 |	All this equipment so that way you can just turn on the service and
EDL	00:51:04,575	00:51:05,343	| IOT227 |	Monitored
EDL	00:51:05,343	00:51:07,647	| IOT227 |	In your home is safe efficient and healthy
EDL	00:51:07,647	00:51:09,439	| IOT227 |	That's what I'm looking for last longer

EDL	00:51:11,743	00:51:14,303	| IOT227 |	Let's move from the future of resideo
EDL	00:51:14,303	00:51:16,095	| IOT227 |	You just brought questions about

EDL	00:51:23,775	00:51:24,287	| IOT227 |	Because of them
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:26,079	| IOT227 |	How is that affecting you guys

EDL	00:51:31,455	00:51:37,855	| IOT227 |	On the borders when the trade free zone so you know we went through a bit of a scare when the US and Mexico
EDL	00:51:37,855	00:51:39,391	| IOT227 |	We're talking about tariffs
