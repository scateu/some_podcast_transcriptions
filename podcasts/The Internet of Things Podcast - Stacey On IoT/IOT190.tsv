EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,520	| IOT190 |	Awesome you guys
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:56,384	| IOT190 |	Man I feel like the last couple episodes we spent a lot of time talking about privacy
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,664	| IOT190 |	And
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:58,176	| IOT190 |	It looks like
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,712	| IOT190 |	Now we're actually getting
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:01,248	| IOT190 |	Somewhere in the legislative
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,528	| IOT190 |	World
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,552	| IOT190 |	Yay
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,320	| IOT190 |	Yay
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:09,696	| IOT190 |	So the ntia which is the national telecommunications infrastructure Asia
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,976	| IOT190 |	See it's part of the department
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:14,048	| IOT190 |	They also handle like rural Broadband in
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,584	| IOT190 |	Stuff that you like what
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,608	| IOT190 |	I don't know about the NCAA
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:17,888	| IOT190 |	You may have to
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:18,400	| IOT190 |	Because
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:20,192	| IOT190 |	They have been responsible for
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:20,960	| IOT190 |	Are coming up with some
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:21,984	| IOT190 |	Updated privacy
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,776	| IOT190 |	They were published
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:24,800	| IOT190 |	Actually in
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,568	| IOT190 |	September
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,336	| IOT190 |	In the Federal Register
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:29,152	| IOT190 |	Which is very good reading
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,688	| IOT190 |	Curl up with that every night
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,224	| IOT190 |	I'm glad we have lawyers
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:33,760	| IOT190 |	What is a journalist
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:39,136	| IOT190 |	Come over this stuff but recently what happened as everybody had to submit comment
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:43,488	| IOT190 |	And so we're seeing a lot of comments now for various agencies and organizations talking about
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,536	| IOT190 |	So it's time to dig
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:50,144	| IOT190 |	Basically the ntia is trying to figure out the
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,936	| IOT190 |	The administration's approach to Consumer privacy
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:55,776	| IOT190 |	They settled on the FTC the Federal Trade Commission
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:58,592	| IOT190 |	For taking care of enforcement
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:04,736	| IOT190 |	For this so it's not going to be an auntie a thing cuz they're already handles things like deceptive advertising
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:08,576	| IOT190 |	Consumer privacy and other areas
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:09,600	| IOT190 |	To the FTC
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,160	| IOT190 |	Bfcc by the way
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,440	| IOT190 |	Is it a common saying
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:16,768	| IOT190 |	Let's dig into what
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,071	| IOT190 |	Ntia thinks we should be
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,351	| IOT190 |	First step
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:25,983	| IOT190 |	So I like the approach that they've taken here because they got two sections where they
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:30,847	| IOT190 |	Highlighted about 7 privacy outcome so we know what to expect or what these
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,639	| IOT190 |	Ideas wealth APUSH
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:39,039	| IOT190 |	For Consumer privacy and then 8 high-level goals for federal action so we've got the outcome based
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:43,391	| IOT190 |	Situation here that they're outlining so what do you want to go through the Privacy outcomes first
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,439	| IOT190 |	Sure but first I want to say
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,719	| IOT190 |	Outcome-based
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:48,255	| IOT190 |	Best approach is really important
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,047	| IOT190 |	Because
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:52,351	| IOT190 |	We're dealing with an area that is so cool
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,119	| IOT190 |	Quickly changing
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:56,703	| IOT190 |	But we can't have something to prescriptive because it's going to become outdated weight
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,495	| IOT190 |	So I think that's a really important
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:03,615	| IOT190 |	Starting now to the why these will be very off a high-level generic
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:06,175	| IOT190 |	So they can be modified
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:08,991	| IOT190 |	Under certain sections in the future if things change I would think
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,527	| IOT190 |	Yeah and that you have discretion
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:16,671	| IOT190 |	So the agency responsible for enforcement and this is both a good thing and a bad thing it depends on who's in charge of
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,207	| IOT190 |	Discretion does
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,743	| IOT190 |	Ideally
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:20,511	| IOT190 |	It will
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,279	| IOT190 |	B2
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,047	| IOT190 |	Better
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:24,095	| IOT190 |	Boss basically that are little bit more Flex
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:24,863	| IOT190 |	Example of something that
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,143	| IOT190 |	Ongoing anime
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,679	| IOT190 |	So how come
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,727	| IOT190 |	Let's talk about him first step
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:31,007	| IOT190 |	Transparency
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:33,823	| IOT190 |	You should be able to understand how people collect and share your
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:37,151	| IOT190 |	Your data what's really noteworthy here is baseball
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,687	| IOT190 |	Specifically call out
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:41,247	| IOT190 |	The idea of Leslie notices
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:43,295	| IOT190 |	Describing a company's privacy program
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:45,855	| IOT190 |	Consumers initial point of interaction
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:47,647	| IOT190 |	The product does not lead
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,159	| IOT190 |	Adequate
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,463	| IOT190 |	That is basically a
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,231	| IOT190 |	Stabbot
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:57,631	| IOT190 |	Euless it is it is an we talked about this before I would like to know that before I even buy the product now.
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,167	| IOT190 |	Get into how track sleep
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,191	| IOT190 |	Make it happen
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:01,727	| IOT190 |	Weather going
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:03,775	| IOT190 |	And last week when we were taught.
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:04,287	| IOT190 |	I think it was last
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:11,199	| IOT190 |	When we had the person talk about the digital standard on the show she actually suggested that when you put something in your
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:11,967	| IOT190 |	Your Amazon
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:13,503	| IOT190 |	UC
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,271	| IOT190 |	Basic
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:14,783	| IOT190 |	Privacy
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,575	| IOT190 |	And kind of data sharing
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,111	| IOT190 |	Framework
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,391	| IOT190 |	Notice which I actually thought was
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:22,207	| IOT190 |	I like that I like that
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,487	| IOT190 |	So hey Amazon if you're listening
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:24,767	| IOT190 |	About that
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,535	| IOT190 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:26,559	| IOT190 |	Next up
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,327	| IOT190 |	Control
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,095	| IOT190 |	You should be able to
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:31,423	| IOT190 |	Exercise reasonable control over the collection use storage and desk
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:33,215	| IOT190 |	Disclosure of your personal info
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:34,239	| IOT190 |	Information that you
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,007	| IOT190 |	Provide
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:35,775	| IOT190 |	This is
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:40,639	| IOT190 |	Interesting it reminds me of when you install an app on your phone where permissions are asked
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:44,735	| IOT190 |	You know what you want to Grant this app permission to see your contacts
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:47,551	| IOT190 |	I like this type of data use your GPS Etc
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,831	| IOT190 |	I don't think
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:52,415	| IOT190 |	Sometimes we just say yes blindly to all those permission requests
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:57,279	| IOT190 |	If you're not going to use a particular function if you're not going to use location-based functions of a device
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:03,679	| IOT190 |	The whole device should still work except for that function that a lot of times you can't even use a device or nap unless you agree to all of them
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:10,079	| IOT190 |	What's up when they say control I kind of read into it that way and maybe I'm reading into it too much but that's what I like to see
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:12,127	| IOT190 |	Will have talked about it doesn't really get
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,663	| IOT190 |	Into
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:19,295	| IOT190 |	Now it does say that you should be able to rescind your permissions as well
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,063	| IOT190 |	Which is nice
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:23,135	| IOT190 |	So moving on a reasonable minimization
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,671	| IOT190 |	Data collection should
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:25,439	| IOT190 |	Deminimize
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,743	| IOT190 |	It needs to be
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:29,791	| IOT190 |	Weighed against the risk of privacy
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:30,559	| IOT190 |	Harp
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:33,119	| IOT190 |	So it also talks in this is tied into the next
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,655	| IOT190 |	Security
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,959	| IOT190 |	The company collecting this data needs to have
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:38,495	| IOT190 |	Security
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,263	| IOT190 |	In place
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:44,127	| IOT190 |	So if you're going to collect the state of you as a user should expect that the company is keeping it
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,407	| IOT190 |	Secure
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:47,711	| IOT190 |	And that the companies Gathering it should
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:51,039	| IOT190 |	To take measures appropriate to the level of risk associated if you lose it
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,831	| IOT190 |	Which means if you're like an experience
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,367	| IOT190 |	Saying that
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,159	| IOT190 |	Oh well
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:57,183	| IOT190 |	We had a password
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,231	| IOT190 |	Are servers that has
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:01,279	| IOT190 |	All of your sensitive credit card Medical
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:02,303	| IOT190 |	Financial info
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,351	| IOT190 |	That's not good enough
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,375	| IOT190 |	Especially the password
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:05,887	| IOT190 |	Password
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,679	| IOT190 |	They want to see a lot more
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:13,055	| IOT190 |	Also in the security section may discuss securing personal data at all stages
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:18,687	| IOT190 |	It's not just that collection computation storage but even the transfer of raw and processed data which
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,711	| IOT190 |	Is a must in my opinion
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,599	| IOT190 |	Cuz that actually makes it a bear
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:27,135	| IOT190 |	Access
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:27,903	| IOT190 |	Correction
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:32,511	| IOT190 |	Is user should have access to the data that you collected on them and
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:35,071	| IOT190 |	They should be able to have a process to change it
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:39,167	| IOT190 |	Which is really important as we start talking about things like oh I don't know
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:42,239	| IOT190 |	Your health insurance information being collected from your Fitbit
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:44,031	| IOT190 |	Maybe you lost it for a day
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:44,799	| IOT190 |	And it's not accurate
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,871	| IOT190 |	You should be able to have a process by which
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,383	| IOT190 |	To say that
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:54,783	| IOT190 |	I agree I just end this is an edge case I worry about
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,063	| IOT190 |	People who made
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:58,879	| IOT190 |	Do nefarious things and then go back in
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,903	| IOT190 |	Scrub
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:04,255	| IOT190 |	Make the sound captured by a smart device when they take that nefarious thing later you know
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:04,767	| IOT190 |	I'm okay with
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:10,143	| IOT190 |	Cuz even scrubbing the data
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:13,215	| IOT190 |	So in the Kate like if I murdered someone and then went back in
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:13,983	| IOT190 |	Erase those
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,775	| IOT190 |	Sound files from my echo
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,311	| IOT190 |	They're still circumstantial evidence
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,359	| IOT190 |	Oh hey what were they doing
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:28,063	| IOT190 |	Yeah I wasn't going there
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,623	| IOT190 |	Management
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,391	| IOT190 |	This is
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,951	| IOT190 |	Kind of Tide with the security stuff but basically
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,719	| IOT190 |	Hey
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:36,767	| IOT190 |	Try not to expose people's personal data
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:37,535	| IOT190 |	And
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:40,863	| IOT190 |	Basically I don't say this because this is how they're
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,631	| IOT190 |	Pitching this
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:44,959	| IOT190 |	Risk management is the core of this Administration
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:49,055	| IOT190 |	Approach as it provides the flexibility to encourage innovation in business models and
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:53,407	| IOT190 |	Privacy tools while focusing on potential consumer harm and maximizing private
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:56,479	| IOT190 |	It's also a really hard thing to legislate
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,551	| IOT190 |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:01,087	| IOT190 |	Accountability
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:04,671	| IOT190 |	Organization should be accountable both internally and externally
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:07,231	| IOT190 |	For collecting and using personal information
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:07,743	| IOT190 |	A-Team
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:10,047	| IOT190 |	Also if you
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:12,607	| IOT190 |	Collect data you need to make sure that your third party
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:13,887	| IOT190 |	Companies that have access
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,679	| IOT190 |	Better service provider
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,727	| IOT190 |	They are also accountable for the use
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:25,407	| IOT190 |	That one's yeah because then we just had this many times in the show Once the data is
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:29,759	| IOT190 |	Casino
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:34,367	| IOT190 |	Original company doesn't really have any control until after the fact
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:37,695	| IOT190 |	Third party company uses that private data
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,719	| IOT190 |	Wrongly
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:45,119	| IOT190 |	Sure you can shut them down and shut down access but they still have all that old data at this is a really tricky situation
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:51,519	| IOT190 |	It is although I think it does encourage people to be a little bit more circumspect about who their share data with in the first place
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,567	| IOT190 |	It's right Yep this is basically a scribe
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:56,383	| IOT190 |	Hopefully penalties to the improper use of
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:58,431	| IOT190 |	Which right now there aren't really
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:02,015	| IOT190 |	It's unclear exactly what these penalties would be the F2
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:06,367	| IOT190 |	DC that's the power to fine people that has the power to censure them doesn't
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:06,879	| IOT190 |	Have
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:08,415	| IOT190 |	Lck
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:11,999	| IOT190 |	Those were the Privacy outcomes
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,535	| IOT190 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:14,815	| IOT190 |	High-level goals
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:17,119	| IOT190 |	So these are again
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:19,167	| IOT190 |	Big picture they want
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,959	| IOT190 |	They want to harmonize the regulatory lives
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,727	| IOT190 |	Skip that makes sense
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:25,567	| IOT190 |	Not a lot of lies they want legal Clarity while maintaining the
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,335	| IOT190 |	Flexibility
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,615	| IOT190 |	What about that
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:29,151	| IOT190 |	Comprehensive application
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:29,919	| IOT190 |	Eniac
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,687	| IOT190 |	Addressing
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,967	| IOT190 |	Super privacy should apply to
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,735	| IOT190 |	Do all private
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:34,527	| IOT190 |	That is nice
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,831	| IOT190 |	Because right now the only legislation that
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:40,159	| IOT190 |	We have it a federal level it was an attempt is legislation that
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:41,951	| IOT190 |	Applied only to government contractors
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,719	| IOT190 |	It was more about
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,511	| IOT190 |	And that was kind of like
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,047	| IOT190 |	Everyone must play
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:48,351	| IOT190 |	Play Risk and outcome based approach
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,935	| IOT190 |	That could come back and bite us olbia
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:54,751	| IOT190 |	As consumers it may not be the most consumer-friendly
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,543	| IOT190 |	That'll be an Aries
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,055	| IOT190 |	I don't want to watch
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,359	| IOT190 |	Interoperability
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:00,639	| IOT190 |	Time is very excited about it
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:04,991	| IOT190 |	So when I first read this I kind of thought interoperability in terms of like
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:10,623	| IOT190 |	Platform is talking to each other and so on but it's not so much that it's just a step back saying we realize that
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,391	| IOT190 |	Two events
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:13,695	| IOT190 |	No smart devices and all these new
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:19,839	| IOT190 |	Services are coming out based on personal data you know they are based on personal data so we don't want to cut down and make it difficult for
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,375	| IOT190 |	Play services
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:24,959	| IOT190 |	We still have to make sure the personal data is
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:26,239	| IOT190 |	Protected so it's
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:27,775	| IOT190 |	And they're saying we should
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:34,175	| IOT190 |	Sika reduce friction placed on data flows better developing a landscape landscape
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:34,943	| IOT190 |	Trademarks
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:40,319	| IOT190 |	Around the world that the United States participates in and so on so I think this is kind of like just a high-level thing saying no
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,855	| IOT190 |	We got to be carefully balanced
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,391	| IOT190 |	Privacy risks
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:45,183	| IOT190 |	It's versus stifling Innovation we don't want to do that
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,463	| IOT190 |	And
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,743	| IOT190 |	It would stifle innovation
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,767	| IOT190 |	If there was like
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:50,559	| IOT190 |	Our rules were really different from like
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:52,351	| IOT190 |	Gdpr
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:53,631	| IOT190 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:57,215	| IOT190 |	They also call for incentivizing privacy research
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:58,239	| IOT190 |	Yay money
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:58,751	| IOT190 |	For privacy reason
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:01,311	| IOT190 |	FTC enforcement we talked about that
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,591	| IOT190 |	And scalability
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:05,663	| IOT190 |	Administration should ensure that the proverbial
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:07,455	| IOT190 |	Sticks used to incentivize drunk
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:09,503	| IOT190 |	Consumer privacy outcomes are deployed in
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:13,087	| IOT190 |	Portion to the scale and scope of the information an organization is
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:13,855	| IOT190 |	Mishandling
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:16,415	| IOT190 |	So small businesses that don't have a lot of information
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,975	| IOT190 |	They probably shouldn't be the big targets
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:20,255	| IOT190 |	So basically
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:22,047	| IOT190 |	Facebook Google
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:22,815	| IOT190 |	Experian
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:23,839	| IOT190 |	OU big toes
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:25,631	| IOT190 |	Target on your back
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,143	| IOT190 |	If you don't behave
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:27,935	| IOT190 |	So
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,983	| IOT190 |	So far feedback has been
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:32,287	| IOT190 |	Mostly like hey the ftc's good for this
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,823	| IOT190 |	Privacy watchdog
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,615	| IOT190 |	Good with a lot of things
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,895	| IOT190 |	In aggregate
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,431	| IOT190 |	Question the small print
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:44,319	| IOT190 |	Flexibility so those are where you're going to see the vice and then the
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,599	| IOT190 |	Yunnan libertarian
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,879	| IOT190 |	Anti-privacy people are like
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:47,903	| IOT190 |	This goes too far
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:51,487	| IOT190 |	So we'll keep an eye on that
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:55,839	| IOT190 |	She is in December and February holding their own hearings on privacy
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,631	| IOT190 |	So we're going to be hearing a lot more
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:13:59,935	| IOT190 |	It was a lot about private
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:02,495	| IOT190 |	At least you guys didn't have to read through it
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:03,519	| IOT190 |	Yeah they should
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,567	| IOT190 |	Federal Register
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:06,847	| IOT190 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:08,639	| IOT190 |	All right that's why we are
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,687	| IOT190 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,711	| IOT190 |	Let's talk about body
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,735	| IOT190 |	That's because this is why
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:17,855	| IOT190 |	Cheapest kind of popped up out of nowhere but it's
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:19,903	| IOT190 |	I don't say it's an old story but it's an old
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,463	| IOT190 |	Yeah I don't know
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:28,863	| IOT190 |	So back in January 2013 there was an advisory so back in 2013 it was an advisory released
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:35,263	| IOT190 |	Explaining a critical flaw in affected routers from Big names fraud, Sue Cisco tp-link
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:38,591	| IOT190 |	D-Link Netcare u.s. robotics or there's an opening for you
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:41,919	| IOT190 |	And it turns out that last week
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,687	| IOT190 |	That
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:48,831	| IOT190 |	Issue was looked into again at netlab 360 that researchers that look into these exploits and such
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:50,111	| IOT190 |	It's still around
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:57,023	| IOT190 |	And apparently is taking control of about 100000 different home and small office routers from that range of menu
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:15:00,095	| IOT190 |	Bashers I don't know why I was never fixed I guess
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,399	| IOT190 |	Didn't seem an issue at the time I don't know
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:03,167	| IOT190 |	It all
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:05,471	| IOT190 |	Revolves around universal plug and play
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:09,823	| IOT190 |	Here's the thing most people
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:15,455	| IOT190 |	In-the-know don't use UPnP or Universal plug-and-play they disable it whenever possible
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:21,087	| IOT190 |	Problem is there are still some Modern services and devices that require UPnP
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:24,927	| IOT190 |	I think I'm almost positive but the Chromecast still does
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:25,951	| IOT190 |	Chromecast
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:26,463	| IOT190 |	Requires up
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:33,375	| IOT190 |	Exactly the problem is with UPnP you're pretty much opening up your network to always be scan
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:36,447	| IOT190 |	Scanning for other UPnP type devices so just
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:40,287	| IOT190 |	So we just work so that's great from a user experience standpoint but it's
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:42,591	| IOT190 |	Terrible from a security standpoint
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,359	| IOT190 |	Yes
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,127	| IOT190 |	In fact
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:45,663	| IOT190 |	If you search for Chromecast and
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:47,455	| IOT190 |	UPnP you get all these things
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:49,247	| IOT190 |	Please help me use my Chromecast
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:49,759	| IOT190 |	UPnP
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,855	| IOT190 |	And fortunately Google says
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:54,879	| IOT190 |	Yeah I know
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:16:01,279	| IOT190 |	If you do have UPnP enabled and you have one of these Spartan 16 models of routers
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:07,679	| IOT190 |	Leaving Atlanta 360 has a list of them you should check to see if there's a router update or it
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,447	| IOT190 |	Patch available
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:16,639	| IOT190 |	I would agree with you on that I know routers can get expensive and all that but yeah I would agree
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:17,407	| IOT190 |	All right
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:18,431	| IOT190 |	Those are big
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:19,967	| IOT190 |	Let's talk about neural networks
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:23,551	| IOT190 |	Intel has a new one it's based on the movie Diaz
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:25,599	| IOT190 |	Chip Caray
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,391	| IOT190 |	Several years ago now
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:31,231	| IOT190 |	They launched one of these a year ago and it was
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:31,999	| IOT190 |	Huge
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:34,559	| IOT190 |	Hit people loved it it basically gives you
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:36,351	| IOT190 |	AI Computing capabilities
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,119	| IOT190 |	Edge device
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,887	| IOT190 |	Some people
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:40,959	| IOT190 |	Optimind drones and other things just to start like
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:42,239	| IOT190 |	Creating these new models
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:44,031	| IOT190 |	This version is
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:44,543	| IOT190 |	A hundred bucks
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:47,359	| IOT190 |	It's a bit more powerful and
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:49,151	| IOT190 |	You know same functionality
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,943	| IOT190 |	I expect this to sell very well
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,223	| IOT190 |	Community info
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:53,247	| IOT190 |	Developers who are trying
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:55,807	| IOT190 |	Figure out how to bring AI to the edge
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,343	| IOT190 |	So check that out
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:59,135	| IOT190 |	Yeah just a little USB stick
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:02,463	| IOT190 |	Plug into your computer
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:03,487	| IOT190 |	Apparently
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:09,887	| IOT190 |	Which that makes sense to me but I don't think you know everyday consumers going to rush out and say I want to make my drone smart let me go get this is going to be for
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:12,959	| IOT190 |	People who are kind of tinkering and making devices which many which
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:15,007	| IOT190 |	Are built on you know some piece of Linux
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,543	| IOT190 |	This is definitely
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,311	| IOT190 |	I would say
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,335	| IOT190 |	Professional Developers
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:19,871	| IOT190 |	Paper streamers
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:21,663	| IOT190 |	Nerds of the world
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,431	| IOT190 |	All right
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:22,943	| IOT190 |	Amazon
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:25,247	| IOT190 |	So much Amazon stock
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:26,015	| IOT190 |	Basilisk
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:29,343	| IOT190 |	They have their voice controlled microwave now available 6
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:29,855	| IOT190 |	Starbucks
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:34,207	| IOT190 |	Call Amazon's digital assistant
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:36,511	| IOT190 |	Cook baked potato in poof
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,279	| IOT190 |	It happens
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,303	| IOT190 |	This is not
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,839	| IOT190 |	To make your life easier
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:42,399	| IOT190 |	Because you think everyone talks about this microwave in there like
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,679	| IOT190 |	Okay I still have to get up
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,471	| IOT190 |	And put the thing in the microwave
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,495	| IOT190 |	And like that is not
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:48,287	| IOT190 |	Help that this is providing
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:51,871	| IOT190 |	Voice Control in this is providing all the thinking behind the scenes
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:52,895	| IOT190 |	Thanks for setting the time
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:54,175	| IOT190 |	Time to roast a baked potato
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:54,943	| IOT190 |	In the microwave
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,711	| IOT190 |	Or to make pop
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:58,783	| IOT190 |	It's almost late and I know we talked about this
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:02,367	| IOT190 |	Prayer because we both have one it's almost like the smarts of a June oven
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:04,927	| IOT190 |	Shrunken down into a microwave and with a voice
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:11,071	| IOT190 |	Control to access those smart as opposed to with the June we have a keypad in some other weekend use matinee to preheat
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,655	| IOT190 |	And also available as the Fire TV recast
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,935	| IOT190 |	Which is the
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:18,751	| IOT190 |	Antenna it's kind of like a personal Arrow
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:19,775	| IOT190 |	Remember that
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:24,127	| IOT190 |	It allows you to get digital TV signals and record it
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:24,895	| IOT190 |	Which over-the-air
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:28,223	| IOT190 |	DTV over-the-air over-the-air
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:31,807	| IOT190 |	I'm excited about that actually because I can't get over there television on
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:33,599	| IOT190 |	So I have to either buy it from
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,903	| IOT190 |	Play Swerve maybe this device will finally work
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,951	| IOT190 |	Who knows finally help me
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,975	| IOT190 |	I've had so many antennas
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:39,999	| IOT190 |	Just nothing
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,791	| IOT190 |	And also
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:43,583	| IOT190 |	You can add devices to
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,119	| IOT190 |	A room
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,399	| IOT190 |	Using your voice and
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:49,471	| IOT190 |	Microwave the recast in this voice
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:53,823	| IOT190 |	Adding devices via voice capability all of this was announced in September
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:55,871	| IOT190 |	With the Amazons gigantic
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,175	| IOT190 |	Very difficult cover
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,455	| IOT190 |	Very cool
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:01,503	| IOT190 |	So
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,527	| IOT190 |	Devices which
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,295	| IOT190 |	Use
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:03,807	| IOT190 |	React
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:06,367	| IOT190 |	Madame a Connect
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,135	| IOT190 |	Kit
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:07,903	| IOT190 |	They will
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:08,671	| IOT190 |	Actually
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:09,439	| IOT190 |	You can
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:11,231	| IOT190 |	Plug those devices in or
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,023	| IOT190 |	Just basically give those devices
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:14,303	| IOT190 |	The power they're going to
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,071	| IOT190 |	Fire up
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:16,607	| IOT190 |	And they're going to be able to
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:18,655	| IOT190 |	Locate themselves on your Wi-Fi
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:20,959	| IOT190 |	Work if Amazon has your Wi-Fi credentials
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:24,031	| IOT190 |	They will connect and then your Madame a device
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:24,799	| IOT190 |	She's going to say
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:26,079	| IOT190 |	Hey I see a smart plug
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:27,871	| IOT190 |	What would you like to call it
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,919	| IOT190 |	To be like I'd like to call the kitchen
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,199	| IOT190 |	And it'll be like
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:32,479	| IOT190 |	Would you like to put it in a room
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:35,039	| IOT190 |	How do you say yes please put in the kitchen
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:36,575	| IOT190 |	And all of that is done via
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:37,855	| IOT190 |	Awesome
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:43,487	| IOT190 |	That's all I'm making a setup experience easier the plug-and-play in a sense having itself discover
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:48,095	| IOT190 |	And then adding the room by voice and it does not get any easier than that no app needed
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:48,607	| IOT190 |	And that's why
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:49,887	| IOT190 |	When all this
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:51,167	| IOT190 |	Just came out in September and I
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:57,055	| IOT190 |	Talked about this being like apple like in its Simplicity and I think this is a big
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:57,823	| IOT190 |	Huge
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:58,591	| IOT190 |	Step four
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,359	| IOT190 |	Amazon
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,127	| IOT190 |	In
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,919	| IOT190 |	Identifying the problems with a smart home
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:02,687	| IOT190 |	Solving it
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:06,783	| IOT190 |	And I can't describe the big trend for next year which is the normalization in mainstream
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:07,807	| IOT190 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:09,599	| IOT190 |	So
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,623	| IOT190 |	Moving on
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:13,183	| IOT190 |	Amazon also announced
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:14,975	| IOT190 |	This is actually a new announcement
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:17,023	| IOT190 |	An actual happening
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:19,839	| IOT190 |	Routines will not work with the echo buttons
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:22,655	| IOT190 |	So if you have one of those Echo buttons that
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:24,703	| IOT190 |	Timeout I think last year in basically
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:27,007	| IOT190 |	Sounds like you could use some to play games and
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:27,775	| IOT190 |	Nobody
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:30,079	| IOT190 |	But now you basically have a button
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:34,175	| IOT190 |	And you can actually do this using after other things
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:37,247	| IOT190 |	Now you can have it a little bit part usually with Amazon
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:38,527	| IOT190 |	And you
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:39,551	| IOT190 |	Take one of these buttons
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,063	| IOT190 |	When you press it it
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:41,855	| IOT190 |	Movie time
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,135	| IOT190 |	Or whatever
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:49,535	| IOT190 |	I did not buy one of the buttons but now I swear to wish I did because there are times when I want to fire up a routine and don't want to go into an
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:55,423	| IOT190 |	And or don't want to speak aloud because maybe every sleeping or something so just having fun
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:57,727	| IOT190 |	My next to me
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:21:00,287	| IOT190 |	How awesome would it be to have a party time button
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:02,847	| IOT190 |	That you just have in your house and you're just like
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:03,359	| IOT190 |	Guys
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:04,639	| IOT190 |	I just got a promotion
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:07,711	| IOT190 |	What what
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:09,503	| IOT190 |	I think that would be like
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:12,831	| IOT190 |	Awesome if you have small kids and they come home with a Great Raid on their paper
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:13,343	| IOT190 |	I mean
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:15,647	| IOT190 |	Play seriously mention
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:16,672	| IOT190 |	And that this would be
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,208	| IOT190 |	Kind of meat for the disabled
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:19,232	| IOT190 |	Or people who have
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:20,000	| IOT190 |	Service dogs
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:20,768	| IOT190 |	Because dogs
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:21,536	| IOT190 |	Press the button
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:22,816	| IOT190 |	Which I was like
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:23,584	| IOT190 |	Wow
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:26,912	| IOT190 |	Okay but now we have to have a little bit of real talk about Amazon routine
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:28,704	| IOT190 |	Here Comes
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:29,728	| IOT190 |	It is not good
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:32,288	| IOT190 |	I can't control anything with Amazon return
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:33,312	| IOT190 |	There are no devices
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:37,920	| IOT190 |	Right just before the show
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:40,480	| IOT190 |	Stacy had me double check
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:41,504	| IOT190 |	Alipay app
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,784	| IOT190 |	And going to routines
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:44,576	| IOT190 |	And there's not a band there for devices
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:50,208	| IOT190 |	My couldn't find any devices that would work with a routine and then you only found one
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:50,720	| IOT190 |	So
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:56,096	| IOT190 |	This aspect would be semi automation but
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:22:00,448	| IOT190 |	There's nothing there and I have a lot like I wanted to cuz we had had it
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:01,984	| IOT190 |	Question last week about
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:02,752	| IOT190 |	Cameras
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,520	| IOT190 |	And
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:04,544	| IOT190 |	Bringing in
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:05,824	| IOT190 |	Emotion detection
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:08,896	| IOT190 |	Or something like that
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:11,200	| IOT190 |	Right
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:12,224	| IOT190 |	So I did
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:12,992	| IOT190 |	And I
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:15,296	| IOT190 |	It feels like I have
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:20,672	| IOT190 |	3 different cameras on there I have the wise cam I have the August doorbell Cam and I have
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:22,464	| IOT190 |	Oh gosh Arlo's
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:24,000	| IOT190 |	All tied in there and none of them
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:26,816	| IOT190 |	Internet scams won't be
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:29,120	| IOT190 |	Nest camera API so I'm like
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:33,472	| IOT190 |	I guess ring maybe is supportive and I just don't happen to have a ring cam right now so
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:36,544	| IOT190 |	Yeah I'm not understanding it either
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,312	| IOT190 |	Dispensary
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:42,944	| IOT190 |	Very odd to have that devices tab under routines and then nothing showing up when things that you work with
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:43,456	| IOT190 |	Padme
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:46,528	| IOT190 |	Just keeping that up there
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:47,552	| IOT190 |	You know we'll keep back on
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:48,832	| IOT190 |	What's on my Google
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:50,368	| IOT190 |	Google Glass
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,392	| IOT190 |	Enterprise Beach
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:53,696	| IOT190 |	Me to Kevin what has happened there
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:56,768	| IOT190 |	Will last year there were some
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:59,584	| IOT190 |	Lakes rivers Etc of Google
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:02,400	| IOT190 |	Creating a new Google Glass for the Enterprise
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:04,448	| IOT190 |	We never really heard much of anything since
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,984	| IOT190 |	However this week
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:06,752	| IOT190 |	The
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:09,056	| IOT190 |	Second gen Google Glass Enterprise Edition
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:11,360	| IOT190 |	Got through the FCC certifications
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,920	| IOT190 |	So it's a real product cuz they tested it
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:14,944	| IOT190 |	And
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:20,064	| IOT190 |	Can't really say what the specs are I mean we have some leak specs from last year that still include a camera
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:23,136	| IOT190 |	Intel atom chip and apparently 32
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:24,160	| IOT190 |	K-Cup storage wood
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:28,000	| IOT190 |	I'm not sure why you would want that so but specs aside
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:31,584	| IOT190 |	There is I think I market for Google Glass in the answer
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,608	| IOT190 |	Surprise
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:35,680	| IOT190 |	Target I see it all the time heads-up displays are
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,472	| IOT190 |	Huge when I go to these Industrial
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:38,496	| IOT190 |	So yes
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:45,408	| IOT190 |	Yeah I mean I wonder if you could kind of do some of the same things from a contextual notification standpoint like maybe
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,688	| IOT190 |	You need to get an alert that
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:48,736	| IOT190 |	Production line for is down or there is
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:52,064	| IOT190 |	An issue something is heating up maybe a smartwatch would do it but
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:52,832	| IOT190 |	I kind of like
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,624	| IOT190 |	The fact that you could just
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:56,416	| IOT190 |	Panda Pop up in front of your eye
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,184	| IOT190 |	Left about
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:59,744	| IOT190 |	That and it's more about fixing or repairing
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:00,512	| IOT190 |	Pairing
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:03,072	| IOT190 |	So these people aren't wearing them all the time
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:08,192	| IOT190 |	On the factory line it's more like you put them on or an engineer puts them on to go diagnose
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:09,728	| IOT190 |	Deal with a piece of equipment
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:10,240	| IOT190 |	So
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:13,312	| IOT190 |	That and that makes sense
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,128	| IOT190 |	Sure sure I suspect that
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:18,944	| IOT190 |	AR goggles and glasses will take the place of that beat
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:20,480	| IOT190 |	Pause the Google Glass
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:21,760	| IOT190 |	Screen
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:23,296	| IOT190 |	Low-res and small
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:25,600	| IOT190 |	Looking up product information and
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,696	| IOT190 |	Justin
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:31,232	| IOT190 |	Justin okay alright
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,256	| IOT190 |	Google Glass heads up to
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:34,816	| IOT190 |	Sure
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:38,144	| IOT190 |	Yes alright let's move on to the Google home
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:39,424	| IOT190 |	2.7
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:44,544	| IOT190 |	No I have not received the version of Google home to 7 on my
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:51,456	| IOT190 |	But the folks at 9 to 5 Google took the Android version and kind of pecans I do this often
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:55,040	| IOT190 |	And they say among all the different improvements are coming
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:58,624	| IOT190 |	They see a lot of Google Wi-Fi settings
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:00,928	| IOT190 |	Being listed in your not used yet
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:02,208	| IOT190 |	But basically a bunch of
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:04,512	| IOT190 |	Strings that are suggesting that you'll be
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:07,072	| IOT190 |	Configuring your changing your Google Wi-Fi stop
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:08,608	| IOT190 |	In the Google home app
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:11,936	| IOT190 |	And I have mixed emotions about that I wrote a post
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:16,032	| IOT190 |	The earlier this week about it saying is it time for a Google home and Google Wi-Fi to merge
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:19,360	| IOT190 |	Super Muscle perspective it almost sounds like that's happening
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:21,408	| IOT190 |	I'm not a fan of it because
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:25,504	| IOT190 |	Google just make the Google home at much more simple with the last release
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:27,040	| IOT190 |	Yes
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:28,576	| IOT190 |	And it was so white
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:33,440	| IOT190 |	It is nice and fat guy finally after 2 weeks 2 weeks after you I got it on my Lenovo smart
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:37,280	| IOT190 |	You can see all of your Google home devices and all its wonderful
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:39,072	| IOT190 |	But I don't want my Wi-Fi
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:40,864	| IOT190 |	Crap cluttering up all the hats
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:43,168	| IOT190 |	The flipside is from a hardware perspective
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,960	| IOT190 |	I think it makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:45,984	| IOT190 |	And I'm not saying
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:48,032	| IOT190 |	But that's what Google is doing
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:52,640	| IOT190 |	I'm thinking about it I'd like to see a color higher-end Google home
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:53,664	| IOT190 |	Product that includes
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:54,944	| IOT190 |	MiFi
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,224	| IOT190 |	Mesh capabilities
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:26:02,624	| IOT190 |	I want less boxes and things in my house always have been already there but it just makes sense to
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:04,160	| IOT190 |	Combine the two in my opinion
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:09,280	| IOT190 |	I would like to see Google simplify I would have liked
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:11,584	| IOT190 |	To see Wi-Fi and home all be one
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:13,120	| IOT190 |	One place but you know that may never happen
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:14,400	| IOT190 |	But
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,424	| IOT190 |	Let's move on to
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,448	| IOT190 |	Quick
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,984	| IOT190 |	Ready here we go
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:18,496	| IOT190 |	If
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:19,776	| IOT190 |	New service
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:20,800	| IOT190 |	SpongeBob
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:22,080	| IOT190 |	One of them I care deeply about
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:23,616	| IOT190 |	Salty
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:24,384	| IOT190 |	The rest
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:26,432	| IOT190 |	I'm kind of like a lot of them are actually International
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,200	| IOT190 |	So we got
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:30,784	| IOT190 |	Link smart home we've got Mitsubishi electric remote cloud
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:31,808	| IOT190 |	But you do
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:32,832	| IOT190 |	Home environment
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:34,368	| IOT190 |	Airtouch
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:36,416	| IOT190 |	Other thermostat stuff
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:38,208	| IOT190 |	There's the roost leak detector
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:41,024	| IOT190 |	Which I don't know if you guys remember Roost they do
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:43,328	| IOT190 |	Smart smoke detector batteries they all have to leave
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:46,656	| IOT190 |	Are the Logitech Circle cam is now in there
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:48,192	| IOT190 |	We have a dutch
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:50,496	| IOT190 |	Grocer that I'm not even a try
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:52,800	| IOT190 |	Jews and we also have a German grocer
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:56,128	| IOT190 |	In South Asia Asia and Oceania
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:57,408	| IOT190 |	They have
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:59,200	| IOT190 |	Japan's number-one business chat
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:26:59,968	| IOT190 |	That work
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:00,480	| IOT190 |	And
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:02,528	| IOT190 |	There's the Sun
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,296	| IOT190 |	Take control
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,320	| IOT190 |	Connect to
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:05,344	| IOT190 |	So I don't
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,672	| IOT190 |	Summer and then
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:10,464	| IOT190 |	In India they've added base with
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,232	| IOT190 |	Which is a
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,768	| IOT190 |	Fun way to manage your money
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:14,560	| IOT190 |	I don't know if it's like a venmo for India but
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:15,584	| IOT190 |	By the way
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:18,400	| IOT190 |	So all of these Services now on if
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:20,192	| IOT190 |	Looking good for them
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:23,520	| IOT190 |	Also in the exciting bits
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:26,848	| IOT190 |	Call them that helped
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,616	| IOT190 |	Fitness
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:29,664	| IOT190 |	Wellness Health and Wellness smart devices
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:32,992	| IOT190 |	They have a new
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:34,784	| IOT190 |	Tracker the pulse HR which
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,832	| IOT190 |	Looks remarkably a lot like a Fitbit
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:38,880	| IOT190 |	This $130
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:43,232	| IOT190 |	I actually I'm kind of a little tempted by it I'll be honest I had to pull sway back in
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:44,512	| IOT190 |	20
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,304	| IOT190 |	14 or something and
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:49,632	| IOT190 |	I thought I did a really good job at track heart rate steps
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:50,912	| IOT190 |	Other stuff
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:54,240	| IOT190 |	It integrates with a Majors like apples Health you can
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:56,800	| IOT190 |	Pull it into MyFitnessPal and some other
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:57,824	| IOT190 |	Services out there
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:00,896	| IOT190 |	I kind of hate to get up all my Fitbit data but I might
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:07,296	| IOT190 |	Sleep monitoring and up to 20 days on a single charge which is amazing
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:10,624	| IOT190 |	Thank you Kevin for pointing that out
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:11,392	| IOT190 |	All right
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:16,768	| IOT190 |	Last week we talked about view which was a smart Windows company that raised 1.1 billion dollars
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:19,072	| IOT190 |	Now this week we know why they raised so much
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:20,608	| IOT190 |	I talked to them
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,632	| IOT190 |	And they are
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:22,656	| IOT190 |	Basically going to
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,168	| IOT190 |	To try to
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:26,240	| IOT190 |	Because all of their Windows have a microcontroller
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:27,008	| IOT190 |	And a network
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:29,312	| IOT190 |	They decided that they will be the
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:30,848	| IOT190 |	Platform
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,640	| IOT190 |	From which to smartify your office
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:35,712	| IOT190 |	You may recall that they're letting companies out there that way
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:37,760	| IOT190 |	Parking sensor company
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:39,040	| IOT190 |	Deplatformed
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:40,576	| IOT190 |	Your office building
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:41,600	| IOT190 |	So it's
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:42,880	| IOT190 |	Sure
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:43,392	| IOT190 |	Go4it
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:44,928	| IOT190 |	Smart windows
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:46,464	| IOT190 |	Sure
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:49,792	| IOT190 |	Their argument is they come in very early in the bill process
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:50,560	| IOT190 |	So you can
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:52,096	| IOT190 |	Can tie into their system
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:53,376	| IOT190 |	Very quickly and easily
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:55,680	| IOT190 |	During the design phase before all these other
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:57,472	| IOT190 |	Chanced
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:57,984	| IOT190 |	The bid for the biz
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:01,056	| IOT190 |	So the first product is part of this
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:02,336	| IOT190 |	This is going to be a
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:03,616	| IOT190 |	Security thing that detects
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,640	| IOT190 |	Window breaks
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:06,688	| IOT190 |	So instead of using glass break detection
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:08,224	| IOT190 |	Which is an auditory sensor
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:08,992	| IOT190 |	Kind of thing
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:12,832	| IOT190 |	They're actually if you break one of their Windows it interrupts their electric current
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:15,904	| IOT190 |	Changes the ions in the glass to make it darker or lighter
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:17,184	| IOT190 |	And they know automatically
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:17,696	| IOT190 |	Because
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:18,976	| IOT190 |	EBay slippers
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:20,768	| IOT190 |	So that's the first service
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:23,072	| IOT190 |	Hopefully I heard flying into the window does not
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:26,656	| IOT190 |	Yeah
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:27,936	| IOT190 |	Although I feel bad for the birds
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:30,240	| IOT190 |	Okay
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:32,032	| IOT190 |	That's got a grim note there
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,312	| IOT190 |	Let's talk about Enterprise
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,080	| IOT190 |	Coyotes
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:34,848	| IOT190 |	Security
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:38,688	| IOT190 |	There's data out there from a company called digicert that hired a
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:39,968	| IOT190 |	Group out of Dallas
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:40,736	| IOT190 |	S2
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:42,784	| IOT190 |	Survey 700 organizations
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:46,624	| IOT190 |	Five countries those companies had to have done some iot
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:50,208	| IOT190 |	Option one of the big challenges in any idea.
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:51,232	| IOT190 |	Is people are worried about
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:52,000	| IOT190 |	Security
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:52,768	| IOT190 |	And
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:54,304	| IOT190 |	The survey found
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:56,352	| IOT190 |	That there's definitely an upper tier
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:59,680	| IOT190 |	They are focused on
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:03,008	| IOT190 |	Iot security and making sure devices they bring in R6
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:04,800	| IOT190 |	Secure that they follow best practice
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:09,408	| IOT190 |	In those companies only a third of them had any sort of
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:10,176	| IOT190 |	Security breach
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:12,736	| IOT190 |	During the time frame of the survey
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:13,760	| IOT190 |	In the bottom half
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:16,320	| IOT190 |	The companies that aren't doing anything
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:16,832	| IOT190 |	They
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:20,160	| IOT190 |	Some sort of security data breach
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,464	| IOT190 |	So you know
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:23,232	| IOT190 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:25,280	| IOT190 |	They also said that
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:26,304	| IOT190 |	Those in the bottom
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,608	| IOT190 |	They all had an incident
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:33,728	| IOT190 |	They were more than six times as likely to experience 10 iot based denial-of-service attack
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:36,032	| IOT190 |	More than six times as likely to experience
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:38,592	| IOT190 |	Unauthorized access to iot devices
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:43,456	| IOT190 |	And 4.5 times as likely to experience iot based malware or ransomware
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:45,504	| IOT190 |	Those
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,528	| IOT190 |	That had those
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,040	| IOT190 |	Issues
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:49,600	| IOT190 |	They found those issues
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:52,928	| IOT190 |	Cost at least 34 million in the last
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:53,696	| IOT190 |	S2
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:54,208	| IOT190 |	Years
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:56,512	| IOT190 |	And that's just of the surveyed companies
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:59,072	| IOT190 |	That is ridiculous
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:01,120	| IOT190 |	Don't be a bottom to your
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:02,656	| IOT190 |	Company B a top-tier company
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:07,776	| IOT190 |	And most of that is in monetary damages but some of that is like reputational.
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:08,800	| IOT190 |	And stock price
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:10,592	| IOT190 |	So some of that is
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:11,104	| IOT190 |	Tangible
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:13,920	| IOT190 |	I can I just say I was
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:17,248	| IOT190 |	Extremely scared when I read the very first line of this survey
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:18,272	| IOT190 |	It's four words
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:19,808	| IOT190 |	Machines are taking over
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:20,832	| IOT190 |	Start out very
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:22,368	| IOT190 |	Yeah
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:22,880	| IOT190 |	Just a bit
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:25,696	| IOT190 |	And they're going to cost you money and be insecure
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:28,768	| IOT190 |	So we'll link to that survey so you can Panic on your
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:30,304	| IOT190 |	And now
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:31,840	| IOT190 |	We will move
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:32,608	| IOT190 |	2
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:35,424	| IOT190 |	What I'm going to say is like one of my favorite things so far
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:39,008	| IOT190 |	I've ever had in the iot podcast hotline which is somebody telling us
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:40,288	| IOT190 |	What we should do
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:40,800	| IOT190 |	Which
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:42,592	| IOT190 |	I'm sure all of you guys are now.
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:47,200	| IOT190 |	This is a good win from less
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:48,736	| IOT190 |	So
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:51,296	| IOT190 |	This is for everyone out there who is looking for
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:52,320	| IOT190 |	Outdoor
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:54,112	| IOT190 |	Camera and try to figure out how to turn
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:57,184	| IOT190 |	Actually if it has a USB cord
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:59,232	| IOT190 |	This might apply to a lot of people looking for out
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,512	| IOT190 |	Stuff so
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:01,280	| IOT190 |	Take it away less
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:04,608	| IOT190 |	Hi this is less I've got a reverse
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,888	| IOT190 |	Question you have
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:06,912	| IOT190 |	People calling app
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:07,680	| IOT190 |	Kabob House
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:09,472	| IOT190 |	Security cameras outside
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:11,264	| IOT190 |	And the Dilemma is having
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:11,776	| IOT190 |	Power them
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:13,824	| IOT190 |	Some have built-in batteries
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:14,592	| IOT190 |	Some charge
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:15,360	| IOT190 |	USB device
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:17,152	| IOT190 |	I've actually put
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:18,944	| IOT190 |	A webcam outside
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:20,480	| IOT190 |	Used a
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:21,760	| IOT190 |	Battery pack that you use
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:22,784	| IOT190 |	Charge your phone
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,320	| IOT190 |	To be able to remotely
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:25,344	| IOT190 |	Charge my device
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:27,648	| IOT190 |	When the battery runs low
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:28,416	| IOT190 |	I just bring the
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:30,208	| IOT190 |	Battery pack in and recharge that
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:32,256	| IOT190 |	Save me having to take down
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:33,536	| IOT190 |	Security camera
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,816	| IOT190 |	Just hope that it helps
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:35,840	| IOT190 |	Thanks so much
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:36,608	| IOT190 |	Spy
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:37,120	| IOT190 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:38,656	| IOT190 |	That was awesome
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:40,448	| IOT190 |	Les and you and
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:42,240	| IOT190 |	Kevin and I are looking at this
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:44,288	| IOT190 |	We went and looked for ruggedized battery packs
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:45,056	| IOT190 |	Kevin hasson
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:49,920	| IOT190 |	Look for an IP 66-65 rating on those and Kevin has some tips on
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:50,944	| IOT190 |	How big that battery should
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:57,856	| IOT190 |	Yeah I mean granted these are typically used for phones and they'll charge a phone you know $10,000 I have one my Charter phone
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:32:59,136	| IOT190 |	Six seven times
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:02,208	| IOT190 |	I think that's the minimum you want to go with for something like this
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:02,976	| IOT190 |	Granted
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:04,512	| IOT190 |	The most juice
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:08,352	| IOT190 |	From that battery pack is going to use when the wireless camera is streaming
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:10,400	| IOT190 |	So if you don't have continuous streaming
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:16,800	| IOT190 |	It will be using power much power all the time for Ruth's Chris motion detection such it won't be so bad but you probably are
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:18,080	| IOT190 |	I don't know
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:22,176	| IOT190 |	I'm thinking a couple days you might be stretched out to a week
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:26,528	| IOT190 |	With only battery packs if you go for something with maybe 20-25 thousand milliamps
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:27,808	| IOT190 |	That might be a stretch but
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:29,344	| IOT190 |	You'll have to swap them out pretty quick
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:32,672	| IOT190 |	But it's an option is and it's one I hadn't thought of so I was
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:35,488	| IOT190 |	Plated and when you get the bigger bricks
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:38,048	| IOT190 |	You're going to pay a much larger price so
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:39,328	| IOT190 |	10000 milliamps
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:41,120	| IOT190 |	Sprout highly ruggedized battery
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:42,400	| IOT190 |	Looks like you could get it for like
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:43,680	| IOT190 |	Below twenty bucks
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:45,216	| IOT190 |	If you move up to
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:48,032	| IOT190 |	Like 20,000 milliamps then you're looking at like 6.
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:49,824	| IOT190 |	So just keep that in mind
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:52,640	| IOT190 |	I still like
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:56,224	| IOT190 |	Exactly
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:57,248	| IOT190 |	Cheaper than Alexa

EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:47,168	| IOT190 |	IMessage for this week sponsor
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:52,288	| IOT190 |	Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for MS
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,568	| IOT190 |	Message from our sponsor
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:57,664	| IOT190 |	This week sponsor is bitdefender and I have Alex Milan who is achieved
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:59,200	| IOT190 |	Security researcher at the
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:00,736	| IOT190 |	Defender here to talk to us
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:02,016	| IOT190 |	All right we talked about
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:04,576	| IOT190 |	Cyberbullying we talk about securing your router
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:05,856	| IOT190 |	And now
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:08,160	| IOT190 |	Let's talk about smart devices and security regulation
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:09,952	| IOT190 |	Smart devices are
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:11,744	| IOT190 |	Fun small new
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:14,048	| IOT190 |	And no one really wants to think about all the dangers associated
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:16,096	| IOT190 |	Manufacturers
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:17,120	| IOT190 |	Sapphires North
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:21,216	| IOT190 |	There a lot of third-party entities that have started to regulate the internet
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:23,008	| IOT190 |	Do we really need this
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:24,288	| IOT190 |	What year
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:27,616	| IOT190 |	Basic standards need to be imposed
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:28,640	| IOT190 |	To make sure that
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:34,272	| IOT190 |	Because
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:35,552	| IOT190 |	Device
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:36,832	| IOT190 |	Having very bad
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:41,952	| IOT190 |	In August
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:42,976	| IOT190 |	2016
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:44,512	| IOT190 |	450000
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:46,304	| IOT190 |	Devices were hot
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:47,328	| IOT190 |	Bicycle
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:49,376	| IOT190 |	Passwords
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:54,496	| IOT190 |	Are some basic
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:57,824	| IOT190 |	80 practices that can be applied
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:59,360	| IOT190 |	We strongly believe that
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,712	| IOT190 |	That's going to make
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:04,992	| IOT190 |	Manufacturers
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,016	| IOT190 |	Have some babies
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:09,344	| IOT190 |	Mosto
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:12,928	| IOT190 |	Are iot manufacturers doing enough
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:13,440	| IOT190 |	How to make their products
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:20,608	| IOT190 |	We
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:34,432	| IOT190 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:36,992	| IOT190 |	Then five or 6%.
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:38,784	| IOT190 |	What is synonyms of manufacturers
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,832	| IOT190 |	Why do smart devices need secure
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:42,880	| IOT190 |	Fall because they
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:46,720	| IOT190 |	Most of them don't have any
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:52,864	| IOT190 |	Indication
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:00,800	| IOT190 |	I love this point in time
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:01,568	| IOT190 |	Packers
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:02,080	| IOT190 |	Will hack
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:06,176	| IOT190 |	That's you
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:10,016	| IOT190 |	Much more on a plane
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:12,576	| IOT190 |	These undefended
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:16,160	| IOT190 |	And can a security device or a service
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:17,696	| IOT190 |	Protect all the smart devices in my
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:19,488	| IOT190 |	If it's a good
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:23,328	| IOT190 |	I hate to say that we launched
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:30,240	| IOT190 |	Sometime ago
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:32,032	| IOT190 |	What currently providing
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:34,592	| IOT190 |	Fiction book
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:42,272	| IOT190 |	So we have to get back to the station
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,040	| IOT190 |	Nanjing
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:45,088	| IOT190 |	That doesn't have many many many
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:48,160	| IOT190 |	And where can I buy listeners go to find out more

EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:06,080	| IOT190 |	And today's guest
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:07,616	| IOT190 |	What is Emily Silverman
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:09,920	| IOT190 |	Who is the Denver Smart City
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:10,688	| IOT190 |	Program
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:11,200	| IOT190 |	Manager
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:13,248	| IOT190 |	Hello Emily how are you doing today
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:15,296	| IOT190 |	I'm great how are you
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,064	| IOT190 |	I am
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:16,832	| IOT190 |	Super
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,112	| IOT190 |	Excited to talk to you
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:19,904	| IOT190 |	Let's just get started with
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,672	| IOT190 |	Talk to us
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:22,464	| IOT190 |	About what you're doing
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:23,744	| IOT190 |	Related to making Denver
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:24,512	| IOT190 |	Into a smarter City
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:26,048	| IOT190 |	To be like
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:27,328	| IOT190 |	Think that
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:28,864	| IOT190 |	In order for Denver to be a smart
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:30,144	| IOT190 |	City we have
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:32,448	| IOT190 |	To empower not only city workers
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,472	| IOT190 |	But residents
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:36,288	| IOT190 |	Businesses and even those who come to Denver
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:38,080	| IOT190 |	To get the best information
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:39,616	| IOT190 |	To make this a safe
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:40,384	| IOT190 |	Healthy place
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:40,896	| IOT190 |	For all
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:44,480	| IOT190 |	How do you define I mean that sounded almost like a definition of the
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:47,296	| IOT190 |	But how do you know when a city is released
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:48,320	| IOT190 |	What is second
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:49,856	| IOT190 |	Take me through it
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:52,416	| IOT190 |	So what we're doing is we are really
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:54,208	| IOT190 |	Progressively embracing
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:56,256	| IOT190 |	But I'm going to emphasize that aggressively because of
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:58,560	| IOT190 |	We see this as a real paradigm shift
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:01,376	| IOT190 |	And we want to do it in a thoughtful manner so we're testing
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:02,912	| IOT190 |	New and better ways
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:04,192	| IOT190 |	To deploy technology
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:09,568	| IOT190 |	This idea of creating two way communication between smart devices and using data to improve services
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:10,336	| IOT190 |	Search for residence
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:11,872	| IOT190 |	Businesses in Austin visitors
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:13,920	| IOT190 |	When I think of what it really boils down to
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:17,760	| IOT190 |	It's the idea of using data to make our city better and what does that mean
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:22,112	| IOT190 |	Cities already have really intelligent people who are doing great
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:23,648	| IOT190 |	Things on a daily basis
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:25,184	| IOT190 |	How do we add value
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:26,720	| IOT190 |	To those efforts
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:28,768	| IOT190 |	Such a specific surround air quality
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:29,536	| IOT190 |	Congestion
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:31,072	| IOT190 |	And then ask people are driving
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:31,584	| IOT190 |	Extrude
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:33,376	| IOT190 |	And what does that do
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:35,168	| IOT190 |	That helps us get people to
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:39,008	| IOT190 |	To where they need to be faster it helps us really understand the house
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:40,032	| IOT190 |	Love our kids
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:41,568	| IOT190 |	I'm making sure that we get them
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:43,616	| IOT190 |	School and where they need to be
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:45,408	| IOT190 |	To be on those ladders of opportunity
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:47,456	| IOT190 |	Thrift they can really achieve everything that they want
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:50,528	| IOT190 |	Those are big and
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:51,296	| IOT190 |	Pretty awesome goals
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:52,576	| IOT190 |	So
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:55,136	| IOT190 |	It's very easy to say hey this is what we're after
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:57,440	| IOT190 |	It's a lot harder to actually Implement something that
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:59,232	| IOT190 |	Make even some of those things
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:01,792	| IOT190 |	Breakdown how Denver is due
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:03,328	| IOT190 |	You and your team
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:04,096	| IOT190 |	How are you at
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:05,376	| IOT190 |	This problem
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:07,680	| IOT190 |	Yeah so we were really galvanized by
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:09,472	| IOT190 |	Three main things and then I really wanted to
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:12,288	| IOT190 |	Talk with you about what our strategy is
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,568	| IOT190 |	From a higher level in that week
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:15,616	| IOT190 |	Dive into details to
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:16,896	| IOT190 |	The three items that
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:21,504	| IOT190 |	Really got us energized around smart cities and the value that it
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:22,272	| IOT190 |	Bring
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:25,600	| IOT190 |	The people that we serve more among mayor Hancock
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:26,624	| IOT190 |	Efforts around p
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:27,392	| IOT190 |	Peak Academy
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:29,696	| IOT190 |	Which is this really Innovative program
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:32,000	| IOT190 |	Using lean Six Sigma process
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:32,768	| IOT190 |	Improvement
EDL	00:40:32,768	00:40:33,536	| IOT190 |	But saying
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:35,840	| IOT190 |	Every person who worked at the city
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:36,864	| IOT190 |	Is an expert in
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:37,632	| IOT190 |	Something
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:39,936	| IOT190 |	How did they get empowered
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:43,008	| IOT190 |	To make the best decisions improve prophecies
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:46,336	| IOT190 |	To deliver the services in a manner that really helps
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:47,104	| IOT190 |	The resident
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:47,616	| IOT190 |	Who need it most
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:52,992	| IOT190 |	An example that mayor Hancock uses is really looking at efficiency for examples with
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:56,576	| IOT190 |	Food stamps are the Department of Motor Vehicle to reduce wait time
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:41:00,928	| IOT190 |	Any chance between when somebody comes in and needs a 30 service and that service
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:03,232	| IOT190 |	Delivered the second catalyst
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:04,768	| IOT190 |	Is that we were a finalist
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:07,584	| IOT190 |	The US Department of Transportation smart cities
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:12,192	| IOT190 |	Challenge only one of seven finalists we saw the value of working
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:13,472	| IOT190 |	Together because it was
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:17,312	| IOT190 |	Cross-functional teams among departments that really put together that apple
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:20,640	| IOT190 |	Haitian anniversary thing we're great strategic partnership
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:21,408	| IOT190 |	That we have
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:23,968	| IOT190 |	Not only with our existing partners with an attack
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:24,992	| IOT190 |	Technology space
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:26,528	| IOT190 |	But also with Partners such a
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:27,296	| IOT190 |	Panasonic
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:30,624	| IOT190 |	Amazon North American headquarters to a transit-oriented
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:32,416	| IOT190 |	Development within the City and County of Denver
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:34,208	| IOT190 |	We also took a look
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:35,488	| IOT190 |	At what smart city did
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:36,768	| IOT190 |	Cuz as you mentioned it means
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:37,792	| IOT190 |	So many things
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:44,960	| IOT190 |	Some people for us we really wanted to understand that this is an emerging industry one thing I think about is it
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:47,776	| IOT190 |	We want to work with people who know how to work on complex
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:48,544	| IOT190 |	Projects
EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:50,080	| IOT190 |	I don't necessarily call themselves
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:52,128	| IOT190 |	Experts in a smart City space
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:53,407	| IOT190 |	Because we're all learning it
EDL	00:41:53,407	00:41:55,711	| IOT190 |	Together and she will eat it if we did a very
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:56,735	| IOT190 |	Tactical strategy
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:59,551	| IOT190 |	Existing funding that worked on from Africa
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:01,599	| IOT190 |	Three major departments
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:04,927	| IOT190 |	Including the mayor's office and then technology services
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:07,231	| IOT190 |	Does the Department of Public Health and environment
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:08,255	| IOT190 |	And Public Works
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:09,791	| IOT190 |	And then we try to work
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:11,071	| IOT190 |	Together to develop
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:14,911	| IOT190 |	Some additional funding mechanisms and we wanted to really test
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:15,679	| IOT190 |	Some of the
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:16,447	| IOT190 |	Technology
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:17,983	| IOT190 |	And look at what it was
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:19,007	| IOT190 |	Shazam be able to think so
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:23,103	| IOT190 |	So how do we do this what we started looking at a living life
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:26,175	| IOT190 |	Contact so what we did is we wanted to focus in on
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:27,455	| IOT190 |	Specific Geographic areas
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:28,991	| IOT190 |	I didn't really start
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:30,271	| IOT190 |	Use cases
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:31,807	| IOT190 |	Integra Technologies
EDL	00:42:31,807	00:42:36,415	| IOT190 |	In the field and a safe and secure manner in order to really understand what works
EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:38,719	| IOT190 |	And the last thing that we did over all of this
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:40,767	| IOT190 |	Build a really strong internal governance
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:45,631	| IOT190 |	So that people at every level both were empowered to do work following after mayor Hancock
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:51,519	| IOT190 |	Lead with Peak Academy was still getting direction to make sure that we're all part of what really makes the
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:54,335	| IOT190 |	The City and County of Denver both work and
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:55,615	| IOT190 |	Continue to improve
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:58,175	| IOT190 |	Okay so what is your job and all
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:05,855	| IOT190 |	So I think we are almost as if we're a startup within the City and County of Denver
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:08,927	| IOT190 |	We really have is entrepreneurial lens
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:10,207	| IOT190 |	And so I think I wear lots of
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:12,767	| IOT190 |	Making sure that everybody has
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:13,535	| IOT190 |	What they need
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:16,607	| IOT190 |	Able to remove barriers from specific projects
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:17,375	| IOT190 |	And then
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:19,423	| IOT190 |	Doing the organizational ties
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:20,959	| IOT190 |	To make sure that we're all working
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:25,567	| IOT190 |	Words with the same goals and utilizing our best assets
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:26,335	| IOT190 |	In the ice
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:28,895	| IOT190 |	Ctd information and communication technology
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:30,687	| IOT190 |	Space so that we're really growing
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:31,455	| IOT190 |	Together
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:32,479	| IOT190 |	Okay so
EDL	00:43:32,479	00:43:34,271	| IOT190 |	Since you guys have created this system
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:37,343	| IOT190 |	I'm really curious how if I were in your
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:38,111	| IOT190 |	Department of Public
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:38,623	| IOT190 |	Healthfirst
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:40,671	| IOT190 |	How I might go
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:43,487	| IOT190 |	Talk to you guys about creating an air quality monitor
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:49,375	| IOT190 |	We actually went through this about a year ago so the partnership started about 18
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:52,959	| IOT190 |	So how we organized our program was amongst Florida
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:53,471	| IOT190 |	Portfolio
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:59,103	| IOT190 |	And we purposely have names that really about delivering value rather than
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:01,151	| IOT190 |	Kind of a typical program and Department
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:03,455	| IOT190 |	One of the portfolios is
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:08,319	| IOT190 |	Healthy people and places and that portfolio manager was in
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:10,111	| IOT190 |	The Department of Public Health and environment
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:12,159	| IOT190 |	But his Focus really was in electric
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:14,207	| IOT190 |	Vacation he had a colleague
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:20,351	| IOT190 |	Who was interested in is an air quality expert and had a great idea this happened to coincide with the blind
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:23,423	| IOT190 |	That happened last year that was
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:24,191	| IOT190 |	The first round
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:25,727	| IOT190 |	And so he brought
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:32,127	| IOT190 |	This gentleman who had a great idea to the implementation team and our implementation team is kind of that mid-level
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:33,151	| IOT190 |	Group of Representatives
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:34,175	| IOT190 |	From the
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:34,943	| IOT190 |	Apartments
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:36,223	| IOT190 |	So the gentleman
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:37,247	| IOT190 |	6 Michael Court
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:42,367	| IOT190 |	They started talking about this idea he had about real-time hyperlocal air quality data
EDL	00:44:42,367	00:44:46,719	| IOT190 |	And getting that information into the hands of parents and teachers and nurses
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:49,791	| IOT190 |	So the team really looked at the effort force of impact
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:55,423	| IOT190 |	What are current projects were and could we add value to even his idea where he was
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:45:01,823	| IOT190 |	And so we were able to push that forward to our Executives and our executive steering committee and they were
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:02,591	| IOT190 |	Really interested
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:03,871	| IOT190 |	So we all worked at
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:05,407	| IOT190 |	Together bonjour
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:06,943	| IOT190 |	The umbrella of
EDL	00:45:06,943	00:45:08,479	| IOT190 |	A challenge for the Bloomberg mayor
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:10,527	| IOT190 |	And submitted application
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:12,319	| IOT190 |	And we're one of 35
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:14,367	| IOT190 |	Cities who were awarded that proposal
EDL	00:45:14,367	00:45:15,391	| IOT190 |	And so
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:19,743	| IOT190 |	To give you a little bit more specific what we did is we help support some of the work here
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:21,535	| IOT190 |	He was doing as part of a team
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:22,303	| IOT190 |	He really focused
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:28,703	| IOT190 |	Doing user-centered design so working with the principles and the teachers and the students
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:31,007	| IOT190 |	To say what type of information
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:33,823	| IOT190 |	What help you understand what air quality
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:34,847	| IOT190 |	Even is
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:36,639	| IOT190 |	And understanding that as it released
EDL	00:45:36,639	00:45:38,431	| IOT190 |	2 for example stop idling
EDL	00:45:38,431	00:45:40,479	| IOT190 |	An example is I have a friend
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:41,503	| IOT190 |	Who is child ghost
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:44,831	| IOT190 |	School downtown where we do have some congestion
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:46,111	| IOT190 |	And she would like
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:47,391	| IOT190 |	Additional information.
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:50,207	| IOT190 |	Understand what days are good or bad for her son's practice
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:57,631	| IOT190 |	In addition we know the air quality isn't just a local problem it doesn't stop at a border so we need to really work
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:45:59,679	| IOT190 |	How we do this region Elite
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:01,727	| IOT190 |	Really move the needle in a positive direction
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:04,031	| IOT190 |	Hey we're going to move on to Regional stuff
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:04,799	| IOT190 |	Moment but first
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:06,079	| IOT190 |	Can you
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:07,615	| IOT190 |	Give me a sense of the
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:08,895	| IOT190 |	Procurement process
EDL	00:46:08,895	00:46:11,199	| IOT190 |	This is it just like he had an idea
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:14,271	| IOT190 |	And then he started talking to you guys and then y'all supported in throughout
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:15,039	| IOT190 |	Getting data did you
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:18,111	| IOT190 |	Like how do you choose vendors and something like this what is that look
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:20,927	| IOT190 |	I don't think that there's a one-size-fits-all
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:22,975	| IOT190 |	We do have a vendor in
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:26,559	| IOT190 |	Partner also process form I do really
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:28,607	| IOT190 |	I think that there's a lot of value in creating good process
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:33,215	| IOT190 |	That way it doesn't just rely on me or somebody else but we start creating a system
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:37,055	| IOT190 |	And I really do think that we're creating in so many ways are these system of systems
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:38,847	| IOT190 |	What's not people and spread
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:39,871	| IOT190 |	Sheets were talking
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:41,407	| IOT190 |	And communicating in
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:43,711	| IOT190 |	Kind of their own forms of Silence but working
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:49,599	| IOT190 |	Together so if someone is interested in partnering with us for example they go to our website they fill out a form
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:51,391	| IOT190 |	And then we go through a very
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:52,927	| IOT190 |	Internal process
EDL	00:46:52,927	00:46:55,487	| IOT190 |	Do you understand do we have any active funding that we can use
EDL	00:46:55,999	00:47:00,351	| IOT190 |	Can we look at Nick future funding and try to partner with them
EDL	00:47:00,351	00:47:02,143	| IOT190 |	Palace Pacific example Don air quality
EDL	00:47:03,167	00:47:06,751	| IOT190 |	Air quality expert did some initial analysis the things that we
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:08,799	| IOT190 |	Really wanted to understand
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:10,591	| IOT190 |	We're really focused around
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:12,895	| IOT190 |	Are four main focuses
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:15,199	| IOT190 |	Mention this before but we wanted to make
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:20,319	| IOT190 |	Make sure and when Michael Ogletree was starting to talk with Thunders you know do we understand local
EDL	00:47:20,319	00:47:20,831	| IOT190 |	Control of data
EDL	00:47:21,343	00:47:23,903	| IOT190 |	Can we base everything or most things on Oppa
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:24,671	| IOT190 |	Open source node
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:27,487	| IOT190 |	Can we look at Federal and Industry
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:28,255	| IOT190 |	Standards to be
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:28,767	| IOT190 |	Standard space
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:31,327	| IOT190 |	And also are we looking interoperability
EDL	00:47:31,327	00:47:32,351	| IOT190 |	Will you look at that
EDL	00:47:33,375	00:47:34,911	| IOT190 |	About a year ago
EDL	00:47:34,911	00:47:38,239	| IOT190 |	We started realizing that we wanted to partner with a starter
EDL	00:47:39,007	00:47:42,079	| IOT190 |	Partnered with a local startup called lunar Outpost
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:43,359	| IOT190 |	Tuco develop ascent
EDL	00:47:44,127	00:47:46,175	| IOT190 |	It would really have this open data and
EDL	00:47:46,175	00:47:47,711	| IOT190 |	Follow what we wanted
EDL	00:47:47,711	00:47:48,735	| IOT190 |	To do in order to
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:49,759	| IOT190 |	Create the speakers
EDL	00:47:50,527	00:47:51,551	| IOT190 |	That's awesome
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:54,879	| IOT190 |	Do you get a lot of pushback from vendors on your
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:56,159	| IOT190 |	Things like Open Standards
EDL	00:47:56,927	00:47:57,695	| IOT190 |	Data-sharing policy
EDL	00:47:58,463	00:47:59,487	| IOT190 |	You know I think so
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:05,887	| IOT190 |	The terror has been some really interesting transformation even in the last year for example I know
EDL	00:48:05,887	00:48:09,727	| IOT190 |	Somebody was looking at a firm even a couple of years ago related to air quality
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:11,519	| IOT190 |	And it's more of an ash
EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:14,847	| IOT190 |	And originally they really wanted to hold onto
EDL	00:48:14,847	00:48:20,223	| IOT190 |	But I think at the industry talking about how it's an emerging industry is changing so rapidly and then
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:24,575	| IOT190 |	People are understanding that interoperability and data sharing maybe that there's other ways
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:26,111	| IOT190 |	Commoditized
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:28,415	| IOT190 |	Beacon sites that are game for the value that is
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:30,207	| IOT190 |	Skate or being that experts
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:35,071	| IOT190 |	To help analyze the data but holding onto the data I don't think we're the only ones and realizing
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:36,095	| IOT190 |	That doesn't
EDL	00:48:36,095	00:48:37,375	| IOT190 |	Create a good system
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:38,399	| IOT190 |	That is my son
EDL	00:48:38,399	00:48:40,191	| IOT190 |	From where the industry is ice
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:42,239	| IOT190 |	I think that there may be all over the board but
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:47,103	| IOT190 |	People are understanding the value of sharing data and then understanding that there still other ways to
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:48,639	| IOT190 |	Create Revenue
EDL	00:48:49,151	00:48:50,943	| IOT190 |	Because Justice is still need to operate
EDL	00:48:50,943	00:48:52,479	| IOT190 |	I can't think that we're all
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:56,831	| IOT190 |	Here just doing work together for the betterment of people that's very important
EDL	00:48:56,831	00:49:00,927	| IOT190 |	But part of our own economic Vitality is having good businesses
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:02,463	| IOT190 |	Here in Denver in Colorado
EDL	00:49:02,975	00:49:05,791	| IOT190 |	Got it okay well that actually segues nicely into
EDL	00:49:05,791	00:49:09,119	| IOT190 |	A pretty big conversation that's happening right now in the Smart City space
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:11,167	| IOT190 |	How do you guys think about
EDL	00:49:11,167	00:49:12,447	| IOT190 |	User-data in
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:13,727	| IOT190 |	Privacy because
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:16,287	| IOT190 |	Do we really want all of this information gathered up and
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:17,311	| IOT190 |	Possibly used
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:18,847	| IOT190 |	That it's really important
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:21,407	| IOT190 |	Considerate and not a Xanax
EDL	00:49:21,407	00:49:23,199	| IOT190 |	What is a very basic
EDL	00:49:23,199	00:49:24,479	| IOT190 |	Foundation and Howard building
EDL	00:49:25,247	00:49:29,599	| IOT190 |	So when we are looking at about how we're going to manage data privacy
EDL	00:49:29,599	00:49:30,111	| IOT190 |	Can security issue
EDL	00:49:30,623	00:49:31,391	| IOT190 |	We think
EDL	00:49:31,391	00:49:32,415	| IOT190 |	Key components
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:34,463	| IOT190 |	Is maintaining ownership of our data
EDL	00:49:34,463	00:49:36,511	| IOT190 |	To be able to address of privacy answer
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:37,791	| IOT190 |	Security issues upfront
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:39,839	| IOT190 |	And directly with our city park
EDL	00:49:39,839	00:49:40,607	| IOT190 |	Understand our vendors
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:43,423	| IOT190 |	But we try to do is be identified the data
EDL	00:49:43,423	00:49:45,471	| IOT190 |	So we ensure that we work with are
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:46,751	| IOT190 |	Protocol from
EDL	00:49:46,751	00:49:48,031	| IOT190 |	National Organization
EDL	00:49:49,055	00:49:51,103	| IOT190 |	Make sure that we're compliant with cjis
EDL	00:49:51,103	00:49:51,871	| IOT190 |	HIPAA
EDL	00:49:51,871	00:49:54,175	| IOT190 |	And other standards are already out there
EDL	00:49:54,175	00:49:55,455	| IOT190 |	We're very careful with data in
EDL	00:49:56,223	00:49:59,807	| IOT190 |	Making sure that if you need for example if
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:00,575	| IOT190 |	Q
EDL	00:50:00,575	00:50:02,879	| IOT190 |	Are trying to understand traffic patterns
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:04,671	| IOT190 |	There's unique identifier
EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:06,207	| IOT190 |	That are given to have nothing
EDL	00:50:06,719	00:50:08,767	| IOT190 |	Dude with anything that could be traced back
EDL	00:50:08,767	00:50:10,303	| IOT190 |	Two color of a car
EDL	00:50:10,303	00:50:13,631	| IOT190 |	Type of car definitely no data related
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:15,167	| IOT190 |	To the person in the car
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:15,935	| IOT190 |	A notch
EDL	00:50:15,935	00:50:20,543	| IOT190 |	Really important because from the very start there's no way to correlate
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:21,311	| IOT190 |	That
EDL	00:50:21,311	00:50:21,823	| IOT190 |	Specifically with
EDL	00:50:22,591	00:50:23,871	| IOT190 |	And then the last thing I just wanted
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:27,199	| IOT190 |	Is it what really interested in understanding and creating the business
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:29,503	| IOT190 |	Just want to leave any type of
EDL	00:50:29,503	00:50:30,527	| IOT190 |	Possible
EDL	00:50:30,527	00:50:32,063	| IOT190 |	PPI data at the edge
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:35,135	| IOT190 |	So that we're bringing in MIDI either something that has a huge
EDL	00:50:35,135	00:50:39,999	| IOT190 |	Deviation from the standard but we do that with aggregated or insights that comes
EDL	00:50:39,999	00:50:41,279	| IOT190 |	From the information
EDL	00:50:41,279	00:50:44,351	| IOT190 |	Rather than any of that data that could have PPI infer
EDL	00:50:44,351	00:50:44,863	| IOT190 |	Formation
EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:47,679	| IOT190 |	And there's a lot of debate happening about like
EDL	00:50:47,679	00:50:49,983	| IOT190 |	Hey data that doesn't feel like it might be
EDL	00:50:49,983	00:50:51,263	| IOT190 |	Personally identifiable
EDL	00:50:51,263	00:50:52,799	| IOT190 |	Could become identifiable
EDL	00:50:53,567	00:50:54,591	| IOT190 |	Can a monitor my car if
EDL	00:50:55,103	00:50:58,431	| IOT190 |	Coke this car always comes from this direction
EDL	00:50:58,431	00:51:00,479	| IOT190 |	And holy cow we can establish a route back to
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:01,247	| IOT190 |	To someone's house
EDL	00:51:01,247	00:51:04,063	| IOT190 |	That is kind of crazy and out there but it is still something
EDL	00:51:05,855	00:51:07,135	| IOT190 |	And I'm glad to see that you
EDL	00:51:07,135	00:51:09,951	| IOT190 |	You guys try to be identify the data and are thinking about
EDL	00:51:10,463	00:51:11,231	| IOT190 |	Control of it
EDL	00:51:11,231	00:51:11,999	| IOT190 |	For those kind
EDL	00:51:11,999	00:51:13,023	| IOT190 |	Future cases
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:14,047	| IOT190 |	So ye onyame
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:16,863	| IOT190 |	Just to kind of follow through on the vehicle LED
EDL	00:51:16,863	00:51:18,655	| IOT190 |	So let's say I am going
EDL	00:51:19,167	00:51:19,935	| IOT190 |	3 blocks
EDL	00:51:19,935	00:51:22,751	| IOT190 |	In the same direction every day on Monday
EDL	00:51:22,751	00:51:24,799	| IOT190 |	But I'm just using this is an example right
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:26,335	| IOT190 |	My vehicle is
EDL	00:51:26,335	00:51:27,103	| IOT190 |	3 2 1 5
EDL	00:51:27,871	00:51:31,455	| IOT190 |	Right and maybe it's going through again we're doing some experiments around can
EDL	00:51:31,455	00:51:32,223	| IOT190 |	Connected vehicle technology
EDL	00:51:32,735	00:51:38,879	| IOT190 |	But in that one day within a 5-minute time it's 32516 the next morning I'm going in the same direction
EDL	00:51:39,391	00:51:41,183	| IOT190 |	Possibly that vehicle is
EDL	00:51:41,183	00:51:43,231	| IOT190 |	7321 and then the next
EDL	00:51:43,231	00:51:46,047	| IOT190 |	Kinda goes through an intersection with in a very short. Time
EDL	00:51:46,047	00:51:46,815	| IOT190 |	732
EDL	00:51:46,815	00:51:48,095	| IOT190 |	Want to imagine
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:52,191	| IOT190 |	Day today we need to all be responsible for the fact that we can't create the
EDL	00:51:52,191	00:51:55,519	| IOT190 |	Same information from the same users in the same way
EDL	00:51:55,519	00:51:57,055	| IOT190 |	But creating a
EDL	00:51:57,055	00:51:57,823	| IOT190 |	Pattern
EDL	00:51:57,823	00:52:02,943	| IOT190 |	It really is aggregated a higher-level to understand patterns rather than individuals
EDL	00:52:02,943	00:52:04,479	| IOT190 |	Oh that's actually really great exam
EDL	00:52:05,503	00:52:08,063	| IOT190 |	And I promise we get back to regionalism
EDL	00:52:08,063	00:52:09,343	| IOT190 |	And I'd love to do that with
EDL	00:52:09,855	00:52:11,903	| IOT190 |	Asportation cuz that's a really good example
EDL	00:52:12,671	00:52:14,975	| IOT190 |	How people actually live I may
EDL	00:52:14,975	00:52:17,535	| IOT190 |	Having experience in Denver but I might also be driving
EDL	00:52:18,047	00:52:19,071	| IOT190 |	The boulder Inn
EDL	00:52:19,071	00:52:22,143	| IOT190 |	Denver's only part of that I'm driving from the airport to Boulder Inn
EDL	00:52:22,143	00:52:22,911	| IOT190 |	Again
EDL	00:52:22,911	00:52:23,935	| IOT190 |	Denver's only part of that
EDL	00:52:23,935	00:52:25,471	| IOT190 |	So how do you think about
EDL	00:52:25,471	00:52:28,799	| IOT190 |	Expanding your program or even working with other
EDL	00:52:28,799	00:52:31,103	| IOT190 |	Groups around the state or local areas
EDL	00:52:32,127	00:52:32,895	| IOT190 |	Smarter region
EDL	00:52:33,407	00:52:35,967	| IOT190 |	Yes AC that is a really great question
EDL	00:52:35,967	00:52:40,319	| IOT190 |	Because no matter how smart or wise or intelligent Denver
EDL	00:52:40,319	00:52:43,135	| IOT190 |	Either is or will be it is
EDL	00:52:43,135	00:52:44,415	| IOT190 |	Pendant and it is
EDL	00:52:44,927	00:52:45,439	| IOT190 |	Key importance
EDL	00:52:45,951	00:52:47,231	| IOT190 |	Let me think about this regionally
EDL	00:52:47,743	00:52:50,559	| IOT190 |	Just as I was talking about how air quality doesn't know the
EDL	00:52:50,559	00:52:51,071	| IOT190 |	Boundaries
EDL	00:52:51,583	00:52:53,375	| IOT190 |	I don't care whether it during
EDL	00:52:53,375	00:52:54,143	| IOT190 |	Denver
EDL	00:52:54,143	00:52:54,911	| IOT190 |	Boulder
EDL	00:52:54,911	00:52:57,215	| IOT190 |	Or all of the borders that we share with
EDL	00:52:57,215	00:52:59,007	| IOT190 |	Many cities and so
EDL	00:52:59,007	00:53:00,543	| IOT190 |	What we really are doing
EDL	00:53:00,543	00:53:04,639	| IOT190 |	Is creating and being a part of other Partnerships as well
EDL	00:53:04,639	00:53:07,967	| IOT190 |	So two examples are the Colorado smart cities Alliance
EDL	00:53:07,967	00:53:11,295	| IOT190 |	Which was formed by Denver south economic
EDL	00:53:11,295	00:53:12,063	| IOT190 |	Partnership
EDL	00:53:12,063	00:53:13,855	| IOT190 |	I think currently there's oversee
EDL	00:53:13,855	00:53:17,183	| IOT190 |	Team cities around the state that are involved in this Alliance
EDL	00:53:17,183	00:53:20,511	| IOT190 |	And it's not just an alliance with cities but it's also with
EDL	00:53:20,511	00:53:23,071	| IOT190 |	University and private partners
EDL	00:53:23,071	00:53:27,167	| IOT190 |	There was a recent Announcement by Arrow Electronics and in partnership with AECOM
EDL	00:53:27,167	00:53:28,191	| IOT190 |	They're working on
EDL	00:53:28,191	00:53:28,959	| IOT190 |	What time does Regional
EDL	00:53:29,727	00:53:31,007	| IOT190 |	So we can all work
EDL	00:53:31,007	00:53:34,335	| IOT190 |	Together with they also are really helping with that information share
EDL	00:53:34,335	00:53:37,407	| IOT190 |	And then another really important organization
EDL	00:53:37,407	00:53:40,735	| IOT190 |	That I wanted to talk about with our Denver Regional Council of governments
EDL	00:53:40,735	00:53:43,807	| IOT190 |	So that is our local Municipal planning organization
EDL	00:53:43,807	00:53:46,367	| IOT190 |	They are involved in many efforts
EDL	00:53:46,367	00:53:47,391	| IOT190 |	But I really looking at this
EDL	00:53:47,391	00:53:48,159	| IOT190 |	Smart Regional
EDL	00:53:49,183	00:53:50,719	| IOT190 |	And then we're working with them
EDL	00:53:50,719	00:53:54,559	| IOT190 |	What ideas could we have where we're learning from other cities
EDL	00:53:54,559	00:53:59,423	| IOT190 |	Even things that they're doing in the region and then maybe there's things that we're doing for example in the
EDL	00:53:59,423	00:54:03,519	| IOT190 |	Connected vehicle or open architecture space that they can learn from us
EDL	00:54:03,519	00:54:04,799	| IOT190 |	So we're not saying This Is Us
EDL	00:54:04,799	00:54:07,359	| IOT190 |	The standard this is information that we can all work on
EDL	00:54:07,359	00:54:10,431	| IOT190 |	And then hopefully with those two organization
EDL	00:54:10,431	00:54:12,479	| IOT190 |	We can really build on some
EDL	00:54:12,479	00:54:13,503	| IOT190 |	Regional in
EDL	00:54:13,503	00:54:14,527	| IOT190 |	Statewide
EDL	00:54:14,527	00:54:15,295	| IOT190 |	Who calls
EDL	00:54:15,295	00:54:17,343	| IOT190 |	That we can use and really learn from each other
EDL	00:54:17,343	00:54:19,647	| IOT190 |	Not to share that information but grow with each
EDL	00:54:20,159	00:54:22,207	| IOT190 |	Ellie the sounds great so
EDL	00:54:22,207	00:54:23,487	| IOT190 |	Can you give me
EDL	00:54:23,487	00:54:25,791	| IOT190 |	One project that you guys are Maybe
EDL	00:54:26,303	00:54:29,375	| IOT190 |	Most proud of or maybe it's just simply that is most complete
EDL	00:54:30,655	00:54:35,007	| IOT190 |	So thanks for asking Stacy I am really excited about what we're doing
EDL	00:54:35,007	00:54:38,079	| IOT190 |	Around our living lab that we have on Federal Boulevard
EDL	00:54:38,079	00:54:39,359	| IOT190 |	The Federal Boulevard
EDL	00:54:39,359	00:54:40,639	| IOT190 |	Is
EDL	00:54:40,639	00:54:41,407	| IOT190 |	Really
EDL	00:54:41,407	00:54:41,919	| IOT190 |	Important
EDL	00:54:42,431	00:54:45,247	| IOT190 |	Way for people to get to their homes into businesses
EDL	00:54:46,015	00:54:47,039	| IOT190 |	In an area is
EDL	00:54:47,039	00:54:49,599	| IOT190 |	Well where we have some of our most
EDL	00:54:49,599	00:54:50,623	| IOT190 |	Spirit a health outcome
EDL	00:54:51,135	00:54:51,903	| IOT190 |	Even around are
EDL	00:54:51,903	00:54:56,767	| IOT190 |	Air quality and what we really realizes is by focusing in on this area
EDL	00:54:56,767	00:54:58,815	| IOT190 |	We can really help understand
EDL	00:54:58,815	00:55:02,399	| IOT190 |	What are the various things that we can do either small steps are big stuff
EDL	00:55:02,399	00:55:03,167	| IOT190 |	2 mm
EDL	00:55:03,167	00:55:04,959	| IOT190 |	Prove the experience of living
EDL	00:55:04,959	00:55:07,007	| IOT190 |	Working and being around Federal Boulevard
EDL	00:55:07,007	00:55:09,823	| IOT190 |	So specific UK sweetheart is around emerging
EDL	00:55:09,823	00:55:10,591	| IOT190 |	NC vehicle preemption
EDL	00:55:11,103	00:55:14,687	| IOT190 |	And our vehicles and station 12 which is it
EDL	00:55:14,687	00:55:16,735	| IOT190 |	26th and federal there are
EDL	00:55:16,735	00:55:18,015	| IOT190 |	Two major fire trucks
EDL	00:55:18,015	00:55:20,831	| IOT190 |	And then there a chief has an SUV
EDL	00:55:20,831	00:55:23,135	| IOT190 |	And when there's an emergency
EDL	00:55:23,135	00:55:24,415	| IOT190 |	Re-Use
EDL	00:55:24,415	00:55:25,183	| IOT190 |	System
EDL	00:55:25,183	00:55:26,975	| IOT190 |	That emits a series of Lights
EDL	00:55:26,975	00:55:27,743	| IOT190 |	To do preamp
EDL	00:55:28,255	00:55:29,023	| IOT190 |	So that means
EDL	00:55:29,023	00:55:30,303	| IOT190 |	For many of us
EDL	00:55:30,303	00:55:31,327	| IOT190 |	When a vehicle
EDL	00:55:31,327	00:55:33,375	| IOT190 |	Pecans we don't actually
EDL	00:55:33,375	00:55:39,007	| IOT190 |	Really know where it's coming from and we're using the sights and sound to try to figure out where they are and then the light often
EDL	00:55:39,007	00:55:40,287	| IOT190 |	Quickly changes for them
EDL	00:55:40,287	00:55:41,823	| IOT190 |	That's needed for tourism
EDL	00:55:41,823	00:55:45,919	| IOT190 |	Just wanted to clear traffic out of the way and then it helps them get through to where they need
EDL	00:55:45,919	00:55:49,759	| IOT190 |	What we are really using is this new connected vehicle technology
EDL	00:55:50,271	00:55:53,343	| IOT190 |	Call dsrc which is dedicated shortwave communication
EDL	00:55:54,623	00:55:55,647	| IOT190 |	Directly
EDL	00:55:55,647	00:55:56,927	| IOT190 |	Communicate with the signals
EDL	00:55:56,927	00:55:57,695	| IOT190 |	Signal the signal
EDL	00:55:58,207	00:55:59,487	| IOT190 |	This is really important
EDL	00:55:59,487	00:56:03,327	| IOT190 |	Because they often turn off whether it's based on traffic or other things
EDL	00:56:03,327	00:56:06,655	| IOT190 |	In two other roads and so we want to make sure that they're able
EDL	00:56:06,655	00:56:09,983	| IOT190 |	Keto signal by signal and get the right information that they need
EDL	00:56:09,983	00:56:11,519	| IOT190 |	A really key component
EDL	00:56:11,519	00:56:12,543	| IOT190 |	Is actually the
EDL	00:56:12,543	00:56:15,359	| IOT190 |	Two-way communication that this new technology will alpha
EDL	00:56:15,871	00:56:20,223	| IOT190 |	So what they'll be able to do if they'll actually be able to see the signal information
EDL	00:56:20,735	00:56:23,295	| IOT190 |	How many more seconds until it turns green
EDL	00:56:23,295	00:56:24,575	| IOT190 |	And other information
EDL	00:56:24,575	00:56:28,159	| IOT190 |	Directly back into their vehicles which will help them make better decisions
EDL	00:56:28,159	00:56:34,303	| IOT190 |	In addition by the signal the signal changes what that'll do is it it will hopefully disrupt the network left
EDL	00:56:34,303	00:56:35,327	| IOT190 |	So that means
EDL	00:56:35,327	00:56:39,423	| IOT190 |	Sometimes when an emergency vehicle comes through like a fire truck it can take hours
EDL	00:56:39,423	00:56:40,191	| IOT190 |	Florida
EDL	00:56:40,191	00:56:41,727	| IOT190 |	People to get back
EDL	00:56:41,727	00:56:43,519	| IOT190 |	To the normal pattern of the road
EDL	00:56:44,031	00:56:46,847	| IOT190 |	Until we think that there's going to be a faster turnaround time
EDL	00:56:46,847	00:56:50,175	| IOT190 |	Between when an emergency happens and when people can continue
EDL	00:56:50,175	00:56:51,455	| IOT190 |	To go where they need to go
EDL	00:56:51,455	00:56:53,247	| IOT190 |	In a manner that deficient
EDL	00:56:53,247	00:56:53,759	| IOT190 |	And also safe
EDL	00:56:54,271	00:56:55,039	| IOT190 |	Awesome
EDL	00:56:55,039	00:56:56,063	| IOT190 |	Anything to get me out of trash
EDL	00:56:57,087	00:56:59,647	| IOT190 |	All right we'll Emily thanks so much for coming on the show this
EDL	00:57:00,159	00:57:00,671	| IOT190 |	I really appreciate
