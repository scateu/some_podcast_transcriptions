EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:47,360	| IOT082 |	Kickback
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:50,944	| IOT082 |	Stay tuned but wait just a moment for a word from our sponsor
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:57,856	| IOT082 |	The days of walking into a sports Stadium sitting down and watching a game are over technology is the fans
EDL	00:00:57,856	00:01:04,256	| IOT082 |	Newest companion San Francisco 49ers vice president Sean kondu came to the arm techcon this week 2
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:10,656	| IOT082 |	Describe how his organization is leveraging mobile technologies smart networks iot Technologies
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:17,056	| IOT082 |	And software to revolutionize your in bed you experience streamline Stadium operations and build businesses are
EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:18,080	| IOT082 |	Around those services
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:22,432	| IOT082 |	All right here we are let's kick it off with
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:23,456	| IOT082 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:25,248	| IOT082 |	Security
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:26,784	| IOT082 |	On Friday
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:28,064	| IOT082 |	Or lack thereof
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:32,416	| IOT082 |	It's not as bad as everyone thinks so here is the message from us for
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:34,720	| IOT082 |	Last week what
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:38,048	| IOT082 |	And was there was a massive distributed denial-of-service attack
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:40,096	| IOT082 |	Using open-source software
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:41,120	| IOT082 |	Found on the internet
EDL	00:01:41,120	00:01:41,888	| IOT082 |	It's called the Mariah
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:43,424	| IOT082 |	Chopper code
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:44,960	| IOT082 |	People used this
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:45,728	| IOT082 |	Create
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:47,008	| IOT082 |	A botnet
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:51,104	| IOT082 |	Comprised of a lot of network DVR cameras some routers
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:52,384	| IOT082 |	Some Critters
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:55,200	| IOT082 |	And a couple other kind of connected devices
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:57,504	| IOT082 |	It was a huge attack
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,016	| IOT082 |	It is
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:00,064	| IOT082 |	What are the largest ever seen
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:04,672	| IOT082 |	And these attacks represent a whole new wave like a whole new escalation
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:06,464	| IOT082 |	DDOS attack
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:11,072	| IOT082 |	These guys actually attacked died which is a domain name server
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:11,840	| IOT082 |	Service
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:13,376	| IOT082 |	Which basically accident address
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:14,400	| IOT082 |	For the internet
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:16,448	| IOT082 |	What happened is
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,984	| IOT082 |	A few people on the East Coast
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:22,848	| IOT082 |	Sabi popular sites go down because people couldn't actually access them using
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:26,432	| IOT082 |	All because it's being hammered by all these
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,200	| IOT082 |	Corinth
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:27,712	| IOT082 |	Iot device
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:31,040	| IOT082 |	The world
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:31,808	| IOT082 |	Mad
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:36,160	| IOT082 |	I was very mad being on the east coast and affected not once but twice on
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:37,696	| IOT082 |	It was Friday morning
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:42,048	| IOT082 |	Started out I couldn't access Twitter no big deal I can live with that but then my
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:44,096	| IOT082 |	Sony PlayStation Vue
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,888	| IOT082 |	TV streaming service that I use
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:49,472	| IOT082 |	Shutdown a problem with Amazon services
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,008	| IOT082 |	It was a mess
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:51,520	| IOT082 |	Heaven
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:52,544	| IOT082 |	Ground to a
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:55,872	| IOT082 |	Be wild and I wondered actually I wondered
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,152	| IOT082 |	Back on Twitter was finally back
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,968	| IOT082 |	I wonder how many people
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:03,808	| IOT082 |	Add iot issues and so many of those go back to the cloud
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:07,648	| IOT082 |	If they can't find their servers well that's a problem and some people actually didn't say
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,928	| IOT082 |	And that they had some issues
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:12,000	| IOT082 |	Yes actually August send an email to me
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,280	| IOT082 |	Explaining that
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,584	| IOT082 |	Their video doorbell was having problems because of
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:22,240	| IOT082 |	Here's the quick take and I've actually Our Guest is going to talk in depth about
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,264	| IOT082 |	So stay tuned for Auntie
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:25,568	| IOT082 |	And I've written about this
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:26,848	| IOT082 |	Basically
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:27,872	| IOT082 |	These devices
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:30,176	| IOT082 |	Have an open port to the internet
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,200	| IOT082 |	They're not
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,736	| IOT082 |	Your traditional iot
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:33,504	| IOT082 |	If Isis
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,784	| IOT082 |	They're basically Giant
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,832	| IOT082 |	Computers that have an open port to the internet
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:39,904	| IOT082 |	Your light bulbs are not really at risk for this type of
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:40,672	| IOT082 |	Attack
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,952	| IOT082 |	Because one
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:43,744	| IOT082 |	They don't directly connect to the internet
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:44,768	| IOT082 |	2
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:46,816	| IOT082 |	They don't have a lot of
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,864	| IOT082 |	Capacity and compute power to actually
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:49,632	| IOT082 |	Be useful indeed
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,216	| IOT082 |	Real perspective there for you guys
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:56,288	| IOT082 |	As part of this though I did decide
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:58,592	| IOT082 |	Hey we should really have a conversation about coyotes
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,616	| IOT082 |	Security that does more than like
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,944	| IOT082 |	And we
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,992	| IOT082 |	Like most companies are you asking about the
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,296	| IOT082 |	Restore York
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:08,832	| IOT082 |	It is accurate
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,600	| IOT082 |	Manor
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:12,672	| IOT082 |	You're like Shrek okay and move on
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:17,791	| IOT082 |	It's probably time to go deeper so I sent some emails out to companies like nest
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:18,559	| IOT082 |	Philips Hue
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:21,375	| IOT082 |	Ecobee Netgear
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:23,423	| IOT082 |	Chamberlain which makes the MyQ
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,983	| IOT082 |	WeMo SmartThings
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,007	| IOT082 |	And wink
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:29,567	| IOT082 |	To find out how they're handling security
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:32,127	| IOT082 |	We're not going to go into a lot of depth
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:32,895	| IOT082 |	Here
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,687	| IOT082 |	But I am going to post
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,455	| IOT082 |	This
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,991	| IOT082 |	In the newsletter that I do
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,271	| IOT082 |	Stacy knows things
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:40,319	| IOT082 |	So you can find out more about this
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,087	| IOT082 |	At a greater level
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,879	| IOT082 |	But the upshot was
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:45,183	| IOT082 |	These companies are actually doing it
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:45,695	| IOT082 |	A good job
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:51,327	| IOT082 |	Most of them have bug Bounty programs most of them are doing pentesting penetration testing
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:53,375	| IOT082 |	At least once a year if not
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,679	| IOT082 |	Almost
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:58,751	| IOT082 |	A lot of them actually monitor the status of their devices
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,799	| IOT082 |	Either if not through a direct
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,335	| IOT082 |	Network operations center
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:04,127	| IOT082 |	They do it through like
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,919	| IOT082 |	Heuristics on the data so
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,967	| IOT082 |	If the data is like a device stops
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:13,087	| IOT082 |	Recording they're going to notice if it starts behaving weirdly or group of them are they're going to notice
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:13,599	| IOT082 |	And take action
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:19,999	| IOT082 |	And I suspect we will find out when your newsletter comes out with the responses are I suspect however that their little bit
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:20,511	| IOT082 |	Better
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:23,839	| IOT082 |	At women they find a security issue that actual
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:26,399	| IOT082 |	Keep pushing software updates to your devices
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:31,007	| IOT082 |	As opposed to most of the devices that were used for this DNS outage
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:35,871	| IOT082 |	We're older and networked DVRs and such
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,919	| IOT082 |	That don't typically get updates
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:38,687	| IOT082 |	A large
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,967	| IOT082 |	Amount of them actually
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:42,015	| IOT082 |	Or built upon
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:43,807	| IOT082 |	Chips in a particular company as well
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,343	| IOT082 |	Yes and
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:47,647	| IOT082 |	A lot of them had hard-coded
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:49,439	| IOT082 |	Passwords which will talk about
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,487	| IOT082 |	I'll put it in the show notes
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:53,535	| IOT082 |	Also but I did a story for
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:56,607	| IOT082 |	Consumers basically telling you how you know if your device is hacked
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,399	| IOT082 |	How you know
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:02,751	| IOT082 |	Your what should you do and all of that and in some cases guys the news is pretty bad
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,543	| IOT082 |	It's basically you know
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,079	| IOT082 |	Set your device on fire and
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,615	| IOT082 |	Send it off into the great beyond
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:10,943	| IOT082 |	I can't I don't know if you talk about this
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:18,111	| IOT082 |	It in your story but I can tell you one thing I did immediately and that is I started monitoring the network traffic of
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:20,671	| IOT082 |	All of my devices when the outage was going on in my
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,975	| IOT082 |	Do I have any box here that are just
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:28,095	| IOT082 |	Turning in pinyin the DNS servers or what but I do not see anything out of the ordinary which was good
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,655	| IOT082 |	Yes and there are Port scanners
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,703	| IOT082 |	That you can use so that that'll be in there too
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,007	| IOT082 |	Yes monitoring your traffic is actually
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:39,871	| IOT082 |	Kevin you're so smart
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,151	| IOT082 |	I have a mind reader
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:41,919	| IOT082 |	Alright so
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:45,247	| IOT082 |	That's the security update news etcetera
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:48,319	| IOT082 |	Guys if you're buying devices from reputable vendor
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:51,647	| IOT082 |	And by reputable I mean they have a brand
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,671	| IOT082 |	You can Google them
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,719	| IOT082 |	Look for bug Bounty programs
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:07:00,863	| IOT082 |	Look for them to make you change your password the over-the-air updates if you haven't upgraded your router in a couple years
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,143	| IOT082 |	My Geico do it
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:03,423	| IOT082 |	Why you'll probably get that
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:06,495	| IOT082 |	So
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:07,775	| IOT082 |	That's that
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,823	| IOT082 |	Let's go on to
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:12,639	| IOT082 |	Find product news because we know this is not going to make a
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,407	| IOT082 |	Stop buying today
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:14,943	| IOT082 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,735	| IOT082 |	Pish posh
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:22,623	| IOT082 |	But I thought I probably will not be by the next device that we're going to talk about only because it's
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,647	| IOT082 |	Homekit
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:25,695	| IOT082 |	Not really interested
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,463	| IOT082 |	Which
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:31,071	| IOT082 |	I'm not either but I did buy an iPhone and I'm setting up my own home kit setup so
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,351	| IOT082 |	Guys stay tuned
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,631	| IOT082 |	Cuz I could be a lot smarter about home
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:36,703	| IOT082 |	Core
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,215	| IOT082 |	You're going to love it
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:38,239	| IOT082 |	Or you're going to hit
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,567	| IOT082 |	Tell us about this light
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:44,639	| IOT082 |	So new product literally ages
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:48,735	| IOT082 |	Hit our inbox is working for the show we actually know about this when we were planning
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:52,575	| IOT082 |	Elgato has the new EVE light switch
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,367	| IOT082 |	449 95
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:57,695	| IOT082 |	It is homekit compatible as we mention
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,231	| IOT082 |	And what's
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:02,047	| IOT082 |	It's kind of interesting about this one too I think a lot of people cuz
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,583	| IOT082 |	Sweet without so much about Wi-Fi
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:06,399	| IOT082 |	This picture Bluetooth low energy
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,679	| IOT082 |	Percy Sledge so
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:08,959	| IOT082 |	That's
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:13,311	| IOT082 |	Eternally I don't wanna sleep earlier naked it would be unique in my house cuz I do not have many
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,591	| IOT082 |	Bluetooth devices so
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:16,895	| IOT082 |	You might be Stacy you might have more than I do
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:19,711	| IOT082 |	I actually don't in the reason I don't
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:21,759	| IOT082 |	Is because there's actually switchmate
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,551	| IOT082 |	Makes a really that's her
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,343	| IOT082 |	Make savory
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:29,183	| IOT082 |	Nice bluetooth light switch in the benefit here is
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:35,327	| IOT082 |	When you get a controllable light switch but two you can actually put the switch anywhere so if you got a switch in a hard.
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:35,839	| IOT082 |	Beach Place
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,631	| IOT082 |	You can just be like
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:39,423	| IOT082 |	Hey I'm going to screw in bluetooth light bulb
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,703	| IOT082 |	Apopka switch on the wall
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,727	| IOT082 |	Wala
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:43,775	| IOT082 |	So that is Handy but
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:47,615	| IOT082 |	Because Bluetooth mesh has not been super satisfying
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:50,175	| IOT082 |	The remote control on these things
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:52,479	| IOT082 |	Isn't great so
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:54,015	| IOT082 |	The light will work
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,551	| IOT082 |	The switch
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,343	| IOT082 |	In the light switch to the light
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,111	| IOT082 |	Is fine
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:59,135	| IOT082 |	Because they're usually Within
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,927	| IOT082 |	A wonderful trip close by
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,719	| IOT082 |	Read unless you're going to do some
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:05,023	| IOT082 |	Crazy like programmable light switch to turn off
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:05,791	| IOT082 |	All the lights
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,815	| IOT082 |	To your house witch
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:09,375	| IOT082 |	Is conceivable and other switches I don't know if you
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:14,239	| IOT082 |	But that sort of stuff gets a little iffy with Bluetooth
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,031	| IOT082 |	If you don't have a stronger
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,311	| IOT082 |	Mesh Network
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:21,663	| IOT082 |	So this is a product that I'm actually going to order it by so I can
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,175	| IOT082 |	Tested my new
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:24,991	| IOT082 |	Hit thing because everybody really is excited
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,271	| IOT082 |	Connected light switch
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:32,927	| IOT082 |	Elgato also makes the sensors the homekit sensors so they've got a water sensor temperature sensor
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:33,951	| IOT082 |	An air quality sensor
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:35,231	| IOT082 |	And
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:39,327	| IOT082 |	I went open close sensor isn't these actually I've tested those they work really well
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,607	| IOT082 |	So
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:42,143	| IOT082 |	If your home cat person
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,423	| IOT082 |	This is definitely device
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,959	| IOT082 |	You should look at
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,983	| IOT082 |	And if you do look at it
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,775	| IOT082 |	Let us know because we have
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:48,543	| IOT082 |	Tested it yet
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:53,151	| IOT082 |	One quick question for you if you're going to get one of these do you have an Apple TV 4 or an iPad
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,431	| IOT082 |	I do I have
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:58,527	| IOT082 |	So you could theoretically set up as a home hub
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,295	| IOT082 |	And then
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:03,903	| IOT082 |	Remotely control lights drunk episode
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:04,927	| IOT082 |	Is the Bluetooth
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:06,719	| IOT082 |	In the iPad in the Bluetooth
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,255	| IOT082 |	In the light switch
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,535	| IOT082 |	That's the question
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:13,119	| IOT082 |	All connectivity you only go so far
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:15,935	| IOT082 |	New Bluetooth will go further
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:19,007	| IOT082 |	And we'll have better Mesh networking and we are waiting for that
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,287	| IOT082 |	So Bluetooth 500
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,823	| IOT082 |	Awesome
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,335	| IOT082 |	Maybe
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:23,359	| IOT082 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,919	| IOT082 |	Next newspaper
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:28,223	| IOT082 |	Also in the consumer smart home side
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,759	| IOT082 |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,295	| IOT082 |	Has
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,063	| IOT082 |	Kind of exciting
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:36,415	| IOT082 |	I'm surprised it's taken as long
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:38,463	| IOT082 |	Is that Amazon has brought
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:44,863	| IOT082 |	The echo functionality to its low-cost tablets it's actually reminds me a lot of like Google Now goo
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:47,679	| IOT082 |	Google Assistant because you can tap and hold
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,983	| IOT082 |	A long press on the home button on
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:50,751	| IOT082 |	A
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,775	| IOT082 |	Fire tablet
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,311	| IOT082 |	And then speak
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,079	| IOT082 |	2
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,871	| IOT082 |	Your echo through the tablet
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:59,711	| IOT082 |	Electrical little pop up cards like I do with my Fire TV so like if I
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:04,063	| IOT082 |	Ask for the weather I can get a weather card on my TV using the Fire TV
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:06,111	| IOT082 |	It's very similar just now is down on the tablet
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:08,415	| IOT082 |	Okay and you could also
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,695	| IOT082 |	Used to be able to tell
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:11,743	| IOT082 |	The echo to send
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:12,511	| IOT082 |	Data to
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,559	| IOT082 |	Fire tablet and it would show up
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,095	| IOT082 |	Right
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:18,143	| IOT082 |	Right now it's now it's native that's okay
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:22,495	| IOT082 |	Got it okay in my big frustration though with this and I'm curious how this
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,263	| IOT082 |	How fast does a
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:25,311	| IOT082 |	Load cuz I I don't actually have anything.
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:27,359	| IOT082 |	Kick work with us I don't know if you tried it
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,127	| IOT082 |	Have you tried it
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,919	| IOT082 |	I don't have any fire tablets
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:32,223	| IOT082 |	Delete ride with my fire TVs
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,247	| IOT082 |	In which case it is
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:33,759	| IOT082 |	Quick quick
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:36,831	| IOT082 |	But I couldn't speak to the tablet implementation
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,855	| IOT082 |	Because the
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:38,623	| IOT082 |	We're going to have to say the name
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:40,159	| IOT082 |	The Earl
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:43,999	| IOT082 |	App
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,279	| IOT082 |	On my
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:47,327	| IOT082 |	Phone is really slow to load
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,375	| IOT082 |	I'm like Cinderella
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:52,959	| IOT082 |	And I don't know if it's my Hardware it's it's all so slow on my husbands iPhone
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,007	| IOT082 |	I don't know what's going on
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:56,287	| IOT082 |	I would like it to be
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:59,103	| IOT082 |	But I like this idea I love
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:04,479	| IOT082 |	Because sometimes you don't listening to like if you ask the weather for 10 days out that's good
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,247	| IOT082 |	Will be painful listen to
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:06,527	| IOT082 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:09,343	| IOT082 |	Sending data onto a visual device
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,135	| IOT082 |	Is really it like a no-brainer
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,159	| IOT082 |	So yeah
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:16,255	| IOT082 |	The Amazon Dash program also got a slight boost in some more
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:17,535	| IOT082 |	Colleen meeting list
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,071	| IOT082 |	6
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:25,215	| IOT082 |	They're 62 button so now they've got over 200 Dash buttons these are the buttons you press to automatically reorder stuff
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,495	| IOT082 |	And
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:27,775	| IOT082 |	People are happy
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,823	| IOT082 |	Amazon says what do they say
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:34,431	| IOT082 |	5 times more five times more purchases
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,479	| IOT082 |	In the last year or in the past year
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:39,807	| IOT082 |	A95x Pro 35 x growth and I believe
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:43,903	| IOT082 |	Last year they said like a purchase was being made every
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:49,535	| IOT082 |	13 seconds or something crazy like that so apparently people are using them how many we have
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,303	| IOT082 |	No idea
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,839	| IOT082 |	5x more than
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,887	| IOT082 |	Which makes sense there's a mass
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,399	| IOT082 |	Expansion
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,191	| IOT082 |	Not too loud
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:59,519	| IOT082 |	And there's 60 more Brands added to the dash buttons
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:01,055	| IOT082 |	So I can go over 200 brands
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:04,383	| IOT082 |	You know I look at the dash buttons every now and then I'm like
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,407	| IOT082 |	Is there a place in my life
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:06,943	| IOT082 |	One of these and so far
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:07,967	| IOT082 |	I haven't gotten
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:12,831	| IOT082 |	The only thing I reorder on a regular basis are these like toothbrushes for my dog
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,599	| IOT082 |	They're like
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:15,647	| IOT082 |	Little toothbrush igbos that smell like Punk
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,159	| IOT082 |	Kanpai
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:21,535	| IOT082 |	I like pumpkin pie
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,119	| IOT082 |	Ghetto maybe a state they put that on the dash I would be
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:25,887	| IOT082 |	Be like yes
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:27,167	| IOT082 |	But right now I just
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,191	| IOT082 |	Turn to
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,471	| IOT082 |	And I say
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,007	| IOT082 |	However
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,031	| IOT082 |	Please order more.
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:33,567	| IOT082 |	And
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:34,847	| IOT082 |	You really should have a
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:39,199	| IOT082 |	And maybe they do I know that I have been have programmable Dash buttons that you can get in
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,479	| IOT082 |	Do your own tinkering but
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:42,527	| IOT082 |	Why not have a generic one that
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,551	| IOT082 |	But you select
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:46,367	| IOT082 |	We're sign whatever product you want to it
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,439	| IOT082 |	I imagine there's probably control over the brand
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,487	| IOT082 |	And maybe
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:52,511	| IOT082 |	Amazon has tax
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:54,303	| IOT082 |	Keep the product in certain stock
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,839	| IOT082 |	Maybe in its warehouses
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,119	| IOT082 |	Could be
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:57,887	| IOT082 |	Could they make sense
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:01,471	| IOT082 |	I need a restore 3 record as well
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:02,495	| IOT082 |	Which is
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,543	| IOT082 |	And finally
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,079	| IOT082 |	Folks who have the Logitech
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:06,591	| IOT082 |	Harmony
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:09,407	| IOT082 |	You guys are going to be excited because now it's
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,943	| IOT082 |	Swiss the echo
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:15,807	| IOT082 |	So I don't need it to send that cuz I tell people used to do it
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,855	| IOT082 |	Well I used to use you know me
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:19,647	| IOT082 |	Which was the software
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:20,927	| IOT082 |	Spoke to you know me
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,463	| IOT082 |	Spoke to the
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:24,767	| IOT082 |	Harmony Hub that then spoke to the
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,279	| IOT082 |	The echo
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:27,071	| IOT082 |	And then by the speaker
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,607	| IOT082 |	Lots of things are then everything
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,119	| IOT082 |	Went back yet
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:31,423	| IOT082 |	So it was no as you know me
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:36,543	| IOT082 |	That was the order of operations there
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,823	| IOT082 |	And it worked
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:39,103	| IOT082 |	So you'd say something like
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:40,383	| IOT082 |	However
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:42,687	| IOT082 |	Netflix and chill
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:43,455	| IOT082 |	Lo and behold
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:44,735	| IOT082 |	But now
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:46,527	| IOT082 |	That is unnecessary
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,575	| IOT082 |	Other than I sing about
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:50,367	| IOT082 |	The yonomi software is its
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,159	| IOT082 |	It comes preprogrammed
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:54,463	| IOT082 |	It looks of the devices you have in suggest
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:55,743	| IOT082 |	Recipes for you
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:58,047	| IOT082 |	So if you don't want to program your own Logitech
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:04,447	| IOT082 |	We have chip news this week I am an arm
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,471	| IOT082 |	Techcon in
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,799	| IOT082 |	Clara I have a hard time with
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,567	| IOT082 |	Please Bay Area
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:12,383	| IOT082 |	City named some like I didn't send sub place
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:14,687	| IOT082 |	Sometimes I even get a
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,199	| IOT082 |	This time
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,271	| IOT082 |	It's actually good show
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,039	| IOT082 |	I saw
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:22,111	| IOT082 |	You know the plans that SoftBank has forearm
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,903	| IOT082 |	Witcher basically
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,695	| IOT082 |	It's a bet on there being a trillion
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:28,255	| IOT082 |	Connected devices by 20
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:29,535	| IOT082 |	23
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,327	| IOT082 |	Think of a DDOS we could do with that
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,607	| IOT082 |	Well but
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:34,911	| IOT082 |	These are low-power their arm
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:38,751	| IOT082 |	I know well the cortex the cortex a series could really do it now
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:40,799	| IOT082 |	DMC use notsobot
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:43,615	| IOT082 |	Arvest done a couple things so
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:49,247	| IOT082 |	Big number of devices Masa who is the chairman of SoftBank muscle saint preux
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:51,807	| IOT082 |	Ejected The Singularity it was really fun talk
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,087	| IOT082 |	And
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:54,111	| IOT082 |	Kind of talked about
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:56,927	| IOT082 |	How in this is with art this is
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:57,439	| IOT082 |	What Kevin and I
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,999	| IOT082 |	Excited
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:02,815	| IOT082 |	All of these cheap sensors are just getting
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:09,727	| IOT082 |	Better and better and cheaper and cheaper and we're going to use them for sillier and sillier things that are just going to change our lives and really unexpected
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:12,031	| IOT082 |	My favorite example from the show
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,311	| IOT082 |	Was
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:15,615	| IOT082 |	From arm CTO
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,383	| IOT082 |	Mike
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,919	| IOT082 |	Mueller who said
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:18,687	| IOT082 |	That
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:20,223	| IOT082 |	Someone was working on a
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,271	| IOT082 |	Smell sensor for
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:24,319	| IOT082 |	For people's underarms that would
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:27,391	| IOT082 |	Talk to their deodorant until it went to work harder
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:28,415	| IOT082 |	This is not a real Prada
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,695	| IOT082 |	This is an idea of a
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,487	| IOT082 |	But
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:33,279	| IOT082 |	The chips are getting better and cheaper
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:33,791	| IOT082 |	And one day we
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:34,815	| IOT082 |	I have something on
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:38,143	| IOT082 |	I don't want that
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:40,703	| IOT082 |	Wayback attack
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:42,239	| IOT082 |	But it was just an easy
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:44,799	| IOT082 |	Kevin is stinky right now
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:49,151	| IOT082 |	It doesn't just freaking sensor to tell me
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:51,711	| IOT082 |	Does bring up an interesting ethical things
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:55,295	| IOT082 |	Look at that person's data the physical data for
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,575	| IOT082 |	But I personally was very nervous
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:57,855	| IOT082 |	And smelly
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,903	| IOT082 |	So arm also announced
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:01,439	| IOT082 |	Really unique service
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,463	| IOT082 |	It kind of baffles me
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:08,351	| IOT082 |	They announced embed Cloud which is their partnering with an unnamed OEM
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,631	| IOT082 |	Call provider
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:11,423	| IOT082 |	Arm is built software
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:15,519	| IOT082 |	Basically handle the first layer of an iot Cloud which is device management
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:18,335	| IOT082 |	Getting the information from devices
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,615	| IOT082 |	And setting devices up on
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,919	| IOT082 |	And I'm just kind of like wow
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:22,943	| IOT082 |	I should come
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:24,223	| IOT082 |	Heading into the cloud
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:27,551	| IOT082 |	Really at a chip design company
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:28,831	| IOT082 |	Yes
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:30,623	| IOT082 |	The same because arm doesn't create
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:33,439	| IOT082 |	Chips as we all know so it actually could create this in big cloud
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:36,255	| IOT082 |	I'm scratching my head on my way to actually making out
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:38,559	| IOT082 |	Physical product if you can call the cloud physics
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:41,119	| IOT082 |	Product they're not hosting their own data
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:44,447	| IOT082 |	Did write their own software though
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:47,775	| IOT082 |	So it's based on some other there is Sansa in
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:50,591	| IOT082 |	How old is 6 slope an acquisition
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:51,871	| IOT082 |	Sin City
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:53,151	| IOT082 |	Sensitive sensitive
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:54,687	| IOT082 |	Remember 6lowpan
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,271	| IOT082 |	That's crazy.
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:03,135	| IOT082 |	I'm excited about this because it's a really interesting new
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:04,671	| IOT082 |	Business angle forearm
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:09,279	| IOT082 |	I told it's a SAS software-as-a-service kind of bottle so that's interesting
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,303	| IOT082 |	It's also a
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:12,095	| IOT082 |	Opportunity for them to go
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,631	| IOT082 |	Up the stack from
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,935	| IOT082 |	Not necessarily providing the hardware but
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:18,495	| IOT082 |	You don't getting pretty close to the hardware
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:19,007	| IOT082 |	And now
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,287	| IOT082 |	Going up
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,079	| IOT082 |	They say that customers
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:22,847	| IOT082 |	What
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:25,663	| IOT082 |	The ease of use they also say that the links to their
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:28,479	| IOT082 |	McLeod and McLeod and their trust Zone in
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:29,503	| IOT082 |	Crypto cell
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:33,087	| IOT082 |	Security stuff is going to be really important and customers want that
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:33,599	| IOT082 |	I want it from one
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:35,391	| IOT082 |	Wilson
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,951	| IOT082 |	I'm not convinced that this is like
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:39,487	| IOT082 |	A home run or anything but
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:41,023	| IOT082 |	Do you think it's a really
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:43,071	| IOT082 |	It's a logical step when you look at the
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,607	| IOT082 |	Business transformation
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:46,399	| IOT082 |	And we'll see if it's the right step
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:49,471	| IOT082 |	It's it's interesting because they
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:51,007	| IOT082 |	Obviously known for their computing
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:57,919	| IOT082 |	This is pushing computer a little bit to the cloud which is very unique for them butts other countries obviously have done
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:02,271	| IOT082 |	I agree it's a very logical thing for them to do I just I didn't think about it prior to
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,391	| IOT082 |	Central Time
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:09,951	| IOT082 |	Intel launch the new atom 4
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,743	| IOT082 |	Connected cars and
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:12,511	| IOT082 |	Gateway's
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:15,583	| IOT082 |	So until causes fog Computing Asda Cisco
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:18,143	| IOT082 |	This is basically the idea that
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,679	| IOT082 |	You'll have some computer
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:26,079	| IOT082 |	Cloud computing Edge in the middle of a Gateway where a lot of like your sensor data comes in and is analyzed
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:28,127	| IOT082 |	Why is right there and then it sends data back
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:30,687	| IOT082 |	Because it's just too far too expensive
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:31,967	| IOT082 |	To keep going all the way from
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:32,479	| IOT082 |	The device
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:37,343	| IOT082 |	Too slow too much latency especially for something like a car what you need instant
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:38,111	| IOT082 |	Paneer instant
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,159	| IOT082 |	And if it's
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:46,047	| IOT082 |	So Intel chip is ruggedized and it's low power for an Intel chip
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:49,887	| IOT082 |	And still very capable and it also has some of the deterministic
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:52,447	| IOT082 |	Teachers that that help enhance the safety
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:55,263	| IOT082 |	Robotics and autonomous driving kind of applications
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:58,335	| IOT082 |	So that way it looks a lot like the recently-launched arm
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:20:00,639	| IOT082 |	It was at the r52 architecture
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,687	| IOT082 |	The r52
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,967	| IOT082 |	So the r52 that we talk
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,247	| IOT082 |	About a cup
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:05,759	| IOT082 |	4 weeks ago
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,063	| IOT082 |	This feels like
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:09,343	| IOT082 |	This isn't hugely
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:13,951	| IOT082 |	You're surprising but it feels like we're starting to see a coalescing around
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,743	| IOT082 |	What we need in these kind of
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:18,815	| IOT082 |	Gateway devices and four
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:19,839	| IOT082 |	Autonomous cars in
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:22,911	| IOT082 |	That's so it's it's like oh everybody agrees that we need these
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:27,263	| IOT082 |	Where are T2 Kevin story Kevin it's story time
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:31,615	| IOT082 |	So it is not a very exciting story let's not build it up too much your butt
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:38,015	| IOT082 |	It actually illustrates the difference I think between having connected devices and actually having a quote on quote Smart Home
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:38,783	| IOT082 |	So many people put
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,063	| IOT082 |	These products
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:41,855	| IOT082 |	Into a house
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:42,879	| IOT082 |	And then
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:45,695	| IOT082 |	Don't take advantage of the smarts behind them whereas
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,487	| IOT082 |	I actually had to because
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:49,791	| IOT082 |	Quick story of my son comes in
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:53,119	| IOT082 |	After work sometimes 12 1/2 in the morning
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:54,399	| IOT082 |	Is not locking the door
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:58,239	| IOT082 |	Orange and then yesterday he went to work everybody was gone he went to work at 11 the morning
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:00,799	| IOT082 |	And we came home at 4:11 in French
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:05,407	| IOT082 |	And again they did not lock the door so we've got wide open house all hours of the day and night
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:09,503	| IOT082 |	And I'm like you know what I have disconnected a lock that Stacy sent me and I
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:11,807	| IOT082 |	Hamden hard over installing but finally did
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:12,831	| IOT082 |	And it really
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:15,135	| IOT082 |	Use it in an intelligent way
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:17,696	| IOT082 |	When this is a perfect opportunity so sure enough
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:20,512	| IOT082 |	I went to my Wink app
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:23,072	| IOT082 |	And I'm like oh I can just make a robot that says
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:25,120	| IOT082 |	Anytime that the lock
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:29,984	| IOT082 |	Is an unlock status for 5 minutes I just arbitrarily chose 5 minutes
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:30,496	| IOT082 |	Lock it
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:33,056	| IOT082 |	And it works like a charm and
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:36,384	| IOT082 |	Lock the door when they leave the house
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:38,176	| IOT082 |	The house will always be
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:40,480	| IOT082 |	Locked within 5 minutes on that so
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:40,992	| IOT082 |	Just a
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:44,320	| IOT082 |	You know handy little tip that think about your devices
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:46,880	| IOT082 |	And use them in a smart while use them to their potential
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,648	| IOT082 |	Joseph
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:51,232	| IOT082 |	This is great A lot of people in this is a perfect example of
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:56,864	| IOT082 |	This is how the smart home will eventually work but it's hard for people because people do not automatically
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,912	| IOT082 |	Think about all the things things can do
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,192	| IOT082 |	I will warn you though
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:02,496	| IOT082 |	Do not like go out to Garden
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:03,776	| IOT082 |	And
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,568	| IOT082 |	Forget your key or your smartphone
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:07,360	| IOT082 |	Because when I have Auto
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:09,408	| IOT082 |	I I had a lock that I had auto lock on
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,968	| IOT082 |	It was a little bit faster but it's still surprise me
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:13,504	| IOT082 |	Crappie like
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:15,552	| IOT082 |	Watering the plants Abednego into
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:16,320	| IOT082 |	Add to go into the house
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:21,952	| IOT082 |	Well that is a good tip but I'm actually covered
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:23,232	| IOT082 |	Because this lock is push button
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,024	| IOT082 |	It's got the keypad
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:29,120	| IOT082 |	Correct which we don't carry keys to the house we have the push button
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:31,424	| IOT082 |	I love it I think keypads are actually way better
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:38,080	| IOT082 |	And that's a Kwikset Z-Wave
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:39,872	| IOT082 |	Lock right
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:40,640	| IOT082 |	Correct that is
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,200	| IOT082 |	Easy quick set
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:44,224	| IOT082 |	Z-Wave lock
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:45,248	| IOT082 |	Power through the wink hub
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:48,064	| IOT082 |	You could also do something like this using smart
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:52,416	| IOT082 |	Alright my show-and-tell for this week
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:56,256	| IOT082 |	Is the nucleus this is a video intercom
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,024	| IOT082 |	System
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:59,072	| IOT082 |	Could I showed it to my husband he was like
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,096	| IOT082 |	I don't get the point
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:06,496	| IOT082 |	It's basically like a dedicated Skype client
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:08,288	| IOT082 |	Which is what they literally everybody says
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:11,360	| IOT082 |	It is like a dedicated Skype
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,128	| IOT082 |	Client accept
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:15,456	| IOT082 |	It also doubles as an echo of sore
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:17,504	| IOT082 |	It does not play your Spotify playlist
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,296	| IOT082 |	And it does not
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,832	| IOT082 |	Play Pandora
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:24,416	| IOT082 |	But other than that it can control your Hue Lights and
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:26,208	| IOT082 |	Do a lot of things that the echo.can do
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:29,280	| IOT082 |	So if you don't have one and you do have
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,048	| IOT082 |	A nucleus
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:37,728	| IOT082 |	This is a device that works better in pairs one is about $250 the other
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:40,288	| IOT082 |	If you buy two they're $200 a piece
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,592	| IOT082 |	And people by a median of
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:44,640	| IOT082 |	3 according to Jonathan Frank
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:45,152	| IOT082 |	Call the CEO
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:47,200	| IOT082 |	And that is because
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:50,016	| IOT082 |	They're using them to replace these old school intercom systems
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:53,344	| IOT082 |	It is actually really useful for this
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,112	| IOT082 |	So
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:55,648	| IOT082 |	We put one in
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:57,184	| IOT082 |	Are upstairs one in our kitchen
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:24:00,256	| IOT082 |	We actually turned off the echo feature
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:01,792	| IOT082 |	And it's not cold
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:02,560	| IOT082 |	I love Auto
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,936	| IOT082 |	Consistent
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:12,288	| IOT082 |	Star Roamer future you can actually turn that off since we have an echo downstairs in
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:14,080	| IOT082 |	The kitchen we did
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:14,592	| IOT082 |	Turn the downstairs
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:21,504	| IOT082 |	But you can now we can now just when my daughter is upstairs pacing in my office or I'm up in my office working my husband needs to
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,528	| IOT082 |	Ask me where something is
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,552	| IOT082 |	Refrigerator he's just like
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:25,856	| IOT082 |	And you know it
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:28,928	| IOT082 |	You can set it up so it connects automatically
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:29,696	| IOT082 |	Four people within your name
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:34,048	| IOT082 |	It's like hello
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:34,816	| IOT082 |	Oh yes this
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:42,752	| IOT082 |	It does sound very much like Skype only if limited to your
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:44,800	| IOT082 |	Wireless network your own house is not like you could
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:47,104	| IOT082 |	Put one at the neighbors house and have a video chat with us
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,176	| IOT082 |	So you can
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:51,968	| IOT082 |	That's the other interesting
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:57,344	| IOT082 |	So now it's now it is interesting to me other place we have ours cuz we were at 3
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,880	| IOT082 |	Is my husband's office
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:02,464	| IOT082 |	So now whenever I want to talk to him
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:03,232	| IOT082 |	I just
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:04,512	| IOT082 |	Basically press the button.
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,048	| IOT082 |	There's a bun
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,840	| IOT082 |	The home screen looks like a button up all the
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:09,120	| IOT082 |	Call basically
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,424	| IOT082 |	And you go
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:13,472	| IOT082 |	I call my husband's office and
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:14,752	| IOT082 |	He's like why are you
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:18,336	| IOT082 |	But it's super fun and you cannot voice
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:19,616	| IOT082 |	Only if you were
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:24,480	| IOT082 |	And so grandparents you can give this to
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:30,880	| IOT082 |	Somebody wasn't text Abby it's very easy to set up on your network you basically set it up on your Wi-Fi network and then you enter a code that says your
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,648	| IOT082 |	You're part of this family
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:33,952	| IOT082 |	Family unit this nucleus
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:34,464	| IOT082 |	And it's
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:37,024	| IOT082 |	How to cool so the downsides are
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:38,304	| IOT082 |	Hear it outside
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:39,584	| IOT082 |	Things I'd like to see
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:42,656	| IOT082 |	One there's no missed call function
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:45,216	| IOT082 |	And maybe that's cuz I'm not thinking of it is it
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:46,496	| IOT082 |	An intercom truly
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:48,032	| IOT082 |	But I would kind of like
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:52,128	| IOT082 |	Purdue score
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:54,176	| IOT082 |	And
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:56,992	| IOT082 |	We had some issues with one of the devices
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:59,552	| IOT082 |	I don't know if this is representative it anything but
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:01,600	| IOT082 |	It just bricked itself
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,392	| IOT082 |	And then we had to restart it
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:03,904	| IOT082 |	And waiting
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,696	| IOT082 |	And it took a bit
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:06,208	| IOT082 |	To restart
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:15,168	| IOT082 |	Relatively minor issues are Kansai it's actually it's much more interesting to me now because it works outside
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:20,800	| IOT082 |	Another thing I just thought of it I'm guessing you can do this this would be an interesting feature to me
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:21,824	| IOT082 |	So Shaggy said you have it
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:24,128	| IOT082 |	The parents are grandparents house
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:26,432	| IOT082 |	Since you can set it up for Auto
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,224	| IOT082 |	Connect 4 Auto
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:30,784	| IOT082 |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:32,832	| IOT082 |	Yes auto answer
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:34,624	| IOT082 |	Could you theoretically use it as a
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:36,416	| IOT082 |	Remote monitoring tool
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:37,952	| IOT082 |	I
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:40,256	| IOT082 |	Auto answers
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,024	| IOT082 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:41,536	| IOT082 |	Have video
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:43,840	| IOT082 |	Sono Chi
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:46,144	| IOT082 |	Auto answers I believe it is just voice
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:47,424	| IOT082 |	Inow kind of
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:49,984	| IOT082 |	Oh there's one other thing though that's
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:58,176	| IOT082 |	That there's an app on your phone and that becomes part of your network to so when your aunt like I'm on the road right now but I
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:58,944	| IOT082 |	Call my daughter
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:00,224	| IOT082 |	Vici
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:03,296	| IOT082 |	So if I read my office
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:05,088	| IOT082 |	I said she heard it she can go answer it
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:08,160	| IOT082 |	We just established a connection without hurting a smartphone without
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:11,744	| IOT082 |	You know any effort on her part except answering a
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:14,048	| IOT082 |	If not it's a nice picture
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:14,816	| IOT082 |	So
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,584	| IOT082 |	I'm liking it
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:16,096	| IOT082 |	Kind of fun
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:19,168	| IOT082 |	Is it worth $200
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:20,704	| IOT082 |	In our house maybe not
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:24,288	| IOT082 |	But I can see setting up it would be worth
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:25,568	| IOT082 |	400
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,640	| IOT082 |	It'd be worth $100
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,408	| IOT082 |	Search for like a connection with
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:34,528	| IOT082 |	I think so
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,320	| IOT082 |	I will also say that
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:39,392	| IOT082 |	So if your family is TekSavvy maybe this isn't
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,160	| IOT082 |	Like the best for you
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:44,000	| IOT082 |	My mom for example I'm always like I have to call her
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:45,280	| IOT082 |	My mom will you get
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:46,048	| IOT082 |	Skype
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:48,608	| IOT082 |	Or I text her to like a mom let's do a Duo call
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:51,680	| IOT082 |	There is no spontaneity
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:53,984	| IOT082 |	And sometimes it's
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:55,264	| IOT082 |	How I would
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:57,312	| IOT082 |	Phone isn't plugged in
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:01,408	| IOT082 |	Skype's not on this computer right now because I doing something else
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:03,968	| IOT082 |	So this would be kind of fun for the
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:06,528	| IOT082 |	Yay
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,552	| IOT082 |	Okay so
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:10,112	| IOT082 |	That is the show for this week
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:10,624	| IOT082 |	Stay tuned
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,416	| IOT082 |	An interview on
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:13,952	| IOT082 |	Home Security
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:18,304	| IOT082 |	And iot security featuring Andy Ellis the CSO of Akamai
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:20,864	| IOT082 |	You're going to learn a lot of really good stuff in this
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,656	| IOT082 |	Or we do that
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:29,056	| IOT082 |	Let's have a message from our sponsor we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:33,152	| IOT082 |	With a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Hewlett-Packard Enterprise
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:38,784	| IOT082 |	Can I have dr. Tom Braddock who is a VP and general manager for servers and iot systems
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:40,064	| IOT082 |	At hpe
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:44,928	| IOT082 |	Here with me today to talk about how HP handles analytics at the edge
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:48,512	| IOT082 |	Tom hpe has introduced a new product
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:50,048	| IOT082 |	Call The Edge line boxes
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:52,352	| IOT082 |	And they have 64-bit
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:54,400	| IOT082 |	Computing at the edge
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:55,936	| IOT082 |	Are these gateways
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:57,728	| IOT082 |	Juggernaut gateways
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:29:04,128	| IOT082 |	And that is the the difference here in fact it's 64-bit
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:06,688	| IOT082 |	Which as you know is Intel's high-end
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:07,968	| IOT082 |	Architecture that we can play
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:14,112	| IOT082 |	Gateway category and we have products and sucked my competitors
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:19,232	| IOT082 |	Atom Processor sometimes
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:22,304	| IOT082 |	No processor
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:25,632	| IOT082 |	What will you need to do deep analytics fast
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:30,240	| IOT082 |	Then you need the horsepower of proving enterprise-class
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:31,520	| IOT082 |	Such as
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:36,640	| IOT082 |	64 Intel Xeon cores that we have and therefore we had to create a new product
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:37,920	| IOT082 |	Category
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:42,272	| IOT082 |	And that new categories called
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:43,296	| IOT082 |	Convert 70 system
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:47,904	| IOT082 |	And in that category we convert several things in a single
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:49,184	| IOT082 |	Environmentally hardened box
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:52,256	| IOT082 |	And that chassis or box is temperature
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:53,536	| IOT082 |	Shocking vibration pardon
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:56,608	| IOT082 |	Q64
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:59,424	| IOT082 |	230 lb
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,216	| IOT082 |	And this has something
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:04,032	| IOT082 |	In the same box it also houses
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:05,312	| IOT082 |	Data acquisition
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:07,872	| IOT082 |	And control systems
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:12,480	| IOT082 |	Call my partner National instruments in the same box and then we also converge
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:15,552	| IOT082 |	Hpe ilo integrated lights-out
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:16,832	| IOT082 |	Remote
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:18,112	| IOT082 |	Management psychology
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:21,952	| IOT082 |	Because again what's more remote than the other called The iot Edge
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:23,488	| IOT082 |	Listen products
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,024	| IOT082 |	Vines
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:27,072	| IOT082 |	Amazing benefits in his conversion
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:27,840	| IOT082 |	Also
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:30,656	| IOT082 |	Amazing benefits and its ability to do
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:33,216	| IOT082 |	Analytics that's normally reserved for the Datacenter
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:34,496	| IOT082 |	And you come fast
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,520	| IOT082 |	Because they're out of the edge
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:37,312	| IOT082 |	Freddy turn around time in the response
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:38,592	| IOT082 |	Candy
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,128	| IOT082 |	What's quicker and many times a meeting
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,176	| IOT082 |	Do I still need a Gateway box
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:43,200	| IOT082 |	In the scenario
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:46,784	| IOT082 |	The Edge line iot converge systems can do the job of a gateway
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:49,600	| IOT082 |	Wechat customer applications now
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:50,624	| IOT082 |	We have
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:51,392	| IOT082 |	A gateway
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:53,184	| IOT082 |	Connected to the iot convergence
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:56,512	| IOT082 |	So you guys are essentially putting a mini Datacenter
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:57,280	| IOT082 |	At the edge
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:58,048	| IOT082 |	Why
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:58,560	| IOT082 |	Do we need some
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:03,680	| IOT082 |	What's a good way to put it because it has tremendous high performance Computing capability
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:04,192	| IOT082 |	And
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:09,312	| IOT082 |	I need a quick example in the world
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:11,872	| IOT082 |	Artificial intelligence machine learning and cognitive
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:12,384	| IOT082 |	Computing
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:14,432	| IOT082 |	There's a notion of building the model
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:16,992	| IOT082 |	Machine learning applications
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:19,296	| IOT082 |	Takes a lot of CPU power
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:19,808	| IOT082 |	To build
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:25,184	| IOT082 |	The cloud has a sensor and it's shifting
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,464	| IOT082 |	Which such
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:28,000	| IOT082 |	Bill demott
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:31,584	| IOT082 |	Augmentin and run
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:36,960	| IOT082 |	The banlist the security issues the latency in the cost issues
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:38,240	| IOT082 |	Are eliminated when
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:39,264	| IOT082 |	All done at the edge
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:40,800	| IOT082 |	Oktap
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:42,848	| IOT082 |	Where can we find out more about Hewlett-Packard in
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:45,920	| IOT082 |	You can find more by going to our website
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:52,320	| IOT082 |	Hpe.com iot
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:58,720	| IOT082 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:00,000	| IOT082 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:05,120	| IOT082 |	And today's guest we have Andy Ellis who is the chief security officer at Akamai
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:08,704	| IOT082 |	I'm doing fantastic
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:09,728	| IOT082 |	Sick today Stacy how are you
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,776	| IOT082 |	I am super great
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:14,080	| IOT082 |	I can't believe you're doing so fantastic
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:14,592	| IOT082 |	Play because
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:16,128	| IOT082 |	On Friday
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:17,920	| IOT082 |	The internet was under attack
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:20,480	| IOT082 |	I feel like you guys probably were noticing that
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:21,248	| IOT082 |	Had some opinions on
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:22,528	| IOT082 |	Yes
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:28,928	| IOT082 |	So we saw your the attack against dying it's worth noting that you're dying like Akamai Mini
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:34,304	| IOT082 |	Other companies your parts of the infrastructure that make up the internet and the web as we know it
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:37,120	| IOT082 |	Internet
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:40,448	| IOT082 |	It wasn't under attack the routing fabric with holding up fine
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:41,984	| IOT082 |	There were just a bunch of
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:44,800	| IOT082 |	Really popular websites that weren't available
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:46,848	| IOT082 |	The East Coast on Friday
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:48,640	| IOT082 |	So in the wake of this
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,176	| IOT082 |	Security researcher
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:52,224	| IOT082 |	Discover that once again this massive
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:53,248	| IOT082 |	Adidas
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:56,064	| IOT082 |	Distributed denial-of-service attack
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,088	| IOT082 |	Against
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,880	| IOT082 |	This actually was
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:00,160	| IOT082 |	Done by the sea
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:04,000	| IOT082 |	I don't know if it's the same organization but using the same source code that was used a couple
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:06,816	| IOT082 |	Weeks ago against you guys to attack
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,608	| IOT082 |	I think it was Brian Krebs
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:09,376	| IOT082 |	Website yes
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:14,240	| IOT082 |	Yep. There's the Mirai code which is used to build this botnet
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:18,336	| IOT082 |	Mostly of your network video recorder some other things in iot
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:21,152	| IOT082 |	Hard-coded default password
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:24,992	| IOT082 |	And we see some of the same devices showing up
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:26,016	| IOT082 |	In both the tax
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:28,576	| IOT082 |	That could be the same actors
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:30,880	| IOT082 |	It could be different actors now the source code is out there
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:33,952	| IOT082 |	And one of the things we have certainly seen in the past
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:38,560	| IOT082 |	Some other denial-of-service attack see when people are taking over WordPress sites
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:41,120	| IOT082 |	Is once it became well-known
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:43,424	| IOT082 |	Great source of botnet material
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:45,984	| IOT082 |	Lots of people in fought over that botnet
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:48,800	| IOT082 |	It would take different parts of it for themselves to go to attack
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:52,384	| IOT082 |	That's a pretty normal thing you see in the DDOS For Hire world
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:56,224	| IOT082 |	Okay so these people are basically they have a massive network of
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:56,992	| IOT082 |	Devices
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:57,760	| IOT082 |	They can use
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:58,784	| IOT082 |	The hammer someone servers
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,320	| IOT082 |	What you're saying is
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:01,856	| IOT082 |	Other people then
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:03,904	| IOT082 |	Take over parts of
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:04,928	| IOT082 |	They steal it okay
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:07,744	| IOT082 |	So it's Bots battling Bots
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,024	| IOT082 |	Effectively
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:10,560	| IOT082 |	I never seen a lot of
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:13,632	| IOT082 |	Scanning traffic in the background noise of the internet
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:15,680	| IOT082 |	People looking for machines to compromise
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:19,008	| IOT082 |	So let's get to these machines
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:21,312	| IOT082 |	I feel like everybody is attacking me
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:22,336	| IOT082 |	According to the Internet of Things
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:29,504	| IOT082 |	Really feels like it's a lot of these devices appear to be routers Network DVR cameras some printers
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:31,040	| IOT082 |	And they feel like things that maybe
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:32,832	| IOT082 |	But is it fair to
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:36,928	| IOT082 |	Call this The Internet of Things or should we maybe come up with better
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:37,696	| IOT082 |	Better terminology
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:40,256	| IOT082 |	So one of my calling
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:41,792	| IOT082 |	It's called it things on the internet
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:43,584	| IOT082 |	Which is probably a little more apropos
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:46,656	| IOT082 |	I like it how do we want to make a distinguishing lime
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,192	| IOT082 |	Two types of
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:54,848	| IOT082 |	So I'm not sure yet but I know where I draw the line between the things on the internet and the stuff that came
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:55,872	| IOT082 |	Before
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:56,384	| IOT082 |	Legal terms
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:35:00,992	| IOT082 |	Is if we think about everything that came before it was always associated with an entity
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:06,368	| IOT082 |	You think about PCS or laptops or tablets is being tied to a human
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:09,696	| IOT082 |	We think about servers has been tied to some business venture
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:10,208	| IOT082 |	Oregon
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:11,744	| IOT082 |	Rupert coalition
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:13,792	| IOT082 |	And all the sudden you have these
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:16,864	| IOT082 |	People die they put on the internet and they abandon them
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:21,472	| IOT082 |	And they're really not part of a network Fabric and not a mess
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:25,824	| IOT082 |	It's not like your fitness trackers we have 85 things monitoring your health that are talking
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:30,688	| IOT082 |	We have these devices to just get plugged in and put on the internet
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:36,576	| IOT082 |	Really associated with the person that bought them maybe it's the network video recorder at your local convenience
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:37,344	| IOT082 |	Store
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:41,184	| IOT082 |	Maybe this is your home router that you buy a new drop-in
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:44,512	| IOT082 |	It's doing traffic all the time that has nothing to do
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:46,816	| IOT082 |	If it's human there's no human sort of behind it
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:49,376	| IOT082 |	And for me that's where we've does become
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:50,400	| IOT082 |	Mustang on the internet
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:53,216	| IOT082 |	I guess I had to make a hypothesis
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:56,032	| IOT082 |	For where Internet of Things takes over
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:57,824	| IOT082 |	Is this really where those become
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:36:00,128	| IOT082 |	Part of something greater than themselves
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:02,944	| IOT082 |	Turn objects the truly is Network
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:05,248	| IOT082 |	Not just in the TCP IP centos
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:07,296	| IOT082 |	Who was in the day of an application there as well
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:11,136	| IOT082 |	I like to see I was making a division based on
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:11,904	| IOT082 |	Things that were
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:15,232	| IOT082 |	Modern design to be updated over the air
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:19,328	| IOT082 |	As opposed to like older stuff that they're like oh that's connect this
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:21,632	| IOT082 |	And it's kind of directly connected to the internet
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:22,656	| IOT082 |	Maybe just go through a cloud
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:24,192	| IOT082 |	I like yours better
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:26,752	| IOT082 |	I think the reason that's an important
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:33,152	| IOT082 |	Extinction is not just about modern versus Legacy we are still seeing devices put on the internet
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:34,688	| IOT082 |	It look more like things
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:36,224	| IOT082 |	Just don't have this
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:40,064	| IOT082 |	Over-the-air updates is over the updates are updates is really hard
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:42,368	| IOT082 |	What makes these old devices
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:44,416	| IOT082 |	Sister just sitting out there and attach to any
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:45,696	| IOT082 |	So
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:46,976	| IOT082 |	Problematic
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:49,024	| IOT082 |	I think what makes some problematic kits
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:52,864	| IOT082 |	So first of all is the fact of their omnipresence on me
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:54,656	| IOT082 |	Network video recorder
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:56,704	| IOT082 |	You think about its functionality
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:37:01,312	| IOT082 |	Is the ferry first version of the no network capability right you plug it in
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:04,128	| IOT082 |	You plug a monitor and keyboard and a mouse into it
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:05,920	| IOT082 |	And so you could look through all of your camera
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:12,064	| IOT082 |	Let's put this in the back room and we've got all these monitors everywhere
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:14,368	| IOT082 |	Searching for the web server on it
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:17,696	| IOT082 |	But it wasn't designed to be over the internet web server
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:21,536	| IOT082 |	MSA designed to be an amusing very liberal
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:24,864	| IOT082 |	I use of the word design apologizing software architect
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:27,936	| IOT082 |	It was really sort of Cobble together in many cases
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:32,800	| IOT082 |	He space and now it's there
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:35,616	| IOT082 |	Cassidy that just shows up
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:37,664	| IOT082 |	It is a fully functioning Linux server
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:39,712	| IOT082 |	You can login
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:41,248	| IOT082 |	You can do whatever you want
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:42,016	| IOT082 |	General purpose
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:43,296	| IOT082 |	Computer
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:46,624	| IOT082 |	No longer sort of very specific Hardware design.
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:47,136	| IOT082 |	Only do one thing
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:49,440	| IOT082 |	And that's where it starts to become a problem
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:52,256	| IOT082 |	Got it to send you have this massive
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:55,328	| IOT082 |	Capability that's no one no one is really paying attention to the
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:56,096	| IOT082 |	The to be harnessed for
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:57,632	| IOT082 |	All kinds of Shanaynay
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:01,472	| IOT082 |	Yeah as long as the cameras are still operating like
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:04,032	| IOT082 |	When a convenience store is going to notice
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:08,128	| IOT082 |	Well that brings me to my next question which is if I'm a consumer
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:09,408	| IOT082 |	How would I ever know if
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:09,920	| IOT082 |	Is my devices
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:15,296	| IOT082 |	Saudi really hard it's in that category of difficulty that moves
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:21,440	| IOT082 |	Small businesses and even medium businesses don't even look at whether or not their bandwidth is being used
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:22,720	| IOT082 |	To do
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:24,256	| IOT082 |	You have to do the monitoring
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:26,304	| IOT082 |	If I hold out of Hope
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:28,608	| IOT082 |	Why I'm fantastic
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:32,960	| IOT082 |	Wonderful idea if anybody wants to execute on it can totally take the switches
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:34,496	| IOT082 |	Parental controls
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:40,128	| IOT082 |	The monitoring software and Hardware that people to play for parental controls whether it's
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:43,200	| IOT082 |	Your Disney Circle or web nanny or any of these
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:47,296	| IOT082 |	Why does the opportunity to think of these devices as children
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:51,648	| IOT082 |	Adults and the way they use the internet changes
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:55,488	| IOT082 |	If I put a network video recorder in my home
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:39:01,888	| IOT082 |	It seems like the sort of thing that a small device that used to profile in traffic and preventing unauthorized uses
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:05,728	| IOT082 |	Would be wonderful and ensuring that I'm not participating in one of these.
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:09,824	| IOT082 |	Okay so I everyone should have some sort of software
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:11,104	| IOT082 |	It would be on their router that would
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:18,016	| IOT082 |	Possibly on your router's possibly as a home device I'm I got to order it circle from Disney
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:21,088	| IOT082 |	Cuz I got some Ayo to my house I'd love to filter out
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:22,112	| IOT082 |	There you go
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:23,392	| IOT082 |	Okay
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:26,208	| IOT082 |	So you wouldn't know accept it
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:26,720	| IOT082 |	Is being used
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:28,512	| IOT082 |	What can you do if
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:29,792	| IOT082 |	You do have one of these
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:32,096	| IOT082 |	Set it afire
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:35,168	| IOT082 |	Sadly that might be the best
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:36,192	| IOT082 |	Quotes for a couple of days
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:39,008	| IOT082 |	Do some of these devices that actually
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:41,568	| IOT082 |	Have hard-coded into their software the password
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:44,384	| IOT082 |	So it's not even as I can tell you to go in
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:46,176	| IOT082 |	And change the default password
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:53,344	| IOT082 |	Right and that means that it's written in the code the consumer can't change it it's just
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:55,136	| IOT082 |	A remnant of something
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:39:56,416	| IOT082 |	Can I say lazy
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:03,072	| IOT082 |	I don't like attributing malice or incompetence
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:06,656	| IOT082 |	The people put the user authentication is really hard to do right
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:12,032	| IOT082 |	And so once you start down the path of a will how would I do user authentication in this world
EDL	00:40:12,032	00:40:15,872	| IOT082 |	Your building these devices here and going to business to your Kickstarter
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:19,200	| IOT082 |	Are you going to ship devices out to all these people
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:20,480	| IOT082 |	As soon as you say
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:22,784	| IOT082 |	You don't want to have a default password
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:26,112	| IOT082 |	What's the initial password on this device
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:27,904	| IOT082 |	What are user opens up the box
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:28,928	| IOT082 |	What is barracks
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:29,696	| IOT082 |	Experience
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:31,232	| IOT082 |	Now you could build something
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:33,536	| IOT082 |	This says okay well it has to do autotune
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:36,608	| IOT082 |	Discovery Inn connect
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:37,120	| IOT082 |	Password
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:41,728	| IOT082 |	Like it
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:44,288	| IOT082 |	Impossible
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:46,592	| IOT082 |	Right password management software
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:48,896	| IOT082 |	Android user experience only friendly
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:53,248	| IOT082 |	That's really what the Internet of Things is about
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:58,112	| IOT082 |	Surrounding yourself with the internet in ways that makes your life better not worse
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:00,672	| IOT082 |	Soda biscuits
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:04,512	| IOT082 |	Sin 2 - what should I look for in the devices that I buy
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:05,792	| IOT082 |	Basically
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:07,840	| IOT082 |	There's no sticker in the box that says
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:09,376	| IOT082 |	Hard-coded password
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:11,168	| IOT082 |	Where
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:12,448	| IOT082 |	So
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:13,984	| IOT082 |	What are the types of
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:15,008	| IOT082 |	Questions I should
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:16,288	| IOT082 |	To be asking even a
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:17,568	| IOT082 |	Honestly even as a reporter when I'm
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:19,360	| IOT082 |	How do I curl them
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:23,200	| IOT082 |	Tyson question number 0
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:23,968	| IOT082 |	Is
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:25,248	| IOT082 |	Is this a server
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:29,088	| IOT082 |	Activate very different set of problems if you have a device that is only a client
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:31,648	| IOT082 |	It makes connections out
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:33,952	| IOT082 |	It does pulling together data
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:40,096	| IOT082 |	Did you have if you have a machine that is running a TCP server that people could fit with connect to
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:44,448	| IOT082 |	DP server into problems is where you are a service
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:46,752	| IOT082 |	Do people can interact with because that interact
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:49,824	| IOT082 |	If the only way you can interact
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:51,104	| IOT082 |	Uconnect out
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:52,640	| IOT082 |	I'm not saying you're perfect
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:55,711	| IOT082 |	Solve a lot of challenges you have how do you authenticate
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:57,503	| IOT082 |	Who you talk to their legitimate
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:59,295	| IOT082 |	But that would be the first Quest
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:00,575	| IOT082 |	Used to figure out
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:01,599	| IOT082 |	Is the server
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:04,415	| IOT082 |	And if it's a server did it really need to be
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:05,439	| IOT082 |	Okay so
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:06,719	| IOT082 |	A popular name
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:10,303	| IOT082 |	Device that people think of is a server is a nest thermostat
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:11,583	| IOT082 |	Does that meet your criteria
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:14,911	| IOT082 |	So I don't know how this did the implementation
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:18,751	| IOT082 |	The Google has a okay home I believe it is
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:21,055	| IOT082 |	Other devices
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:25,407	| IOT082 |	But I don't believe the original Nets needed to be a server I did sits here
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:28,223	| IOT082 |	It monitors your temperature it makes a call out
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:28,991	| IOT082 |	And it does stuff
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:32,831	| IOT082 |	Okay but do you run a web server that you talk to
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:36,415	| IOT082 |	From your phone didn't you
EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:37,183	| IOT082 |	Your phone
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:40,255	| IOT082 |	No but did you talk directly to it or did you talk to nest
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:47,167	| IOT082 |	It was a client your phone with a client they're both talking to a server somewhere else
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:51,007	| IOT082 |	Such a different problem right that's it but it's not
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:54,079	| IOT082 |	This case where an adversary can login directly to your nest
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:55,359	| IOT082 |	Start sending out packages
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:56,127	| IOT082 |	Necessarily
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:58,687	| IOT082 |	Necessarily
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:04,063	| IOT082 |	Okay and I think architecture Lee
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:06,367	| IOT082 |	What are the things I've been hearing is that
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:07,903	| IOT082 |	Having a device that has a
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:08,927	| IOT082 |	Cloud interface so
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:10,719	| IOT082 |	Utah to
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:11,487	| IOT082 |	The cloud
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:13,279	| IOT082 |	It talks to the cloud weibo
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:14,047	| IOT082 |	There's cloud
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:16,095	| IOT082 |	Nothing is directly
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:17,375	| IOT082 |	Connecting out to the intern
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,655	| IOT082 |	Annette in that feels like
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:20,191	| IOT082 |	Probably a good way to go
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:20,959	| IOT082 |	Bradley
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:21,471	| IOT082 |	Devices
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:23,007	| IOT082 |	That's it
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:29,151	| IOT082 |	Great way to go to for this problem now on the flipside that means that if the vendor goes out of business your device stops
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:33,247	| IOT082 |	Alright so then what do I do
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:40,159	| IOT082 |	Except bricks in exchange for security
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,439	| IOT082 |	Doctor from within your home
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:43,743	| IOT082 |	Oh wait but we just said that's a bad idea
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:46,047	| IOT082 |	Butcher Trading
EDL	00:43:46,047	00:43:47,839	| IOT082 |	30 goal against security goal
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:54,495	| IOT082 |	So one is you want to have availability in the event of a failure or business model change on the part of your
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:56,799	| IOT082 |	The other is
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:58,335	| IOT082 |	Do you want to be a public health
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:00,895	| IOT082 |	Cash
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:02,431	| IOT082 |	So excited
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:04,479	| IOT082 |	So there is no middle ground
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:06,015	| IOT082 |	Can we put a hub in and have that
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:09,855	| IOT082 |	Be the brains of the operation at just the server in the hub
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:11,391	| IOT082 |	I could talk to the cloud but then there's local stuff
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:12,671	| IOT082 |	Never goes out
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:13,951	| IOT082 |	Isn't that what
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:16,767	| IOT082 |	Your Apple homekit and Google with onhub
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:23,167	| IOT082 |	And perhaps ultimately Amazon with Alexa are aiming at used to be that central point of contact within
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:26,239	| IOT082 |	It would broker these interactions for you
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:28,031	| IOT082 |	I believe it
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:28,543	| IOT082 |	Okay
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:32,127	| IOT082 |	So that's how I should be thinking of my
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:34,431	| IOT082 |	My new secure architecture that is also convenia
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:37,503	| IOT082 |	Got it so like what happens now
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:40,831	| IOT082 |	The I believe one of the vendors
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:44,671	| IOT082 |	Actually just did a recall of all of their devices it was a Chinese IP
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:47,999	| IOT082 |	Butcher its name
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:49,791	| IOT082 |	Hong's uchiyama
EDL	00:44:50,559	00:44:52,095	| IOT082 |	Technology
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:53,375	| IOT082 |	I gotcha by I feel like that's
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:54,399	| IOT082 |	Enough
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:56,191	| IOT082 |	So these guys did a voluntary
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:59,007	| IOT082 |	Should we be looking for more of that s***
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:45:00,799	| IOT082 |	Government get involved in
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:02,847	| IOT082 |	Bad actors get
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:07,711	| IOT082 |	They have a recall well it's going to be interesting to look into what is the effect of the voluntary recall
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:10,783	| IOT082 |	Because remember these two devices that mostly
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:12,319	| IOT082 |	Purchase
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:13,599	| IOT082 |	Deployed in a band
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:17,183	| IOT082 |	Oh my goodness mine is one of those
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:19,743	| IOT082 |	I want to participate interesting to look at
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:23,839	| IOT082 |	Details of the recall are they give you your money back
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:24,863	| IOT082 |	Acquire a new one
EDL	00:45:24,863	00:45:25,887	| IOT082 |	What are they actually going to do
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:29,215	| IOT082 |	That's yo question number one that's always been
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:31,263	| IOT082 |	Will it be in business
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:33,567	| IOT082 |	Or will they show up as a different company neck
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:35,359	| IOT082 |	Weed selling a slightly different product
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:36,895	| IOT082 |	Skeptical
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:41,759	| IOT082 |	The Challenger and regulations going to be the global problem
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:48,159	| IOT082 |	The Chinese manufacturer I want to blame all Chinese manufacturing buses run with this one for a moment
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:50,207	| IOT082 |	Let's imagine the US how to login
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:51,231	| IOT082 |	Something
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:55,071	| IOT082 |	That we believe that actually work for what was that loud really did what it is
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:45:59,167	| IOT082 |	Stop this botnet from being accessible to be groomed
EDL	00:45:59,167	00:45:59,935	| IOT082 |	Absolutely not
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:03,007	| IOT082 |	Most of the Bots aren't even in the Uso
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:06,335	| IOT082 |	It makes these devices not available in the US
EDL	00:46:06,335	00:46:11,455	| IOT082 |	What you'd also do is you would inhibit the production of a lot of devices by us company
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:18,111	| IOT082 |	Think about how many objects on Kickstarter would be affected by regulation here and would that have a net good
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:20,159	| IOT082 |	Negative for us
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:27,071	| IOT082 |	That's true and this particular company actually does
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:30,143	| IOT082 |	Software and other connected
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:35,007	| IOT082 |	We haven't even gotten into the fact that a lot of connected devices
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:38,079	| IOT082 |	Have a supply chain that is just really opaque
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:42,943	| IOT082 |	Very opaque and let's be honest
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:43,967	| IOT082 |	Ravens today
EDL	00:46:43,967	00:46:50,367	| IOT082 |	You probably only care about three things you care about the resolution of the attached cameras you care about that how much disk
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:52,671	| IOT082 |	You have and whether you could expand that externally
EDL	00:46:52,671	00:46:53,695	| IOT082 |	Can you care about the price
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:57,279	| IOT082 |	If you ever use one there they're all horribly on YouTube
EDL	00:46:57,791	00:47:03,423	| IOT082 |	Like the interfaces are not the most graceful and beautiful things because that's not what people are paying for
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:05,727	| IOT082 |	Give me a video feed
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:07,775	| IOT082 |	Make it as good as I can get at the Dollar Tree
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:09,055	| IOT082 |	That is true
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:13,151	| IOT082 |	Alright so we have to change some things the industry has to change some things in
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:14,943	| IOT082 |	People shouldn't be surprised sensitive
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:15,455	| IOT082 |	I don't know
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:22,623	| IOT082 |	This is one of those tricky problems where we have externalities in the system oh my goodness anytime you see
EDL	00:47:22,623	00:47:26,207	| IOT082 |	Systemic flies look for the externality the
EDL	00:47:26,207	00:47:27,743	| IOT082 |	Acquirers
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:29,535	| IOT082 |	The companies that make these
EDL	00:47:29,535	00:47:33,119	| IOT082 |	The Network's at their hosted on are not the ones that feel the pain
EDL	00:47:33,631	00:47:35,167	| IOT082 |	But they're the ones who make all the financial
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:37,727	| IOT082 |	People feel the pain
EDL	00:47:37,727	00:47:38,495	| IOT082 |	Are the targets
EDL	00:47:39,007	00:47:40,543	| IOT082 |	They're hosting Networks
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:41,311	| IOT082 |	And their fender
EDL	00:47:41,823	00:47:43,359	| IOT082 |	So we have this yoke
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:45,663	| IOT082 |	Beautiful dichotomy where
EDL	00:47:45,663	00:47:46,943	| IOT082 |	Do all of the
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:49,759	| IOT082 |	Initial costs are born by one group
EDL	00:47:50,271	00:47:53,343	| IOT082 |	But the secondary costs are completely born by the second group
EDL	00:47:54,623	00:47:58,975	| IOT082 |	We know from The Economist if we believe they know what they're talking about
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:48:04,607	| IOT082 |	Is it that leads to externalities were the first people act to minimize their cost of maximize the cost on others
EDL	00:48:05,375	00:48:06,143	| IOT082 |	Right so
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:07,423	| IOT082 |	Given this
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:10,495	| IOT082 |	Andy do you have a solution for us
EDL	00:48:10,495	00:48:12,799	| IOT082 |	Do you have any sort of recommendations on
EDL	00:48:13,311	00:48:14,591	| IOT082 |	How we can kind of make
EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:17,919	| IOT082 |	Iot more secure cuz right now people are looking at this and going
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:20,479	| IOT082 |	Holy cow I want none of this crap in my
EDL	00:48:21,247	00:48:22,015	| IOT082 |	Or
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:24,575	| IOT082 |	Holy cow this stuff is terribly dangerous let's regulate the heck out of
EDL	00:48:26,367	00:48:29,183	| IOT082 |	First reaction might be slightly better than the second react
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:34,559	| IOT082 |	Which is the user saying I don't want to be part of that that's imrie internalizing
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:37,119	| IOT082 |	The externality and that's a Market Force
EDL	00:48:37,887	00:48:41,727	| IOT082 |	So maybe we will see people shift until I want to go to this Hub mode
EDL	00:48:41,727	00:48:45,055	| IOT082 |	And maybe this house mode will also protect you against devices doesn't
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:47,871	| IOT082 |	Like I said there's a market there
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:50,687	| IOT082 |	For parental control devices for your robots
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:55,295	| IOT082 |	So that's my that's what I'm holding out for the other thing I'm holding out for is
EDL	00:48:55,295	00:48:57,087	| IOT082 |	This is not something that is new
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:48:58,367	| IOT082 |	Even though it feels
EDL	00:48:58,879	00:49:00,927	| IOT082 |	Do we see harbingers like this
EDL	00:49:01,439	00:49:07,839	| IOT082 |	Every few years on the internet bill when we discovered all the empaths WordPress in Joomla site Severus like oh my goodness
EDL	00:49:07,839	00:49:09,119	| IOT082 |	Anybody survive that
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:11,935	| IOT082 |	The answer is not only did we survive those attacks
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:14,495	| IOT082 |	But by today's standards dos attack
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:15,263	| IOT082 |	Arbutus
EDL	00:49:15,775	00:49:18,079	| IOT082 |	Because the internet has grown so much
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:19,359	| IOT082 |	Defensive Brown
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:21,663	| IOT082 |	It's at the internet has grown so much
EDL	00:49:22,175	00:49:23,967	| IOT082 |	This is such a small
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:25,759	| IOT082 |	Percentage of the traffic now
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:30,879	| IOT082 |	This those when it's a big percentage of traffic it's noticeable
EDL	00:49:31,391	00:49:37,023	| IOT082 |	But my expectation and belief is that the internet will continue to grow
EDL	00:49:37,023	00:49:41,631	| IOT082 |	Will deliver you a larger and larger videos and more and more people that's capacity
EDL	00:49:42,143	00:49:46,495	| IOT082 |	It is important to be there for us to be able to handle denial-of-service attacks since well
EDL	00:49:46,495	00:49:48,287	| IOT082 |	But doesn't that capacity
EDL	00:49:48,287	00:49:50,591	| IOT082 |	Increase also increase
EDL	00:49:50,591	00:49:51,359	| IOT082 |	Pain
EDL	00:49:51,359	00:49:52,639	| IOT082 |	Power of a denial-of-service
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:53,663	| IOT082 |	What is a tax because as
EDL	00:49:54,175	00:49:58,015	| IOT082 |	As you're pumping out more internet content at higher resolutions
EDL	00:49:58,015	00:50:03,135	| IOT082 |	I is a consumer in tempted to upgrade my Broadband which gives them more bandwidth to
EDL	00:50:03,135	00:50:05,439	| IOT082 |	Intern point
EDL	00:50:05,951	00:50:09,023	| IOT082 |	It's I believe that you are the tax from the network video recorder
EDL	00:50:09,023	00:50:13,631	| IOT082 |	Well within a few years we'll tell why were we worried about care of it for second attack
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:15,935	| IOT082 |	Now we're worried about
EDL	00:50:16,703	00:50:22,847	| IOT082 |	But that'll be a world in which we talked about your pet a bit scale networks that are delivering huge volumes of traffic
EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:24,895	| IOT082 |	Awesome I hope you guys
EDL	00:50:24,895	00:50:25,663	| IOT082 |	Can keep growing the network
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:30,527	| IOT082 |	I keep up with these attacks all right Andy thank you so much for coming on this week
