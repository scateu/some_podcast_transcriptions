EDL	00:00:18,432	00:00:18,944	| IOT062 |	This week
EDL	00:00:19,456	00:00:20,480	| IOT062 |	Actually was late last week
EDL	00:00:23,040	00:00:25,856	| IOT062 |	Shop to its very core by the departure of
EDL	00:00:26,624	00:00:27,136	| IOT062 |	Girlfriend
EDL	00:00:27,648	00:00:29,952	| IOT062 |	He didn't the part he was set to away mode
EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:33,024	| IOT062 |	I screwed up Kevin
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:34,560	| IOT062 |	Bathtub
EDL	00:00:36,096	00:00:39,424	| IOT062 |	Yep Tony's gone stepping down
EDL	00:00:39,424	00:00:40,448	| IOT062 |	Stepping away
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:43,008	| IOT062 |	Apparently is invested in like a hundred small startups
EDL	00:00:43,008	00:00:44,288	| IOT062 |	The Pacifier 2
EDL	00:00:44,288	00:00:45,824	| IOT062 |	Including a go-kart company
EDL	00:00:45,824	00:00:46,848	| IOT062 |	Which
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:49,152	| IOT062 |	There's a lot to talk
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:49,664	| IOT062 |	There's a lot
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:53,504	| IOT062 |	First of all he's leaving after a bunch of
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:54,272	| IOT062 |	Bad press
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:55,040	| IOT062 |	Next
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:55,808	| IOT062 |	But
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:00:59,136	| IOT062 |	The Verge actually did a story I'm going to say it was Tuesday
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:00,416	| IOT062 |	Tell you about how
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:02,208	| IOT062 |	Fidel head actually told
EDL	00:01:02,208	00:01:02,976	| IOT062 |	Google
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:04,512	| IOT062 |	Larry that
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:05,792	| IOT062 |	He was leaving in
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:07,584	| IOT062 |	December
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:11,424	| IOT062 |	And wanted to transition out so he was kind of unhappy because it sounds like
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:14,752	| IOT062 |	When Google became alphabet
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:15,776	| IOT062 |	He suddenly got
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:17,312	| IOT062 |	Different marching orders
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:21,920	| IOT062 |	A little more accountability from a financial standpoint
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:22,944	| IOT062 |	Getting things done
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:24,224	| IOT062 |	Kingston Market
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:24,992	| IOT062 |	Less vision
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:26,528	| IOT062 |	Model the product
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:27,040	| IOT062 |	Selling
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:32,928	| IOT062 |	Let me ask you if you have a problem with that I mean you're looking at a company paid over three billion dollars for nest
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:34,720	| IOT062 |	I don't have
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:37,792	| IOT062 |	Have a problem with it I can see why I would have a problem with you
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:39,840	| IOT062 |	I mean especially if he was promised
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:43,424	| IOT062 |	He wouldn't taking it was going to be a YouTube style investment for
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:45,472	| IOT062 |	Google where they give you to
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:46,752	| IOT062 |	Like a decade
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:47,520	| IOT062 |	To get profitable
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:53,920	| IOT062 |	So if you're thinking along those lines than yes it has always been
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:56,480	| IOT062 |	Super long term I mean the man pushed a new protocol
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:59,040	| IOT062 |	That's that's not a short-term that right there
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:00,064	| IOT062 |	Right right
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:01,088	| IOT062 |	But but
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:04,160	| IOT062 |	Me play devil's advocate here I'll save from
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,952	| IOT062 |	Alphabets perspective sentence
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:09,536	| IOT062 |	I'm just giving my perspective on what they would think they spend a lot of money
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,048	| IOT062 |	And
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:13,120	| IOT062 |	How many new products really came out in what
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:14,400	| IOT062 |	3 years
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,168	| IOT062 |	Mastro's owned
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:18,240	| IOT062 |	There's nothing
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,056	| IOT062 |	I mean
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:25,664	| IOT062 |	Pipeline to The Nest Thermostat
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:27,456	| IOT062 |	Not really
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:31,808	| IOT062 |	I get it and also you know.
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:34,880	| IOT062 |	Google actually was in talks to purchase Dropcam
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:35,648	| IOT062 |	Like
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:38,208	| IOT062 |	They brought that deal in in May
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:40,768	| IOT062 |	A part of Nest Tony was not like searching around for the
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:44,352	| IOT062 |	Right that we know there was some some angst
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:47,424	| IOT062 |	There between the Dropcam folks and then ask folks based on reports of
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:56,896	| IOT062 |	Response to Tony fadell calling the
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:03,040	| IOT062 |	The real deal
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:05,344	| IOT062 |	So that being said there's a
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:06,112	| IOT062 |	Couple things to do
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:06,880	| IOT062 |	Think about here
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:07,648	| IOT062 |	1
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:10,464	| IOT062 |	Is the new CEO Marwan fawaz
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:15,072	| IOT062 |	Is a former CTO at several big cable companies
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:15,840	| IOT062 |	And
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,888	| IOT062 |	I believe it was Adelphia
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,168	| IOT062 |	And
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:20,960	| IOT062 |	Charter over there
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:25,312	| IOT062 |	This is a man who a has a lot of
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,848	| IOT062 |	Experience in the
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:30,176	| IOT062 |	Service provider industry which I think is actually a really interesting
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:33,248	| IOT062 |	Space for the smart home right now
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:37,344	| IOT062 |	And he also was a VP at Motorola Mobility
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,904	| IOT062 |	Managing their Motorola home business
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:43,744	| IOT062 |	The man knows how to hopefully build Hardware
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,536	| IOT062 |	Support it
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,304	| IOT062 |	And sell it
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,840	| IOT062 |	Which actually if your
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:51,936	| IOT062 |	Cheer consumer who wants to buy this product this may not be the worst thing for you
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:52,960	| IOT062 |	Agreed
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:56,288	| IOT062 |	The great I mean he's got the right background
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:04:00,384	| IOT062 |	You know I can't say I know of his accomplishments at those companies and whatnot but
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:02,688	| IOT062 |	Kiss My Bass credential Sandpoint
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:06,528	| IOT062 |	You know that's exactly what you would want everything in a nest group
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:10,368	| IOT062 |	Yeah it was actually the technical Advisory Board of ATT
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:14,208	| IOT062 |	Around the time that ATT was getting super involved in the Smart Hub
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:15,488	| IOT062 |	Come to
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,768	| IOT062 |	So I feel like
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,280	| IOT062 |	Alphabet
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:22,143	| IOT062 |	Is telling us something very clear here which is Tony fanelle's vision for the Smart Home
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:22,655	| IOT062 |	May have been
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:25,215	| IOT062 |	Where's the 3.2 billion dollars
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,007	| IOT062 |	But it's not playing out fast enough
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:29,823	| IOT062 |	Screw division
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,639	| IOT062 |	Let's just go with making a quality product
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,407	| IOT062 |	And
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:33,919	| IOT062 |	Get it out in the park
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,455	| IOT062 |	Ripe
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:37,247	| IOT062 |	Tri-tip as a nest owner
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:39,551	| IOT062 |	I mean I'm not concerned by what's going on are you
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,855	| IOT062 |	No no I'm actually a little heart
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,647	| IOT062 |	Now I will say
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,951	| IOT062 |	As someone who loves the industry
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:47,999	| IOT062 |	Fidel was
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:53,119	| IOT062 |	It's Magic here so we had a sense of how we
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,399	| IOT062 |	Get there from
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:54,911	| IOT062 |	Tactical perspective
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:59,007	| IOT062 |	I can't
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:04,639	| IOT062 |	You know it is kind of a loss to say
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:06,943	| IOT062 |	Dang it now we don't have this person I mean
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:09,759	| IOT062 |	Cuz it was an open but the worst with Nest program
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,295	| IOT062 |	Wasn't awesome
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:12,575	| IOT062 |	Way
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:15,647	| IOT062 |	To get people to buy into the smart home without actually
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,671	| IOT062 |	Freaking programming stuff
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:19,743	| IOT062 |	But here's the other thing I want to talk about cuz
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:22,047	| IOT062 |	ARS Technica wrote a story speculating that
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:23,583	| IOT062 |	Alphabet to put nest
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:27,167	| IOT062 |	I don't believe that Nest is up for sale
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:28,447	| IOT062 |	Was pure speculation on there
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:29,215	| IOT062 |	Park
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:30,751	| IOT062 |	The story is a great overview.
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,775	| IOT062 |	Forecast
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:34,335	| IOT062 |	But I was thinking about what is the value
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,383	| IOT062 |	Apple connected home
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:37,919	| IOT062 |	Today
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:41,247	| IOT062 |	Because you've got a device and there's not a subscription Revenue
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,807	| IOT062 |	So what you would be buying is
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:45,855	| IOT062 |	The device the Goodwill that sort of thing
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:50,463	| IOT062 |	But you also are buying the promise that you're going to support that device forever
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:50,975	| IOT062 |	Right
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:56,607	| IOT062 |	I just kind of started thinking about me and is that really a great model to
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:59,935	| IOT062 |	How should we start thinking about these companies that are actually successful
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:04,543	| IOT062 |	SmartThings for example sold to Samsung for 200 billion which is
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,847	| IOT062 |	A considerably smaller sum than 3.2
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:11,455	| IOT062 |	Yeah cuz you said there's no subscription model that could change that
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:14,271	| IOT062 |	Could Implement something but they have to provide more value than what
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,295	| IOT062 |	What's provided today
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:19,391	| IOT062 |	Obviously I think to a Google and alphabet or any other company in this with us
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:22,975	| IOT062 |	Getting the data is very important
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,487	| IOT062 |	Get that data
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,791	| IOT062 |	Nest keeps their data separate
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:26,303	| IOT062 |	From Google
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,119	| IOT062 |	And that's been
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,143	| IOT062 |	Promised forever
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:31,935	| IOT062 |	So maybe that'll change
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:32,703	| IOT062 |	Tony was really
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:33,983	| IOT062 |	Component of fat that would be
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,823	| IOT062 |	Keep an eye on rtos
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,175	| IOT062 |	Pandora.
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:43,711	| IOT062 |	Why shouldn't we all should
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:45,247	| IOT062 |	And you
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,039	| IOT062 |	Arbolino new home
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:49,087	| IOT062 |	So soon
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,111	| IOT062 |	Cool stuff that you're having to
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:50,879	| IOT062 |	Do deer like
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,183	| IOT062 |	Yeah that's
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:56,767	| IOT062 |	Will I be two or three weeks we can talk about that cuz that's what we make the move
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:01,887	| IOT062 |	But a none totally unrelated to the Tony fadell brouhaha
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,167	| IOT062 |	We're actually
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:05,471	| IOT062 |	Not buying a nest for the new home
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:06,495	| IOT062 |	I decided
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:10,079	| IOT062 |	Even before this news came out I decided in already ordered an ecobee
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:12,895	| IOT062 |	Because for the same price I seen a little less on Amazon
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:14,943	| IOT062 |	I'm getting a remote sensor and
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:16,991	| IOT062 |	We purchase a townhouse with
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:23,391	| IOT062 |	Multiple levels in my office will be on the second level thermostat up in the first level just like my current house and I'm tired
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:24,159	| IOT062 |	Being hot
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:26,719	| IOT062 |	In my office when nobody's home and
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,255	| IOT062 |	My thermostat doesn't realize nobody talk
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:35,167	| IOT062 |	So the remote sensor will go in my office and I can always add more sensors I think they're two packs are like 80 bucks
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:38,239	| IOT062 |	Does reasonable soft works with my wink Hub works with
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,263	| IOT062 |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:40,543	| IOT062 |	So
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,823	| IOT062 |	Apple unconcerned it
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,615	| IOT062 |	It's just a better product for my knees
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:47,199	| IOT062 |	Has been my favorite
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,991	| IOT062 |	Favorite thermostat for
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:55,135	| IOT062 |	A long time it's not the favorite thermistor of Wirecutter which surprised me cuz I was researching
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:55,903	| IOT062 |	The Weeknd
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,951	| IOT062 |	They actually still prefer the nest
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:00,511	| IOT062 |	But the ecobee what's the next best
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:01,791	| IOT062 |	Sorry I'm working
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:06,911	| IOT062 |	The people over at The Wirecutter and I actually had an argument with their smart home guy about that I thought your wife
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,519	| IOT062 |	No
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:14,335	| IOT062 |	Soccer. Stacy so this week
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:16,383	| IOT062 |	Because it's almost Father's Day
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:16,895	| IOT062 |	Which
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:23,551	| IOT062 |	1830 around there I don't know, Dad I should know but I don't
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,343	| IOT062 |	No no I think it's someone else's
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:25,855	| IOT062 |	The shop to remember
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,391	| IOT062 |	You don't have to do it
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:38,399	| IOT062 |	I thought we should actually run through some gift idea since we did it for the moms might as well offer some option
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| IOT062 |	For the dads
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,959	| IOT062 |	So
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,983	| IOT062 |	Throughout the
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:43,007	| IOT062 |	Logitech
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:43,775	| IOT062 |	Home Harmony
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:45,823	| IOT062 |	Dad's like
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,359	| IOT062 |	That's my guy
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:52,479	| IOT062 |	It's actually the Logitech Harmony home hub
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:55,551	| IOT062 |	And this is 99 box on Amazon
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,831	| IOT062 |	I have actually
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:59,903	| IOT062 |	Massena personal I feel like I've seen it for sale for a little bit less so
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,951	| IOT062 |	Wait on that Chopper room
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:02,463	| IOT062 |	Shop around
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:03,743	| IOT062 |	But
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,767	| IOT062 |	If you have a smartphone
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:07,327	| IOT062 |	This is just a little Hub in the thing
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:09,887	| IOT062 |	We reviewed this probably a year-and-a-half ago
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:11,935	| IOT062 |	The thing that was amazing about it is
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:14,495	| IOT062 |	Logitech is awesome at AV
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:17,055	| IOT062 |	So you can pull in all your AV stuff
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,335	| IOT062 |	Super fast
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:20,383	| IOT062 |	Adidas just like this
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,919	| IOT062 |	Oh you have this receiver
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,199	| IOT062 |	Oh I sent the Roku
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:23,967	| IOT062 |	So that was
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:30,367	| IOT062 |	Super seamless I did have a little trouble connecting a couple of my device not connecting them but just getting everything to work
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:32,415	| IOT062 |	But once I did that
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,183	| IOT062 |	It was awesome
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,743	| IOT062 |	The added bonus is
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:38,303	| IOT062 |	You can connect it to you if this then that
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:40,607	| IOT062 |	If you're so inclined and
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:43,935	| IOT062 |	If you download the yonomi software and we've actually talked about this
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,447	| IOT062 |	Before
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:46,239	| IOT062 |	You can set up like
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,519	| IOT062 |	Amazon Echo commands
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,311	| IOT062 |	For like
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,591	| IOT062 |	Netflix and chill
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,359	| IOT062 |	Which
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,151	| IOT062 |	Will like set everything up for you
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:54,431	| IOT062 |	And I think that's
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:57,759	| IOT062 |	$99 get you the home hub
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:10:02,367	| IOT062 |	They actually have introduced a zigbee and Z-Wave home automation extender for it which
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,159	| IOT062 |	I have not tried but
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:05,951	| IOT062 |	I don't know either
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:07,999	| IOT062 |	That's also
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,023	| IOT062 |	That's a hundred bucks
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:12,351	| IOT062 |	And let's see they have if you want the remote
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:13,631	| IOT062 |	Troll
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,655	| IOT062 |	To go with this
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:21,055	| IOT062 |	There's $145 package that you like a standard remote control and then there's like a
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:25,663	| IOT062 |	$260 package to get you the Hub and the touchscreen pants
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:27,199	| IOT062 |	That's nice
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,735	| IOT062 |	That we know what Kevin Gates
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,271	| IOT062 |	Daddy bikes
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:33,599	| IOT062 |	I'm throwing that out there is good idea
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:34,367	| IOT062 |	Kind of pricey
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,743	| IOT062 |	Universal remote all that stuff
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,279	| IOT062 |	Why not give him more
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:50,239	| IOT062 |	Makes sense makes sense so as a dad I lose things all the time and I know that you just had the CEO of
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,031	| IOT062 |	Macaron the podcast last week
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:56,639	| IOT062 |	But actually saw a Tracker in the wild yesterday along with the tile
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:11:00,735	| IOT062 |	I talk with somebody on my team at Google as both of them he puts the Kyle
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,783	| IOT062 |	It is Google bad she never loses that
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:07,391	| IOT062 |	And his tracker is on his key chain and I
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:09,951	| IOT062 |	Would recommend this for any that I think and I actually did
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,743	| IOT062 |	Purchase four of them
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:16,351	| IOT062 |	Once I saw his because it's like the size of a quarter I mean it's the trackers really small
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:20,959	| IOT062 |	And it also has a replaceable battery which I don't believe the tile does I'm not saying
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:25,311	| IOT062 |	You got to send it back yeah post tiles the tiles bigger so
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:31,711	| IOT062 |	I like that you can swap this out with a coin size battery you know once a year or however often you have to do it they actually do
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:33,503	| IOT062 |	Do you have a current sale
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:36,319	| IOT062 |	Protect your Father's Day buy 2 get 2 free for 60 bucks
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:41,951	| IOT062 |	Plus if you know somebody who bought trackers they have it may have a referral link to my get another one free so
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:46,047	| IOT062 |	Which I did I actually dying of getting 5 for the price of 2

EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:55,519	| IOT062 |	Probably give one each to the kids I mean
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:58,591	| IOT062 |	I think it's a handy little device and it's not that expensive
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,127	| IOT062 |	It is not how much
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:06,527	| IOT062 |	It's thirty bucks for one but again right now if you buy two get two free Super 60 bucks

EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:23,679	| IOT062 |	I tried this

EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,847	| IOT062 |	Starting December January timeframe
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:33,151	| IOT062 |	And I got to say the most complete
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:37,759	| IOT062 |	Fitness tracking solution I can find an actually still used to this day
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:41,343	| IOT062 |	Is the UA healthbox Under Armour of all places
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,391	| IOT062 |	Again not cheap but
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,159	| IOT062 |	$400
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,207	| IOT062 |	What you got is a
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:50,559	| IOT062 |	Smart wifi-connected scale that does your weight and your body fat

EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:08,479	| IOT062 |	That you can strap on and go use when you're running
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:09,759	| IOT062 |	I think that is
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:14,623	| IOT062 |	It for the $400 the app is fantastic app works on IOS and Android
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:19,743	| IOT062 |	Very holistic view of your health you can track your nutrition because you a also owns the

EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:24,863	| IOT062 |	I got $400
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:26,399	| IOT062 |	If you really want to go Hog Wild
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:30,495	| IOT062 |	And I do recommend these Under Armour does have a
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:33,055	| IOT062 |	Pair of running shoes that goes with this
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:35,615	| IOT062 |	Want to see the look a hundred 2000 $40
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,919	| IOT062 |	They have a built-in sensors
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:38,687	| IOT062 |	And Bluetooth
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,223	| IOT062 |	And you literally
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:41,247	| IOT062 |	You put these on
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,015	| IOT062 |	You don't
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,807	| IOT062 |	Turn them on writing you put them on
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:46,367	| IOT062 |	You go run and it automatically tracks
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,135	| IOT062 |	Steps
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:48,671	| IOT062 |	Distance and so on
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:50,719	| IOT062 |	And Pedro back into the system
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:54,559	| IOT062 |	And it just automatically syncs when you get back from your run you don't even
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:56,607	| IOT062 |	Do anything is a beautiful thing so
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:14:00,959	| IOT062 |	Again a little pricey but the UA healthbox is top-notch
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:02,751	| IOT062 |	If it were Mother's Day I would
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:10,943	| IOT062 |	Heart rate monitor
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:11,967	| IOT062 |	Strapped to your chest right
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:14,527	| IOT062 |	The heart rate does do it in a chest
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:16,063	| IOT062 |	IHeartRadio
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:17,855	| IOT062 |	It's not that I don't think it
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:19,647	| IOT062 |	Does a heart rate on the wrist
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:22,975	| IOT062 |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:23,743	| IOT062 |	But
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:25,023	| IOT062 |	Did you find it accurate
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,047	| IOT062 |	Because the rich ones are very
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:26,559	| IOT062 |	Free accurate if your
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:31,935	| IOT062 |	I tend to find the chest heart rate monitors to be more accurate than the
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:36,287	| IOT062 |	The LED sensor that were using on the wrist are few exceptions to that but in general
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:39,615	| IOT062 |	The heart rate monitors are pretty solid and yes I found it accurate
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,151	| IOT062 |	Cuz that's
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:43,711	| IOT062 |	Otherwise spending $400 on it
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:44,479	| IOT062 |	Not a cure
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:44,991	| IOT062 |	Heart rate monitor
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:52,927	| IOT062 |	The scale by the way works for up to at least four people so it's not even just for that I'm sorry up to eight
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:57,023	| IOT062 |	So that's a lot of people can they all stand on it at one time
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:15:01,631	| IOT062 |	Probably could but they better have small feet and it will probably break
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:05,471	| IOT062 |	Awesome so those are
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:07,775	| IOT062 |	Happy to hear others
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,567	| IOT062 |	Yes
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,079	| IOT062 |	But
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:13,151	| IOT062 |	I have a I have a husband that's going to buy for it
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,687	| IOT062 |	I don't think it's smart home Gadgets in the
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:18,527	| IOT062 |	And since he's a little skeptical of the whole Space
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:25,183	| IOT062 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:25,951	| IOT062 |	Another product
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:26,463	| IOT062 |	It doesn't quite
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:29,791	| IOT062 |	I found
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:30,303	| IOT062 |	From Dave's
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,351	| IOT062 |	Super
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:35,167	| IOT062 |	Exciting I knew you would love this
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:36,447	| IOT062 |	So
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,471	| IOT062 |	4
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:40,543	| IOT062 |	Like almost a year-and-a-half maybe even two full years
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:42,335	| IOT062 |	I have been waiting for Hugh
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:46,431	| IOT062 |	To put out BR30 switch or the can the lights that
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,967	| IOT062 |	He put in your cans if your ceiling
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,247	| IOT062 |	In white
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,295	| IOT062 |	I have wanted this forever
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:54,623	| IOT062 |	And lo and behold Dave's at 2
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:55,903	| IOT062 |	Write something lovely blog
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,975	| IOT062 |	Scarfing through the FCC
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:01,023	| IOT062 |	Applications and he found
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:04,863	| IOT062 |	Philips Hue was going to do some white BR30
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:06,911	| IOT062 |	Yep yep yep
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:09,727	| IOT062 |	There is no timing on these there is no price on it
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,519	| IOT062 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:17,919	| IOT062 |	I don't know if is the type of company like Amazon is a type of company they never filed their at stuff with the SEC unless they're about
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:18,431	| IOT062 |	Out to lunch it
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:20,479	| IOT062 |	I think
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:22,783	| IOT062 |	Philips is probably similar in that respect
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:24,831	| IOT062 |	So hopefully we'll see this very soon
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:28,671	| IOT062 |	Like there will be a party in my house
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:31,743	| IOT062 |	It will not have colored lights they will be white and it will be awesome
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,279	| IOT062 |	And they will be tunable
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,815	| IOT062 |	They will be tunable and
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:38,399	| IOT062 |	I'm hoping that they go for about $30
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:42,495	| IOT062 |	Feels like they could go to $40
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:45,823	| IOT062 |	So I'm still probably going to buy them
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:46,847	| IOT062 |	Because ice
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:49,663	| IOT062 |	Believe it or not you guys I still have light bulbs that are not smart
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,711	| IOT062 |	Although I will say
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:52,479	| IOT062 |	So this happened to me
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:56,319	| IOT062 |	My Philips Hue's that I've had in my living room
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:58,367	| IOT062 |	For like 2 + years
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,391	| IOT062 |	Disconnected itself
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:02,463	| IOT062 |	One of them just randomly disconnected itself from
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,743	| IOT062 |	The network
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:04,511	| IOT062 |	I have no idea why
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:09,119	| IOT062 |	I'm worried after my experience with the cheaper GE lights that what about
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,143	| IOT062 |	Video fail
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:13,471	| IOT062 |	Not experience
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:19,871	| IOT062 |	But when it disconnected itself I realize that a
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,919	| IOT062 |	Putting it back on
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:23,711	| IOT062 |	Philips app was actually not hard
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:25,759	| IOT062 |	But getting everything
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:26,783	| IOT062 |	Back in track
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:29,087	| IOT062 |	For the echo
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:30,623	| IOT062 |	Is that required
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:37,023	| IOT062 |	Real relearning which devices are internet where I can possibly regrouping or learning improves yeah
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:38,047	| IOT062 |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:39,583	| IOT062 |	I wish there was a better way
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:41,631	| IOT062 |	I wish we could just save those
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,143	| IOT062 |	Remember that
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:48,031	| IOT062 |	Just be aware that you know it's possible that liked
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:51,359	| IOT062 |	Two years afterwards you get some wacky things. I don't know that was kind of glitchy
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:55,711	| IOT062 |	You know some people are like this is why I don't want smart light bulbs I don't know
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:56,479	| IOT062 |	Need extra glitches in my
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:18:03,391	| IOT062 |	12 it's and it's a big investment I'm in your you have a bulb or two that the radios are shot and whatever you paid for those bulbs
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:06,207	| IOT062 |	2030 bucks a pop it adds up
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:09,791	| IOT062 |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:14,143	| IOT062 |	The other thing we should know is the lumens on these BR thirties that Phillips
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,935	| IOT062 |	Korean is about 680
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:17,471	| IOT062 |	That is not allowed
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:21,055	| IOT062 |	Excuse towards the lower light output side
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:24,383	| IOT062 |	But I'm not too worried about it because
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:28,735	| IOT062 |	I have like in my kitchen I have six of these and my kitchen is like bright is freaking
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,503	| IOT062 |	Daylight all the time
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:30,783	| IOT062 |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:33,087	| IOT062 |	So and with a tunable stuff you can always tune
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:33,599	| IOT062 |	Down I guess
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,135	| IOT062 |	Quartz countertop
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:39,999	| IOT062 |	Have a a19 has 800 lumens
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,535	| IOT062 |	Chicken testing in

EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:53,567	| IOT062 |	The connecting door lock is connected its door lock to if this then that
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,103	| IOT062 |	So if you want to start
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:57,663	| IOT062 |	Doing things like hey when I unlock my door turn on my lights
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:59,199	| IOT062 |	It's done

EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,471	| IOT062 |	Except a little siren
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,519	| IOT062 |	Your neighbors would love that
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:27,103	| IOT062 |	And then which makes welcome camera

EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:42,432	| IOT062 |	For you guys today and where your priorities
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,480	| IOT062 |	Yes
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:48,064	| IOT062 |	Today AT&T is been a true leader
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:50,624	| IOT062 |	The United States not a global stage Around The Internet of Things
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:51,904	| IOT062 |	We've been at this for
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:54,208	| IOT062 |	Actually over 8 years now
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:56,000	| IOT062 |	Where we started our first Disney
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:58,304	| IOT062 |	Amazon Kindle
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,352	| IOT062 |	Devices
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,120	| IOT062 |	We brought on
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:02,144	| IOT062 |	Interior space
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:03,680	| IOT062 |	An example of what
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,216	| IOT062 |	The new products and services
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:07,264	| IOT062 |	This might be connected at Hahnemann connect
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:10,080	| IOT062 |	Announce as a first quarter of the week
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:12,640	| IOT062 |	Are not connecting over 28 million
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,408	| IOT062 |	Devices
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:15,200	| IOT062 |	Title III AT&T Networks
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:18,272	| IOT062 |	Around the world and it's everything from
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,808	| IOT062 |	Classic cars
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:20,832	| IOT062 |	That's tianjin
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:23,136	| IOT062 |	Irrigation
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:24,672	| IOT062 |	The trash can
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:30,304	| IOT062 |	You know we we basically run the gamut across a number of different verticals
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:32,352	| IOT062 |	To make sure that we were able to really
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:36,448	| IOT062 |	Change the way businesses operating or change the consumer experience by connecting things I haven't been to
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:37,984	| IOT062 |	Okay
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:42,336	| IOT062 |	Are you guys today are in Houston to open up a Foundry which is
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,360	| IOT062 |	AT&T
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:44,640	| IOT062 |	I think it was like
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,688	| IOT062 |	Startup slash
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:47,968	| IOT062 |	Lab.
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:48,736	| IOT062 |	Kind of think about technology
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:51,552	| IOT062 |	And this one's focused on medical
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:56,416	| IOT062 |	Is this a new space for you guys or is it something where you were like you know what we just need a place to
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:56,928	| IOT062 |	The dedicated
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:24:01,024	| IOT062 |	AT&T has been creating Innovation space
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,584	| IOT062 |	A while as well
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:05,888	| IOT062 |	Foundry Networks
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:08,192	| IOT062 |	What we're doing uniquely here
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:08,960	| IOT062 |	Houston
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,728	| IOT062 |	Is opening up one
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:12,032	| IOT062 |	Pacifically around connected health
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:13,568	| IOT062 |	And we've been active in the space
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,616	| IOT062 |	Quite a while we actually is
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:16,896	| IOT062 |	Willowbrook
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:18,944	| IOT062 |	Companies in healthcare ecosystem
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:20,224	| IOT062 |	They were already doing
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:20,736	| IOT062 |	Text device
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:23,552	| IOT062 |	Your growth rate
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,648	| IOT062 |	What's with the companies were already working with
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:29,440	| IOT062 |	We think Daniel take
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:32,512	| IOT062 |	Facility in dedicated specifically to healthcare
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:33,280	| IOT062 |	Advice
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:34,560	| IOT062 |	Accelerate
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:35,840	| IOT062 |	Adoption of new technology
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:39,168	| IOT062 |	And really appreciate the way Healthcare is being delivered
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,960	| IOT062 |	Kiran Houston
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:44,800	| IOT062 |	The Texas Medical Center is largest Medical Center in the world they already had an Innovations
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:51,200	| IOT062 |	Any chance you're plugged ourselves right in the middle of that or we can deal with the startups
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:53,760	| IOT062 |	The companies that want to bring those new Solutions tomorrow
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:56,832	| IOT062 |	Okay it is just focused mostly on
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,624	| IOT062 |	The Professional
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:01,184	| IOT062 |	Health and wellness as opposed to like
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:03,744	| IOT062 |	Activity tracker
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,792	| IOT062 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:06,816	| IOT062 |	Not it actually is
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,120	| IOT062 |	We're taking
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:11,936	| IOT062 |	We're looking at really kind of four key areas
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:14,752	| IOT062 |	Some of that is actually in the home itself
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:17,568	| IOT062 |	How can we be able to connect
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:20,640	| IOT062 |	Patients and their information
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:22,432	| IOT062 |	With their Healthcare professionals
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,712	| IOT062 |	Dealer-to-dealer up
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,224	| IOT062 |	Location
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,016	| IOT062 |	Monitoring remote visits
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:30,880	| IOT062 |	We're doing work in the clinical setting about how can we make
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:32,416	| IOT062 |	Better experience
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:36,512	| IOT062 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:37,792	| IOT062 |	Nowhere
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,328	| IOT062 |	Actually all the assets are the
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:40,352	| IOT062 |	You need to be
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:41,632	| IOT062 |	Patient
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:45,216	| IOT062 |	Working a lot around mobile caregiving as well as those
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:46,240	| IOT062 |	Yes we can take this
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:49,568	| IOT062 |	Not just her Urban but even then trolls marketplaces
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:52,640	| IOT062 |	And then there's another final Focus
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:55,456	| IOT062 |	It's really about what all kind of call the connected Hospital itself
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:57,504	| IOT062 |	About you're really looking at
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:58,784	| IOT062 |	What are the operations
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:00,320	| IOT062 |	Ava Hospital
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:02,368	| IOT062 |	And all the things that need to move
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:05,440	| IOT062 |	Coming into the hospital leaving hospital as well as
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:07,232	| IOT062 |	Fuel mixture
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,280	| IOT062 |	Running as efficiently in a text
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,864	| IOT062 |	And how does AT&T
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:14,144	| IOT062 |	Think about its role here
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:14,912	| IOT062 |	Because
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:17,984	| IOT062 |	SIM card in this
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:22,336	| IOT062 |	Let's go to hospital blood pressure monitor inside the hospital
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:23,872	| IOT062 |	And
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:28,992	| IOT062 |	How do you guys see your role because it feels like
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:31,040	| IOT062 |	With The Foundry efforts you must be
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:33,856	| IOT062 |	Taking on a much deeper role and I'm curious
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:37,440	| IOT062 |	What that role is and then what have you learned from
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:39,744	| IOT062 |	Like your previous foundries that you hope to apply here
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:46,656	| IOT062 |	Yeah really for AT&T perspective we want to enable
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:49,216	| IOT062 |	Activity into any solution
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,008	| IOT062 |	Beginning
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:51,776	| IOT062 |	Start of it
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:54,336	| IOT062 |	We also take a multi Network approach so that
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:55,872	| IOT062 |	You might be able to use
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:59,456	| IOT062 |	Biotechnology to put that in but you might
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:00,480	| IOT062 |	2002 use
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:02,016	| IOT062 |	Some other types of Technology
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:03,808	| IOT062 |	Within
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,856	| IOT062 |	I was in the hospital
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:07,904	| IOT062 |	Free Wi-Fi
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,952	| IOT062 |	So you can be wired to assets
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:11,488	| IOT062 |	An attacker just made an announcement
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,768	| IOT062 |	Hello Satellites
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:14,816	| IOT062 |	Danielle a while ago about doing it with kids
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:16,096	| IOT062 |	Yak activities places
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:17,376	| IOT062 |	Networks don't exist
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:21,216	| IOT062 |	But then once you're connecting it is what can you do
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:23,520	| IOT062 |	Yeah with the information from back
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:26,592	| IOT062 |	Several different platforms
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,384	| IOT062 |	Do we bring to bear
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,152	| IOT062 |	Where are we can
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:31,968	| IOT062 |	Begin to aggregate the data from these in devices
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:35,040	| IOT062 |	We can actually going to take action against the data
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:36,832	| IOT062 |	We called me
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:37,600	| IOT062 |	Flow designer
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:40,160	| IOT062 |	We also have the ability to
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:41,696	| IOT062 |	Really
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:44,768	| IOT062 |	Provisions these different services
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:47,584	| IOT062 |	Down to the individual advice level level
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:52,960	| IOT062 |	All this on a global scale
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:56,544	| IOT062 |	And let's talk about how that turns into
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,104	| IOT062 |	Are you guys because
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:01,408	| IOT062 |	Verizon
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:07,552	| IOT062 |	And kind of have a similar like
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:08,576	| IOT062 |	Supercloud
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:12,416	| IOT062 |	Activity portions
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:13,440	| IOT062 |	Seems like
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,280	| IOT062 |	They told me that
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:24,448	| IOT062 |	They come up with the idea that about 80% of the revenue with iot was going to come from applications 15% with come
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:27,264	| IOT062 |	Platform and only 5% would come from the connectivity
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:29,312	| IOT062 |	I'm curious
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:32,384	| IOT062 |	Is true for you guys or if that's something that you're like
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:33,664	| IOT062 |	Maybe that's there
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:40,832	| IOT062 |	SA
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,624	| IOT062 |	There are definitely different
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:43,904	| IOT062 |	Places where
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:44,928	| IOT062 |	You can generate
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:45,696	| IOT062 |	Valuing
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:50,048	| IOT062 |	Revenues are being created within the industry activity
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:53,632	| IOT062 |	Actually Foundation
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:55,936	| IOT062 |	I did it going to continue to
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:57,728	| IOT062 |	Your grow in
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:00,032	| IOT062 |	Anxiety can be created based upon
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:02,848	| IOT062 |	Services that are coming out
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:06,176	| IOT062 |	A lot of what we call these low-power wide area Networks
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:08,480	| IOT062 |	RR brand new that are launching
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:09,504	| IOT062 |	There anyone else
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,528	| IOT062 |	How to use r
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:12,576	| IOT062 |	Arctic macroalgae Networks
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:17,696	| IOT062 |	To be into many more devices because we can reach
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:18,976	| IOT062 |	Different buildings
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:22,048	| IOT062 |	Or we can reach further we have longer battery life
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:24,096	| IOT062 |	Well as well as we have lower-cost
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:26,656	| IOT062 |	What does Solutions and so I think that there is
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:29,216	| IOT062 |	There's a lot of opportunity in connectivity alone
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:31,008	| IOT062 |	And then I think it is about you
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:32,800	| IOT062 |	Wants to watch you have it connected
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:34,336	| IOT062 |	And what can you do with
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,104	| IOT062 |	Cheetah
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:36,384	| IOT062 |	From those connections
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:37,408	| IOT062 |	How can you either
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:39,456	| IOT062 |	Transformer business is operating
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:43,040	| IOT062 |	I will transform the consumer experience by connecting things that make snacks
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:49,952	| IOT062 |	He said that carriers
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:53,024	| IOT062 |	Would start to have to worry about the last meter
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:55,840	| IOT062 |	Where before you guys kind of stopped at the last
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:59,936	| IOT062 |	I thought it was actually really telling statement especially when you're talking about
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:02,240	| IOT062 |	Multimode on the networks
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:04,032	| IOT062 |	He was hopping across different Networks
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:05,568	| IOT062 |	Also thinking about
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:07,360	| IOT062 |	My provisioning each individual device
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:12,480	| IOT062 |	Is that kind of a ways to start thinking about 10 of the internet of things and you guys
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:17,088	| IOT062 |	Yeah it's I think you're going to see exactly what she do
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:18,624	| IOT062 |	Transpired
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:21,696	| IOT062 |	Example in that in that electric space is it
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,464	| IOT062 |	We have a lot of
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:27,584	| IOT062 |	Taylor connectivity to a hub and then I use a different type
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:29,376	| IOT062 |	Local area network
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:32,192	| IOT062 |	I am licensed a southern reach the individual meter
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:33,472	| IOT062 |	So you're going to have a beer and have some
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:39,104	| IOT062 |	Dedicated
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:41,664	| IOT062 |	Chevy straight into and twice as well
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:43,968	| IOT062 |	And at the end of the day it's a
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:45,504	| IOT062 |	It is going to be about how do we
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,784	| IOT062 |	Effectively secure
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:49,088	| IOT062 |	Solutions
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:51,904	| IOT062 |	Using that advice layer at the network layer
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:56,256	| IOT062 |	Application layer and using the visibility that AT&T has around all the
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:57,792	| IOT062 |	Traffic that goes across our Networks
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:01,120	| IOT062 |	To make sure that we can see real-time into the potential
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:06,240	| IOT062 |	Other things that you know as we as needed so I think
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:10,080	| IOT062 |	We are definitely reaching further and further into the various endpoints
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:12,128	| IOT062 |	Is there a Surface Technologies
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:13,920	| IOT062 |	And just
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:15,712	| IOT062 |	Last week actually Erickson
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:23,392	| IOT062 |	And I thought this was kind of interesting about 28 billion devices
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,672	| IOT062 |	This was down from 50 billion
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:25,952	| IOT062 |	What still alive
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:30,048	| IOT062 |	1.5 billion would be cellular
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:32,096	| IOT062 |	And the rest would run over
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:33,120	| IOT062 |	Other networks
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:35,168	| IOT062 |	Does that number feel right to you
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,216	| IOT062 |	But yeah I think that's Harrison
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:41,568	| IOT062 |	Report end and research
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:43,616	| IOT062 |	Beijing TV
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:45,408	| IOT062 |	Opportunity
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:45,920	| IOT062 |	Yaya Toure
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:47,968	| IOT062 |	Put together a fabric Network
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,248	| IOT062 |	Well
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:50,784	| IOT062 |	So depending upon
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:52,064	| IOT062 |	Royal
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:55,904	| IOT062 |	Rig in their Motors doing something agriculture
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,440	| IOT062 |	Doing something
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:59,744	| IOT062 |	Driving
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:02,048	| IOT062 |	Yeah you're going to need to make sure that you're putting
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:04,096	| IOT062 |	The devices on the best network
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:05,888	| IOT062 |	For the exchange locations
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,936	| IOT062 |	Okay let's talk about
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:08,704	| IOT062 |	Consumers
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:14,336	| IOT062 |	I am actually an AT&T consumer because you guys provide connectivity in my car so thank you for that
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:16,896	| IOT062 |	Excited
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:21,760	| IOT062 |	My car is actually paid for by the manufacturer so the connectivity
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:22,272	| IOT062 |	I don't pay for it
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,064	| IOT062 |	But if I
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:26,880	| IOT062 |	At some point in time it's possible that I might pay for
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:27,648	| IOT062 |	And get a monthly subscription
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,696	| IOT062 |	Or have to get a monthly fee
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:32,768	| IOT062 |	Subscription in without it I think my car becomes a lot less used
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:38,656	| IOT062 |	What do you think the pricing starts to look like for things
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:40,448	| IOT062 |	Looks like that to Consumers
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:41,728	| IOT062 |	Finally
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,264	| IOT062 |	Do they feel
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:47,104	| IOT062 |	Good about that today like okay I'm going to buy the car and I'm going to buy subscription plan
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:49,408	| IOT062 |	Or is it something that maybe
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:51,456	| IOT062 |	Follows the Amazon Kindle model because
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:55,808	| IOT062 |	Self-driving cars these things aren't even going to work without
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:57,856	| IOT062 |	Connectivity so that it feels like it might become
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:02,464	| IOT062 |	Yes I think this is a place where AT&T is really young
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:03,488	| IOT062 |	Pleasant pleasant world
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:06,560	| IOT062 |	Different billing capabilities test
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:08,352	| IOT062 |	Bringing to the automobile manufacturer
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:11,168	| IOT062 |	I am and all those models exist
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:11,680	| IOT062 |	Today
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:14,240	| IOT062 |	We all we got
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:15,776	| IOT062 |	And what we allow the automaker
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,104	| IOT062 |	What services
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:21,408	| IOT062 |	Do they want stay for and then which ones
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:23,200	| IOT062 |	What day does she like
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:26,016	| IOT062 |	And we have what we call a
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:28,320	| IOT062 |	Billing capabilities
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,856	| IOT062 |	So I'll give an example
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:31,392	| IOT062 |	You got a car
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:33,696	| IOT062 |	Where are the automobile manufacturer is wanting to
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:35,744	| IOT062 |	Pull update off of the vehicle
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:39,840	| IOT062 |	Two operating over the air updates
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,376	| IOT062 |	Make the vehicle work better
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:44,448	| IOT062 |	And that's going to be a wholesale relationship between us
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:47,008	| IOT062 |	About automobile manufacturer to be able to
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:50,848	| IOT062 |	Help AT&T records. Conductivity and typically not charged
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:57,760	| IOT062 |	Build a tan customer
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:59,040	| IOT062 |	Credit card
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:02,112	| IOT062 |	Or even adding on to your AT&T Mobile Share bill
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:04,928	| IOT062 |	Where you got a big bucket today to your article from AT&T
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:06,464	| IOT062 |	$10 a month
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:09,536	| IOT062 |	All right
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:12,864	| IOT062 |	Let's talk for a little bit about the Smart Home
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:15,424	| IOT062 |	Because it is a Hot Topic this week
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:21,568	| IOT062 |	I think what a lot of people are coming at their they're realizing right now that maybe the Smart Home
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:24,128	| IOT062 |	I'm seeing a lot of the smart home is stupid the smart home is dead
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,664	| IOT062 |	And you guys offer
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:27,968	| IOT062 |	AT&T Digital Life I've seen ads
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:32,064	| IOT062 |	What do you think about kind of the evolution of the smart
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:37,952	| IOT062 |	AT&T
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:40,000	| IOT062 |	That's a great opportunity not only
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:41,792	| IOT062 |	Security from a foundation
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:43,584	| IOT062 |	Perspective it then
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:47,680	| IOT062 |	Once you've got the kind of chilly for the home and how can you bring other services
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,704	| IOT062 |	Automation
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:49,728	| IOT062 |	Home automation Solutions
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:51,008	| IOT062 |	To bear
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:52,032	| IOT062 |	And so
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:54,848	| IOT062 |	More more traction
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:56,896	| IOT062 |	I am more accustomed to taking
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:59,456	| IOT062 |	Get well beyond the basics of conductivity
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:01,504	| IOT062 |	I'm getting into you a lot of these different services
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:06,368	| IOT062 |	But it is complex to manage and being able to manage all that through a single interface
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:08,672	| IOT062 |	Is really resonating with the end consumers
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:10,208	| IOT062 |	If you want that you go out to try to
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:13,024	| IOT062 |	6 difference
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:16,096	| IOT062 |	Solutions if you want to be able to stand up in your home and your six different applications
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:18,400	| IOT062 |	Do you need to manage in order to
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:21,472	| IOT062 |	Make it all work that becomes a very complex situation
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:23,776	| IOT062 |	AT&T will go out to your home
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:25,312	| IOT062 |	How do you install
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:26,592	| IOT062 |	Dissolutions get setup
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:29,152	| IOT062 |	Appropriate and give you a single interface
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:30,944	| IOT062 |	Solutions
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:33,760	| IOT062 |	That that is where we really have to differentiate our offer
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,368	| IOT062 |	And it raised our homes
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:39,136	| IOT062 |	Solutions
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:40,672	| IOT062 |	And with other things were doing such a
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:41,696	| IOT062 |	Connect a car
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:45,280	| IOT062 |	So you think about our AT&T Drive Studio we're actually demonstrating this
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:46,048	| IOT062 |	Today
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:47,328	| IOT062 |	Where are your car as is
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:48,608	| IOT062 |	The Neighbourhood
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:49,632	| IOT062 |	It automatically
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:53,472	| IOT062 |	It's over 8000 sensera and invisible
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:55,776	| IOT062 |	5 miles out
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:58,336	| IOT062 |	Automatically have your thermostat lowers
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:01,152	| IOT062 |	As you approach the driveway the lights come on out to go on
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,688	| IOT062 |	And in Sodus
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:04,224	| IOT062 |	Ability to seamlessly
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:05,504	| IOT062 |	Happy sings interface
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:06,784	| IOT062 |	Without you having to
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:09,600	| IOT062 |	Do anything other than drive to and from your home
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:16,000	| IOT062 |	Is another great value proposition that where we are beginning to pull together different parts of the ecosystem and make more coarse a muscle
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:19,072	| IOT062 |	In our consumers willing to pay for this
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:23,936	| IOT062 |	Absolutely I think consumers are always willing to pay for Value that they get
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:25,216	| IOT062 |	Okay final question
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:30,080	| IOT062 |	What are you most excited about when it comes to the internet of things and what
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:30,592	| IOT062 |	Turntable
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:34,176	| IOT062 |	I think what I'm most excited about is the fact that
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:35,712	| IOT062 |	We are beginning to see
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:36,480	| IOT062 |	How
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:37,504	| IOT062 |	These things
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:40,064	| IOT062 |	Darion networks are beginning to
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:42,624	| IOT062 |	Take care of ourselves versus Outsiders take care of her
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:44,416	| IOT062 |	I think
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:46,976	| IOT062 |	When we start getting into a lot more
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:48,000	| IOT062 |	Predictive
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:50,560	| IOT062 |	Solutions NM
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:52,608	| IOT062 |	Things are really enabling my life to work
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:54,144	| IOT062 |	Easier making a lot of my business
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:56,448	| IOT062 |	Operate more efficiently
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:57,728	| IOT062 |	Because I'm not having to worry about
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:01,056	| IOT062 |	Manufacturing Florence
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:02,592	| IOT062 |	The park
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:05,152	| IOT062 |	Might be about to fail
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:09,760	| IOT062 |	Yeah it knows that it's going to fail and it automatically doors replacement parts so it's sitting
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:11,808	| IOT062 |	Machine
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:13,344	| IOT062 |	Before the machine goes off
