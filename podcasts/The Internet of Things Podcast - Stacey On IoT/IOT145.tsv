EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:55,552	| IOT145 |	And now
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:57,344	| IOT145 |	Let's go to a message
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:00:58,368	| IOT145 |	From another one of our spa
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:00:59,136	| IOT145 |	Spencer's
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:01,696	| IOT145 |	This week sponsor is CBT Nuggets
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:08,096	| IOT145 |	So how does the IOD change the way you do business for many organizations it means a proliferation
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:09,376	| IOT145 |	One of devices and tools
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:11,168	| IOT145 |	Which all require support
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:13,216	| IOT145 |	What is a mountain of requests for the it
EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:16,544	| IOT145 |	Or Pilot devices that aren't being used to their full
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:17,312	| IOT145 |	Potential
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:20,128	| IOT145 |	But if everyone on your team knows how to use their tools
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:24,736	| IOT145 |	You're going to have fewer support request for it and get the most out of your material and vest
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:31,136	| IOT145 |	CBT Nuggets has been a top training choice for it Professionals for decades and now they're making the same
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:36,000	| IOT145 |	High quality online training for end-user topics like Windows 10 IOS
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:41,376	| IOT145 |	Salesforce and security awareness so your whole team can fully connect with the iot
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:44,448	| IOT145 |	Go to CDT nuggets. IO
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:48,544	| IOT145 |	To find out more about how end-user training can help your team
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:49,568	| IOT145 |	Get connected
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,848	| IOT145 |	To the iot
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:53,152	| IOT145 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:55,712	| IOT145 |	Let's kick it off with someone
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:57,248	| IOT145 |	Consumer-facing dues
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:02:00,064	| IOT145 |	Some of which there's two related stories one
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:01,344	| IOT145 |	In both actually happened last year
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:03,136	| IOT145 |	When is
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:05,696	| IOT145 |	Auto the $700 Smart Lock
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:06,720	| IOT145 |	We've talked about
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:08,256	| IOT145 |	They shut down
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:11,584	| IOT145 |	And then to was Amazon buying blink witch hat
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:12,864	| IOT145 |	Right before
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:13,376	| IOT145 |	Christmas
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:16,192	| IOT145 |	And I think these two stories are related
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:18,752	| IOT145 |	Is Nas played Wiseau Autos issue
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:20,800	| IOT145 |	Is that this company has started
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,080	| IOT145 |	Years before
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:23,872	| IOT145 |	Launch so it launched this
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:27,200	| IOT145 |	Last year in 2017
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:28,992	| IOT145 |	With this
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:31,040	| IOT145 |	Planned $700 lock
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:32,320	| IOT145 |	It was a very beautiful
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:38,976	| IOT145 |	Its claim to fame was it actually wasn't as bulky as all the other iot locks it all fit into the original
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:42,816	| IOT145 |	Is it the deadbolt hole
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:45,888	| IOT145 |	And was going to
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,936	| IOT145 |	The product launch TuneIn
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:48,960	| IOT145 |	Early this year
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:51,520	| IOT145 |	What happened was they said
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:55,360	| IOT145 |	We were in the middle of trying to raise money and then we got an A
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:55,872	| IOT145 |	Acquisition
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:58,176	| IOT145 |	Any acquisition offer
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:58,944	| IOT145 |	Was going to
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,224	| IOT145 |	The clothes in early December
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:05,344	| IOT145 |	Basically didn't allow Auto to continue raising money
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:09,184	| IOT145 |	And so when the acquisition fell through
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,720	| IOT145 |	The company was left with
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:17,632	| IOT145 |	Apparently the acquisition fell through on the final day of when the deal was supposed to actually happen
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,400	| IOT145 |	And that
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:21,472	| IOT145 |	Left the auto folks scrambling and
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,496	| IOT145 |	Yes they have
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:24,032	| IOT145 |	Shut down operations
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:28,128	| IOT145 |	I mean I can see where you're going to go with us being related
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:30,176	| IOT145 |	But I do want to talk about the lock itself
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:34,016	| IOT145 |	Because as I read the a medium post
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,296	| IOT145 |	By the CEO
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:36,832	| IOT145 |	About to die yeah
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:40,672	| IOT145 |	Sam's post explain you know how all this went down as you just
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,208	| IOT145 |	Mentioned
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:45,024	| IOT145 |	But some of it in there just made me
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:47,072	| IOT145 |	Scratch my head and he had mentioned that the
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:52,448	| IOT145 |	Turn beta testing the $699 price point you know challenge melted away
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:53,984	| IOT145 |	I don't think so
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,264	| IOT145 |	I'd be shocked if that was
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,544	| IOT145 |	Is traffic bad because
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:58,080	| IOT145 |	It seems to me like autobutts
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:00,128	| IOT145 |	They spend a lot of time working with
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:02,688	| IOT145 |	Somebody who actually was in the Swiss watch
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:04,992	| IOT145 |	Making industry and I mean very
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,016	| IOT145 |	Small precise
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,040	| IOT145 |	Components for this thing
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:11,904	| IOT145 |	And that's great I'm sure it's a work of art just like any say mechanical watch might be but
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:17,280	| IOT145 |	A mechanical watch high-end is not the same as a lock you know what you wear the watch it's with you all day the lock
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,559	| IOT145 |	How to use a couple times a day
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:21,631	| IOT145 |	It seemed like these folks going to be for lack of a better word
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,911	| IOT145 |	The apple of
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:25,471	| IOT145 |	Smart locks I think they actually wanted to be
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:26,751	| IOT145 |	It's an even higher
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:29,055	| IOT145 |	Well
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,359	| IOT145 |	I mean it's the Philip II
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:35,199	| IOT145 |	Rolex
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:41,599	| IOT145 |	I'm smart locks and I see this because most locks have Precision Engineering even August has they
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,111	| IOT145 |	Went through it there
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:44,927	| IOT145 |	And this lovely story about Japanese
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:46,719	| IOT145 |	Hi precision
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:48,511	| IOT145 |	Something something
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,023	| IOT145 |	Gears blah
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,071	| IOT145 |	Because
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:54,655	| IOT145 |	I kind of threw away
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,935	| IOT145 |	His
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,447	| IOT145 |	Swiss Swatch
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:00,287	| IOT145 |	I appreciate it but I'm like
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:03,615	| IOT145 |	Alex have very intricate little Parts because they're free
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:04,383	| IOT145 |	Picking locks
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:06,687	| IOT145 |	And if you're going to run a motor through it you're going to need
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:07,711	| IOT145 |	Bits and pieces
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,783	| IOT145 |	The two things I thought of
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:11,807	| IOT145 |	This is one
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:17,951	| IOT145 |	I'm very curious who the acquirer was because this actually happened not too long ago to Zana
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:19,487	| IOT145 |	Which also
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,279	| IOT145 |	Had an acquisition fault
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:24,351	| IOT145 |	Do and then Heather abruptly shut operations
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,631	| IOT145 |	And then led to
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:28,703	| IOT145 |	Hiring everybody had now the lawsuit again
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,215	| IOT145 |	It's raining
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,007	| IOT145 |	But
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:32,799	| IOT145 |	This seems to be a common
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:33,567	| IOT145 |	Maybe another time
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,847	| IOT145 |	This seems to be a thread
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,359	| IOT145 |	Did this happen
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,919	| IOT145 |	There's a lot of kind of cannibalization have
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:42,015	| IOT145 |	I would also say that August which was acquired also
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:43,039	| IOT145 |	Late last year
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,319	| IOT145 |	Was not acquired
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,087	| IOT145 |	In like
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:47,391	| IOT145 |	A very fantastic deal this was a deal that
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:48,671	| IOT145 |	The shareholders barely
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,463	| IOT145 |	So
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:50,975	| IOT145 |	I'm going to say
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,767	| IOT145 |	Locks not a great place to
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,047	| IOT145 |	Now
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:56,351	| IOT145 |	Trying to do this
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:58,399	| IOT145 |	Is Amazon buying blink
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:02,751	| IOT145 |	Blank is a camera company it's a low power wireless camera come
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:05,823	| IOT145 |	It's actually pretty cool it was started by a semiconductor
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:09,663	| IOT145 |	Company that had this great ship that was selling for like five bucks
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,175	| IOT145 |	Zapata Lake
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:12,479	| IOT145 |	Companies was it in Media
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:12,991	| IOT145 |	Amelia
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:14,783	| IOT145 |	They were like
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:20,159	| IOT145 |	Hey what's a better way for us to show off are really awesome what they had was low power
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:21,183	| IOT145 |	Video processing
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:25,279	| IOT145 |	Analogy
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:25,791	| IOT145 |	Tiger Mart
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,607	| IOT145 |	So they built this camera system
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,143	| IOT145 |	And it
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:30,655	| IOT145 |	What's a good camera
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,191	| IOT145 |	And
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:34,239	| IOT145 |	Very cheap 99 bucks for
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,519	| IOT145 |	A wireless HD
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,543	| IOT145 |	Cameron ice
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,055	| IOT145 |	And
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,103	| IOT145 |	They've been on the market for
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:42,687	| IOT145 |	I saw I first heard they were on the market
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:43,455	| IOT145 |	The middle of last year
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:45,759	| IOT145 |	So again this was
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:48,831	| IOT145 |	Last year was definitely a time of m&a and trying to
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:50,367	| IOT145 |	It's going to start cleaning up some of the
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:52,671	| IOT145 |	Success in the smart home space
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,207	| IOT145 |	So I don't coming along
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:54,975	| IOT145 |	That time
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:56,255	| IOT145 |	I'm with a really high price
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,279	| IOT145 |	Product was just
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:59,839	| IOT145 |	Late for that
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,351	| IOT145 |	And
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:06,751	| IOT145 |	I think in 2018 what we're about to see is the beginning of incredible commodification and
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:10,847	| IOT145 |	Addition and that's what I said with Amazon buying blink I think this is
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:14,175	| IOT145 |	Not Just Like Glue Amazon has security goals sure everybody does
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,735	| IOT145 |	But it's also a sense and
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,759	| IOT145 |	A validation that
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,295	| IOT145 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,831	| IOT145 |	Price and getting a price down India
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:21,855	| IOT145 |	Just going to be sued
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:25,439	| IOT145 |	I think you're spot on I mean there's going to be a
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:31,071	| IOT145 |	Tan of price pressure now on newer products and even some of the older products are coming down in price
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:34,655	| IOT145 |	Quite a bit and we'll talk about my canary in a bit but I mean I got it for a song
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,447	| IOT145 |	No pun intended
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:38,239	| IOT145 |	No no I did not mean that I did not mean that
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,007	| IOT145 |	Does that make them sick
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,031	| IOT145 |	Marion
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:46,175	| IOT145 |	Could be yeah yeah they could be but I completely agree with you
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:46,943	| IOT145 |	I think
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:50,527	| IOT145 |	And that's good for consumers for the business side that's a whole different aspect
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:53,343	| IOT145 |	The profit margins in sustainability but
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:55,135	| IOT145 |	If you're a consumer on the lookout
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,951	| IOT145 |	You can expect I think to pay a lot less in 2018 than you did
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:59,487	| IOT145 |	In one or two years ago
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:00,767	| IOT145 |	Alright so
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:03,327	| IOT145 |	Best debate consumer device story
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,351	| IOT145 |	Let's talk about something that
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:05,375	| IOT145 |	1
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:06,911	| IOT145 |	Amazon has sold a lot of
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,775	| IOT145 |	We still don't know how many
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,055	| IOT145 |	Exact number of
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:18,687	| IOT145 |	Man-made devices that have been sold but Amazon did say in a press release right after Christmas
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,479	| IOT145 |	Tens of millions of
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,271	| IOT145 |	Echo devices with
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,295	| IOT145 |	You know who
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,319	| IOT145 |	We're sold worldwide
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:28,671	| IOT145 |	The echo Dot and Fire TV stick with the voice remote work not just
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:35,071	| IOT145 |	Top selling devices on Amazon in the holidays but they were the best line products from any manufacturer in any category
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:38,655	| IOT145 |	Maria cross Alabama's on so that's a pretty good indication of how many a lot
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,703	| IOT145 |	In another interesting aspect
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:43,519	| IOT145 |	Because it brings more people using the devices
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,847	| IOT145 |	They say that Tamela Mann on Fire TV
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:51,967	| IOT145 |	The usage in the US is up 889% over the same time. Last year it so
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:57,087	| IOT145 |	We talked about this the Fire TV in the voice before it's nice to see the cards in the TV
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:09:01,439	| IOT145 |	I don't get into it that much but apparently a lot of people do so and that's all good for
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:01,951	| IOT145 |	For Amazon
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:02,975	| IOT145 |	Yes it is
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,023	| IOT145 |	And they seem to be
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:10,911	| IOT145 |	Add a story
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,191	| IOT145 |	This week
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:16,543	| IOT145 |	About Amazon they talked to some people at Big brands
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,591	| IOT145 |	Clorox and it sounds like
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,383	| IOT145 |	Amazon is talking to them
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,663	| IOT145 |	About bringing advertising
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,175	| IOT145 |	Sing to the A
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:23,455	| IOT145 |	Now
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,991	| IOT145 |	This is
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:29,087	| IOT145 |	This is basically it's talking to them about letting them promote their products on there
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:32,159	| IOT145 |	Early discussion centered on
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:36,511	| IOT145 |	Whether companies would pay for higher placement if a user searches for a product
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,791	| IOT145 |	Such a shame
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:38,559	| IOT145 |	Poo
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,583	| IOT145 |	Kind of like how Google
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,399	| IOT145 |	I would say
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:43,935	| IOT145 |	That's a dumb way to monitor
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:52,127	| IOT145 |	Another possibility could be with promotional bits on skills and such
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:52,895	| IOT145 |	So
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:53,919	| IOT145 |	That might make
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,711	| IOT145 |	More sense to me than just
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:58,783	| IOT145 |	Inner product placement and search ads and such as
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:02,879	| IOT145 |	Approach I'd rather see it on the skills cuz I have a choice to install the skill or not
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:06,975	| IOT145 |	Yes and I think skills could become like the Campbell's cookbook
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:11,839	| IOT145 |	Marketing bright so instead of saying
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:17,471	| IOT145 |	Let me put your search higher why don't you give me some functionality that relates to your product and so if you guys don't know what
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:22,847	| IOT145 |	The Campbell's cookbook is Campbell's basically put out books that taught you how to make things using their
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:23,359	| IOT145 |	Air Products
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:25,663	| IOT145 |	Is it terribly innovative
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:26,687	| IOT145 |	No better
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,783	| IOT145 |	Clorox stain remover
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:34,623	| IOT145 |	How do I get it out
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,439	| IOT145 |	I would do that
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:41,535	| IOT145 |	You can suggest how to do it and then optionally
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:44,095	| IOT145 |	Say do you need any Clorox
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:44,863	| IOT145 |	Sylveon
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,631	| IOT145 |	Place the order
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,167	| IOT145 |	I think the opportunity here
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,191	| IOT145 |	Where is Les
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:50,751	| IOT145 |	Direct like a search engine based at
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,031	| IOT145 |	Which is like
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:56,127	| IOT145 |	Shirley based on the intent and War around brand building and marketing like a magazine
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,407	| IOT145 |	Voice is not
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:59,199	| IOT145 |	I don't think voice is going to be
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:10:59,967	| IOT145 |	Good
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,991	| IOT145 |	4
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:02,015	| IOT145 |	This intent-based Mar
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,551	| IOT145 |	Because it's
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,087	| IOT145 |	It's a medium that Demands a
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:07,391	| IOT145 |	A quick information Exchange
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,159	| IOT145 |	So
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:13,279	| IOT145 |	Build trust with Brands you don't want to Brand taking of your valuable time telling you about
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:15,327	| IOT145 |	Disinfecting wipes while you ask
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:16,351	| IOT145 |	How long
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,143	| IOT145 |	7 elephants 2
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:18,655	| IOT145 |	Counter
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,703	| IOT145 |	So that's
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,727	| IOT145 |	My two cents
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,799	| IOT145 |	I'm sure that people will get it wrong before they get it right
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:30,431	| IOT145 |	I do think that Google's approach here might be a little smarter because they're looking at grabbing this data and trying to make
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,967	| IOT145 |	Products from it
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:33,503	| IOT145 |	And it'll be interesting to see
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:34,527	| IOT145 |	Anna Powell
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,063	| IOT145 |	Amazon figures this out
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:43,231	| IOT145 |	Yeah I think it's going to be a let's try a couple of different things and see what sticks and what people complain about versus what people are okay with
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:47,071	| IOT145 |	Plus how many more products to resell as a result of these
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:49,375	| IOT145 |	I would be super irritated
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:53,983	| IOT145 |	It already Amazon is pushing search results when I asked for like
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,287	| IOT145 |	Order more this
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,151	| IOT145 |	In
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:04,735	| IOT145 |	I know what I'm looking for so if one of the things I want is in a bundle
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:05,247	| IOT145 |	3 I'm not
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,087	| IOT145 |	I can see that
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:13,439	| IOT145 |	Yeah this is going to be interesting to see how this progresses and
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:16,511	| IOT145 |	Who does what in the space between Amazon Google I need a Microsoft
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,559	| IOT145 |	Okay let's
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,327	| IOT145 |	Talk about
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:21,631	| IOT145 |	Xiaomi
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:24,191	| IOT145 |	We shall we shall know
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:30,079	| IOT145 |	There's a report out from Navigant research that was talking about who is the
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:31,103	| IOT145 |	It's like a
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:34,175	| IOT145 |	Graph of who are the leading iot platform providers are
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:37,247	| IOT145 |	Gartner quadrant magic quadrant
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:40,063	| IOT145 |	McGrath and I noticed in the leader section IC
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,087	| IOT145 |	IBM
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,903	| IOT145 |	Okay that makes sense Microsoft okay that makes sense
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:45,695	| IOT145 |	AWS also makes sense
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:47,487	| IOT145 |	But then I saw no mention of alphabet
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,279	| IOT145 |	Google anime that doesn't make sense
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:50,559	| IOT145 |	Or does it
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:55,167	| IOT145 |	Maybe it does because where is and what is Google's iot platform
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,447	| IOT145 |	Oh my goodness
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,543	| IOT145 |	When Kevin brought this up
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:01,311	| IOT145 |	Ahead of the show
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:02,591	| IOT145 |	I would like
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:08,991	| IOT145 |	Will they have their serverless Computing option they have
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:10,527	| IOT145 |	Google Cloud functions
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,831	| IOT145 |	In beta
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,599	| IOT145 |	Witness
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:15,647	| IOT145 |	And
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,415	| IOT145 |	Then I was like
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,607	| IOT145 |	Cloud iot Core
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:25,631	| IOT145 |	Right
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:27,679	| IOT145 |	Do they have a job
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,215	| IOT145 |	That's that's where
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:31,519	| IOT145 |	Edge
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:34,847	| IOT145 |	Because you know if you got a w s has green grass
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:37,151	| IOT145 |	Microsoft actually has
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:38,175	| IOT145 |	Azure iot
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:40,991	| IOT145 |	Google doesn't really have an
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:44,319	| IOT145 |	I hate to say the word end-to-end option but they really do
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,111	| IOT145 |	Twerking
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:48,927	| IOT145 |	Yeah it's not mentioned
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,719	| IOT145 |	Very well on the Google Cloud
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:53,279	| IOT145 |	Site exora pee smell is not bundled
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:54,815	| IOT145 |	In my opinion
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:58,143	| IOT145 |	Can I talk to developers have used Android things
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:00,191	| IOT145 |	And they think it's actually really interesting
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,519	| IOT145 |	But I don't know anyone who's
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,055	| IOT145 |	Building Products
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:06,335	| IOT145 |	Exact
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,895	| IOT145 |	Yeah so this
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,663	| IOT145 |	Really does make
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,175	| IOT145 |	The question
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:11,711	| IOT145 |	Where
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:17,087	| IOT145 |	Like where's Waldo for what are you doing
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:21,183	| IOT145 |	Just to give some insight on because I did work
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:24,255	| IOT145 |	Google Pryor and I think I can say this without breaking any nda's
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,791	| IOT145 |	Google
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:27,071	| IOT145 |	Rightly things
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:29,119	| IOT145 |	Highly of itself and I seen that
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:29,631	| IOT145 |	Because
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:31,679	| IOT145 |	It's got some leading
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:35,263	| IOT145 |	Products and services with your billions of users
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,031	| IOT145 |	But
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:40,895	| IOT145 |	That is often the rationale behind we put a product out and people use it because
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:41,407	| IOT145 |	Google
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:47,039	| IOT145 |	And that's not a great strategy especially in this space which is heating up very fast
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:50,879	| IOT145 |	Hey Google does have a lot of the right pieces here that I would seek or
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,415	| IOT145 |	The guy Cloud Annex
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:54,463	| IOT145 |	Language in Cloud machine learning engine
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,511	| IOT145 |	And mention Cloud functions
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:15:00,607	| IOT145 |	People are just going to use it because well it's Google where they got all the best stuff
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,911	| IOT145 |	There's got to be a cohesive
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,679	| IOT145 |	Bundled
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,447	| IOT145 |	Story
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:08,799	| IOT145 |	End-to-end and I don't see it between all of those Android things and so on
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,847	| IOT145 |	And what's crazy is they have
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,359	| IOT145 |	Nest
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,383	| IOT145 |	Interrupt
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,687	| IOT145 |	Right so they have
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:15,967	| IOT145 |	Millions
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:16,991	| IOT145 |	Switch is very very
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:19,039	| IOT145 |	Millions of connected devices
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:19,807	| IOT145 |	They're so they're sick
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:25,951	| IOT145 |	Does Google home and Google assistant on most Android devices over Android 5.0 I think
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:30,303	| IOT145 |	So Kathy understand Edge devices they understand Integrations
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,607	| IOT145 |	So
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:33,887	| IOT145 |	Hey
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:34,655	| IOT145 |	Google
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,423	| IOT145 |	What's up
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:35,935	| IOT145 |	Talk to us
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:38,239	| IOT145 |	We would love to explain
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,007	| IOT145 |	What you're doing
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:39,775	| IOT145 |	We would love to know
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:41,055	| IOT145 |	And I bet we're not alone
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,871	| IOT145 |	Moving on from our plea for infer
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,663	| IOT145 |	What does talk about
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:46,687	| IOT145 |	Quick news
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,735	| IOT145 |	Arrow
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:51,551	| IOT145 |	Which is a massive Electronics distributor
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:55,391	| IOT145 |	Is buying e info chips this is part of their iot strategy
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:16:02,303	| IOT145 |	Which this one gets them from a distributor into more of a systems integrator there are thousands of iot based engineer
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,071	| IOT145 |	Beers from
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:03,583	| IOT145 |	This Indian
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,631	| IOT145 |	And
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:11,263	| IOT145 |	This makes a ton of sense we're seeing this both on Arrow as a distributor and also Avnet
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:15,615	| IOT145 |	Which is kind of a distributor they're all moving into systems integration for the iot
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:17,407	| IOT145 |	So we're seeing a bunch of
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:18,431	| IOT145 |	Consolidation
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,455	| IOT145 |	Up skills in
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:19,967	| IOT145 |	And the channel it's
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,503	| IOT145 |	Not exciting
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,271	| IOT145 |	I know but
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:23,295	| IOT145 |	Big and important
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,831	| IOT145 |	Nexa Roku
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,111	| IOT145 |	Wants to be your next
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:27,391	| IOT145 |	Voice assistant
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:35,071	| IOT145 |	Yeah I got a little surprised by this in one sense not surprised that they want to bring voice Computing to Roku
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:38,911	| IOT145 |	Power devices which are TVs they will be smart speakers as well
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:40,959	| IOT145 |	Is a part of this new licensing deal that
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:44,543	| IOT145 |	Roku Justin Bell this week but they're building the
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:50,687	| IOT145 |	Software themselves are not tying themselves to say Amazon voice Services Google or somebody else like that
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:57,343	| IOT145 |	They're going it alone and that may be okay because the initial push here is for controlling Home Entertainment
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:17:00,927	| IOT145 |	Such as your wireless speakers your TV sound bars and so on
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:07,071	| IOT145 |	But it kind of leads me to think longer-term like if you're going to do that why not go all the way in
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:12,191	| IOT145 |	Control Smart Home devices with voice and if they're going to do that on their own I don't know that they have
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:15,263	| IOT145 |	I don't say don't know they have the chops to do cuz they make a great product
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,287	| IOT145 |	But did I
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,311	| IOT145 |	Apple chopstick
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,335	| IOT145 |	Out voice
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:21,151	| IOT145 |	The others in this market I'm not too sure about that but
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:27,551	| IOT145 |	Regardless will get the chance to see this next week at TCL which is one of their biggest OEM Partners will be debuting a Roku
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:30,111	| IOT145 |	Connect power device at CES so we'll take a look
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,135	| IOT145 |	Nowhere Roku
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,183	| IOT145 |	Here is where
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,463	| IOT145 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:36,511	| IOT145 |	There's a huge opportunity in voice
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,047	| IOT145 |	To say things
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:39,839	| IOT145 |	Hey Shelby the yada yada
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:42,911	| IOT145 |	And
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:43,423	| IOT145 |	Gracenote
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:44,959	| IOT145 |	4
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:52,639	| IOT145 |	I don't I don't disagree with you and I don't know cuz I haven't used it but I thought that Xfinity's
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:56,735	| IOT145 |	Software remote may do something similar it may not be as robust as that
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:58,783	| IOT145 |	And I also be curious to see if
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:00,575	| IOT145 |	YouTube TV which is
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:04,927	| IOT145 |	Obviously built from Google and Google search I mean Google has I think the best search results
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:09,023	| IOT145 |	I wouldn't be surprised if you could even do that there but I have not tested it
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:10,815	| IOT145 |	Yes so that's
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:15,423	| IOT145 |	Intel CPU flaw
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:19,519	| IOT145 |	So quit State of the Union
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:20,799	| IOT145 |	Because there's not
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:24,383	| IOT145 |	Whole ton of details this is something that is likely
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,151	| IOT145 |	What will affect clouds
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:28,223	| IOT145 |	Rebuilder colonel
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:28,991	| IOT145 |	Is that
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:34,623	| IOT145 |	Yeah it's there's no way to fix this from a hardware perspective it is going to be software patches across
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:35,647	| IOT145 |	PCS
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:38,463	| IOT145 |	Devices servers Etc yes
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:43,327	| IOT145 |	And we were wondering if it was going to affect iot devices it could affect gateway's Inn
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:46,399	| IOT145 |	Industrial gateways basically that are running Intel based chips
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:49,983	| IOT145 |	But for most smart home devices are running arm
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:52,031	| IOT145 |	Chips and usually not even rm60
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:53,311	| IOT145 |	Afford it now
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:54,591	| IOT145 |	We did find out
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:57,151	| IOT145 |	According to the register that they're also
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:59,967	| IOT145 |	Adding updates to the arm 64-bit
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:01,759	| IOT145 |	That
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:05,599	| IOT145 |	But we're not sure
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:13,023	| IOT145 |	Newer iot devices like brand-spanking-new may use 64-bit arm chips don't know I mean we have to research
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:17,631	| IOT145 |	What is a little concerning in at the very high level that's law which goes back I believe about
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:19,167	| IOT145 |	10 years worth of chips now
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:21,727	| IOT145 |	As I'm going to do with allowing users
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:24,799	| IOT145 |	Access to Kernel protected memory and that's a no no
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:27,359	| IOT145 |	I'm insecure
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:34,783	| IOT145 |	Cortana still can't talk to me
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:35,295	| IOT145 |	Even though
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,159	| IOT145 |	They were clock watcher
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:49,119	| IOT145 |	But the thing is I still don't know how it's supposed to work that hasn't been explained yet so I guess we're just going to undertale here it is
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:50,399	| IOT145 |	Is an here's how it works
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,935	| IOT145 |	Demonstration
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:53,471	| IOT145 |	I think so
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:53,983	| IOT145 |	We'll see that
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,359	| IOT145 |	You recently purchased a car
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:02,943	| IOT145 |	Canary which is the all-in-one security device that I actually recently recommended as a
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,247	| IOT145 |	Do you agree with me
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:11,903	| IOT145 |	I would agree with you I would I not just cuz I do the show with you I bought a canary and I know you tested a canary
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:15,999	| IOT145 |	I added a canary Flex as well I don't know if you tested that
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:20,351	| IOT145 |	I did but it was when I tested it was brand-spanking-new and it had a real issues
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:21,631	| IOT145 |	Mywifi net
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:23,167	| IOT145 |	Work is it was running dual band
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:24,703	| IOT145 |	Because that Euros showed
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:25,215	| IOT145 |	Unified band
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:32,383	| IOT145 |	And Google Wi-Fi with your values also do a single band of 2.4 + 5
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,919	| IOT145 |	Gigahertz together but I
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:36,479	| IOT145 |	Didn't have any problems setting either of these
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:41,087	| IOT145 |	Yeah so that's that was very good cuz I do have a problem with my ring doorbell book schreiber's off
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,367	| IOT145 |	Similar issue with the Bands
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:45,951	| IOT145 |	Regardless yes I think Canary sells the home unit
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:48,511	| IOT145 |	For 349 and the flex is additional
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:49,791	| IOT145 |	I don't know 1:50 or some like that
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:53,631	| IOT145 |	So is it done once it's either
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:54,911	| IOT145 |	When he first came out
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:57,215	| IOT145 |	Yes a long time ago
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,823	| IOT145 |	This is the price pressure I was living
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:06,943	| IOT145 |	Regardless I got the canary and the canary Flex for 149 together
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:07,711	| IOT145 |	Wow
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:10,783	| IOT145 |	Yes Costco was very good to me at Christmas time this year so
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:15,903	| IOT145 |	Yeah so that Canary unit is a cylinder with a HD video camera
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,696	| IOT145 |	Speaker microphone
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:20,256	| IOT145 |	Has a little light underneath that let you know when it's 4
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:22,304	| IOT145 |	Recording or video or you
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:25,120	| IOT145 |	Somebody's looking through their app to see video which is
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:31,520	| IOT145 |	It's nice to see it also has some sensors in it to measure your air quality temperature humidity and so on so forth with your handy
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:32,800	| IOT145 |	I don't really need that but it's
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,824	| IOT145 |	Candy again
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:34,592	| IOT145 |	Italian
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,920	| IOT145 |	I think someone just took a shower
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:39,968	| IOT145 |	Humidity level rises
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:44,064	| IOT145 |	It's funny you say that cuz I looked at the graph of the air quality humidity apparently
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:48,416	| IOT145 |	We breathe out a lot of CO2 because every morning we going upstairs air quality tanks
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:52,000	| IOT145 |	I don't get it
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:53,536	| IOT145 |	To know you should get some plan
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:22:00,704	| IOT145 |	Yes we do need plants Virginia plants that's the gist of the canary unit and the canary Flex are they small
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,728	| IOT145 |	Little
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,008	| IOT145 |	5 in
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:05,312	| IOT145 |	Big Tylenol pill
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:07,616	| IOT145 |	With a camera and a microphone
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:11,968	| IOT145 |	It comes to the magnetic base so you can angle the video camera anywhere you want
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:15,040	| IOT145 |	It's an indoor outdoor camera I'm using it indoors only
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:18,624	| IOT145 |	And again no problems connecting it so answer for
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:21,184	| IOT145 |	What I like about the canary itself
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:23,232	| IOT145 |	The software I find is
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:23,744	| IOT145 |	Excellent
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:25,024	| IOT145 |	I love it
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:29,376	| IOT145 |	I like how you invite people to be part of the family and the reason you do that
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,912	| IOT145 |	Is because this
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:34,240	| IOT145 |	Auto arms and disarms based on geolocation if you want it
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:37,568	| IOT145 |	This is one of the Hang-Ups I had with the wink security system that I tested
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:39,360	| IOT145 |	There's no easy way to arm knit without
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:39,872	| IOT145 |	Going to the app
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:45,248	| IOT145 |	May I hear it just works automatically and even in the timeline in the app it says
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:51,392	| IOT145 |	Kevin just left home City just came home as soon as I work all of us are gone the system is armed if anybody is home
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:55,488	| IOT145 |	It will not be armed unless you want it to be armed like at night time and so on
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:58,048	| IOT145 |	I absolutely love that it's a little bit
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:23:01,120	| IOT145 |	Zealous when it comes to the notifications and I mean
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:05,984	| IOT145 |	It's sending me notifications for like when a car passes by in the lights are seen and so on and so forth
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:12,384	| IOT145 |	Even when normally dog runs around which I would expect there's some masking features that I haven't used yet but I also bump down the sense of
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:14,176	| IOT145 |	Nativity what you can do on a per device level
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:20,832	| IOT145 |	And that has helped out quite a bit so there's a siren I have not even tried that yet cuz I want to freak the dog out but overall
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:23,904	| IOT145 |	Yeah I saw the decibel level that's why I didn't try it
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:29,024	| IOT145 |	But overall I really like it ticks all the boxes for me in terms of the right notifications
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:32,096	| IOT145 |	Automatic arming and disarming is fantastic
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:33,632	| IOT145 |	Wasn't very expensive
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:34,656	| IOT145 |	It was easy to set up
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:35,936	| IOT145 |	And the software itself
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:37,472	| IOT145 |	Really found to be
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:38,752	| IOT145 |	Very well-made my PIN
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:41,056	| IOT145 |	It may have been different when you used it I don't know
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:43,104	| IOT145 |	I did like it there were a couple things but again
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:43,616	| IOT145 |	It was very early
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:46,688	| IOT145 |	So does it work with Madam or Google home
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:49,760	| IOT145 |	It does not work with home cats
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:52,320	| IOT145 |	And it does work with my wink
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:56,672	| IOT145 |	And I thought maybe therefore would work with the echo button
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:57,952	| IOT145 |	Did a search for
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:00,256	| IOT145 |	AT&T app and it does not find it
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:05,120	| IOT145 |	I'm not sure what I'd use it for maybe arming at night or putting in night mode by voice or something
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:08,704	| IOT145 |	You know we're doing the camera on a show or something which I don't have so
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,728	| IOT145 |	I'm not too
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:10,752	| IOT145 |	Upset about that
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,544	| IOT145 |	Incompatibility at this point
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:14,336	| IOT145 |	One thing I would like to do and this is
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,872	| IOT145 |	Probably insane you tell me
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:20,480	| IOT145 |	When somebody comes home or somebody leaves I'd actually love for the echo to announce
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:21,504	| IOT145 |	Who laughed
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:26,112	| IOT145 |	Who came cuz I said you could do that because you can actually do it
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:28,928	| IOT145 |	And if tablet that's what I was hoping
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:31,488	| IOT145 |	So Wink 2 asked to
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:35,840	| IOT145 |	Wink and Sonos
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:37,632	| IOT145 |	Cassano's Network Sunwing
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,144	| IOT145 |	You should be able
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:39,936	| IOT145 |	Can't create a robot
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:41,216	| IOT145 |	There's my homework
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:42,496	| IOT145 |	Kevin has homework
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:43,520	| IOT145 |	It's a good show

EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,144	| IOT145 |	I was just wondering
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:12,960	| IOT145 |	We were looking at getting my grandparents either
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:15,008	| IOT145 |	An echo dot or Google home Mini
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:16,032	| IOT145 |	For Christmas
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:18,592	| IOT145 |	They do not have a tablet or a smartphone
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:20,640	| IOT145 |	But they do have a Windows 10 laptop
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:23,968	| IOT145 |	What should I be aware of and do you guys have a recommendation
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:26,272	| IOT145 |	Either way appreciate the show thanks a lot by
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:28,320	| IOT145 |	Oh Adam
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,600	| IOT145 |	We have good news for you
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:30,624	| IOT145 |	Definitive
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,416	| IOT145 |	Your recommendation
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,976	| IOT145 |	What's an Amazon Echo
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:37,280	| IOT145 |	Explain why
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:43,424	| IOT145 |	There's a very good reason to go with an echo in this particular circumstance and that is you can actually
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:45,984	| IOT145 |	Configure and use an echo
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:47,008	| IOT145 |	To a web-based
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:47,776	| IOT145 |	App
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,056	| IOT145 |	On Amazon site
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:55,456	| IOT145 |	If you point your browser at Alexa. Amazon.com you'll have basically a Weatherford version of the
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:58,272	| IOT145 |	App that's used on smartphones to manage the echo devices
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:26:04,416	| IOT145 |	In fact I kind of think that the app is really built on web Technologies and they put a wrap around it but that's a guess.
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:07,744	| IOT145 |	Regardless you can do everything you need to do
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:11,072	| IOT145 |	Setting up the account and the devices right from there
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,096	| IOT145 |	Configure everything
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:15,680	| IOT145 |	You can type reminders you can do all sorts of stuff which is fantastic
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:16,704	| IOT145 |	Sex with no smartphone needed
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:19,008	| IOT145 |	You have to have a smartphone
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:23,616	| IOT145 |	To use the Google home or the Google mini that's the downside there's no
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:25,152	| IOT145 |	Computer-based way to
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:26,688	| IOT145 |	Work with us so
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:28,992	| IOT145 |	This site is a fine it's a gold mine I say
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:30,016	| IOT145 |	I think what do you think stays
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:33,344	| IOT145 |	I actually I was so excited because now knowing that
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:38,208	| IOT145 |	Type in reminders to go to my Echo Show which is downstairs in my kitchen knowing that I can do that
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:38,976	| IOT145 |	From far away
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:42,304	| IOT145 |	Or just to like if I'm not in town and I can just send
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:43,584	| IOT145 |	Reminder basically to Mike
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:44,352	| IOT145 |	Kitchen two people
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:45,120	| IOT145 |	I think that's awesome
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:47,936	| IOT145 |	Cuz I don't forget
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:49,216	| IOT145 |	Karate bag
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:51,776	| IOT145 |	I'm really excited about it
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:53,056	| IOT145 |	Why does her bag take karate
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:57,152	| IOT145 |	On that note
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:59,968	| IOT145 |	Sounds like a good time to go
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:02,272	| IOT145 |	To a word from our sponsor and then
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:04,576	| IOT145 |	T up our guest this week

EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:10,976	| IOT145 |	Is basically
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:13,280	| IOT145 |	Gosh if you like combined
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,816	| IOT145 |	Iblocklist watching

EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:18,656	| IOT145 |	I think that's where you're going to
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:19,680	| IOT145 |	That's the closest I can get
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,472	| IOT145 |	Aliens
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:21,984	| IOT145 |	Aliens
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:26,080	| IOT145 |	Explain all of that and more in a moment
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:34,272	| IOT145 |	Everyone we are taking a break from this week's podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Lux
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:37,088	| IOT145 |	Products and we have robbed muninn CEO of Lex products
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:38,880	| IOT145 |	Rob can you
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:40,416	| IOT145 |	Quickly refresher audience with
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:41,696	| IOT145 |	30-second overview of the
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:43,744	| IOT145 |	I'll do it in 20
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:44,512	| IOT145 |	We are a
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,048	| IOT145 |	A proud philadelphia-based
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:47,328	| IOT145 |	Innovator of HVAC
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:52,192	| IOT145 |	Trolls and our newest product to the market is the Lux Kono smart thermostat
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:53,728	| IOT145 |	449 bucks
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,008	| IOT145 |	She got a thermostat with
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:56,288	| IOT145 |	It's a great look at has
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:59,360	| IOT145 |	The coarse knob covers connects all the major Voice assistance
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,408	| IOT145 |	And has smart features like GFS
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:03,456	| IOT145 |	Alright so now
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:04,736	| IOT145 |	We are well aware that
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:06,528	| IOT145 |	Dakota smart is your newest thermostat
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:10,368	| IOT145 |	One of the things that makes it different is that it's easy to use
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:14,976	| IOT145 |	So what type of approach did you take when designing this product that's different from other thermostat
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:18,816	| IOT145 |	But what we did was we tried to come up with something
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:19,584	| IOT145 |	Thing that would be
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:20,352	| IOT145 |	Obvious
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:21,120	| IOT145 |	Unintuitive
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:23,168	| IOT145 |	We know that from our research
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:24,192	| IOT145 |	The other smartphone
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,728	| IOT145 |	That they may look easy
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:27,776	| IOT145 |	You know you can turn the device but sometimes
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:29,056	| IOT145 |	The user interface
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:31,616	| IOT145 |	Can become confusing that's what I research shows
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:33,920	| IOT145 |	And some touchscreen models are inherently
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:34,944	| IOT145 |	Not intuitive
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:36,736	| IOT145 |	Very menu-driven and Liars
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,296	| IOT145 |	Two layers so when we looked at the Kona we wanted
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:40,320	| IOT145 |	Did you something that
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:41,088	| IOT145 |	Lyft office
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:42,112	| IOT145 |	And it wasn't
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:43,392	| IOT145 |	So with the
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:43,904	| IOT145 |	Control knob
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,952	| IOT145 |	If you are hot you
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:47,488	| IOT145 |	Turn it down to the left
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:49,024	| IOT145 |	And if you are cold you turn it up
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:49,792	| IOT145 |	To the right
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:52,608	| IOT145 |	We literally have 100% of
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:54,144	| IOT145 |	Consumers that we've talked to
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:54,912	| IOT145 |	Have said
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:55,680	| IOT145 |	I get it
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,960	| IOT145 |	I know how to operate that thermos
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:59,264	| IOT145 |	So turning the knob is awesome
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:02,848	| IOT145 |	But most smart thermostats have other features so let's talk about
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:03,616	| IOT145 |	How to get to those
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:04,896	| IOT145 |	We wanted
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:06,944	| IOT145 |	You keep it really simple on the wall
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:09,248	| IOT145 |	So you can make it warmer and cooler and sofa
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:11,296	| IOT145 |	Forethought means taking a lot of the other
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:13,600	| IOT145 |	Features and put them into the app
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:15,648	| IOT145 |	Where it's a much more natural place
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:18,720	| IOT145 |	To do things so we have our scheduling on the apus
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:22,560	| IOT145 |	Which is so easy to use we have a variety of energy saving profile
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:24,096	| IOT145 |	House to help set up the schedule quickly
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:26,144	| IOT145 |	And more importantly easily
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:27,936	| IOT145 |	In addition to controlling the
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,728	| IOT145 |	The app also has
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:31,264	| IOT145 |	The future we call Smart
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,032	| IOT145 |	That will help him
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:33,312	| IOT145 |	Realize that
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:35,360	| IOT145 |	Direct impact that their action
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,640	| IOT145 |	Tap on their wallet
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:41,760	| IOT145 |	So if they are changing temperature and they making more energy saving
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:42,528	| IOT145 |	Choice
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:44,064	| IOT145 |	Will push out a notification
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:46,112	| IOT145 |	And say good job you're going to save
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:46,880	| IOT145 |	This much
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:48,672	| IOT145 |	Percent of your bill would you like to make that app
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:49,696	| IOT145 |	Permanent setting
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:50,464	| IOT145 |	For your schedule
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:52,000	| IOT145 |	Have a choice Obby
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:52,512	| IOT145 |	Crystal yes or no
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:55,840	| IOT145 |	Will also offer tippit have to do with energy saving
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:56,608	| IOT145 |	Friends
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,888	| IOT145 |	Sensing the change of season
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:59,680	| IOT145 |	It's always a good reminder to know she
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:04,544	| IOT145 |	Should you look at the caulking on your window and the weather stripping that you have going into the cold
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:09,152	| IOT145 |	And if you had to pick out one feature in the corner that's your favor
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:10,176	| IOT145 |	What would it be
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:12,480	| IOT145 |	I think what I would say is it's got to be tonight
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:12,992	| IOT145 |	It's just
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:15,808	| IOT145 |	Put it on the wall and
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:17,088	| IOT145 |	Even if you have Grandma
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:17,856	| IOT145 |	Come over who
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:21,184	| IOT145 |	Might not like connected products struggles with the smartphone
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:22,464	| IOT145 |	When she's cool
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:26,048	| IOT145 |	She'll know how to change the thermostat to make it warmer in the guarantee
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:28,864	| IOT145 |	Excellent and Rob where can we go to find out more
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,144	| IOT145 |	Well you can
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:31,936	| IOT145 |	Could stop by your local Home Depot stores
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:36,288	| IOT145 |	You could go online to Luxe products.com and you can shop all over the intern
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:49,856	| IOT145 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,136	| IOT145 |	Chris Matthews
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:52,416	| IOT145 |	Hi Chris how are you doing
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:57,280	| IOT145 |	Hey Stacey great and you I am super well so you guys may remember
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:58,816	| IOT145 |	Hardcore listeners
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:00,608	| IOT145 |	Should remember that Chris came on
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:04,192	| IOT145 |	Couple years ago to talk about different protocols for Io
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:08,544	| IOT145 |	Now he's back with his own startup called computer
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:10,592	| IOT145 |	Ink and we are going to get into
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:11,872	| IOT145 |	Are you ready for it y'all
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:12,896	| IOT145 |	Basically
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:15,200	| IOT145 |	Blacklist blockchain for the internet
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:19,296	| IOT145 |	That's exactly a decentralized distributed
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:20,320	| IOT145 |	Supercomputing
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:22,112	| IOT145 |	Music
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:25,696	| IOT145 |	So before everyone freaks out his like
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:26,208	| IOT145 |	Quick
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:29,024	| IOT145 |	I need to get my brain in gear
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,560	| IOT145 |	We're going to talk first about your vision
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:33,120	| IOT145 |	Because I think it's important to start with
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:34,656	| IOT145 |	Why decentralisation
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,424	| IOT145 |	It's going to be so
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:36,448	| IOT145 |	Essential
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:39,776	| IOT145 |	Indeed I mean
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:45,920	| IOT145 |	Look at the numbers we keep hearing about 75 billion connected devices like by 2023
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:49,760	| IOT145 |	The cloud wasn't made to handle all of that
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:53,088	| IOT145 |	Machine data uploads and processing and
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:56,928	| IOT145 |	Go back down to things like driverless vehicles and all the
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:57,952	| IOT145 |	All the cool
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:00,768	| IOT145 |	Fantastic iot devices coming our way soon
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,048	| IOT145 |	Sure in
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:03,840	| IOT145 |	There's actually president
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:05,120	| IOT145 |	It is so in the data center
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:07,424	| IOT145 |	Way back in the day there was like
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:09,216	| IOT145 |	Like back and forth up and down
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:10,240	| IOT145 |	Traffic to the data center
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:14,848	| IOT145 |	But then as things like Facebook and Amazon
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:17,152	| IOT145 |	Things had to start pulling data for
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:18,176	| IOT145 |	From server to server
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:18,944	| IOT145 |	In the dataset
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,736	| IOT145 |	To like deliver the right
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:22,528	| IOT145 |	About
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:24,064	| IOT145 |	Became that was called East West traffic
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:25,344	| IOT145 |	And
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:27,648	| IOT145 |	The companies that were building big
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:29,696	| IOT145 |	Cloud computing and had big data centers
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:33,280	| IOT145 |	They actually had to invent a whole new ways of networking in
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:34,048	| IOT145 |	Software
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:36,096	| IOT145 |	To handle with a call East-West track
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:36,608	| IOT145 |	Taking the Datacenter
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:38,400	| IOT145 |	And what we're seeing now
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:43,008	| IOT145 |	Is a need to build that same sort of infrastructure
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:46,336	| IOT145 |	At the edge to handle all these devices sharing data
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:50,176	| IOT145 |	Between themselves in among themselves without going back to the cloud
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:52,736	| IOT145 |	That's because of latency it's
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:53,248	| IOT145 |	Cost
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:54,528	| IOT145 |	It is
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:56,064	| IOT145 |	Security even so
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:57,344	| IOT145 |	There is a
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:57,856	| IOT145 |	A big
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:00,416	| IOT145 |	You saw this need Chris
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:01,440	| IOT145 |	And then what did you say to
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:04,512	| IOT145 |	I should do something about the
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,024	| IOT145 |	How did we get here
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:12,192	| IOT145 |	What evil yes like you you look at all of these devices around us I mean they're idle like just like your laptop typic
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:15,264	| IOT145 |	Glee 80% of the time you're the fast room fast
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:17,568	| IOT145 |	Processors in them even GPU some of them
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:23,968	| IOT145 |	And they're idle 80% of time they chirp you know maybe every minute with their temperature status or what-have-you but
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:24,480	| IOT145 |	What is
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:27,040	| IOT145 |	All of these devices could just
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:29,600	| IOT145 |	Tear with each other even despair devices
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:31,904	| IOT145 |	Different manufacturers different machines
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:32,928	| IOT145 |	What if they could just
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:34,464	| IOT145 |	Pier with one another
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:36,768	| IOT145 |	And either requests work
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:38,048	| IOT145 |	Or perform work
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:41,120	| IOT145 |	For each other kind of in the secure mesh Network
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:43,424	| IOT145 |	It kind of got me thinking that we've got
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:47,520	| IOT145 |	A dramatic increase of more devices coming to the market
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:51,872	| IOT145 |	And at the same time a dramatic increase sperm or more computing power
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:54,176	| IOT145 |	For machine learning for AI
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:55,712	| IOT145 |	The cool automation
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:57,760	| IOT145 |	Things we want to do with these devices
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:34:00,576	| IOT145 |	Why not intersect the 2in
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:01,856	| IOT145 |	Make them Act
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:03,904	| IOT145 |	Stink like they're one
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:06,464	| IOT145 |	Interconnected peer-to-peer
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:07,232	| IOT145 |	Secure super
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:08,768	| IOT145 |	Okay
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:11,584	| IOT145 |	We're going to question such as
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:12,608	| IOT145 |	Battery life
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:13,632	| IOT145 |	Button
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:14,912	| IOT145 |	Beforehand
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,960	| IOT145 |	Your solution
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:17,728	| IOT145 |	Into this
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:18,496	| IOT145 |	Is decentralized
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:20,288	| IOT145 |	And
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:21,312	| IOT145 |	To take I feel like
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:23,104	| IOT145 |	Before we get into
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:24,384	| IOT145 |	What you guys are actually build
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:26,688	| IOT145 |	We should probably go into the history
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:27,712	| IOT145 |	Watching
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:28,992	| IOT145 |	Because
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:31,552	| IOT145 |	For people who are not familiar with it it's important to understand
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:32,576	| IOT145 |	And how that works with
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:33,856	| IOT145 |	Before we get into The Blacklist
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:38,208	| IOT145 |	Dip that's a great point of mean everyone seemed excited about
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:44,608	| IOT145 |	Bitcoin right like you can't turn on the radio or look at an article without someone mentioning something about the spray
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:46,144	| IOT145 |	Crazy price in Bitcoin wallet
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:47,680	| IOT145 |	That was
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:51,264	| IOT145 |	Built on blockchain technology going back
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:52,032	| IOT145 |	10 years now
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:56,384	| IOT145 |	So while it's a very cool idea you know it's allowing us to
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:35:01,760	| IOT145 |	Create decentralized distributed applications are currencies cryptocurrencies
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:03,296	| IOT145 |	That technology
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:05,088	| IOT145 |	It's kind of heavy and slow
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:07,392	| IOT145 |	All of this Computing that has to happen
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:08,160	| IOT145 |	Mike proof-of-work
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:11,488	| IOT145 |	Every node on the blockchain has to have the
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:12,000	| IOT145 |	Entire
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:14,560	| IOT145 |	Blockchain itself like
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:17,120	| IOT145 |	Copy of it in storage and
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:19,936	| IOT145 |	They're constantly updating an entire database if you
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:20,704	| IOT145 |	She will
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:24,288	| IOT145 |	Across each other all the time and doing this proof of work
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,312	| IOT145 |	Computations
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:28,384	| IOT145 |	To keep this blockchain Ledger in sink so
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:30,432	| IOT145 |	You can look at it as
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:32,480	| IOT145 |	Bitcoin or another crypto
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:36,064	| IOT145 |	Two currencies run on the blockchain in a blockchain is really no more than
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:37,344	| IOT145 |	Egg
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:38,880	| IOT145 |	Decentralized
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:41,184	| IOT145 |	Database like a database where every
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:41,952	| IOT145 |	Pier
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:43,744	| IOT145 |	On a network has a copy of it
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:45,792	| IOT145 |	Now proof of work
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:47,328	| IOT145 |	Which is essential for
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:49,376	| IOT145 |	Establishing authenticity
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:50,400	| IOT145 |	Correct
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:52,448	| IOT145 |	Want to make sure 4
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:58,848	| IOT145 |	And that's kind of the point of
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:00,640	| IOT145 |	What chain is it the distributor
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:01,664	| IOT145 |	2
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:02,944	| IOT145 |	Trust
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,456	| IOT145 |	Things
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:04,992	| IOT145 |	Which is really exciting
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:06,016	| IOT145 |	Coyote
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:07,296	| IOT145 |	And I always
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:08,576	| IOT145 |	It was like and it's scales
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:11,904	| IOT145 |	So what you're telling me here is that it doesn't scale
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:13,696	| IOT145 |	Or at least it doesn't scale
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:16,256	| IOT145 |	Very fast speeds and it takes a lot of power
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:18,816	| IOT145 |	Entire database
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:23,424	| IOT145 |	Yeah you know I think the Bitcoin blockchain last I looked at
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:25,216	| IOT145 |	The three-point numbers with something around 3
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:29,312	| IOT145 |	Three transactions a second theory emits biggest kind of blockchain
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:31,104	| IOT145 |	Competitor platform is
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:32,384	| IOT145 |	Somewhere around
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:34,944	| IOT145 |	A dozen transactions per second so
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:36,224	| IOT145 |	You can see that y'all
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:40,576	| IOT145 |	For the world moving all of these it devices to that type of
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:41,088	| IOT145 |	Technology
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:46,208	| IOT145 |	What's really cool is decentralized it stressful than a trustless environment
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:51,072	| IOT145 |	It is having some difficulty scaling to meet the demand of all of the nodes coming online
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:52,352	| IOT145 |	For reference
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,120	| IOT145 |	It's just so you
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:54,144	| IOT145 |	Case you guys want to know
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:56,192	| IOT145 |	Lisa says it handles more than 24
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:56,704	| IOT145 |	4000
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:00,800	| IOT145 |	That's a big disparity
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:03,104	| IOT145 |	So when we're talking about
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:05,152	| IOT145 |	Visa is the largest
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:07,712	| IOT145 |	Payment processor in the world
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:08,992	| IOT145 |	Kind of what we're hoping for right
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:12,064	| IOT145 |	Let's talk about the evolution
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:13,856	| IOT145 |	Because
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:16,928	| IOT145 |	There's been a couple there's one that's huge in the internet.
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:17,952	| IOT145 |	Things called the iota
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:19,232	| IOT145 |	And these are so-called
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:20,768	| IOT145 |	Blocklist watching
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:22,048	| IOT145 |	Explain what
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:29,472	| IOT145 |	Yeah and computer is doing something very similar to what I owed is doing and I do truly believe this is kind of neck
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:29,984	| IOT145 |	Next gen
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,776	| IOT145 |	Blockchain like
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:33,056	| IOT145 |	Technology so
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:37,920	| IOT145 |	The idea is to throw a few acronyms at you and will maybe try to break them down but
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:40,992	| IOT145 |	There's this technology called a dag
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:44,320	| IOT145 |	A d a g and it's a directed acylic graph
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:51,232	| IOT145 |	It's not new developers that have been writing code using git and GitHub have been using gags whether they know it
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,536	| IOT145 |	For a decade now
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:58,656	| IOT145 |	The idea is that it's a bunch of like branches off of a tree where every
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:02,752	| IOT145 |	Commit or every update has a hash
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:04,032	| IOT145 |	A crypto hash
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:06,848	| IOT145 |	Is colic a 36 character Looking hash
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:09,152	| IOT145 |	That it relates back
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:10,688	| IOT145 |	To what its parents were
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:12,224	| IOT145 |	So you can kind of take one
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:14,016	| IOT145 |	Update in the system
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:18,112	| IOT145 |	And trace it all the way back through all the branches
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:19,904	| IOT145 |	Is the trees the parents to create
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:21,440	| IOT145 |	Basically a ledger
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:23,744	| IOT145 |	Of all of the transactions of happen
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:24,256	| IOT145 |	Intimidate
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:25,792	| IOT145 |	Without having
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:27,840	| IOT145 |	To do things like proof of work
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:31,424	| IOT145 |	Where you're actually having to track blocks and crate
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:34,240	| IOT145 |	Ashes of blocks to connect in the Dag
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:36,032	| IOT145 |	Automatically
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:40,384	| IOT145 |	Associate transactions with one another that allow you to trace it all the way back
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:42,432	| IOT145 |	Without proof of work
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,456	| IOT145 |	The other ideas at
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:45,248	| IOT145 |	It's very fast
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:46,016	| IOT145 |	Like
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:49,856	| IOT145 |	I'm kind of seeing the some of the earlier designs of computers being
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:51,392	| IOT145 |	Faster
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:53,184	| IOT145 |	5 more nodes you add
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:59,328	| IOT145 |	To the system that's counterintuitive how blockchain Works in one more other really important thing I think as it applies iot
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:01,376	| IOT145 |	Is that with the Dag
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:06,240	| IOT145 |	You don't have to maintain that entire database of transactions
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:08,032	| IOT145 |	On the iot device
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:09,312	| IOT145 |	They all just become
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:12,640	| IOT145 |	Computers that can read and write to kind of a
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:14,432	| IOT145 |	Mesh network of a dag so
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:16,480	| IOT145 |	Devices like
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:18,528	| IOT145 |	I don't know like maybe a hue lighting or
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:23,136	| IOT145 |	The Nest thermostats where they don't have enough storage to maintain like a
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:23,904	| IOT145 |	Blockchain
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:25,952	| IOT145 |	They could then participate
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:28,512	| IOT145 |	On networks like
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:31,328	| IOT145 |	What Iota is building and what computers building
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:32,608	| IOT145 |	And so you got
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:33,632	| IOT145 |	Very fast transaction
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:36,448	| IOT145 |	Very low storage if any
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:40,800	| IOT145 |	Basically an infrastructure less blockchain like technology
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:43,360	| IOT145 |	Let's break some things down
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:44,128	| IOT145 |	So what I'm thinking of
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:46,688	| IOT145 |	Is 36 character hash
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:48,480	| IOT145 |	I'm thinking
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:52,320	| IOT145 |	Would a good analogy be something like in Latin America for example
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:53,344	| IOT145 |	But you have people
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:55,392	| IOT145 |	You take your mother's maiden name
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:56,928	| IOT145 |	You take your father's name and you
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:57,696	| IOT145 |	Become to know
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:39:58,976	| IOT145 |	Crispy out Ramirez
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:00,768	| IOT145 |	And then your kid be
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:03,072	| IOT145 |	You always bring your mother's
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:06,656	| IOT145 |	So it's that
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:07,936	| IOT145 |	Now
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:08,704	| IOT145 |	How many
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:09,984	| IOT145 |	Characters like
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:11,264	| IOT145 |	How does this hash happen
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:13,056	| IOT145 |	And how does it
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:14,848	| IOT145 |	I mean there's only so many numbers and letters in
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:16,384	| IOT145 |	How is it unique
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:17,152	| IOT145 |	Can how do you follow that
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:19,200	| IOT145 |	Yes sir
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:20,480	| IOT145 |	You can also go back
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:23,040	| IOT145 |	From a security perspective decades
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:28,672	| IOT145 |	Thinking of how the Shah system works like sha-256 or Rochelle one what have you
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:33,024	| IOT145 |	Have you eaten
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:33,536	| IOT145 |	Talk to me
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:37,632	| IOT145 |	So there's this concept in cryptography where you can take
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:39,424	| IOT145 |	Any content it could be
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:44,288	| IOT145 |	A text new string or it could be like an address or could be like a
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:45,568	| IOT145 |	Encyclopedia
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:46,336	| IOT145 |	She will
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:48,384	| IOT145 |	And you can run
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:49,408	| IOT145 |	A crypto
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:55,552	| IOT145 |	Algorithm against it then there's a few there's like md5 and charges some examples of what I'm talking about
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:58,368	| IOT145 |	And what they do is they give you back at unique
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:40:59,392	| IOT145 |	Hash
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:01,696	| IOT145 |	A string of like alphanumeric
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:03,488	| IOT145 |	Text with some dashes in it
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:05,280	| IOT145 |	That always
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:07,072	| IOT145 |	Equate to what you just
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:09,120	| IOT145 |	Okay set a reverse so if
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:10,144	| IOT145 |	If you have
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:12,192	| IOT145 |	The algorithm that was used to create this
EDL	00:41:13,216	00:41:14,496	| IOT145 |	In Rio de Oro
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:17,056	| IOT145 |	Then you can read it
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:19,360	| IOT145 |	Then you can run your hash algorithm
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:20,640	| IOT145 |	And get all the info
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:21,408	| IOT145 |	Formation you need
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:27,296	| IOT145 |	Well kind of so it's not decrypt Apple so it's a one-way it's like a one-way hash but what's
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:30,112	| IOT145 |	Interesting though is that if you add one
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:34,208	| IOT145 |	Space near to that document and you rehash it the hashes are
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:38,560	| IOT145 |	So it is a way of always saying okay if I'm looking for
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:40,608	| IOT145 |	This file that says hello world
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:44,704	| IOT145 |	It will always have that same hash no matter if I right
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:45,728	| IOT145 |	The file or you right
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:46,496	| IOT145 |	Pedophile
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:47,776	| IOT145 |	It's a way of
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:49,568	| IOT145 |	I guess uniquely identifying
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:52,895	| IOT145 |	A resource on this kind of peer-to-peer
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:54,175	| IOT145 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:54,943	| IOT145 |	By saying
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:56,735	| IOT145 |	We're all going to Hash it the same
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:57,247	| IOT145 |	Same way
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:42:01,599	| IOT145 |	And even a. Or space is going to give us a different hash it's a
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:02,111	| IOT145 |	Profile
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:03,391	| IOT145 |	Okay
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,671	| IOT145 |	So this is the day
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:07,231	| IOT145 |	We've got a sense of what the dag is
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:08,767	| IOT145 |	What else do we need
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:10,303	| IOT145 |	So
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:11,071	| IOT145 |	Like with
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:12,607	| IOT145 |	Computes anyway the Dag
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:17,983	| IOT145 |	Is cool everything that's a way of kind of creating like you explain kind of names are parents
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:18,495	| IOT145 |	In history
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:22,591	| IOT145 |	But there needs to be a way kind of like the blockchain works where
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:25,407	| IOT145 |	You need to have something that knows how to
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:26,175	| IOT145 |	Handle
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:27,967	| IOT145 |	Choose if you will like
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:29,759	| IOT145 |	With computes you can say
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:32,575	| IOT145 |	Like say the nest Princeton's could say
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:35,391	| IOT145 |	This is just totally hypothetical but the nest could say
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:38,975	| IOT145 |	Hey I need to do some machine learning on whether or not
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:42,047	| IOT145 |	This person that owns me is home or not can anyone help me
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:47,935	| IOT145 |	Maybe cuz maybe I don't have enough processing power do it all by myself and I don't want to send it all to the Google Cloud
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:50,751	| IOT145 |	Maybe I could have my Hue Lights and
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:54,591	| IOT145 |	My owners Mac and maybe some raspberry Pi's are sitting around
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:56,383	| IOT145 |	Like all
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:57,663	| IOT145 |	Join in when needed
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:43:01,503	| IOT145 |	And could do some computations to help me figure out
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:05,087	| IOT145 |	If someone's home or not based on these machine-learning algorithms
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:07,135	| IOT145 |	That type of
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:10,207	| IOT145 |	Process requires some type of orchestrator
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:15,327	| IOT145 |	Decentralized q-type technology that knows how to say here are all the
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:18,911	| IOT145 |	Yeah hundreds or thousands of computations that need work
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:23,007	| IOT145 |	Who's available know who has extra resources
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:26,079	| IOT145 |	Who can run JavaScript who can run python
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:27,103	| IOT145 |	Yo what have you
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:30,687	| IOT145 |	And distribute that work in such a way where there's really
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:34,015	| IOT145 |	No servers persay in this environment
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:36,063	| IOT145 |	It's just all of these piers
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:39,135	| IOT145 |	Know how to communicate with one another and
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:40,927	| IOT145 |	Help each other out
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:41,695	| IOT145 |	Tachevah
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:44,767	| IOT145 |	Yo computations and whatnot locally
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:48,351	| IOT145 |	Amongst themselves in a secure fashion without going to the
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:49,119	| IOT145 |	The cloud sofa
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:52,703	| IOT145 |	That's kind of another layer to this tag ideas that you need
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:56,287	| IOT145 |	Some other way of writing decentralized apps
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:44:00,639	| IOT145 |	That know how to run in this type of environment so you need a brain for
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:02,687	| IOT145 |	Decentralized app so everything has to have
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:03,711	| IOT145 |	A brain
EDL	00:44:04,735	00:44:05,759	| IOT145 |	Betabrand
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:08,575	| IOT145 |	Pretty pretty resource-intensive or memory-intensive
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:10,111	| IOT145 |	I would think so
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:11,647	| IOT145 |	How do you handle that
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:18,559	| IOT145 |	But yeah that's kind of the cool thing I remember and I can't remember if it was Cisco or who used to sneak this claim like
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:23,167	| IOT145 |	Ocwen switches were getting really popular they would say that the network is the computer
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:25,471	| IOT145 |	Hello is fascinated by that idea but I think
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:30,335	| IOT145 |	What we're building now truly is that the network itself
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:31,103	| IOT145 |	Is the brain
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:38,015	| IOT145 |	Like all of the nodes there's no servers they just know how to organically self-organized selfie
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:39,295	| IOT145 |	Real self
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:41,087	| IOT145 |	Collaborate with one another
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:45,183	| IOT145 |	To do various machine learning or AI related
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:45,951	| IOT145 |	Jobs
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:47,231	| IOT145 |	Okay
EDL	00:44:47,231	00:44:48,511	| IOT145 |	But what do
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:50,303	| IOT145 |	The individual devices need
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:52,095	| IOT145 |	In order to be able to
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:53,375	| IOT145 |	Participate in this
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:45:00,799	| IOT145 |	Dip perfect question so with computes they would need a very small little five megabyte size
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:01,823	| IOT145 |	Is very small
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:05,407	| IOT145 |	What we call a nano core or computes manticore
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:06,943	| IOT145 |	That gives them
EDL	00:45:06,943	00:45:07,711	| IOT145 |	The
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:12,831	| IOT145 |	Operations to automatically match with one another and
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:14,111	| IOT145 |	Join that Dag
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:17,439	| IOT145 |	And participate in that queuing
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:18,207	| IOT145 |	Brain
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:19,231	| IOT145 |	Technology
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:20,767	| IOT145 |	I feel like we're saying brains on
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:24,607	| IOT145 |	Okay
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:26,911	| IOT145 |	You know I have a fascination
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:29,983	| IOT145 |	For Skynet I'm always trying to build Skynet weather
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:31,775	| IOT145 |	Do octopus do or what have you been
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:33,823	| IOT145 |	You could almost kind of
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:34,335	| IOT145 |	Look at like
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:37,151	| IOT145 |	Relationship that it was
EDL	00:45:37,151	00:45:38,175	| IOT145 |	Global
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:39,967	| IOT145 |	Decentralized
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:40,991	| IOT145 |	Neural-net supercab
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:43,039	| IOT145 |	Right
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:46,623	| IOT145 |	I know you love Skynet but
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:51,231	| IOT145 |	What was the we're going to build a nice version of Skynet
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:55,839	| IOT145 |	So I can put this on the device is something that
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:45:59,679	| IOT145 |	You don't manufacturers will need to do is this stuff that like I has a
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:02,495	| IOT145 |	The crazy individual in my house want to do like how does that work
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:11,711	| IOT145 |	I like great example I think it's all of the above so we were talking with computer vision company the other day
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:18,367	| IOT145 |	And they were telling me that they're using cameras basically a sensors new iot devices as sensors but not for video stream
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:25,279	| IOT145 |	And they were saying that to do the machine learning they needed to Dubai on each camera that they needed like an octave
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:28,863	| IOT145 |	Core processor that was doing all of this machine learning
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:30,655	| IOT145 |	In real time on the camera
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:31,679	| IOT145 |	NetSpend
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:33,983	| IOT145 |	Yeah right right right
EDL	00:46:33,983	00:46:38,847	| IOT145 |	So what they were asking is you if there's a hundred cameras around a facility in office
EDL	00:46:39,359	00:46:40,383	| IOT145 |	Complex or camp
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:42,431	| IOT145 |	Could they distribute
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:45,759	| IOT145 |	The work two cameras that have no change in video
EDL	00:46:46,271	00:46:49,087	| IOT145 |	So that you could argana Klee kind of crate this message
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:52,671	| IOT145 |	Share the processing workload across the entire network
EDL	00:46:53,439	00:46:56,511	| IOT145 |	So that maybe you could get away with like a Raspberry Pi level
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:46:58,047	| IOT145 |	Processor needs
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:46:58,815	| IOT145 |	Cameron
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:02,911	| IOT145 |	So in that instance they would be interested in Gnomeo emminger
EDL	00:47:02,911	00:47:06,495	| IOT145 |	Deploying computes just basically inside of their cameras
EDL	00:47:06,495	00:47:08,031	| IOT145 |	But to your other point
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:11,103	| IOT145 |	I think we're near the whole Bitcoin movement
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:13,663	| IOT145 |	It's kind of got a lot of people thinking about
EDL	00:47:13,663	00:47:14,943	| IOT145 |	Uber
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:16,479	| IOT145 |	Supercomputing idea like
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:17,759	| IOT145 |	What if
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:18,783	| IOT145 |	You have
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:20,063	| IOT145 |	Idle City
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:21,343	| IOT145 |	Use on your Mac
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:25,695	| IOT145 |	And you want to earn some extra money by letting
EDL	00:47:25,695	00:47:28,511	| IOT145 |	Computer run on those the only secure fashion
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:30,303	| IOT145 |	That allows other
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:36,703	| IOT145 |	Companies to use your idle CPUs and gpus for computations but pay you for it so kind of like
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:38,495	| IOT145 |	Uber when you say
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:39,775	| IOT145 |	I want to drive for an hour
EDL	00:47:39,775	00:47:41,311	| IOT145 |	Well you can say I want to
EDL	00:47:41,311	00:47:43,871	| IOT145 |	Share my CPUs for an hour maybe you'll make
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:46,687	| IOT145 |	Now $5 an hour or whatever
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:49,247	| IOT145 |	Ambition the size of your processing power
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:51,295	| IOT145 |	Yeah you could earn you accordingly
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:53,343	| IOT145 |	How to say that micropayments
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:53,855	| IOT145 |	They're not quite sure
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:56,159	| IOT145 |	And I have lots
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:59,487	| IOT145 |	Talk to so many companies over the years who have tried to do that
EDL	00:47:59,999	00:48:01,023	| IOT145 |	Various iterations
EDL	00:48:01,791	00:48:02,559	| IOT145 |	And
EDL	00:48:02,559	00:48:03,583	| IOT145 |	Almost all of them
EDL	00:48:03,583	00:48:04,095	| IOT145 |	Have pivoted
EDL	00:48:04,607	00:48:05,375	| IOT145 |	So
EDL	00:48:05,375	00:48:06,399	| IOT145 |	I'm a little worried about that ass
EDL	00:48:07,167	00:48:07,679	| IOT145 |	But I like it
EDL	00:48:11,775	00:48:17,919	| IOT145 |	Yeah I think it's a good point I think we're focusing burst is really B2B so we're looking at companies you know that have
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:22,527	| IOT145 |	Was already thousands of servers thousands of workstations
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:27,903	| IOT145 |	Yo they see the demand for more more machine-learning computations coming at them and
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:28,927	| IOT145 |	Rather than
EDL	00:48:28,927	00:48:31,999	| IOT145 |	Buying more servers or more cloud services
EDL	00:48:31,999	00:48:33,535	| IOT145 |	Yo what if they could just
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:35,327	| IOT145 |	We could harness all of that
EDL	00:48:35,327	00:48:35,839	| IOT145 |	Wasted
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:36,863	| IOT145 |	Compute
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:42,495	| IOT145 |	In their existing hardware and give them basically access to the very own supercomputer
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:48,895	| IOT145 |	Without nail buying any additional Hardware so that's the first goal but I think to your second Point are your point about the
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:49,407	| IOT145 |	Micropayments
EDL	00:48:49,919	00:48:50,687	| IOT145 |	I think with the
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:56,831	| IOT145 |	Blockchain it's too expensive to do those proof of work and computations wear something like that
EDL	00:48:56,831	00:48:58,879	| IOT145 |	Which really efficient really fast
EDL	00:48:58,879	00:49:02,975	| IOT145 |	That might be the right technology to finally make micropayments work
EDL	00:49:02,975	00:49:05,791	| IOT145 |	When we get around to doing BTC type activity
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:07,327	| IOT145 |	Okay let's see
EDL	00:49:08,095	00:49:08,863	| IOT145 |	I feel like we've
EDL	00:49:08,863	00:49:09,887	| IOT145 |	We covered a lot of things
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:11,679	| IOT145 |	Is there something else you wanted
EDL	00:49:12,191	00:49:12,703	| IOT145 |	Well
EDL	00:49:13,215	00:49:18,335	| IOT145 |	I agree with you I think this is fascinating to me I've been thinking about this for a couple of years now
EDL	00:49:18,335	00:49:19,871	| IOT145 |	And this idea that
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:23,455	| IOT145 |	Any device regardless of operating system
EDL	00:49:23,455	00:49:26,271	| IOT145 |	Even using clouds themselves uidaho
EDL	00:49:26,271	00:49:27,551	| IOT145 |	Computing clouds
EDL	00:49:27,551	00:49:29,087	| IOT145 |	All connected together
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:36,255	| IOT145 |	Could be something very interesting especially as you know a lot of vendor iot platform companies are trying to figure out how to
EDL	00:49:36,255	00:49:36,767	| IOT145 |	Shift
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:39,327	| IOT145 |	From Cloud to the edge
EDL	00:49:39,327	00:49:45,727	| IOT145 |	A lot of them are taking approaches where your they're deploying new appliances on the edge I think this concept
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:46,751	| IOT145 |	Is a lot of Merit wear
EDL	00:49:47,263	00:49:48,031	| IOT145 |	Each
EDL	00:49:48,031	00:49:49,567	| IOT145 |	Device or each
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:51,615	| IOT145 |	Computing resource basically
EDL	00:49:51,615	00:49:55,455	| IOT145 |	Is an auteur is a core on this mesh Network
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:56,735	| IOT145 |	We
EDL	00:49:56,735	00:49:59,807	| IOT145 |	May reach a point where you don't need an appliance
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:02,879	| IOT145 |	Anymore just basically everything computes
EDL	00:50:03,391	00:50:05,439	| IOT145 |	And ultimately it's infinite
EDL	00:50:05,439	00:50:06,719	| IOT145 |	Computing I think
EDL	00:50:06,719	00:50:07,999	| IOT145 |	In this new world of
EDL	00:50:07,999	00:50:08,767	| IOT145 |	CEO of
EDL	00:50:08,767	00:50:11,583	| IOT145 |	Hockey stick number of devices coming to Market in
EDL	00:50:11,583	00:50:15,167	| IOT145 |	They're getting more more powerful I think this is just fascinating
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:17,983	| IOT145 |	You can be in and it's not easy I mean there's a lot of
EDL	00:50:17,983	00:50:19,519	| IOT145 |	Google problems we're having to solve
EDL	00:50:19,519	00:50:21,311	| IOT145 |	Computer science related problems
EDL	00:50:21,311	00:50:23,359	| IOT145 |	But I think that's what makes it
EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:25,151	| IOT145 |	Even more fun and even more fascinating
