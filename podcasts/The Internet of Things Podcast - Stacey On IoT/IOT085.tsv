EDL	00:00:15,360	00:00:16,384	| IOT085 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:16,384	00:00:17,408	| IOT085 |	And today
EDL	00:00:17,408	00:00:18,176	| IOT085 |	We have
EDL	00:00:18,944	00:00:21,504	| IOT085 |	We have a show for you today
EDL	00:00:22,272	00:00:24,064	| IOT085 |	We're going to get started
EDL	00:00:24,576	00:00:25,600	| IOT085 |	Some talk about Trump
EDL	00:00:25,600	00:00:27,136	| IOT085 |	Because last time we recorded the show
EDL	00:00:27,648	00:00:28,160	| IOT085 |	Weah
EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:29,440	| IOT085 |	We didn't have a
EDL	00:00:29,440	00:00:35,328	| IOT085 |	President-elect Trump an update to the routers a little bit about
EDL	00:00:35,840	00:00:38,912	| IOT085 |	Little bit about Verizon a new Wi-Fi water sensor that is
EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:39,424	| IOT085 |	This is so new
EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:40,704	| IOT085 |	People would like to know about
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:43,776	| IOT085 |	Bread connected even with a i
EDL	00:00:43,776	00:00:44,800	| IOT085 |	And
EDL	00:00:44,800	00:00:48,128	| IOT085 |	Solutions for my Google home problems from last week
EDL	00:00:48,128	00:00:50,944	| IOT085 |	We also have a message from our sponsor Bluetooth
EDL	00:00:50,944	00:00:53,248	| IOT085 |	And our guest is Rob Martin
EDL	00:00:53,760	00:00:54,784	| IOT085 |	A futurist
EDL	00:00:54,784	00:00:55,808	| IOT085 |	Porsche leg
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:00:56,576	| IOT085 |	The lock company
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:57,856	| IOT085 |	Talking about
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:00:59,136	| IOT085 |	You guess it
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:00:59,904	| IOT085 |	Doorbells
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:01,696	| IOT085 |	Locksmith
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:04,768	| IOT085 |	Before we get to all of that
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:05,792	| IOT085 |	I want to give you
EDL	00:01:05,792	00:01:07,584	| IOT085 |	This week's sponsor
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:08,608	| IOT085 |	Which is Samsung
EDL	00:01:09,120	00:01:15,520	| IOT085 |	Are you a manufacturer service provider looking for the fastest path to enterprise-grade secure interoperable in an
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:21,920	| IOT085 |	Intelligent iot based products and services Samsung artik Smart iot platform is that
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:24,480	| IOT085 |	Learn more about how to leverage Arctic
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:30,880	| IOT085 |	Arctic. IO I actually signed up for this because you can actually control Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:35,232	| IOT085 |	Send stuff through your Echo I check that out let y'all know how that goes
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:36,512	| IOT085 |	All right
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:38,304	| IOT085 |	Now onto the show
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:43,936	| IOT085 |	Yeah we recorded last week a little bit early because
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:47,264	| IOT085 |	I was traveling I want to interfere with my right to vote so
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:51,872	| IOT085 |	I think we recorded on Monday we voted on Tuesday and then the show came out later
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:53,152	| IOT085 |	Does the first timer talking about
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:54,944	| IOT085 |	President-elect
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,016	| IOT085 |	Kevin
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:01:59,040	| IOT085 |	The Battleground state
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:00,320	| IOT085 |	Pennsylvania
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:03,392	| IOT085 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:10,304	| IOT085 |	And then just to be clear we're not we're not here to trial up or talk about politics or left vs right views we want to talk about
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,584	| IOT085 |	El potential
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:14,400	| IOT085 |	Policy changes could impact the Smart Home
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:20,800	| IOT085 |	The climate and so on and I say climate only because I think my old house I had 41 solar panels and have a Chevy Volt
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:22,336	| IOT085 |	4 years and I miss both of those
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:24,384	| IOT085 |	Townhouse
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,152	| IOT085 |	But
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,688	| IOT085 |	With this
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,736	| IOT085 |	Presidential
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:29,760	| IOT085 |	Shange
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:31,808	| IOT085 |	Looks like a lot of the
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:34,112	| IOT085 |	I I would I suspect a lot of the subsidies
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:36,928	| IOT085 |	Is for those type of things are going away so I'm
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:38,464	| IOT085 |	Literally scrambling to
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,488	| IOT085 |	Change my car I think
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:40,768	| IOT085 |	Logo with us
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:42,560	| IOT085 |	Another vltor need a bolt
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:50,496	| IOT085 |	I know you love yours and I know why and I look for used ones and I couldn't touch one for under 49 or 50
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:53,568	| IOT085 |	Grand and that's just more than I can or want to spend right now
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,104	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:57,664	| IOT085 |	I think what I will do is look in the
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:03:03,040	| IOT085 |	30-ish thousand-dollar range that is Alexa a lot of option scares far more options than
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,320	| IOT085 |	Back in 2013 when I
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:06,624	| IOT085 |	I should say four more viable option
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,672	| IOT085 |	10 miles in 2013
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:10,464	| IOT085 |	Squeezable 2013
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:16,608	| IOT085 |	3 years and it was great for us cuz you didn't have any range anxiety you need to go 40 miles
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:19,680	| IOT085 |	300 some odd miles with gasoline
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:24,800	| IOT085 |	Now it's I think it's 53 miles on a battery with a new volt
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,592	| IOT085 |	And
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:30,432	| IOT085 |	Even further with the gas generator that's in there
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:33,760	| IOT085 |	But I'm actually intrigued by this new Chevy bolt with a B
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:37,856	| IOT085 |	I don't have seen this Stacy I have why is that better
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:40,160	| IOT085 |	Why are you introvert
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:44,256	| IOT085 |	It's a little more expensive right of the battery it's also not on any
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:46,304	| IOT085 |	GM dealership place as of
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:50,912	| IOT085 |	Right now at least when I checked yesterday I was looking into this you know
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:56,032	| IOT085 |	Because the size of the battery qualifies for a full $7,500 federal tax credit currently
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,080	| IOT085 |	I just like the volt in many other
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:00,128	| IOT085 |	Vehicles based on the battery size
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:00,640	| IOT085 |	By the way
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:04,736	| IOT085 |	So if you buy something with a smaller battery mean I got $7,500 in my pocket
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:06,528	| IOT085 |	It's 4154
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:09,856	| IOT085 |	Maybe a spark EV or a Kia Soul or whatever
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:12,928	| IOT085 |	Any case I'm the bolt is all electric
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:17,024	| IOT085 |	The cost of electricity to go a certain distance is
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:18,559	| IOT085 |	Cheaper than the cost
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:21,375	| IOT085 |	2 Diesel and gas than the math many many times
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,399	| IOT085 |	And obviously
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:28,543	| IOT085 |	It really didn't matter at all when I have solar panels because I was creating my own electricity so that was a beautiful combination right there
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,591	| IOT085 |	Don't have those but I still would like to go Electric
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:35,199	| IOT085 |	Not just because it's cheaper though but because of the emissions and
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:38,527	| IOT085 |	Literally just before the election I had seen
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,807	| IOT085 |	Before the Flood
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:44,159	| IOT085 |	A documentary from 3/9 go on climate change and whether you believe it or not
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:49,279	| IOT085 |	I recommend people go watch it at least just educate yourself and make a more informed
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,815	| IOT085 |	Decision on climate change
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:53,631	| IOT085 |	And since then I've actually made some changes in my life I've
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,143	| IOT085 |	Got rid of beef
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:56,959	| IOT085 |	You can watch the documentary understand why I did that
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,751	| IOT085 |	And also have thought about
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,287	| IOT085 |	The emissions that were put in there
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:03,359	| IOT085 |	Yes I love being an electric car in like
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:05,407	| IOT085 |	The fact that I can
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:08,223	| IOT085 |	But if I need to I can idle I don't usually idle ever
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:12,831	| IOT085 |	But like if I'm stuck at a traffic light on my car I'm not doing anything
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,879	| IOT085 |	Exactly
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:17,439	| IOT085 |	Nike with your solar panels back in the day
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:18,719	| IOT085 |	I do
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,743	| IOT085 |	My car does
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:23,839	| IOT085 |	Take energy which can be generated in unfriendly ways
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,119	| IOT085 |	In Austin
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,471	| IOT085 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:32,031	| IOT085 |	For the premium
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:36,639	| IOT085 |	So that's one and I wrote in my
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:39,199	| IOT085 |	My newsletter last week I actually did a thing on
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:43,551	| IOT085 |	What Trump means for the internet of things and I should tell you guys
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,063	| IOT085 |	The cyber
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:50,463	| IOT085 |	I should tell you guys that I have this iot newsletter so please go to Stacey on iot
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,743	| IOT085 |	Dot-com to sign up
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:54,303	| IOT085 |	If that's your thing and you want to hear even more coyotes
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:58,399	| IOT085 |	But basically based on the things that he has said
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:01,215	| IOT085 |	And written in his like contract
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:02,239	| IOT085 |	100 days contract
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,031	| IOT085 |	What Kevin said is
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:04,543	| IOT085 |	Probably true
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:08,639	| IOT085 |	I would worry about my subsidies and get that in for green stuff
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:11,455	| IOT085 |	Solar electric vehicles
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,991	| IOT085 |	And get that in early
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,271	| IOT085 |	If you are
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:17,855	| IOT085 |	Thing about smart cities though I would say that he actually could do
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,647	| IOT085 |	A lot there because
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:21,695	| IOT085 |	He plans on making infrastructure investment
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:25,535	| IOT085 |	So I anticipate seeing a switch from
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:28,607	| IOT085 |	Smart cities marketing from things like
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,911	| IOT085 |	OLED conserving energy to
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,191	| IOT085 |	Oh
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:33,471	| IOT085 |	What's what grade are infrastructure
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,007	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:35,775	| IOT085 |	That could
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:42,175	| IOT085 |	Be good I talk to parents are the personal details and Rehabilitation obviously you know
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,711	| IOT085 |	Something new it feels like
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:45,503	| IOT085 |	Why wouldn't you start
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:48,063	| IOT085 |	Implementing some of these kind of sensor BAE Systems
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:54,463	| IOT085 |	We'll see the other thing is I was at a conference and there was someone
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,231	| IOT085 |	Cubesat
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:58,815	| IOT085 |	They're the tiny little satellites that are very cheap to produce you toss them up in
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:03,167	| IOT085 |	Into space in space
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:09,055	| IOT085 |	No Utah some up and those guys were concerned that
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,103	| IOT085 |	Trump Vice
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:16,735	| IOT085 |	Change the licensing agreements for how they share they sell their information all around the world except
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,271	| IOT085 |	Countries like Iran
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:19,807	| IOT085 |	North Korea
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:21,855	| IOT085 |	They're worried that that might change
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:23,903	| IOT085 |	So the data that they share their data green
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,695	| IOT085 |	Smite
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,719	| IOT085 |	Being finished
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,511	| IOT085 |	They were actually pretty
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:32,607	| IOT085 |	Bullish on a trump presidency because they said the defense spending would be
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:33,631	| IOT085 |	Phenomenal
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,191	| IOT085 |	There is that
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:37,983	| IOT085 |	And that's pretty much
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:38,751	| IOT085 |	Where things stand
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:43,103	| IOT085 |	For the smart home perspective because I actually just had someone ask me
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,407	| IOT085 |	Trump's economic policies
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:46,943	| IOT085 |	Make
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:48,991	| IOT085 |	Life worse off for the middle class
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:51,551	| IOT085 |	Then we're probably going to see people stop spending
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,599	| IOT085 |	Devices
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:56,671	| IOT085 |	At a macro-level the trends that are affecting
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:57,695	| IOT085 |	Industry
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:59,743	| IOT085 |	Really actually work
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,511	| IOT085 |	For the internet
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:02,047	| IOT085 |	It's because
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:04,095	| IOT085 |	We need to have more efficient
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,119	| IOT085 |	Production
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,399	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:12,031	| IOT085 |	Goal of putting sensors and boosting Roi by tracking things a little bit more accurately
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:14,335	| IOT085 |	That's probably still going to happen so
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:16,895	| IOT085 |	Hillside on the Enterprise side
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,943	| IOT085 |	We're still going to see Investments made
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:22,271	| IOT085 |	Connected devices robotics
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,575	| IOT085 |	That's probably bad for people
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:26,623	| IOT085 |	Since we don't have policies for
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:27,647	| IOT085 |	Ra training
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:29,951	| IOT085 |	Probably
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:31,999	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:34,303	| IOT085 |	I would agree and I would just add one other thing
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:37,375	| IOT085 |	And I don't know the answer this question then I don't expect you to answer to either bud
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:40,191	| IOT085 |	I'm wondering how many of the
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:42,239	| IOT085 |	Connected and smart home devices
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:43,519	| IOT085 |	Currently
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,311	| IOT085 |	On the market
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,871	| IOT085 |	Made in countries where there could be
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:51,199	| IOT085 |	New tariffs and so on which could impact prices and further
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:53,247	| IOT085 |	Reduce demand for them
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:53,759	| IOT085 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:54,783	| IOT085 |	That is actually
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,623	| IOT085 |	You're welcome that's why I'm here
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:08:59,647	| IOT085 |	Why you're here
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:01,951	| IOT085 |	Yes
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:06,047	| IOT085 |	So all of the terrorist if those policies going to place that will raise the cost of
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:08,095	| IOT085 |	It's possibly quite substantially
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,911	| IOT085 |	Can we didn't even get into the surveillance
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,423	| IOT085 |	State stuff
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:13,471	| IOT085 |	That's a whole another show
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:15,775	| IOT085 |	If you are concerned about that
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:18,847	| IOT085 |	I'll put some links in the show notes to like how to secure your
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:22,175	| IOT085 |	Better if you're really that concerned about it
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,711	| IOT085 |	You're probably not buying the sketch
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,735	| IOT085 |	This is my hunch
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:27,551	| IOT085 |	So if you suddenly have become concerned
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:31,135	| IOT085 |	What about it then I would recommend unplugging these gadgets
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:31,903	| IOT085 |	And not buying anymore
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:33,695	| IOT085 |	Which is
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:34,975	| IOT085 |	Terrible thing to say
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,023	| IOT085 |	But I'm going off the grid
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,535	| IOT085 |	That's it
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,327	| IOT085 |	Is my last show
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,863	| IOT085 |	This is it
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:44,191	| IOT085 |	Call me by phone now. I'm not even taking phone calls smoke
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:44,959	| IOT085 |	I'll send you a carrier
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:50,335	| IOT085 |	Iot podcast
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:54,431	| IOT085 |	Via telegram this week on the ioc podcast
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:57,503	| IOT085 |	All right
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:58,015	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,831	| IOT085 |	Smart home things that are worth talking to
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,135	| IOT085 |	Which is
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:05,183	| IOT085 |	What is this this is a
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,463	| IOT085 |	Mesh Network router
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,743	| IOT085 |	I have routers
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:08,255	| IOT085 |	Routers
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,303	| IOT085 |	Have three of them in my house
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:12,095	| IOT085 |	Covering tile 2500 square feet
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:14,143	| IOT085 |	The end they are
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,935	| IOT085 |	Basically getting an upgrade
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:16,447	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,727	| IOT085 |	It came out
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:18,751	| IOT085 |	About this time last year
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:22,591	| IOT085 |	That's about right
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,639	| IOT085 |	Early this year
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:25,919	| IOT085 |	Costa Rica
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,455	| IOT085 |	9 months having sex
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:28,735	| IOT085 |	Enough time to make
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:34,111	| IOT085 |	So they had enough time to do a giant refraction what's going to happen is your Eero router is if you have them
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:36,927	| IOT085 |	They're going to get about 2x faster
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,975	| IOT085 |	Because what they've done is they've taken data
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:42,047	| IOT085 |	On everybody's network connection so when you're having a
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:43,071	| IOT085 |	Good time a bad time
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,887	| IOT085 |	Wi-Fi is working is not working
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:46,911	| IOT085 |	They actually
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:50,239	| IOT085 |	Grab all that and they've figured out how to optimize
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,287	| IOT085 |	Their connections
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,823	| IOT085 |	Completely different type of meshing
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:56,127	| IOT085 |	And everyone's going to see 2x faster
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:59,199	| IOT085 |	A big complaint with Eero was that if you don't
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,223	| IOT085 |	Was that
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:02,527	| IOT085 |	Each subsequent hop on the network
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,063	| IOT085 |	If you don't have them plugged into your land
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:06,879	| IOT085 |	Actually degrades the speed and that is true
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:09,951	| IOT085 |	You're still going to get 2x faster so
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:11,999	| IOT085 |	Yay
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,815	| IOT085 |	Faster is better
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,607	| IOT085 |	And that's if you have the bandwidth
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:23,007	| IOT085 |	So if you were already maxing out your bandwidth and you were getting that all the way through your house that's not going to change
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:26,079	| IOT085 |	They cannot change that magically change your ISP
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:28,639	| IOT085 |	Tattoo Expo
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,943	| IOT085 |	They also did a couple things
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,455	| IOT085 |	Consider worth
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:35,039	| IOT085 |	They created an echo integration
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:41,439	| IOT085 |	And so now you can ask the echo to find a device in your home so any devices connected to Wi-Fi in your
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:43,487	| IOT085 |	You're home you can as of
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,511	| IOT085 |	Today
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:47,071	| IOT085 |	This witness podcast goes out if you are
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,607	| IOT085 |	Once you get the update
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,631	| IOT085 |	Because I think they're doing it
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,911	| IOT085 |	Once you get the update
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,191	| IOT085 |	You can say
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,495	| IOT085 |	Hey she who shall not be named
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,543	| IOT085 |	Find my
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,055	| IOT085 |	IPhone
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:59,103	| IOT085 |	And it will say
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,919	| IOT085 |	Oh that's next to the router in the bedroom
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,455	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,735	| IOT085 |	You're like oh it's probably
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,271	| IOT085 |	In the bedroom now obviously
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:08,575	| IOT085 |	In my house I have that three routers so I've got more
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:11,647	| IOT085 |	Mark remson that it's it's only going to give me a general location but it's nice
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:17,791	| IOT085 |	You can also tell it to pause the internet based on family profiles that they rolled out earlier this summer so I could pause my daughter's thing
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:18,815	| IOT085 |	Talking to the echo
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:23,167	| IOT085 |	She could also unpause it by commanding the echo to do
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:23,935	| IOT085 |	The opposite
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:24,447	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:28,031	| IOT085 |	This is not a great strategy
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:34,175	| IOT085 |	And my favorite is you can turn off the LEDs
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:35,199	| IOT085 |	Your
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,479	| IOT085 |	Eros
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,015	| IOT085 |	Thank goodness
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:42,879	| IOT085 |	I say that not just to the folks at Euro but any manufacturer of
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,159	| IOT085 |	Smart home devices
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,951	| IOT085 |	Get that you want LEDs on your
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,975	| IOT085 |	Devices to
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,999	| IOT085 |	Show information
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:53,887	| IOT085 |	But sometimes we're trying to sleep and we don't need to see blinking lights and everything else in the
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:13:00,287	| IOT085 |	I have electrical tape all over LEDs on some devices just for this reason because it drives me nuts
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:00,799	| IOT085 |	Say about like a rest
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:04,127	| IOT085 |	All of mine
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:05,919	| IOT085 |	It's a multi-step process since we have so many
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:08,223	| IOT085 |	I suspect like short just be like
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:10,783	| IOT085 |	Is part of your like goodnight setting
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:12,063	| IOT085 |	All your LEDs power down
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:14,623	| IOT085 |	Oh my God thank you thank you thank you
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,903	| IOT085 |	Alright so those are the big
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,951	| IOT085 |	There's also
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:24,095	| IOT085 |	More information about your connected devices so you'll get data like if something's having a crummy connection you can actually go into the app and see
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:26,655	| IOT085 |	Hey it's not me
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:29,727	| IOT085 |	My TV really is struggling right now on the network
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:33,311	| IOT085 |	And it'll blame your ISP if that's the person play more it'll blame
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:34,591	| IOT085 |	I guess you're not
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:39,455	| IOT085 |	Sentence that actually super helpful that I do not have Eros I tested them I love them
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:43,295	| IOT085 |	I just didn't want to spend 499 for the 3-pack of the time
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:44,575	| IOT085 |	Silent music
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,111	| IOT085 |	Google
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:46,879	| IOT085 |	Onhub
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,159	| IOT085 |	And that app
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:51,487	| IOT085 |	Destiny very similar I've used it so many times to
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:57,887	| IOT085 |	Troubleshoot what's eating up all my data right now why does it have a bad connection and someone say before it starts
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,399	| IOT085 |	Super handy
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:13:59,679	| IOT085 |	And
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,727	| IOT085 |	In all of our news about security
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:04,287	| IOT085 |	All the mishaps with the Mirai botnet
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:06,847	| IOT085 |	Using your connected devices for today
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,639	| IOT085 |	Distributed denial-of-service attack
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:12,223	| IOT085 |	Not this update but an update coming out
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:13,247	| IOT085 |	They said enough
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,039	| IOT085 |	Weeks
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:21,183	| IOT085 |	They will actually provide in the app the ability to look and see if your devices are generating like way too much
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,487	| IOT085 |	I would like that to be notify
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:25,279	| IOT085 |	Vacation by
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:27,839	| IOT085 |	But yeah
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:28,863	| IOT085 |	That's a good first
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,399	| IOT085 |	Right now most people
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:37,055	| IOT085 |	Not easily anyway not unless you wanna look at archaic
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:39,615	| IOT085 |	No web pages can I get to your router
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:42,943	| IOT085 |	Getting around to find that stuff not + since you change your password
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:45,503	| IOT085 |	This is how
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:49,343	| IOT085 |	Reset the router
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:54,207	| IOT085 |	That's at speaking of security
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:57,023	| IOT085 |	Z-Wave which is one of those mesh Network
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,815	| IOT085 |	18 protocols it's wireless
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:14:59,839	| IOT085 |	Protocol like
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,607	| IOT085 |	City
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:02,911	| IOT085 |	And they have boosted their security
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:04,191	| IOT085 |	Or will
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:04,703	| IOT085 |	Booster seat
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:10,591	| IOT085 |	They as of April 2017 all wheat Z-Wave devices will have to have
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:14,175	| IOT085 |	A new level of security they're calling the S2 framework
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:19,039	| IOT085 |	So they're pushing everybody with a Z-Wave device to adopt this protocol
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:19,807	| IOT085 |	How to be certified
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,111	| IOT085 |	Open question
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:24,415	| IOT085 |	If portable devices have to use it
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:25,951	| IOT085 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,231	| IOT085 |	But
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:27,999	| IOT085 |	It says
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:30,047	| IOT085 |	You know to pass certification to be in the mark
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:35,935	| IOT085 |	For consumers so my guess is your old devices don't if they can I'm hoping that manufacturers will update them
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:37,471	| IOT085 |	But
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:38,751	| IOT085 |	We'll see
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:41,055	| IOT085 |	Yeah it doesn't seem like this is a
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:43,871	| IOT085 |	Well that and or a
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,919	| IOT085 |	That it requires certain new hardware
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:50,015	| IOT085 |	You know like there's no new security chip or anything involved here
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:55,135	| IOT085 |	Instead they're adding the use of a QR pin code on devices for pairing
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:56,159	| IOT085 |	Set me your
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,951	| IOT085 |	You have been proven Authentication
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:01,279	| IOT085 |	And they said they strengthen their Cloud communication
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:04,095	| IOT085 |	For all a Z-Wave over IP traffic
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,631	| IOT085 |	Social Security office
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,399	| IOT085 |	Tunnel
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:10,495	| IOT085 |	And remove other vulnerabilities through like man in the middle attacks inside
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:11,775	| IOT085 |	To me that is not
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:13,055	| IOT085 |	Speak to
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:17,663	| IOT085 |	Hardware but so I'm thinking old devices could adopt
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,967	| IOT085 |	Yes we'll have to see
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:25,343	| IOT085 |	But this is good this is necessary this is actually been a standard was UA since the last
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,111	| IOT085 |	Upgrade
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:30,463	| IOT085 |	And now they're finally pushing it because holy cow everyone start
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,743	| IOT085 |	Security in The Internet of Things
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:32,255	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,279	| IOT085 |	Keep talking
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:34,559	| IOT085 |	Real quick
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:38,911	| IOT085 |	I just noticed something as I'm scanning through some of the information that they did send us
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:44,031	| IOT085 |	They say all gateways L Z-Wave Gateway 2500 series chips
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:48,639	| IOT085 |	And all devices that allow over there upgrades are able to add as to two existing devices
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:51,711	| IOT085 |	Well there we go
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:52,223	| IOT085 |	There we go
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:56,319	| IOT085 |	I don't know what chips are in my products but I will
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,135	| IOT085 |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:05,535	| IOT085 |	Let's see if I can find that I have some really old Z-Wave devices I'll be on
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,815	| IOT085 |	Honest so my dad
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,607	| IOT085 |	Confident those will not be there
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:14,239	| IOT085 |	My hunch is because those devices talk through a hug so I talk to my new wink hub
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:17,823	| IOT085 |	And because they focus so heavily on security
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:22,687	| IOT085 |	I will double check with them but I'm fairly confident that that's going to be part of
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:23,199	| IOT085 |	The wink hub
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:26,527	| IOT085 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:28,063	| IOT085 |	Okay moving right along
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:30,111	| IOT085 |	I met with Honeywell
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:34,719	| IOT085 |	This is not for people who are following
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:36,511	| IOT085 |	I don't know how many of the
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:40,351	| IOT085 |	I wanted to bring this up because I get a lot of questions about it
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:42,143	| IOT085 |	Honeywell actually is part of their lyrics
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,423	| IOT085 |	Program
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,703	| IOT085 |	Has a
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,983	| IOT085 |	Wifi-connected
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,007	| IOT085 |	Water sensor
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:48,031	| IOT085 |	That's battery powered
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:51,359	| IOT085 |	And this is and it's $80
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:53,407	| IOT085 |	I seen it for a little bit cheaper
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:56,223	| IOT085 |	In other places but you don't Home Depot has it for like 7
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:58,015	| IOT085 |	This is
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,807	| IOT085 |	Unusual because the only
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:02,879	| IOT085 |	There are only a few Wi-Fi powered water sensors in there
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:04,159	| IOT085 |	Do you think makes one
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:05,951	| IOT085 |	But it has to be plugged in which limits were you
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:06,719	| IOT085 |	I can put it
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:08,511	| IOT085 |	Credit sense makes one
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,815	| IOT085 |	What is $150
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:15,935	| IOT085 |	Which is a lot of money for a water sensor especially if you like I want to put one
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,959	| IOT085 |	Water heater
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,471	| IOT085 |	Seek
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:18,751	| IOT085 |	It gets it as a
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,055	| IOT085 |	So this one
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:22,591	| IOT085 |	Ebucks
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,359	| IOT085 |	And
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,383	| IOT085 |	This is the cool Part I
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:31,039	| IOT085 |	The batteries last it's three double a batteries they last for about three years they said it's depending on how often it checks
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:32,319	| IOT085 |	Cheetah cloud
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:34,367	| IOT085 |	Is no Hub required
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:37,695	| IOT085 |	And it comes with a 4 ft long
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:38,975	| IOT085 |	Chord
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:41,023	| IOT085 |	That also acts as a sensor
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:43,583	| IOT085 |	So you not only have the two kind of
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,887	| IOT085 |	Sensors on the actual
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:48,191	| IOT085 |	Box that is a sensor
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:49,727	| IOT085 |	But the board itself
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:51,775	| IOT085 |	Gives you like a lot of extra coverage
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,567	| IOT085 |	Cuz one of my big issues with
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:58,175	| IOT085 |	Water sensors is if your leak isn't where there's a detection
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:00,735	| IOT085 |	Didn't you want to
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:03,807	| IOT085 |	Guess where your leak may have to get really bad before it can
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:09,183	| IOT085 |	I thought this was pretty cool it also detects temperature
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:09,951	| IOT085 |	Humidity
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:13,023	| IOT085 |	So people can use it to the black wrap around it
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:17,631	| IOT085 |	Not where I live but where you live Kevin you could wrap it around a pipe on an exterior wall
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,911	| IOT085 |	Dysmorphic
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:19,679	| IOT085 |	Courts in
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:22,239	| IOT085 |	Basically see if your pipes going to
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,519	| IOT085 |	Fries
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:30,431	| IOT085 |	Yeah that's that's a big deal here in the Northeast so that would definitely be appreciated and of course I should say there about 8 bucks
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,479	| IOT085 |	Record and you can daisy chain
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:35,807	| IOT085 |	A lot of them together to rap
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:36,575	| IOT085 |	A lot of places
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:38,111	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,647	| IOT085 |	I thought that was really
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:40,927	| IOT085 |	A kind of meat product
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:43,999	| IOT085 |	I will probably get one for
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:48,095	| IOT085 |	I've had a lot of leaks but none of them are ever in anticipated spaces but
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:51,167	| IOT085 |	You know it's always it is comforting to have
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,263	| IOT085 |	I just wanted to tell you guys
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:59,615	| IOT085 |	What's a nice innovation
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:00,639	| IOT085 |	All right
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,175	| IOT085 |	Shear it's time
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:06,783	| IOT085 |	Cooking cooking with Stacy
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,087	| IOT085 |	All right
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,623	| IOT085 |	I reviewed
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,647	| IOT085 |	The June oven
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:14,207	| IOT085 |	And for those of you guys who are not familiar with
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:14,975	| IOT085 |	Let me wrap
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:18,559	| IOT085 |	Waxing rhapsodic about the June oven countertop oven
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:20,351	| IOT085 |	That is slightly larger than a toaster oven
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:23,679	| IOT085 |	And basically it's 22 inches wide it's about
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:25,215	| IOT085 |	13 in tall 18 in
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:26,751	| IOT085 |	It has
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:29,311	| IOT085 |	Everything
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:35,199	| IOT085 |	I know it it's it's a connected stove it's got Wi-Fi
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:35,967	| IOT085 |	The camera
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:40,319	| IOT085 |	So what's cool about it is it's got a camera in it
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:44,415	| IOT085 |	And a graphics processor and you put your food in
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:47,231	| IOT085 |	It's got weight sensors in the feet of the oven
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:48,255	| IOT085 |	So when you put the food in
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:49,535	| IOT085 |	It weighs it
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,583	| IOT085 |	It sees what it is
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:54,143	| IOT085 |	And then it's like oh I know what this is
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:57,215	| IOT085 |	I already have a preprogrammed recipe
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:58,495	| IOT085 |	And hit it
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:00,799	| IOT085 |	And it Cooks it and it Cooks It
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,079	| IOT085 |	Perfectly
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,103	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:04,895	| IOT085 |	Yeah I know you guys are like
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:05,663	| IOT085 |	Well
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:10,783	| IOT085 |	How much is this it's it's $1,500 guys it's 1495
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:11,551	| IOT085 |	$5 switch
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,087	| IOT085 |	That's a lot of money
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:14,879	| IOT085 |	But it's amazing
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,416	| IOT085 |	Like I could
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:21,536	| IOT085 |	Over a dozen things this weekend
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:23,328	| IOT085 |	And I would say the baked goods
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:29,216	| IOT085 |	They're working on it they're going to tweak the algorithms for this so they'll come out better but I don't know if I do a lot of baked goods in it
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:32,032	| IOT085 |	Anyway because I could only fit like 9 cookies on their tray
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,080	| IOT085 |	You can only fit
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:34,592	| IOT085 |	Things in it that are
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:35,616	| IOT085 |	I think it's 9
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:40,224	| IOT085 |	Yeah you're limited on size of
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:43,808	| IOT085 |	Baked goods indoor Universe some meat or something like that you know
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:45,088	| IOT085 |	11 by 6
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,648	| IOT085 |	CU tribute
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:50,464	| IOT085 |	Traditional Pyrex cake
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:51,232	| IOT085 |	Casserole pan
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:52,512	| IOT085 |	And stuff like that you can
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:54,048	| IOT085 |	Roast a 5lb chicken in it
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,584	| IOT085 |	But you cannot do it then
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,144	| IOT085 |	Guys
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:22:02,240	| IOT085 |	I wanted to sing so much and everything I made in it
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,008	| IOT085 |	Was so good
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:05,312	| IOT085 |	And you have a lot of money to spend
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:07,872	| IOT085 |	And I would definitely like actually even if you don't like
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:11,712	| IOT085 |	It's probably better for people don't like to cook cuz you could just slap some
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:16,576	| IOT085 |	Seasoned salmon on a tray with some vegetables and just pop it in there and
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:18,880	| IOT085 |	He'll be like hey dude
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,392	| IOT085 |	This is salmon
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:22,976	| IOT085 |	Or actually is a salmon in
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:25,536	| IOT085 |	How would you like your salmon cooked
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,072	| IOT085 |	Medium
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:28,096	| IOT085 |	And then
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:29,376	| IOT085 |	It does it
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:31,936	| IOT085 |	It's got a temperature probe is all that you can use
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:34,496	| IOT085 |	To really hone in on the right internal temperature for
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:35,264	| IOT085 |	For baking
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,288	| IOT085 |	Yes for rosacea
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:37,824	| IOT085 |	Resting okay
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:39,616	| IOT085 |	You would not I'm sorry my bad
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:41,408	| IOT085 |	I don't know how
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:45,760	| IOT085 |	Order out a lot that's probably I just evidence
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:50,880	| IOT085 |	So yes the temperature probe inside is accurate within 1 degree according
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:51,648	| IOT085 |	Pitchoun
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:54,720	| IOT085 |	I tried the temperature probe with my current
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:57,024	| IOT085 |	Digital thermometer
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,048	| IOT085 |	Kris cell
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,912	| IOT085 |	Either way it's still felt pretty
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:05,472	| IOT085 |	So this is like
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:06,240	| IOT085 |	My favorite and
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:07,264	| IOT085 |	My husband
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,824	| IOT085 |	And he doesn't like anything else
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:15,712	| IOT085 |	Yeah I mean it definitely is a compelling
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:18,784	| IOT085 |	Smart device no doubt about it
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:21,088	| IOT085 |	The price is obviously going to put out of
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:22,112	| IOT085 |	Reach of a lot of people
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:27,232	| IOT085 |	Although I mean you can spend a lot on high-end kitchen appliances obviously tsareena
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:30,560	| IOT085 |	Oven is 700
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:31,328	| IOT085 |	$50 for the
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:34,144	| IOT085 |	Doesn't do much no convection
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:36,192	| IOT085 |	My ovens in my house
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,472	| IOT085 |	Where $1,500
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:40,032	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,056	| IOT085 |	Their stainless steel
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,872	| IOT085 |	Are out there they are self-cleaning
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:44,384	| IOT085 |	They have to convey
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:45,408	| IOT085 |	I actually just have
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:48,480	| IOT085 |	There are Futures on other
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:51,040	| IOT085 |	And this is also a convection oven
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:52,064	| IOT085 |	Does toasting
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,368	| IOT085 |	I would say to someone
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:56,160	| IOT085 |	If you're interested in
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,440	| IOT085 |	This it will replace your toaster
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,464	| IOT085 |	Which is not an a
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:02,560	| IOT085 |	But if you don't have double ovens
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:03,328	| IOT085 |	And you want that
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:07,168	| IOT085 |	I would look into getting this because you can do quite a bit with it
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:10,496	| IOT085 |	And I mean I would cook dinner in it probably
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:11,008	| IOT085 |	Three or four nights
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:12,288	| IOT085 |	If I have it
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:20,480	| IOT085 |	I mean if you're not guaranteed but you're almost guaranteed to have a perfect outcome
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:27,136	| IOT085 |	That could make up for some of the compromises I tried to make in terms of size for example and cost and so on so
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:30,720	| IOT085 |	It's interesting the bacon that we cooked should have been
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,232	| IOT085 |	Better done
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:32,768	| IOT085 |	The chicken
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:33,280	| IOT085 |	The pork
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:35,072	| IOT085 |	The salmon
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:36,352	| IOT085 |	Kale chips
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:37,120	| IOT085 |	Potatoes
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,400	| IOT085 |	It all came out perfect
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,680	| IOT085 |	It was
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:43,264	| IOT085 |	And it came out perfectly without me having to check on it
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:45,568	| IOT085 |	Which is also nice cuz we had guests over cuz it was a
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:46,592	| IOT085 |	Inordinate amount
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:52,992	| IOT085 |	It was nice because I wasn't going back to the oven and checking it I was just like
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,784	| IOT085 |	Set it forget it
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:56,320	| IOT085 |	When it's play it plays a little song
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:05,792	| IOT085 |	I think the real potential here is the fact that the product will likely get better because it will learn overtime they will be more recipes out of
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:08,352	| IOT085 |	The food identification
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,376	| IOT085 |	Could improve
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,424	| IOT085 |	You maybe you'll be able to tweak it
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:15,520	| IOT085 |	And say you like I like my baking a little more crispy and it will learn to know that next time
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:19,104	| IOT085 |	By default it will just make it the way you wanted as opposed to the default way
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:19,616	| IOT085 |	Yes
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:21,408	| IOT085 |	And that's the beauty like
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:24,736	| IOT085 |	What I like about this is they took a product they made it better
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:27,552	| IOT085 |	They changed the material of the heating element so it heats up
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:30,112	| IOT085 |	Faster that's nice that got to convection pans in it
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,136	| IOT085 |	Where most happens only
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,928	| IOT085 |	That is also nice
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:36,512	| IOT085 |	And then they added this layer of Intelligence on top of it to make it really idiot
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:39,072	| IOT085 |	And it will get better with time
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:42,400	| IOT085 |	When thinking about designing a connected product
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:43,936	| IOT085 |	They didn't just say hey let's put a chip in it
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,728	| IOT085 |	Right behind thought about the
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:52,384	| IOT085 |	No I don't see this becoming like a huge
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:53,408	| IOT085 |	Widespread Panic
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:58,016	| IOT085 |	Definitely an oven of the future
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,344	| IOT085 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:01,856	| IOT085 |	Google
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,136	| IOT085 |	Google home
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:05,696	| IOT085 |	Here's what we're going to say that Kevin works for Google
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:06,720	| IOT085 |	He does not work on the
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:09,024	| IOT085 |	Disclosure
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:09,792	| IOT085 |	Last week
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:17,472	| IOT085 |	Last week I talked about Google home in my issues of connecting my Philips Hue Lights
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:20,288	| IOT085 |	This was both like a
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:22,336	| IOT085 |	Dang this is disappointing cuz I can't test it
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:23,872	| IOT085 |	Infinity
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:25,920	| IOT085 |	It was just funny because of the Google support
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:26,688	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:29,760	| IOT085 |	Update on Google support did get back to me with an email
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:32,064	| IOT085 |	And the email did not
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:33,856	| IOT085 |	Actually help me at all
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:35,392	| IOT085 |	It was a seven-step email
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:36,160	| IOT085 |	In 5 Steps
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:43,584	| IOT085 |	It was basic troubleshooting and meet you Stacy add share the email with me and I looked at it a cycle reset this and repair that and try
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:44,608	| IOT085 |	Turn this off and on again
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:45,888	| IOT085 |	Very very
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,168	| IOT085 |	Standard
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:48,192	| IOT085 |	Personally
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:53,312	| IOT085 |	Credits and fortunately there was a very specific solution of this and nobody asked the right question in my opinion
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:55,360	| IOT085 |	Sub solution
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:55,872	| IOT085 |	In which
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:57,664	| IOT085 |	Someone actually suggested Ma
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,456	| IOT085 |	W
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:01,760	| IOT085 |	And Phillips also
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:02,272	| IOT085 |	Confirmed
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:03,296	| IOT085 |	For me
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:04,832	| IOT085 |	They actually reached out after
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,624	| IOT085 |	Podcast and said hey
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:10,464	| IOT085 |	So what the issue was is I was using Adblock as my browser
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:14,304	| IOT085 |	A block is not supported in either is Firefox so far
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:17,632	| IOT085 |	And you were using the browser to do what
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:19,936	| IOT085 |	So the way this is set up is
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:20,704	| IOT085 |	You
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,728	| IOT085 |	Give me
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:22,496	| IOT085 |	Google home app
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:28,384	| IOT085 |	When it comes time to add a device and you choose the Philips Hue Lights it takes you out to a browser
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:29,664	| IOT085 |	Ryuk
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,176	| IOT085 |	Complete
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:31,200	| IOT085 |	Authentication process
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:33,504	| IOT085 |	So in that
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:34,528	| IOT085 |	Process
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:35,808	| IOT085 |	My browser was like
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:38,112	| IOT085 |	And that's what broke thing
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:40,416	| IOT085 |	You have to use
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:42,208	| IOT085 |	Chrome Safari
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:42,720	| IOT085 |	Feel like there's an
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:46,048	| IOT085 |	Maybe Edge or ie
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:49,888	| IOT085 |	Let's not go there that's a whole nother story
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,192	| IOT085 |	Chrome horse
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:52,960	| IOT085 |	Safari RC
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:55,008	| IOT085 |	They just haven't gotten to supporting it
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:59,360	| IOT085 |	Sew-in and I get that
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:00,384	| IOT085 |	But I do think
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:03,456	| IOT085 |	So now it works I've connected my lights they work
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:04,480	| IOT085 |	Perfectly it's lovely
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:08,320	| IOT085 |	I did that by setting Chrome as my default browser for the setup
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:10,112	| IOT085 |	And then I swapped it back to Adblock
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:13,696	| IOT085 |	A lot of people especially on mobile devices
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:15,232	| IOT085 |	Use different browsers
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:16,512	| IOT085 |	Uncommon
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:21,120	| IOT085 |	So it felt like Google at some point of time should have asked that question
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:22,400	| IOT085 |	In
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:23,680	| IOT085 |	No one did
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:30,080	| IOT085 |	I completely agree with you I think that's a little bit of a real they're definitely area of opportunity
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:33,408	| IOT085 |	In that mean I don't want to defend but
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:34,944	| IOT085 |	The only thing I can think of is
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:38,272	| IOT085 |	Do the support people know which browsers
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:42,624	| IOT085 |	Are supported by Phillips web authentication which ones aren't I don't know
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:43,904	| IOT085 |	But that's
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:44,672	| IOT085 |	Really
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:45,696	| IOT085 |	Kind of a lame excuse
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:50,816	| IOT085 |	And I'm not
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:54,656	| IOT085 |	What is the brand new thing so I'm sure this is now a known issue that
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,424	| IOT085 |	You know
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:57,728	| IOT085 |	Possible if I called support today that
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:58,752	| IOT085 |	They would be like
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:28:59,520	| IOT085 |	Hey
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,288	| IOT085 |	What browser
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:03,104	| IOT085 |	Podcast
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,128	| IOT085 |	Shirley.
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:13,088	| IOT085 |	We spent also last we talked about the Google home a little work around for basically connected more things to it
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:19,232	| IOT085 |	That's right that's right we mentioned the Google Assistant channel on if this then that
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:23,584	| IOT085 |	And I actually just before the show last week and tried it but was having some issues
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:25,376	| IOT085 |	And I do not have a Google home
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:28,704	| IOT085 |	But that's okay because remember this is a Google Assistant Channel
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:34,848	| IOT085 |	Assistant is built into home but it's also built into the new Google pixel phones which I do have
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:40,992	| IOT085 |	So after the show I figured out what my issue was and
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:43,808	| IOT085 |	It had to do with the naming like
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:45,088	| IOT085 |	When you create
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,624	| IOT085 |	The new applet
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:47,136	| IOT085 |	4
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:52,512	| IOT085 |	It's a turn lights on when turn lights on through my wink hub for example of using Google Assistant
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:53,536	| IOT085 |	I was
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:57,888	| IOT085 |	You would have type the command that if this then that is going to listen for or Google assistant listen for
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:03,776	| IOT085 |	And I was putting OK Google in there and I didn't need to do that and I'm sorry if I just saw everybody's phones and Google homes by the way
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:04,800	| IOT085 |	So it was
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:09,920	| IOT085 |	You can say user on my part to me it's not really clear that you don't need to do that but whatever
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:15,296	| IOT085 |	I got it working really well and Ashley for the first time I can use my phone
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,576	| IOT085 |	Very easily
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:21,696	| IOT085 |	And natively to control lights in my house through this if this then that Apple that I created
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:25,792	| IOT085 |	There's only one downside and that's pretty standard I think with any
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:28,352	| IOT085 |	Cloud-based service would you give this man that is
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:30,400	| IOT085 |	There is more latency then
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:32,448	| IOT085 |	Using say the Wink app to do this
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:34,240	| IOT085 |	Dancing with my Wink app
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:39,360	| IOT085 |	If I do it through the actual one second delay for a light will go on or go off and I could
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:41,152	| IOT085 |	Be annoying at times I think
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:44,480	| IOT085 |	Yes it would be nice like if your phones by your badge
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:46,528	| IOT085 |	Turn off the lights downstairs
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:48,576	| IOT085 |	Which would be handy
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:51,392	| IOT085 |	But if you're like walking into a room
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:53,696	| IOT085 |	Presence
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:57,024	| IOT085 |	Yeah they're going to walk into something before Life Goes On
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:30:59,584	| IOT085 |	That's bad
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:02,656	| IOT085 |	That's bad and your lights
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,424	| IOT085 |	Attached herewith
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:06,496	| IOT085 |	They're a mish-mosh I have some
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:09,056	| IOT085 |	Cree bulbs in fact I just bought a
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:10,592	| IOT085 |	Four packs of
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:12,640	| IOT085 |	Cree bulbs are those are not connected bulbs
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:14,432	| IOT085 |	I do have some connected Cree bulbs
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:17,248	| IOT085 |	And I have the osram lightify
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:18,784	| IOT085 |	As well
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:25,184	| IOT085 |	I do not have any Philips Hue on my network my son has the Hub and does his own thing with those balls
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,720	| IOT085 |	I do not controllers
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:28,256	| IOT085 |	He was supported
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,328	| IOT085 |	Rights that would have worked
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:32,352	| IOT085 |	Natively
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:35,936	| IOT085 |	Okay so I could actually mess with his lights by voice
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:40,800	| IOT085 |	He doesn't listen to show I can say
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:41,824	| IOT085 |	There you go
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:45,408	| IOT085 |	Ed we have one listener question
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:47,456	| IOT085 |	Which
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:48,992	| IOT085 |	Good point Ithaca
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:51,296	| IOT085 |	Missy Brian Wood asks
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:51,808	| IOT085 |	Via Twitter
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:55,136	| IOT085 |	Why do smart light bulbs get so much attention
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:57,184	| IOT085 |	Is it a smart switch for Outlet more useful
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:00,768	| IOT085 |	I got a couple thoughts on that one
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:07,680	| IOT085 |	That's a good question it's a good question and I'm glad Brian it a steady just asked it on Twitter just this morning before the show so good
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:08,448	| IOT085 |	Number one
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:10,240	| IOT085 |	I think about it in terms of
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:12,800	| IOT085 |	Convenience choice
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:15,360	| IOT085 |	And cost Queen Elsa goes three things the three C's
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:22,272	| IOT085 |	There's no question a Smart Switch or an outlet is useful I have some of them might have a couple of smart outlets for example and then the way
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:23,808	| IOT085 |	Wink relay is a Smart Switch
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:25,088	| IOT085 |	That added smarts
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:27,392	| IOT085 |	To a non smart pot which is great
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:32,256	| IOT085 |	Switches typically cost roughly 40 50 bucks or more
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:34,560	| IOT085 |	Rapper that wears a bulb connected
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:36,608	| IOT085 |	Can be had for less than 20
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:38,400	| IOT085 |	I'm so there's a cost involved
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:41,472	| IOT085 |	There's also convenience I mean people listen to show
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:43,008	| IOT085 |	Probably okay with some
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:44,288	| IOT085 |	Swapping out switches and
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:45,568	| IOT085 |	Playing with electrical wires
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:50,176	| IOT085 |	Shorting out the HVAC systems like I've done but it's a lot easier to just
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:51,200	| IOT085 |	Changeable
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,224	| IOT085 |	Quite honestly so
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:54,784	| IOT085 |	For folks who don't want to mess with electricity
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:57,344	| IOT085 |	About is easier
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:33:00,160	| IOT085 |	And then a switch add smart stew
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:01,696	| IOT085 |	Dogs yes but
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:06,560	| IOT085 |	Some bulbs actually have more functionality just because they are smart bulbs whereas
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:08,864	| IOT085 |	You know that she was a pretty simple changing the colors
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:12,960	| IOT085 |	On your Hue bulbs are not going to really easily do that with most witches
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:14,496	| IOT085 |	That's one example
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:16,032	| IOT085 |	I also have those
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:18,080	| IOT085 |	Balls that are
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:18,592	| IOT085 |	Tunable
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:20,384	| IOT085 |	To soft light
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:22,432	| IOT085 |	Soft white rather or daylight
EDL	00:33:22,432	00:33:24,992	| IOT085 |	Again not easily done with just a switch
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:26,784	| IOT085 |	So I think you get more
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:29,344	| IOT085 |	Choice with a smart dog those are my
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:31,136	| IOT085 |	Three of the top of my head
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:33,440	| IOT085 |	Okay and mine are a little different
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:37,024	| IOT085 |	It depends kind of situation so
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:38,816	| IOT085 |	A lot of my lights
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:40,352	| IOT085 |	Our I don't have a lot of
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:45,472	| IOT085 |	Clamps so if I'm changing out all the light bulbs in my kitchen is actually cheaper
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:46,752	| IOT085 |	For me to install the switch
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:47,264	| IOT085 |	Install
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:52,128	| IOT085 |	And because that is a room where we lie
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:55,456	| IOT085 |	I only want certain functionality I don't need
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:56,992	| IOT085 |	The colors to change in my room
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:58,528	| IOT085 |	Are in my kitchen
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:00,832	| IOT085 |	So for their I'm like
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:03,136	| IOT085 |	A switch makes sense cuz I'm just going to dim it up
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:04,672	| IOT085 |	Quit
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:06,464	| IOT085 |	If you want the tunable wipes
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:07,744	| IOT085 |	There is no dimmer
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,536	| IOT085 |	There's no Smart Switch that can offer
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:10,304	| IOT085 |	Today
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:11,072	| IOT085 |	And they're made
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:15,168	| IOT085 |	The other thing to know is with a light bulb
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:17,728	| IOT085 |	You lose the ability to turn off your switch
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:19,008	| IOT085 |	Which if your label is connect
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:21,824	| IOT085 |	Because when you do you break the light bulb
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:23,104	| IOT085 |	It's off
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:24,384	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:24,896	| IOT085 |	4
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:26,688	| IOT085 |	Practical rooms
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:28,992	| IOT085 |	That's kind of my thought is
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:31,040	| IOT085 |	Uno swap out your switch for your mean
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:32,064	| IOT085 |	Jermaine lighting
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:35,392	| IOT085 |	Four lamps I think a connected
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:38,720	| IOT085 |	Light bulb actually is really interesting because
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:42,048	| IOT085 |	It's fun to play with colors and that sort of thing
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:44,608	| IOT085 |	So that's kind of where
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:48,192	| IOT085 |	I've come down on it so swap out your switch if you can
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:49,984	| IOT085 |	I really like Lutron
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:50,496	| IOT085 |	I'm just going to tell you
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:53,056	| IOT085 |	WeMo has a Wi-Fi switch
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:54,848	| IOT085 |	I was switched at
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:55,872	| IOT085 |	Is
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,688	| IOT085 |	Off on but it is not
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:34:59,200	| IOT085 |	Dimmable
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:01,504	| IOT085 |	And people are really iffy
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,016	| IOT085 |	That's
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,064	| IOT085 |	Most people do not
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:05,600	| IOT085 |	The best solution
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:07,392	| IOT085 |	And there's a couple new
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:09,696	| IOT085 |	Wifi powered light switches like
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:11,232	| IOT085 |	Sun Life is one
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:15,840	| IOT085 |	Are supposedly better but I haven't tried them there's the wink relay
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:16,608	| IOT085 |	But also no
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:18,656	| IOT085 |	If you put a connected switch in
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:21,472	| IOT085 |	You cannot have a connected
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:21,984	| IOT085 |	Light bulb
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:24,288	| IOT085 |	So you can't have a Lutron light
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:26,080	| IOT085 |	With a connected
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:26,848	| IOT085 |	Philips hue light bulb
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:27,872	| IOT085 |	For example
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:29,920	| IOT085 |	You basically lose
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:35,040	| IOT085 |	Those are my thoughts I think
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:36,064	| IOT085 |	It's not a clear-cut answer
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:42,976	| IOT085 |	No no it's these definitely not a perfect example that is I have far more lamps in my house than you do is what
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:43,488	| IOT085 |	From the sounds of it
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:46,048	| IOT085 |	Three lamps
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:49,376	| IOT085 |	Yeah we have a lot of lamps and
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:51,680	| IOT085 |	You know we just made sense to go with
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:56,032	| IOT085 |	Smart bulbs for those I'm not saying smart bulbs is a better choice for everybody who sang
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:57,824	| IOT085 |	In my circumstances made Morse
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:58,592	| IOT085 |	Yeah and you
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:02,176	| IOT085 |	Yep
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:02,688	| IOT085 |	Baidu
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:04,992	| IOT085 |	So yes
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,272	| IOT085 |	It depends
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:08,064	| IOT085 |	But there you got a little bit I think
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:09,088	| IOT085 |	So you can
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:11,904	| IOT085 |	What do I want to spend my 50
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:15,232	| IOT085 |	All right
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:17,024	| IOT085 |	That is a lot to show for us this week
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:20,608	| IOT085 |	Let us prepare for our guests Rob Martens
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:23,424	| IOT085 |	Who is a futuristic Schlage we're going to talk about locks

EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:55,648	| IOT085 |	And I'm happy to talk to anybody who is a few
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:58,464	| IOT085 |	What do you do in your day-to-day life
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:39:59,744	| IOT085 |	Actually
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:02,816	| IOT085 |	Well my number one role Within
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:04,608	| IOT085 |	Wag and Allegiant is
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:06,144	| IOT085 |	The challenge old ways of thinking
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:09,216	| IOT085 |	So I spend a lot of time looking at new tax
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:13,568	| IOT085 |	New trends new processes and trying to figure out how to apply it
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:14,336	| IOT085 |	Back
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:16,384	| IOT085 |	To our products to benefit our
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:16,896	| IOT085 |	Consumer
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:22,784	| IOT085 |	Kenneth Lee to a big part of my job is to try and demystify things like the iot
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:26,368	| IOT085 |	Let's get started on that for your business
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:30,208	| IOT085 |	What is an actually we should stress that your business is both residential
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:34,048	| IOT085 |	Multifamily and Commercial so that's that's everybody
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:35,840	| IOT085 |	For your business
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:36,864	| IOT085 |	How are you guys
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:39,936	| IOT085 |	Looking at the Internet of Things how do you demystify that for your
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:46,336	| IOT085 |	Wilshire obviously you know a very complex space but probably the fast
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:47,104	| IOT085 |	This growing
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:50,688	| IOT085 |	Megatrend that that we see within our business
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:54,528	| IOT085 |	Probably you know the biggest thing we're trying to do right now
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:56,320	| IOT085 |	Is improve that customers
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:59,136	| IOT085 |	Experience on the residential side of
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:40:59,904	| IOT085 |	The market
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:02,208	| IOT085 |	Things are really honky right now
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:07,072	| IOT085 |	So when you buy things off the shelf some people are having experience
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:08,864	| IOT085 |	Is where you really need to be at a key
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:12,704	| IOT085 |	In order to I get the product to work the way that you wanted to work so
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:16,544	| IOT085 |	Our focus is how can we improve that in quite frankly
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:17,824	| IOT085 |	Falling to the Cadence
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:18,848	| IOT085 |	Somebody is today
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:20,640	| IOT085 |	Rather than being an interrupter
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:22,432	| IOT085 |	I like it
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:29,344	| IOT085 |	So let's talk about you guys and you're connected locks cuz when I first started my smart home dirty way back into
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:29,856	| IOT085 |	2012
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:34,208	| IOT085 |	I think I had a choice of like a Z-Wave or maybe it was a zigbee lock from
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:34,976	| IOT085 |	You guys
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:36,000	| IOT085 |	Where are y'all today
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:41,376	| IOT085 |	Talking purely about the residential segment here for a second
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:44,960	| IOT085 |	We came out with our first connected lock back in 2008
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:48,288	| IOT085 |	And this was a little early was called slay bling
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:50,336	| IOT085 |	And that was
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:51,616	| IOT085 |	AZ wave
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:52,640	| IOT085 |	Connected
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:53,919	| IOT085 |	Keypad deadbolt
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:56,735	| IOT085 |	And so you would be able to
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:42:03,135	| IOT085 |	If still have to solve actuated another word that didn't have a motor you would get the permission to drop a pin and you could turn the deadbolt
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:04,415	| IOT085 |	I'll let people in or out
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:06,463	| IOT085 |	But since then there's been
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:07,487	| IOT085 |	Huge growth
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:08,255	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:10,303	| IOT085 |	We have a whole variety of
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:11,839	| IOT085 |	D-wave lovers
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:15,679	| IOT085 |	Z-Wave touchscreen deadbolts that have keypad
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:17,215	| IOT085 |	MNR latest
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:20,799	| IOT085 |	Creation has been what we call the Schlage sense
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:23,615	| IOT085 |	Which is the Bluetooth low energy lock
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:28,223	| IOT085 |	Right now most people associate the Schlage sense with Apple homekit
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:29,503	| IOT085 |	But in reality
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:31,039	| IOT085 |	Normal BP
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:32,063	| IOT085 |	Expanded out
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:34,879	| IOT085 |	The big differentiator between our
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:38,207	| IOT085 |	Z-Wave products sets in RB Ali-A products at
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:40,511	| IOT085 |	Is that at the ble products
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:42,303	| IOT085 |	Ship with an application
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:45,375	| IOT085 |	And the big deal about that
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:46,399	| IOT085 |	Is that
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:47,423	| IOT085 |	Before
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:50,751	| IOT085 |	We have all kinds of Technology built into these locks
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:53,055	| IOT085 |	Accelerometers in the example
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:54,847	| IOT085 |	That can tell you the difference
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:59,199	| IOT085 |	In the fourth profile of a Kickin at M purse has a dorsal
EDL	00:42:59,711	00:43:00,479	| IOT085 |	For example
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:02,783	| IOT085 |	Or we can set it
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:04,575	| IOT085 |	Such that for example my son is
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:05,343	| IOT085 |	Always
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:08,159	| IOT085 |	Late for the bus in your runs out the front door
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:09,439	| IOT085 |	Never locked the door behind them
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:11,231	| IOT085 |	And so we can set it so
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:17,631	| IOT085 |	30 seconds after the door's been open and up to 4 minutes after it can Auto throw the bolt for you
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:18,911	| IOT085 |	This
EDL	00:43:18,911	00:43:21,471	| IOT085 |	Graphical interface just makes
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:24,287	| IOT085 |	Easier a better experience to program the law
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:27,615	| IOT085 |	Programme schedules in the event that you have
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:28,895	| IOT085 |	A dog walker coming
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:31,455	| IOT085 |	I'm you have any scheduled events
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:33,759	| IOT085 |	And all that good stuff
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:36,063	| IOT085 |	All of our touch screen
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:36,575	| IOT085 |	Deadbolt
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,623	| IOT085 |	Have the penis keypad
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:41,439	| IOT085 |	Which is fingerprint resistant
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:47,839	| IOT085 |	They saw the heat and cold and all in a survive all the sledgehammer attack and all the crazy stuff you'd expect
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:48,607	| IOT085 |	Brea
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:49,887	| IOT085 |	A grade 1 lock
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:50,399	| IOT085 |	To survive
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:54,239	| IOT085 |	Let's talk about security and physical access in
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:55,519	| IOT085 |	Control
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:56,799	| IOT085 |	Access control I guess
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:59,359	| IOT085 |	A lot of companies in the lock space
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:03,711	| IOT085 |	Or who are getting into the locked space are viewing it as kind of a
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:10,111	| IOT085 |	As a home security play or possibly as a Services kind of play so there's like the August access serve
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:11,135	| IOT085 |	Service which is really interesting
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:13,951	| IOT085 |	Where do you think Schlage is going to kind of
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:20,351	| IOT085 |	I guess evolve in this world are you guys going to just be better locks which is totally fine are you guys going to try to move into some sort of
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:20,863	| IOT085 |	Other offer
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:24,447	| IOT085 |	No I think you're going to see us evolve in
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:25,215	| IOT085 |	And I think it
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:28,031	| IOT085 |	Really fantastic the whole crowdfunding
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:31,871	| IOT085 |	A movement although you know we've seen some crazy things come out right
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:33,919	| IOT085 |	Not all of them very useful
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:37,503	| IOT085 |	But interesting ideas that really helped to transform the station
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:41,343	| IOT085 |	Created a lot of opportunities within the category itself
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:42,879	| IOT085 |	I'd say the most important
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:45,183	| IOT085 |	Singing in our North Star is worth
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:46,463	| IOT085 |	Security company first
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:52,863	| IOT085 |	And we believe there's a small group of home automation Enthusiast made out of small group
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:55,679	| IOT085 |	You're certainly not as big as the main screen
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:56,191	| IOT085 |	We Believe
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:59,775	| IOT085 |	That there is a mainstream underserved
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:00,799	| IOT085 |	Gru
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:03,359	| IOT085 |	People who
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:05,919	| IOT085 |	Are really shopping first and foremost
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:06,943	| IOT085 |	Or
EDL	00:45:06,943	00:45:07,455	| IOT085 |	Security
EDL	00:45:07,967	00:45:08,479	| IOT085 |	Analogue
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:12,831	| IOT085 |	In a lock that is going to perform as
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:14,879	| IOT085 |	They would expect it to historically
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:17,951	| IOT085 |	But then has this incremental
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:18,463	| IOT085 |	Benefit
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:24,607	| IOT085 |	I'm in that could be connected it might just be the highest got a keypad and I don't have to carry he with me
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:25,887	| IOT085 |	But I think it's
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:29,983	| IOT085 |	Going to be an evolution towards enhancing
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:31,519	| IOT085 |	A better outcome
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:32,799	| IOT085 |	For the user
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:34,847	| IOT085 |	Those business cases
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:38,687	| IOT085 |	For the end users can be pretty complex today
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:40,735	| IOT085 |	You see a lot of people
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:41,759	| IOT085 |	Who want to connect
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:44,063	| IOT085 |	Different things within the
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:47,135	| IOT085 |	Home and what we're experts at is identifying
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:50,719	| IOT085 |	Which ones are those are safe to do
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:56,863	| IOT085 |	Which ones do you really need to think about more carefully before you do it so example of one that we would suggest
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:58,911	| IOT085 |	Hey Carson
EDL	00:45:58,911	00:46:00,191	| IOT085 |	You know who should be
EDL	00:46:00,191	00:46:03,263	| IOT085 |	You know some caution here
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:05,567	| IOT085 |	Would be proximity lock and unlock
EDL	00:46:06,335	00:46:08,127	| IOT085 |	So for example
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:10,687	| IOT085 |	People want the Star Trek to where you want to walk up
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:13,759	| IOT085 |	Have the door recognize you and unlocked for your convenience
EDL	00:46:14,527	00:46:15,039	| IOT085 |	Walt
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:17,087	| IOT085 |	We see some gas
EDL	00:46:17,087	00:46:19,647	| IOT085 |	In terms of the technology
EDL	00:46:19,647	00:46:21,695	| IOT085 |	Where is identifying Where You Are
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:23,743	| IOT085 |	Necessarily in proximity to the lock
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:25,535	| IOT085 |	Depending on where your garage
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:27,071	| IOT085 |	Example
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:31,679	| IOT085 |	Time you may be parallel to the lock or inside the home
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:34,751	| IOT085 |	And may inadvertently trigger The Loft open
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:36,287	| IOT085 |	And
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:38,847	| IOT085 |	It may be an infant a small a small chance
EDL	00:46:39,359	00:46:45,759	| IOT085 |	But you really have to ask yourself if your son or daughter or loved one is on the other side of the door and there's a
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:46,783	| IOT085 |	After Decline
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:49,599	| IOT085 |	And it unlocks and they hear it
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:51,391	| IOT085 |	Is that worth it
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:53,439	| IOT085 |	Sure and what I think about locks
EDL	00:46:53,439	00:46:56,767	| IOT085 |	That's a space where there might be some liability issues to
EDL	00:46:57,535	00:47:00,607	| IOT085 |	If someone wanted to pursue them and I don't know if that kind of
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:03,167	| IOT085 |	Obviously if you are a lock brand
EDL	00:47:03,167	00:47:05,727	| IOT085 |	That's your bread and butter is that your locked
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:07,775	| IOT085 |	Or unlocked at the person's will right
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:09,567	| IOT085 |	So having these
EDL	00:47:09,567	00:47:11,615	| IOT085 |	Potential for mistakes or uncertainty
EDL	00:47:12,127	00:47:15,455	| IOT085 |	Feels like it could be both a liability and a brand Issue 4
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:18,527	| IOT085 |	Are you guys how do you even innovate if you've got that kind of
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:20,063	| IOT085 |	A Culture of Fear there
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:21,599	| IOT085 |	I think
EDL	00:47:21,599	00:47:23,135	| IOT085 |	The easiest way to describe it
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:25,439	| IOT085 |	To say there's always a balance
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:26,719	| IOT085 |	Between physical
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:28,255	| IOT085 |	Security inconvenience
EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:31,839	| IOT085 |	It's always try to do is educate the consumer on
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:33,119	| IOT085 |	This is the most secure element
EDL	00:47:33,887	00:47:39,519	| IOT085 |	And hear some choices that you have and you can diminish a little bit of your security and gain some convenience there
EDL	00:47:39,519	00:47:41,311	| IOT085 |	But understand what it is
EDL	00:47:41,311	00:47:42,847	| IOT085 |	In the balance that you're trying to
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:43,359	| IOT085 |	Get there
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:47,199	| IOT085 |	So this is just a physical like locking and unlocking
EDL	00:47:47,199	00:47:47,967	| IOT085 |	King future
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:51,039	| IOT085 |	But once you put something online so with your Bluetooth
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:51,807	| IOT085 |	Lock for example
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:56,159	| IOT085 |	Or maybe if i integrated my zwave locks to a wink hub
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:48:02,559	| IOT085 |	Suddenly I am now has thrown in another partner for you guys that you may or may not know about and I've also
EDL	00:48:02,559	00:48:04,351	| IOT085 |	Open up another Avenue of attacked
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:06,655	| IOT085 |	To the Internet so how are you guys thinking about
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:07,423	| IOT085 |	Could have internet
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:09,983	| IOT085 |	Absolutely enough
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:12,799	| IOT085 |	The big question or one of the big question
EDL	00:48:12,799	00:48:13,567	| IOT085 |	For me
EDL	00:48:13,567	00:48:15,871	| IOT085 |	It says you're only strong as your weakest link
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:18,687	| IOT085 |	Sounds cliche but it's absolutely the truth and so
EDL	00:48:19,199	00:48:22,015	| IOT085 |	We spend a lot of time with the Hub providers
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:23,551	| IOT085 |	And with our partners
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:24,575	| IOT085 |	Identifying
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:26,879	| IOT085 |	We're through that chain
EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:28,159	| IOT085 |	Routine
EDL	00:48:28,159	00:48:30,463	| IOT085 |	Or robot or depending on your
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:33,791	| IOT085 |	You know when you're on your vendor they all have different names for it
EDL	00:48:33,791	00:48:36,863	| IOT085 |	Which ones will be allowed and which ones will not
EDL	00:48:36,863	00:48:37,631	| IOT085 |	The allowed
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:40,191	| IOT085 |	And quite frankly we asked
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:42,495	| IOT085 |	Spell subject matter experts for them on
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:43,263	| IOT085 |	What is
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:45,567	| IOT085 |	Appropriate and what is not appropriate
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:46,591	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:48:47,103	00:48:49,663	| IOT085 |	Pumpkin is a great example could you have your homekit lock
EDL	00:48:50,175	00:48:54,783	| IOT085 |	The homekit lock profile by August
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:56,831	| IOT085 |	And they actually recently had a
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:49:03,743	| IOT085 |	So it was on somebody said Okay Siri or hey Siri open the August door lock
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:06,047	| IOT085 |	And the person didn't have a password on their site
EDL	00:49:06,815	00:49:08,607	| IOT085 |	They're on their iPad and so Siri
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:09,631	| IOT085 |	Front door for them
EDL	00:49:10,143	00:49:12,447	| IOT085 |	Are you saying that your implementations are
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:18,079	| IOT085 |	Different from something like that or is there also a responsibility by someone like apple to say
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:19,359	| IOT085 |	Hey
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:23,711	| IOT085 |	Maybe we shouldn't have the door unlock verbally unless there's a password hint
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:28,319	| IOT085 |	Yeah I think there's a huge responsibility on the part of all the parties involved
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:31,391	| IOT085 |	Those types of gaps are things that we
EDL	00:49:31,391	00:49:32,415	| IOT085 |	Spend time
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:33,951	| IOT085 |	With them on
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:35,487	| IOT085 |	To try and identify again
EDL	00:49:35,999	00:49:37,023	| IOT085 |	It's that balance
EDL	00:49:37,023	00:49:37,791	| IOT085 |	Right
EDL	00:49:37,791	00:49:39,327	| IOT085 |	Between security
EDL	00:49:39,327	00:49:42,143	| IOT085 |	Inconvenience in our case we see those things as
EDL	00:49:42,143	00:49:44,191	| IOT085 |	As important gas that need to be addressed
EDL	00:49:44,959	00:49:50,847	| IOT085 |	I think it's also healthy to say and I'm not afraid to say it even as the futurist for a security company
EDL	00:49:50,847	00:49:53,151	| IOT085 |	Nothing is 100% secure
EDL	00:49:53,663	00:49:55,967	| IOT085 |	And anybody that tells you that it is
EDL	00:49:56,479	00:49:58,271	| IOT085 |	Is either naive or dishonest
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:50:01,855	| IOT085 |	And so I think there's a lot of things that
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:02,879	| IOT085 |	People have done
EDL	00:50:03,391	00:50:07,231	| IOT085 |	Especially people who are trying to Garner attention to a new brand
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:09,535	| IOT085 |	Or startup company or something like that
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:11,071	| IOT085 |	To try and drive it.
EDL	00:50:11,583	00:50:17,471	| IOT085 |	Perfectly secure for all these things and all that is as bait for the hacker community
EDL	00:50:18,495	00:50:22,847	| IOT085 |	You know I think another thing or subject that's tied very closely to your question
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:23,871	| IOT085 |	Chicken is privacy
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:24,639	| IOT085 |	Is well
EDL	00:50:25,151	00:50:27,455	| IOT085 |	And as we go forward
EDL	00:50:27,455	00:50:27,967	| IOT085 |	I think
EDL	00:50:28,479	00:50:34,367	| IOT085 |	Consumers going to have a lot of questions as they're comparing you know whether it's Google home and apple or SmartThings and
EDL	00:50:34,879	00:50:35,903	| IOT085 |	In Amazon
EDL	00:50:35,903	00:50:38,463	| IOT085 |	Yes they're going to have to make some choices in terms of
EDL	00:50:38,463	00:50:39,743	| IOT085 |	What information
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:41,791	| IOT085 |	They're willing to share from a privacy
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:43,327	| IOT085 |	Standpoint and what they are
EDL	00:50:43,839	00:50:47,679	| IOT085 |	In another way that we try and address some of those things is
EDL	00:50:47,679	00:50:49,983	| IOT085 |	What working hard to give options
EDL	00:50:49,983	00:50:53,055	| IOT085 |	As to whether we're going to play in a mesh Network
EDL	00:50:53,055	00:50:56,383	| IOT085 |	Does he know what that is you know Z-Wave type framework
EDL	00:50:56,383	00:50:56,895	| IOT085 |	Where
EDL	00:50:57,407	00:50:58,431	| IOT085 |	We're going to just
EDL	00:50:58,431	00:51:00,991	| IOT085 |	Share the information directly with your hot provider
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:02,527	| IOT085 |	Or in a cloud
EDL	00:51:02,527	00:51:05,343	| IOT085 |	Cloud type of situation where we have much work
EDL	00:51:05,343	00:51:07,647	| IOT085 |	Control over what is shared or not
EDL	00:51:07,647	00:51:11,999	| IOT085 |	But ultimately we want to put those types of decisions in the hands of the consumer
EDL	00:51:12,511	00:51:15,583	| IOT085 |	Okay and I know the cloud-to-cloud situation help me
EDL	00:51:16,095	00:51:18,399	| IOT085 |	Many years back I had someone hack my wink
EDL	00:51:19,167	00:51:24,031	| IOT085 |	And they were unable to control the Chamberlain MyQ because of the
EDL	00:51:24,031	00:51:29,663	| IOT085 |	But they were able to unlock my Z-Wave locks these were not yours
EDL	00:51:33,503	00:51:37,087	| IOT085 |	Because of the way that radio works
EDL	00:51:37,855	00:51:40,671	| IOT085 |	If I had had one on there
EDL	00:51:40,671	00:51:43,231	| IOT085 |	It's possible that it would have been locked at 2 cuz that's just
EDL	00:51:43,999	00:51:48,095	| IOT085 |	The radio the truth then you don't want you
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:50,399	| IOT085 |	Call Arkansas. Circumstance
EDL	00:51:50,399	00:51:51,935	| IOT085 |	What's going to take the command
EDL	00:51:51,935	00:51:53,215	| IOT085 |	From The Hub and so
EDL	00:51:53,215	00:51:56,287	| IOT085 |	I think people are Chamberlain deserve a lot of credit
EDL	00:51:56,287	00:51:57,567	| IOT085 |	For very early on
EDL	00:51:58,079	00:51:59,871	| IOT085 |	Yuan their development process
EDL	00:51:59,871	00:52:01,407	| IOT085 |	Figuring out ways
EDL	00:52:01,407	00:52:02,175	| IOT085 |	Hugh
EDL	00:52:02,175	00:52:07,295	| IOT085 |	Creatively manage some of these things without inconveniencing the consumer so kudos to them
EDL	00:52:07,807	00:52:08,831	| IOT085 |	Yay
EDL	00:52:09,343	00:52:10,111	| IOT085 |	All right
EDL	00:52:10,111	00:52:14,463	| IOT085 |	No there's been talk in Europe and there's even been talk among people here
EDL	00:52:14,463	00:52:17,279	| IOT085 |	Different organizations here about creating kind of
EDL	00:52:17,791	00:52:19,327	| IOT085 |	A sticker certification
EDL	00:52:19,839	00:52:23,679	| IOT085 |	Or maybe like a Good Housekeeping seal of approval for security
EDL	00:52:24,191	00:52:26,495	| IOT085 |	Like a security framework for devices
EDL	00:52:26,495	00:52:27,263	| IOT085 |	In the home
EDL	00:52:27,263	00:52:30,591	| IOT085 |	And I'm curious where you guys might stand on something like that
EDL	00:52:31,615	00:52:32,127	| IOT085 |	We have
EDL	00:52:32,639	00:52:35,455	| IOT085 |	Mechanical version of that
EDL	00:52:35,455	00:52:37,503	| IOT085 |	In in the form of bhma
EDL	00:52:37,503	00:52:39,295	| IOT085 |	Which you know are are
EDL	00:52:39,295	00:52:45,695	| IOT085 |	Hardware standards grade 1 lock her grades to lock or grade three lock and what those would indicate would be
EDL	00:52:45,695	00:52:47,743	| IOT085 |	You know it survive
EDL	00:52:47,743	00:52:50,559	| IOT085 |	This type of heat and cold to survive this type of
EDL	00:52:50,559	00:52:52,095	| IOT085 |	Sledgehammer attack
EDL	00:52:52,095	00:52:53,631	| IOT085 |	Kickin attempt to work
EDL	00:52:53,631	00:52:55,167	| IOT085 |	You know fire safety
EDL	00:52:56,959	00:52:58,751	| IOT085 |	We're very familiar with those texts
EDL	00:52:58,751	00:53:02,079	| IOT085 |	Frameworks and that's not necessarily A Bad Thing
EDL	00:53:02,079	00:53:06,175	| IOT085 |	What I would say is as I'll go ahead and say the expert across
EDL	00:53:06,175	00:53:07,199	| IOT085 |	A couple of different
EDL	00:53:07,711	00:53:09,503	| IOT085 |	Spaces in the commercial space
EDL	00:53:10,271	00:53:12,063	| IOT085 |	You find the standard
EDL	00:53:12,063	00:53:15,391	| IOT085 |	To be quite desperate you see a lot of proprietary Solutions
EDL	00:53:15,903	00:53:17,695	| IOT085 |	That claim to be more
EDL	00:53:17,695	00:53:18,463	| IOT085 |	Secure
EDL	00:53:18,463	00:53:21,023	| IOT085 |	And then you see a body
EDL	00:53:21,023	00:53:26,911	| IOT085 |	A group of people like Sia I'm trying to come together and provides standards not unlike
EDL	00:53:26,911	00:53:29,471	| IOT085 |	You know the ones you've been talking about on your podcast
EDL	00:53:29,471	00:53:31,519	| IOT085 |	You know all join you no excetera
EDL	00:53:32,031	00:53:33,823	| IOT085 |	I think we're certainly open
EDL	00:53:33,823	00:53:35,871	| IOT085 |	Time-in we're always looking
EDL	00:53:35,871	00:53:36,895	| IOT085 |	Shoe Drive
EDL	00:53:36,895	00:53:40,223	| IOT085 |	Open architecture and Open Standards because
EDL	00:53:40,223	00:53:44,063	| IOT085 |	We believe there's a lot better technology out there when it
EDL	00:53:44,063	00:53:44,831	| IOT085 |	Cher
EDL	00:53:44,831	00:53:49,951	| IOT085 |	I personally and in as a company we believe the proprietary definitely does not mean more
EDL	00:53:53,023	00:53:56,607	| IOT085 |	So let's talk about you guys currently support lots of difference
EDL	00:53:56,607	00:53:57,375	| IOT085 |	Cubs
EDL	00:53:58,399	00:54:00,191	| IOT085 |	Different wireless networks
EDL	00:54:00,191	00:54:01,727	| IOT085 |	Y'all are clearly out there
EDL	00:54:02,239	00:54:03,007	| IOT085 |	Doing a lot
EDL	00:54:03,007	00:54:04,031	| IOT085 |	How do you view
EDL	00:54:04,543	00:54:05,823	| IOT085 |	The lifetime of it Electra
EDL	00:54:06,335	00:54:12,223	| IOT085 |	So I feel like a lock is something I installing might like an old-school lock change those unless
EDL	00:54:12,223	00:54:16,575	| IOT085 |	You had like a break-in or something terrible has happened right this is or maybe you move
EDL	00:54:16,575	00:54:17,343	| IOT085 |	These are not
EDL	00:54:17,343	00:54:18,111	| IOT085 |	Things you
EDL	00:54:18,111	00:54:18,623	| IOT085 |	Upgrade on the
EDL	00:54:19,647	00:54:20,415	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:54:20,415	00:54:23,231	| IOT085 |	How do you see adding connectivity to this
EDL	00:54:23,743	00:54:24,511	| IOT085 |	Product
EDL	00:54:24,511	00:54:26,047	| IOT085 |	Changing that relationship
EDL	00:54:26,047	00:54:26,559	| IOT085 |	People have with it
EDL	00:54:27,327	00:54:29,119	| IOT085 |	So the hardware on our product
EDL	00:54:29,119	00:54:30,399	| IOT085 |	Is going to last
EDL	00:54:30,399	00:54:32,447	| IOT085 |	20 to 30 years at minimum
EDL	00:54:33,471	00:54:33,983	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:54:34,495	00:54:37,567	| IOT085 |	You do really get into the the question of
EDL	00:54:37,567	00:54:40,127	| IOT085 |	Okay so the hardware is going to last that long
EDL	00:54:40,127	00:54:44,991	| IOT085 |	You know just from experience the technology inside is going to change
EDL	00:54:46,527	00:54:52,159	| IOT085 |	We're trying very hard and I don't think obviously that we have this completely solved yet Stacy
EDL	00:54:52,159	00:54:53,695	| IOT085 |	But we try very hard.
EDL	00:54:53,695	00:54:55,231	| IOT085 |	What to do over the air updates
EDL	00:54:55,743	00:54:57,279	| IOT085 |	Updates
EDL	00:54:57,279	00:54:59,839	| IOT085 |	Create Headroom within the processors
EDL	00:55:00,351	00:55:03,167	| IOT085 |	And the infrastructure within the lot
EDL	00:55:03,167	00:55:07,007	| IOT085 |	Such that we can make it is viable as we possibly
EDL	00:55:07,007	00:55:08,799	| IOT085 |	And for as long as we can
EDL	00:55:09,311	00:55:12,639	| IOT085 |	So we're working really hard to try and figure out
EDL	00:55:12,639	00:55:14,687	| IOT085 |	What is an appropriate lifetime
EDL	00:55:14,687	00:55:16,991	| IOT085 |	What you also don't want to do is here
EDL	00:55:16,991	00:55:23,391	| IOT085 |	We're trying to shrink the size of these locks right they're not the most beautiful things to look at all the time especially on the interior
EDL	00:55:23,391	00:55:24,159	| IOT085 |	Terriers
EDL	00:55:24,159	00:55:26,975	| IOT085 |	But we want to have a strong motor and we want to have
EDL	00:55:27,999	00:55:30,047	| IOT085 |	Technology in there that's going to make it last
EDL	00:55:30,559	00:55:31,327	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:55:31,327	00:55:33,375	| IOT085 |	Your 2008 Z-Wave lock
EDL	00:55:33,375	00:55:35,423	| IOT085 |	I believe was your first one
EDL	00:55:35,423	00:55:37,471	| IOT085 |	Are those still in the market are they still working
EDL	00:55:38,239	00:55:39,007	| IOT085 |	They're still working
EDL	00:55:39,519	00:55:42,079	| IOT085 |	Yes I'm proud to say they are still working
EDL	00:55:42,079	00:55:42,847	| IOT085 |	So
EDL	00:55:42,847	00:55:43,615	| IOT085 |	We haven't
EDL	00:55:45,151	00:55:46,943	| IOT085 |	A significant enough
EDL	00:55:46,943	00:55:49,503	| IOT085 |	Drop off of some of those Technologies sale
EDL	00:55:49,503	00:55:52,831	| IOT085 |	Stacy if we see you know some of the match match Networks
EDL	00:55:52,831	00:55:54,879	| IOT085 |	You don't go away which I don't think we're going to see but
EDL	00:55:55,391	00:55:56,927	| IOT085 |	If we were to see some of those
EDL	00:55:56,927	00:55:59,487	| IOT085 |	You know Rod wife still changes
EDL	00:55:59,487	00:56:01,535	| IOT085 |	Gmic chef
EDL	00:56:01,535	00:56:05,631	| IOT085 |	We definitely do see a trend obviously especially in DIY Market
EDL	00:56:05,631	00:56:08,191	| IOT085 |	Towards a cloud to Cloud infrastructure
EDL	00:56:08,191	00:56:10,495	| IOT085 |	As opposed to let you know I'm a mess
EDL	00:56:10,495	00:56:12,287	| IOT085 |	Network infrastructure
EDL	00:56:12,287	00:56:17,407	| IOT085 |	But we actually see both of those products s living beside each other for quite some time
EDL	00:56:18,687	00:56:22,271	| IOT085 |	Alright this brings us to cost because right now A connected deadbolt
EDL	00:56:22,783	00:56:24,831	| IOT085 |	Even if it's not Bluetooth or something fancy
EDL	00:56:25,343	00:56:26,111	| IOT085 |	Still alive
EDL	00:56:26,623	00:56:29,183	| IOT085 |	Sometimes 5x the cost of a normal door lock
EDL	00:56:29,183	00:56:30,463	| IOT085 |	Is this a
EDL	00:56:30,463	00:56:33,535	| IOT085 |	Reasonable thing to expect should we see this go down
EDL	00:56:34,815	00:56:38,143	| IOT085 |	No no I think it depends on features and functions I mean
EDL	00:56:38,655	00:56:40,703	| IOT085 |	We don't know what the sweet spot is yet
EDL	00:56:40,703	00:56:41,471	| IOT085 |	To be candid
EDL	00:56:41,471	00:56:43,263	| IOT085 |	We're going to try and find that
EDL	00:56:43,263	00:56:48,383	| IOT085 |	Obviously you're investing a lot in R&D and development on these things and that's not cheap
EDL	00:56:48,383	00:56:49,919	| IOT085 |	But I think you'll start the
EDL	00:56:49,919	00:56:50,687	| IOT085 |	Sissy
EDL	00:56:50,687	00:56:52,735	| IOT085 |	Better and better solution
EDL	00:56:52,735	00:56:54,271	| IOT085 |	Coming forward with
EDL	00:56:54,271	00:56:55,551	| IOT085 |	Different features
EDL	00:56:55,551	00:56:57,599	| IOT085 |	The price points
EDL	00:56:57,599	00:57:00,671	| IOT085 |	You know somewhere people you know who might not be filled
EDL	00:57:00,671	00:57:04,255	| IOT085 |	Feeling comfortable about it today to get out there
EDL	00:57:04,767	00:57:06,303	| IOT085 |	In in to get one
EDL	00:57:06,815	00:57:08,863	| IOT085 |	I think the value prop
EDL	00:57:08,863	00:57:10,655	| IOT085 |	That a lot of people are seeing
EDL	00:57:10,655	00:57:12,703	| IOT085 |	And we have a pretty wide rain so we have a lot of
EDL	00:57:12,703	00:57:14,495	| IOT085 |	Non-connected Electronics
EDL	00:57:14,495	00:57:15,775	| IOT085 |	Deadbolt
EDL	00:57:15,775	00:57:16,543	| IOT085 |	As well
EDL	00:57:16,543	00:57:17,823	| IOT085 |	So they give you some contact
EDL	00:57:18,335	00:57:22,175	| IOT085 |	So in the last year we sold 1.1 million electronic locks
EDL	00:57:23,199	00:57:24,991	| IOT085 |	Electronic lock
EDL	00:57:25,503	00:57:27,807	| IOT085 |	A tremendous number those were actually
EDL	00:57:27,807	00:57:29,087	| IOT085 |	Lost it we're not connecting
EDL	00:57:30,111	00:57:32,415	| IOT085 |	So they have a keypad on them
EDL	00:57:32,415	00:57:37,791	| IOT085 |	You know some of the Innovation that you'll see from us that you might not necessarily expect from a company like Schlage
EDL	00:57:38,303	00:57:39,071	| IOT085 |	Will be on
EDL	00:57:39,583	00:57:44,191	| IOT085 |	How can we provide an enhanced capability for people with a specific need
EDL	00:57:44,191	00:57:48,287	| IOT085 |	For example like a landlord hey I have multiple properties
EDL	00:57:48,287	00:57:49,055	| IOT085 |	Can you
EDL	00:57:49,567	00:57:50,591	| IOT085 |	Organized he's in
EDL	00:57:51,871	00:57:54,943	| IOT085 |	But it makes me easier to manage remote properties
EDL	00:57:54,943	00:57:58,783	| IOT085 |	Reset codes all those things that you would want to do
EDL	00:57:58,783	00:58:03,647	| IOT085 |	Either a lot of other DIY devices in there as well you know you think about the
EDL	00:58:06,719	00:58:08,255	| IOT085 |	All these other devices
EDL	00:58:08,255	00:58:12,863	| IOT085 |	But you may want to set back to you know a different temperature or an original setting
EDL	00:58:12,863	00:58:14,655	| IOT085 |	Once your tenants of laughs
EDL	00:58:15,423	00:58:15,935	| IOT085 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:58:18,239	00:58:20,543	| IOT085 |	I use the keypad door lock
EDL	00:58:21,055	00:58:22,847	| IOT085 |	Or that I use the actual
EDL	00:58:22,847	00:58:23,615	| IOT085 |	Remote connectivity
EDL	00:58:24,127	00:58:24,639	| IOT085 |	Aspect
EDL	00:58:25,151	00:58:26,431	| IOT085 |	Let's keep going
EDL	00:58:26,431	00:58:27,199	| IOT085 |	Real fast
EDL	00:58:27,711	00:58:28,735	| IOT085 |	Final question for you
EDL	00:58:29,247	00:58:31,807	| IOT085 |	Are you guys going to stick with being a devices
EDL	00:58:31,807	00:58:33,599	| IOT085 |	Company or are you looking at services
EDL	00:58:34,623	00:58:35,647	| IOT085 |	I think that

EDL	00:59:19,679	00:59:24,799	| IOT085 |	We're going to try and provide the type of app functionality over time that people are asking
EDL	00:59:24,799	00:59:27,359	| IOT085 |	The kind of what we talked about before
EDL	00:59:27,359	00:59:32,223	| IOT085 |	If you have a very specific need you know you're a landlord or no some other element

EDL	00:59:33,503	00:59:35,807	| IOT085 |	Not only ourselves but with partners
EDL	00:59:36,319	00:59:37,599	| IOT085 |	Try and develop
EDL	00:59:37,599	00:59:41,439	| IOT085 |	I'm good kids that are very intuitive and easy-to-use
EDL	00:59:42,719	00:59:46,047	| IOT085 |	College was an RA a resident advisor
EDL	00:59:46,047	00:59:46,559	| IOT085 |	Benidorm
EDL	00:59:47,071	00:59:48,095	| IOT085 |	And I can tell you
EDL	00:59:48,095	00:59:49,631	| IOT085 |	Biggest pain in the butt
EDL	00:59:50,143	00:59:53,215	| IOT085 |	Was when people would forget their keys and I would have to
EDL	00:59:53,215	00:59:55,775	| IOT085 |	Either escort them my cells are called like
EDL	00:59:55,775	00:59:56,799	| IOT085 |	Somebody
EDL	00:59:56,799	00:59:59,871	| IOT085 |	Call a security person to come and unlock their door for them
EDL	00:59:59,871	01:00:03,967	| IOT085 |	I'm like wow how awesome would it be if you could just be like
EDL	01:00:06,783	01:00:09,087	| IOT085 |	We got you covered on that
EDL	01:00:10,367	01:00:16,767	| IOT085 |	Yes all the notes were capability to I need to start thinking about is when you talk about
EDL	01:00:16,767	01:00:17,535	| IOT085 |	City managers
EDL	01:00:17,535	01:00:19,327	| IOT085 |	Executive Sous job overtime
EDL	01:00:19,839	01:00:24,703	| IOT085 |	Has been to either audit doors you know for fire safety or for any number of things
EDL	01:00:25,215	01:00:31,103	| IOT085 |	Now we can really make some productivity gains for them we have a lot of what we call him no tour
EDL	01:00:31,615	01:00:34,175	| IOT085 |	Functionality where you can go and touch that lock
EDL	01:00:34,175	01:00:36,735	| IOT085 |	Without having to physically be there
EDL	01:00:36,735	01:00:40,831	| IOT085 |	I think it's also something important in a we start talking about
EDL	01:00:40,831	01:00:42,111	| IOT085 |	What's your plan
EDL	01:00:42,111	01:00:44,927	| IOT085 |	Not for if you're going to get hacked but when
EDL	01:00:44,927	01:00:47,743	| IOT085 |	How can we Flash the firmware
EDL	01:00:47,743	01:00:49,023	| IOT085 |	Quickly easily
EDL	01:00:49,535	01:00:52,607	| IOT085 |	Verses where if you had a master key solution
EDL	01:00:52,607	01:00:54,143	| IOT085 |	You know for a large campus
EDL	01:00:54,143	01:00:55,679	| IOT085 |	And if that master key got lost
EDL	01:00:56,703	01:00:59,775	| IOT085 |	You're going to go change out every single cylinder in that campus
EDL	01:01:00,799	01:01:02,079	| IOT085 |	Alright so the end of the master
EDL	01:01:03,103	01:01:04,127	| IOT085 |	At the beginning of
