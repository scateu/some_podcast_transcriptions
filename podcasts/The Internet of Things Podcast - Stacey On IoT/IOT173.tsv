EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:44,192	| IOT173 |	I'm doing this for the Pacific Northwest and there is a very
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:46,240	| IOT173 |	Excited black bird that really likes

EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:53,664	| IOT173 |	I have to actually add a disclaimer to
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:02:00,064	| IOT173 |	Before we talk about some of these thing I am currently doing some freelance Consulting writing for Google a
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:02,112	| IOT173 |	It is specifically with Eric
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:08,000	| IOT173 |	Chrome OS Enterprise team has nothing to do with iot but just wanted to mention that cuz we will be talking about Google today
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,280	| IOT173 |	So much Google
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:11,072	| IOT173 |	Let's kick it off with
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,376	| IOT173 |	Next CEO
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,168	| IOT173 |	Out
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:15,936	| IOT173 |	So
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:17,984	| IOT173 |	Marwan fawaz
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:18,752	| IOT173 |	Joined
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:24,896	| IOT173 |	Google in 2016 and took over as CEO of nest
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:26,688	| IOT173 |	Aetna
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:27,712	| IOT173 |	Plus
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:30,528	| IOT173 |	Is part of the reporting on the story we learned it
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:32,064	| IOT173 |	Google did try to sell nest
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,088	| IOT173 |	To Amazon
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:35,904	| IOT173 |	So lot of stuff here
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,976	| IOT173 |	Yeah it all comes back to the same
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:43,328	| IOT173 |	Central theme that many of us had when Google bought nest
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:44,864	| IOT173 |	2 / 3.2 billion dollars
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:45,632	| IOT173 |	Back in 2014
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:47,680	| IOT173 |	Yeah that fart was
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:49,984	| IOT173 |	They paid 3.2 billion dollars which is a lie
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:54,336	| IOT173 |	And ever since then that's has just never seem to
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:59,712	| IOT173 |	Fit for whatever reason from a financial standpoint Google has a new CFO as of 20
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,992	| IOT173 |	15
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:03,296	| IOT173 |	That's Ruth Torah and
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:09,696	| IOT173 |	Having worked at Google Underoos not directly obviously but Google is very much more held accountable for its finances
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,720	| IOT173 |	Now and
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:13,280	| IOT173 |	So that's an issue right there if Nest is not making
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,560	| IOT173 |	Enough money to
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:16,096	| IOT173 |	Recoup the investment
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,888	| IOT173 |	Shirley doubted us then you've got
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,168	| IOT173 |	The issues that
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:20,960	| IOT173 |	Adele had with Google and
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:25,568	| IOT173 |	We say he stepped down but I think he may have been forced out that's just my thought
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:28,384	| IOT173 |	Yeah because yeah his management style was
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,176	| IOT173 |	Google
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:32,224	| IOT173 |	Too much
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:36,064	| IOT173 |	And if you remember Google also have their own smartphone
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:38,368	| IOT173 |	Same time so they were like parallel tracks
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:41,696	| IOT173 |	Set development Tony was focused on developing this
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:43,744	| IOT173 |	Crazy new thread protocol
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:46,048	| IOT173 |	Right and it wasn't focused on products
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,352	| IOT173 |	And they were forced to integrate Dropcam
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,144	| IOT173 |	It just it was naughty
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:51,424	| IOT173 |	Copacetic
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,472	| IOT173 |	So he was forced out
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:54,496	| IOT173 |	Then
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,312	| IOT173 |	Well and then
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:04:03,712	| IOT173 |	Marlin came along and they put him in charge but as we're finding out he really wasn't around that much he lived in
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:07,040	| IOT173 |	Denver and the nestings in Palo Alto I believe
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:09,088	| IOT173 |	So there's some rumbling on that fact
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:11,648	| IOT173 |	Change in leadership may be the leader
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:15,232	| IOT173 |	Vision is an issue or wasn't if I don't know all-in-all what's happening hours
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:17,024	| IOT173 |	As you said I wanted out
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:18,047	| IOT173 |	And the
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:22,911	| IOT173 |	Nest team is now moving under the Google home and living room area
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:26,239	| IOT173 |	We just part of Google Hardware which is run by
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,007	| IOT173 |	Marlins
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:30,335	| IOT173 |	Motorola Powell Rick osterloh
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,383	| IOT173 |	So Nest should be under
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,151	| IOT173 |	In my opinion
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,431	| IOT173 |	The Google Hardware division
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:40,319	| IOT173 |	Because I need to be sharing the information and their efforts and projects with all of their hardwood addict
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:44,159	| IOT173 |	Cohesive line of products right now they don't I mean I still can't
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:47,487	| IOT173 |	Use Google home with certain Nest products for sale
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:48,767	| IOT173 |	Sample minutes
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:51,327	| IOT173 |	Weird yeah and nest
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:54,655	| IOT173 |	Had been pulled back in February that's was pulled back
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,423	| IOT173 |	Talking to
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:57,727	| IOT173 |	Google from an alphabet company
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:59,519	| IOT173 |	From being its own independent alphabet
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:04,895	| IOT173 |	And so this change that because if you're going to be pulled back in as a hardware company
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:08,223	| IOT173 |	Google you don't need your own CEO so this makes sense
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:09,759	| IOT173 |	It also made sense back when they
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:10,527	| IOT173 |	Hired
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:13,599	| IOT173 |	It felt like they were going to try to sell nest
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,367	| IOT173 |	Figure out what
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,135	| IOT173 |	To do with it
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:21,279	| IOT173 |	So in some ways this is good news for people who love nest care because it means that Google is not going to try to sell
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,583	| IOT173 |	They're just like okay we've got it
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,607	| IOT173 |	How to make the best of it
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,143	| IOT173 |	Start pulling all the stuff
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:31,775	| IOT173 |	So I agree with you there I can't help but wonder what would have happened if Amazon had bought it
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,335	| IOT173 |	Then we'd only have
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:40,223	| IOT173 |	Yeah I did I don't know & Shirley
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:40,991	| IOT173 |	Plank
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,271	| IOT173 |	And Ringwood
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:48,415	| IOT173 |	I'd still be there possibly be their own entities that I don't think they would be purchased by Amazon at this point they only
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,695	| IOT173 |	Right might have blank
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:51,999	| IOT173 |	As blank I think was much more of a hardware
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:55,071	| IOT173 |	Technology Center staff
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,631	| IOT173 |	Right here we go
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,423	| IOT173 |	Give so that's the latest on desk
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,727	| IOT173 |	As if you owned a scare I think this is good news
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:05,055	| IOT173 |	One more time
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:07,359	| IOT173 |	3.2 billion.
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:07,871	| IOT173 |	Okay I'm done
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:11,199	| IOT173 |	Remember that he D fun days
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,783	| IOT173 |	All right
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:17,343	| IOT173 |	Let's talk about Industrial iot
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:17,855	| IOT173 |	GE
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,415	| IOT173 |	Microsoft Cloud
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:23,999	| IOT173 |	So I talked about Microsoft Azure 4 years it is
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:26,047	| IOT173 |	Top cloud of choice for people building
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:28,351	| IOT173 |	GES
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,887	| IOT173 |	Decided
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:36,031	| IOT173 |	So they are going to be pulling together much more integration between the products appliances and software in
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:37,567	| IOT173 |	Services
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,335	| IOT173 |	And software
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:42,431	| IOT173 |	You're going to have more integration between Microsoft Azure Analytics
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,455	| IOT173 |	Azure iot
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,015	| IOT173 |	This is
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:49,855	| IOT173 |	Part of an ongoing seeing that we're seeing in the industrial iot which is
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,647	| IOT173 |	All the Defenders have realized
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,439	| IOT173 |	There's a couple realizations one
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,207	| IOT173 |	They realized
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:56,767	| IOT173 |	Way too hard to pull all the stuff together for
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,559	| IOT173 |	Companies that are not used to dealing with I
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:04,191	| IOT173 |	So GE has to work harder
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,727	| IOT173 |	Original GE was like
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:08,543	| IOT173 |	Hey we can do the it side too and they were building
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:10,591	| IOT173 |	Critics cloud and all this crazy stuff in
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,871	| IOT173 |	That's gone
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:14,431	| IOT173 |	So they realize that they should let it guys do the it
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:19,039	| IOT173 |	Do the industrial not stop
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:20,831	| IOT173 |	Work together to create the
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:22,111	| IOT173 |	Really tightly integrated pack
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:24,671	| IOT173 |	About calling this an end-to-end solution
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,999	| IOT173 |	But in this case it actually works
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,279	| IOT173 |	So that is
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:29,791	| IOT173 |	WhatsApp
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:32,351	| IOT173 |	We're seeing it happen all over
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:35,167	| IOT173 |	We're seeing companies like sap and
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,935	| IOT173 |	Sazon
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:36,447	| IOT173 |	Xeomin
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:37,727	| IOT173 |	All of them
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:40,543	| IOT173 |	Tying at these Cloud assets and even doing so
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,055	| IOT173 |	Some Partnerships
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,871	| IOT173 |	Vertically specific companies as well
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:45,407	| IOT173 |	So it's a big deal
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:46,431	| IOT173 |	Is another
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:48,479	| IOT173 |	For Microsoft
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:50,527	| IOT173 |	Credibility in the industrial
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:51,039	| IOT173 |	End
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:52,831	| IOT173 |	That's what this is
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:56,927	| IOT173 |	I don't claim to be an expert in Microsoft Azure cuz I'm certainly not
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:08:03,327	| IOT173 |	That's not anything I've looked at in detail but one thing I did note in here and I don't know how true it is or isn't but one of the other benefits for
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:06,143	| IOT173 |	GE is to enhance the product
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:06,911	| IOT173 |	Platforms
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:07,935	| IOT173 |	Security layer
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:08,703	| IOT173 |	Thrasher
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:10,751	| IOT173 |	So that is always a good thing assuming that is true
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:19,967	| IOT173 |	Alright we'll speaking of GE we're going to move from their industrial stuff making jet airplane engines and all that
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,991	| IOT173 |	It's tough to
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,015	| IOT173 |	Their home appliances
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:27,135	| IOT173 |	They announced on Tuesday that they had created the GE smart
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:27,647	| IOT173 |	Microwave
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,695	| IOT173 |	This is a microwave
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,975	| IOT173 |	Is wifi connect
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:33,791	| IOT173 |	And is integrated with Madam
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,839	| IOT173 |	You basically can scan
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:40,959	| IOT173 |	3000 different microwavable products from Hot Pockets
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:44,287	| IOT173 |	Studio Cuisine and it will automatically know the instructions
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:44,799	| IOT173 |	Cooking time
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,335	| IOT173 |	Is popping in the microwave
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,663	| IOT173 |	Start the microwave
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:50,431	| IOT173 |	And then poop
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:54,527	| IOT173 |	What's amazing about this
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,551	| IOT173 |	Historical price
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,087	| IOT173 |	That's what Kevin thinks
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,903	| IOT173 |	The price is 125
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:01,439	| IOT173 |	Actually the MSRP
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,463	| IOT173 |	Which is the manufacturer
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,255	| IOT173 |	What is actually
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:05,791	| IOT173 |	Suggested retail price
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,071	| IOT173 |	There we go
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,375	| IOT173 |	So MSRP is 139
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,399	| IOT173 |	So my God
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,935	| IOT173 |	Oh you got to keep going
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,215	| IOT173 |	You feel like this is a
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:20,127	| IOT173 |	I think this is a great College thing although her college requires you to rent the microwaves that they provide but that's a whole nother
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:25,247	| IOT173 |	Absolutely I mean it's not a huge microwave at 2.9 cubic feet so
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:27,551	| IOT173 |	It is perfect for like a dorm
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,063	| IOT173 |	And
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,623	| IOT173 |	Yeah yeah I made it
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:32,671	| IOT173 |	And it's also not expensive
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,207	| IOT173 |	No it is
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:36,767	| IOT173 |	MSRP is 139 and then
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:39,583	| IOT173 |	As part of prime day they did a deal where they bundle this with
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:41,887	| IOT173 |	An Amazon Echo dot for 125
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,423	| IOT173 |	Now that's a visible
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,447	| IOT173 |	That deal will be
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:46,751	| IOT173 |	Today is not Friday
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,079	| IOT173 |	But it's pretty sweet
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:52,127	| IOT173 |	So here's what I'm excited
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:57,247	| IOT173 |	Kevin is rightly excited about the price but I'm excited because it's going to have What's called the
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,271	| IOT173 |	Cooking and time
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,039	| IOT173 |	Controllers with
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:09:59,807	| IOT173 |	Matamata
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,343	| IOT173 |	So consumers will be able to
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,879	| IOT173 |	Directly to her
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,415	| IOT173 |	Without using GE
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:05,439	| IOT173 |	Appliances
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:07,487	| IOT173 |	Basically natives
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,815	| IOT173 |	Cooking and time controller
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,351	| IOT173 |	Where's the Amazon has now added
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,887	| IOT173 |	So you no longer have to say
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,655	| IOT173 |	Anime
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:15,935	| IOT173 |	Ask
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:16,703	| IOT173 |	Geneva
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,983	| IOT173 |	To start the microwave
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:20,287	| IOT173 |	If you could just say Madam a start the microwave
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,567	| IOT173 |	So this is
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,591	| IOT173 |	Huge
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,871	| IOT173 |	I agree
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:27,199	| IOT173 |	Is signals one the creation of a new type of
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,223	| IOT173 |	Native skills
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,503	| IOT173 |	Matamata
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:34,367	| IOT173 |	Intuit signals that GE recognizes that asking Geneva for stuff is sucky
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:37,439	| IOT173 |	Well now I wonder I wonder how many other
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:39,743	| IOT173 |	Partnerships will come about once people start
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:43,071	| IOT173 |	Enjoying the fact that they don't have to name the skill and their command
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,095	| IOT173 |	What's up that's what I like
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,399	| IOT173 |	SP exclusive to GE
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:48,191	| IOT173 |	Opportunity for Amazon
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:50,239	| IOT173 |	This is just become
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,775	| IOT173 |	Everyone else could use it
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:57,407	| IOT173 |	Number two is that Delta faucet is working on an
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,943	| IOT173 |	Amazon integration
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,711	| IOT173 |	4 faucet
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:01,247	| IOT173 |	Which means you'd have native
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,015	| IOT173 |	Support for
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,295	| IOT173 |	Turning your wife us
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,319	| IOT173 |	We talked about that last
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:08,671	| IOT173 |	So a lot of Hope in my heart that Amazon is
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,951	| IOT173 |	Trying so hard
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:12,255	| IOT173 |	To become the standard Slayer
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:12,767	| IOT173 |	4
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,303	| IOT173 |	Smart home and
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,327	| IOT173 |	This Market
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:20,191	| IOT173 |	J&D time if they can come up with standards that will eventually let's say
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,471	| IOT173 |	Have met him a work with
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:22,239	| IOT173 |	All
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,543	| IOT173 |	Madam a enabled voice services
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:29,919	| IOT173 |	Not have a skill for it all just have a API layer that will work with different brands and so I'm behind the scenes
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,455	| IOT173 |	That could be big
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:33,759	| IOT173 |	So not only is a microwave cool but how you talk
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:38,623	| IOT173 |	Speaking of the echo
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,135	| IOT173 |	Kevin
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:41,439	| IOT173 |	Do you want to upgrade your Echo
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,231	| IOT173 |	I do not
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:45,791	| IOT173 |	However that is a question we
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:51,167	| IOT173 |	Commonly hear from Friends colleagues and countrymen and women around the world and
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,191	| IOT173 |	I feel like we should give us
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,215	| IOT173 |	Special shout out to
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:55,775	| IOT173 |	We should he's in your backyard there because
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:56,543	| IOT173 |	Season
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,567	| IOT173 |	Washington State
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:59,103	| IOT173 |	Our old house
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,383	| IOT173 |	Yeah probably
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:02,687	| IOT173 |	Mr. Chris Albrecht who has
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:05,247	| IOT173 |	We work for them in the past to go home and
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:07,551	| IOT173 |	I know he's doing some podcasting work these days as well
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,319	| IOT173 |	It hasn't been
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,343	| IOT173 |	For a while but
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,647	| IOT173 |	Every once in awhile mr. Albrecht
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:14,207	| IOT173 |	Ping us and say Kevin Spacey
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:16,767	| IOT173 |	Can I get a new Echo is it time to upgrade my ago
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:18,047	| IOT173 |	Is there a new Echo coming out
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,071	| IOT173 |	Checking account now
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:19,583	| IOT173 |	How about now
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:20,863	| IOT173 |	So
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:25,727	| IOT173 |	Yes I'm making fun of course but it's actually a valid question and Rye Crist over at CNET
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:29,055	| IOT173 |	Poses that question in an article that both looked at before the show
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:34,431	| IOT173 |	I don't know let me try make some good points I mean you have to understand if you're going to buy a new Echo then you are
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,711	| IOT173 |	Committing further to
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:37,503	| IOT173 |	Being in the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:38,527	| IOT173 |	And that's fine
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,319	| IOT173 |	That's totally okay
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:41,343	| IOT173 |	Security guard
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:44,671	| IOT173 |	Without a doubt you and I are both happy and as are many other people
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:45,951	| IOT173 |	However
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:49,279	| IOT173 |	I like flexibility and I'm glad where I pointed this out
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:54,143	| IOT173 |	That's why I was kind of hot on the Sonos one because it came with Madam a
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:54,911	| IOT173 |	Out of the box
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,447	| IOT173 |	But he's also getting
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,727	| IOT173 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,007	| IOT173 |	At some point this year.
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:02,079	| IOT173 |	Plan it did recently get AirPlay 2 as well for
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:03,103	| IOT173 |	Controlling music
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:03,871	| IOT173 |	Interior
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:05,407	| IOT173 |	IOS device by voice
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:10,783	| IOT173 |	With Siri but so I'm not interested in upgrading my echo I would still have an original one and
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,551	| IOT173 |	Any
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:12,319	| IOT173 |	.
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,343	| IOT173 |	And I'm fine
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,623	| IOT173 |	I don't see the need
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:18,975	| IOT173 |	Even the newer one with the Hub is just liking some radios for me so I can know thank you
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,535	| IOT173 |	And that would you recommend they buy this
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:22,559	| IOT173 |	-1 is a
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,863	| IOT173 |	If you have nothing
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:26,655	| IOT173 |	If you have nothing
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:28,959	| IOT173 |	I would say yes but
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:31,007	| IOT173 |	Cause you're not locked in
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,287	| IOT173 |	21 platform
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:36,639	| IOT173 |	If you want to be on the matinee Amazon platform you can do that today
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:40,479	| IOT173 |	If you decide I might get some things that might work better with
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,503	| IOT173 |	Google Home Products
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,015	| IOT173 |	Then
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,551	| IOT173 |	Can I give you an out
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,087	| IOT173 |	You can have both
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:46,623	| IOT173 |	That's what I
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:48,671	| IOT173 |	Confusing
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:51,999	| IOT173 |	Okay so yes and I have the original Echo that I bought
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:54,815	| IOT173 |	December of 2014
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:56,607	| IOT173 |	It still work
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,143	| IOT173 |	Sounds good
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:01,215	| IOT173 |	Why is making the point that maybe Amazon should update it
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:03,775	| IOT173 |	Is the market has changed significantly but I actually don't think
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:10,431	| IOT173 |	I think it's better that it hasn't changed significantly because it just becomes this based of ice that sits in your home and can
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,199	| IOT173 |	Controls everything
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:14,527	| IOT173 |	That's kind of the point of having software-based update
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,575	| IOT173 |	One of the benefits
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,343	| IOT173 |	Connectivity
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:22,463	| IOT173 |	So hungry. What should they upgraded to any women that have had newer versions
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:28,095	| IOT173 |	Come out they have upgraded it yeah so he's saying they need a new flagship line I say no this is like
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:31,679	| IOT173 |	It's almost becoming an appliance in your home that you just set and forget
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,471	| IOT173 |	Parks
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:34,751	| IOT173 |	I would like that a lot
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:36,543	| IOT173 |	All right
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,823	| IOT173 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,127	| IOT173 |	Where Amazon
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:41,919	| IOT173 |	UPS
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,711	| IOT173 |	Is taking on Amazon key
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:44,223	| IOT173 |	Sort of
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:46,271	| IOT173 |	You want to talk about
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,807	| IOT173 |	Yeah UPS
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:51,135	| IOT173 |	Has announced that it's got a pilot program with latch
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:51,647	| IOT173 |	Smart Lock
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:54,207	| IOT173 |	4M building deliveries
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:15:00,351	| IOT173 |	To multi-unit homes AKA apartments in such in New York City this is a trial program pilot Pro
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:06,751	| IOT173 |	Basically it's very similar to the Amazon key in that you know if you have a package and you live in it New York multi
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:10,335	| IOT173 |	Home UPS can now get in and leader package
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:13,663	| IOT173 |	It's not going to leave your package in your apartment
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:14,943	| IOT173 |	Or you're living
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,455	| IOT173 |	SpaceX
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:17,247	| IOT173 |	Just leave it in the building
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:24,159	| IOT173 |	So it's kind of limited in that regard it's not meant for single-family home such as what Amazon key is doing with their cat
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:26,207	| IOT173 |	Ameren Smart Lock and door there
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:27,231	| IOT173 |	Access to vehicles
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:30,303	| IOT173 |	Trunks as well so this is very limited by comparison
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,327	| IOT173 |	But it's a start
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:32,607	| IOT173 |	And it's great for this user
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,631	| IOT173 |	So I wrote about this
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,399	| IOT173 |	Does company
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:37,983	| IOT173 |	UPS working with the idea here is
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:40,287	| IOT173 |	There's a lot of apartments that don't have dorms
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:42,847	| IOT173 |	I went to New York City I had a
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:43,871	| IOT173 |	So
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:46,943	| IOT173 |	Apartment building
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:50,527	| IOT173 |	But the apartment building basically did not like a bail closet
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,063	| IOT173 |	You can
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:53,599	| IOT173 |	Get it and get your package
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,135	| IOT173 |	But the time comes
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,927	| IOT173 |	I think it's great
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:59,487	| IOT173 |	Is going to be useful for a lot of people
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,279	| IOT173 |	I'll have the traditional
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:02,815	| IOT173 |	Family homes
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:05,119	| IOT173 |	And it's a beauty big deal for latch
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,143	| IOT173 |	What is a startup
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:06,911	| IOT173 |	And
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:08,703	| IOT173 |	So I think it's really
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:09,983	| IOT173 |	I like it
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:12,287	| IOT173 |	Yeah two things come to mind one
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:13,823	| IOT173 |	I never knew you lived in New York City
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,127	| IOT173 |	I live here right after college
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:17,407	| IOT173 |	I didn't know you were deaf
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:24,575	| IOT173 |	To this could extend to other delivery services I'm thinking like pizza Chinese food etcetera
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,855	| IOT173 |	Is very common
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,647	| IOT173 |	Yes yes yes
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:33,535	| IOT173 |	The latch door locks they control access in and out of public areas in these apartments but they also
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,559	| IOT173 |	Can be placed
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:35,839	| IOT173 |	Residence
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:36,607	| IOT173 |	Stores
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:37,375	| IOT173 |	As well
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,911	| IOT173 |	So what can happen there then
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:40,959	| IOT173 |	Is this could go further
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:46,847	| IOT173 |	UPS probably doesn't want it to go further cuz they don't want their delivery guy having to go down an apartment making all these deliveries that seems
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:49,663	| IOT173 |	Crazy when you dump it in the mail closet
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,687	| IOT173 |	But yes
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:51,199	| IOT173 |	Spur
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:52,735	| IOT173 |	Service providers
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:54,015	| IOT173 |	4
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:55,295	| IOT173 |	Pizza delivery whatever
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,319	| IOT173 |	Grocery deliveries
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:59,903	| IOT173 |	You could say latch has a foot in the door
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:09,887	| IOT173 |	All right also in the luck news World a similar startup this is a startup called open path they just raised 20
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:10,911	| IOT173 |	Million dollars in
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:13,471	| IOT173 |	Instead of residential locks you guys are providing
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:15,775	| IOT173 |	Smartphone-based access to building
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,543	| IOT173 |	Offices
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:18,335	| IOT173 |	So they are
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,615	| IOT173 |	Very similar except
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:21,151	| IOT173 |	I think of it kind of like August
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,175	| IOT173 |	It's partially because I went to Oz
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:23,199	| IOT173 |	Blocks
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:26,783	| IOT173 |	Officers when they were starting out in these guys give
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,575	| IOT173 |	Smartphone access to
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:30,879	| IOT173 |	A building so the say instead of having your like
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,671	| IOT173 |	NFC card
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,695	| IOT173 |	RFID Card
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,207	| IOT173 |	Whatever
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:36,767	| IOT173 |	I've only worked in one building where I've had a card
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,047	| IOT173 |	Situations
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:42,911	| IOT173 |	But this election
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:46,239	| IOT173 |	Large amount of money
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,263	| IOT173 |	Doing this for
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,799	| IOT173 |	About two years
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:50,335	| IOT173 |	So it looks like
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:52,639	| IOT173 |	We're kind of slowly upgrading our access infrastructure
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:56,223	| IOT173 |	And we actually have a lock
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:18:01,087	| IOT173 |	Related question and I are listening to voicemail a little bit later on the show I just want to point that out because
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:06,463	| IOT173 |	There seems to be a very big difference between industrial War office Enterprise locking and unlocking
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,999	| IOT173 |	I'll leave it at that for now
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:08,767	| IOT173 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,303	| IOT173 |	Okay find a lot story for you
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:12,095	| IOT173 |	August
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,631	| IOT173 |	Says it has
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,911	| IOT173 |	1 million users
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:16,959	| IOT173 |	Users
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:18,751	| IOT173 |	Users not
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:20,287	| IOT173 |	Customers with law
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,591	| IOT173 |	Yale locks sold
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,359	| IOT173 |	So
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,383	| IOT173 |	I don't have an August lock on
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,943	| IOT173 |	But I am technically an August user
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,711	| IOT173 |	Because I have a
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:31,295	| IOT173 |	And my husband is also a user
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,319	| IOT173 |	Because he is
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:34,367	| IOT173 |	Are you sure on that doorbell as well so
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:37,183	| IOT173 |	We are at least 250 million with our August doorbell
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,463	| IOT173 |	The question is
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:39,999	| IOT173 |	How many locks
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:45,119	| IOT173 |	All right it's a milestone for them for trying to downplay but I'm trying to keep it in perspective as well
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:48,191	| IOT173 |	Yes and Nesta sold more than a million
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:50,239	| IOT173 |	Mystats we found out that the Arlo geyser
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,799	| IOT173 |	Just sold more than 7 million Arlo products
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:57,151	| IOT173 |	Sonos devices
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:19:03,551	| IOT173 |	So what do you think about those numbers in the context of the us having a hundred million households about 310
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,575	| IOT173 |	10 million people
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:05,343	| IOT173 |	You know the Smart Home
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,647	| IOT173 |	Got a lot of room to grow
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,207	| IOT173 |	We're not yours
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:15,583	| IOT173 |	Speaking of the August doorbell Apple Insider has noticed
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,607	| IOT173 |	Apple his
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:19,935	| IOT173 |	Purge the doorbell category from the homekit
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:20,447	| IOT173 |	Accessories
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:22,239	| IOT173 |	And it is indeed
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,007	| IOT173 |	True
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:25,055	| IOT173 |	So it suggests that
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:27,615	| IOT173 |	August and ring doorbells that
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:31,199	| IOT173 |	We were promised to give us homekit support which meant you could open the home app
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:33,503	| IOT173 |	And see what was happening on those devices
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,783	| IOT173 |	It seems that may not happen
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:39,135	| IOT173 |	This is a big deal for people especially on the ringside because the ring folks have been
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,671	| IOT173 |	Promise homekit support
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,207	| IOT173 |	4 years
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:45,023	| IOT173 |	And they've just never gotten it so
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:47,071	| IOT173 |	Apple has not commented yet
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:51,423	| IOT173 |	On the story it is unlikely that they will say anything substitutive because it is
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:54,495	| IOT173 |	But this is worth noting if your
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:57,055	| IOT173 |	NFL fan of these doorbells and homekit
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:59,871	| IOT173 |	I'm a little surprised that apple
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:05,759	| IOT173 |	Elvis just wondering what they had in mind because it is not like them to have a suite of products and have a gap in that sweet
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:12,927	| IOT173 |	Yes but it could be that the security implementation for homekit just doesn't work on basically what is a battery pack
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:15,487	| IOT173 |	Powered wifi-connected device that supposed to
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:15,999	| IOT173 |	Glassboro
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:17,535	| IOT173 |	It does feel
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:20,607	| IOT173 |	Wired
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:26,495	| IOT173 |	I don't know if you could be power that is you're absolutely right I kind of feel like Apple
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:29,311	| IOT173 |	They want Simplicity with their protocols but as a result
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:31,359	| IOT173 |	They have limiting options
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:32,383	| IOT173 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,175	| IOT173 |	Moving from
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:34,687	| IOT173 |	Locks
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:35,711	| IOT173 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:43,135	| IOT173 |	Cars not the movie but cars that we drive or the drive us I had not heard of this company
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,159	| IOT173 |	I'm about to talk about Bruce Lee
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:45,439	| IOT173 |	It's called
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,207	| IOT173 |	Zoosk
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:48,255	| IOT173 |	I hope I'm saying that right it's a z
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:49,535	| IOT173 |	Oox
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:51,839	| IOT173 |	Basically it is a startup
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:54,655	| IOT173 |	That believes autonomous cars should be built
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:59,775	| IOT173 |	From scratch applying sensors and everything else that we need all the smart summer planning
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,567	| IOT173 |	You currently available vehicles
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:04,127	| IOT173 |	Is not the way to go it's a very radical take
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:08,479	| IOT173 |	He was a very good profile on this company and the CEO
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:10,527	| IOT173 |	Add Bloomberg to learn a lot from reading it
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:13,599	| IOT173 |	They're basically trading robot taxis
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:18,208	| IOT173 |	Autonomous taxis the ticket of very different approach again they are filling from scratch
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:18,976	| IOT173 |	And
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:20,512	| IOT173 |	It's a bidirectional
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:26,144	| IOT173 |	Taxi it literally we can go forward or backwards at the same speed so that's kind of unique in some sense
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:29,728	| IOT173 |	Compared to today's traditional cars they have to do other testing with
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:31,520	| IOT173 |	Currently available cars that can tow
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:34,080	| IOT173 |	Put their own cars on the road yet because I just don't have
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,104	| IOT173 |	Penis look like
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:37,664	| IOT173 |	Sand dune buggies right now just frames essential
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:42,528	| IOT173 |	It's very interesting though they're going to have the sensors actually communicate to other cars
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:44,064	| IOT173 |	Are there drivers I should say
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:46,368	| IOT173 |	With a long LED strips and such
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:50,720	| IOT173 |	To suggest that hey there's a problem further up ahead that I noticed you should be aware of it or
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:53,024	| IOT173 |	I'm going to make a right turn now and
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:54,816	| IOT173 |	It's all clear ahead of me Etc
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:57,632	| IOT173 |	It's just a unique take on things and
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:59,424	| IOT173 |	Kind of interested to follow
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:01,216	| IOT173 |	Especially because they really stepped out
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:06,336	| IOT173 |	Not about papers 800 million that was the other big news for them 500 million in early July
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,104	| IOT173 |	Very recently
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:11,968	| IOT173 |	That is an evaluation of 3.2 billion dollar so clearly the investors
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:13,760	| IOT173 |	Support them and see Vision here
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:14,784	| IOT173 |	It'll be interesting follow
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:18,112	| IOT173 |	There's a huge Market
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:22,208	| IOT173 |	A huge market for a delivery vehicles for
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,744	| IOT173 |	Industrial
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:26,560	| IOT173 |	Self-driving car so why the heck not
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:28,864	| IOT173 |	Alright also in the car world
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:29,632	| IOT173 |	Light
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:35,264	| IOT173 |	Which is a camera company has just raised another big round of funding 121 million
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:36,800	| IOT173 |	Self-driving cars
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:38,848	| IOT173 |	Yes light is
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:41,664	| IOT173 |	Probably better known if you know them at all that is
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:46,528	| IOT173 |	As a camera company in their camera looks like a smartphone innocence but it has
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:48,832	| IOT173 |	16 different sensors and lenses
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:51,904	| IOT173 |	And most smartphones today at best come with
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:54,976	| IOT173 |	Maybe two rear facing cameras this has again 6
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:23:01,376	| IOT173 |	The reason they do that is because they use software and AI to create the best possible photo using
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:04,448	| IOT173 |	16 different viewpoints in a sense and sensor for me
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,728	| IOT173 |	All of these sensors
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:10,336	| IOT173 |	And it's really a cool idea that camera alone is $2,000 again for 500 smart
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:13,408	| IOT173 |	Price on DSLR like that it's just a handheld
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:15,456	| IOT173 |	$2,000 intelligent camera
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:16,992	| IOT173 |	The weather doing has
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:18,784	| IOT173 |	And why just raise money
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:21,600	| IOT173 |	They are planning to sell the camera technology
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:23,136	| IOT173 |	Tu connected car
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:29,536	| IOT173 |	Companies because a lot of these car companies are using I would say off-the-shelf camera components but they're using things that are red
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:33,632	| IOT173 |	Readily available lidar obviously is not something that I would say readily available and inexpensive
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,936	| IOT173 |	But from a camera perspective
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:39,776	| IOT173 |	There's not a whole lot of amazing new technology being used in can I see cars
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:46,176	| IOT173 |	So this could extend the vision capabilities of are connected cars which in turn would obviously given more information at be
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,968	| IOT173 |	Smarter and perhaps even cut costs
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:50,272	| IOT173 |	Because maybe they would need to use as many lidar and other sensors
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:51,808	| IOT173 |	Wow that would be
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:53,600	| IOT173 |	Pro getting rid of light
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:55,136	| IOT173 |	A $10,000 Tesla
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:56,672	| IOT173 |	Okay
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:58,464	| IOT173 |	So that was our
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:23:59,488	| IOT173 |	Smart Car news
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,024	| IOT173 |	Kevin you want to talk about the ticwatch
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:07,936	| IOT173 |	I do we don't talk about too many wearables these days just because that market seems to have slowed down in terms of energy
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,984	| IOT173 |	Vacation but there is
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:10,752	| IOT173 |	The ticwatch
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:15,104	| IOT173 |	Pro is now available and it is an Android Wear OS smartwatch
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:20,480	| IOT173 |	Personally I'm not a fan of where OS I got away from the Android Smartwatch platform once
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:24,064	| IOT173 |	Start use a nap a lot to me and I just was more consistently
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:27,392	| IOT173 |	Stable for me added features usability was better Etc
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:29,952	| IOT173 |	So I think Google has a lot to do with wear OS
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:32,768	| IOT173 |	However the ticwatch pro is
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:38,400	| IOT173 |	Kind of unique in that it sells one of the major issues with wear OS watches that is battery life
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:40,192	| IOT173 |	So what this device has
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:44,288	| IOT173 |	It hasn't what you'd expect like a 400 by 400 resolution OLED display
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:45,568	| IOT173 |	But on top of that
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:47,360	| IOT173 |	There's an LCD display that's
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:48,384	| IOT173 |	Transparent
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,408	| IOT173 |	So
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:55,552	| IOT173 |	It has two modes one isn't always on mode with that low-power LCD display that can show some basic information and the other
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:57,088	| IOT173 |	OLED display
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:58,880	| IOT173 |	For using you don't certain apps that work
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:01,952	| IOT173 |	Android Wear OS wechat music app store
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,976	| IOT173 |	Exercise app
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:04,000	| IOT173 |	And so on so
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:09,120	| IOT173 |	What does does it really resolve the whole issue of really poor battery life cuz I have not found it
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,656	| IOT173 |	Two or three day battery
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,448	| IOT173 |	Life watch with wear OS
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:13,984	| IOT173 |	Typically Monday at best
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:19,104	| IOT173 |	I just buy Apple watch I can sometimes get too so I don't want to you know too many conclusions there but
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:25,760	| IOT173 |	You can go for days and days on this two days on Smart Mode when it switches back and forth between the displays
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,552	| IOT173 |	Multiple days
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:30,112	| IOT173 |	30 days and just what they call Essential mode
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:34,208	| IOT173 |	So that is the LCD watch face always on
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:37,792	| IOT173 |	So it's a nice balance I thought it was an interesting use of Technology
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:38,560	| IOT173 |	So
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:40,608	| IOT173 |	Good news on a possible watch Aldo
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:43,168	| IOT173 |	Android Wear but you also have
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:51,616	| IOT173 |	Yeah real quick little Pro tip if you have a Fire HD device the current one the tablet I actually have one so this is how I feel
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,896	| IOT173 |	Found out with a software update
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:57,504	| IOT173 |	I was a week or two ago the Amazon said hey we could have Fire HD tablet charging stand
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:26:00,576	| IOT173 |	And that will turn your tablet into an Echo Show when it's
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,344	| IOT173 |	In this
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,112	| IOT173 |	Turning Stone
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:04,416	| IOT173 |	Will turns out you don't need the stand
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:07,488	| IOT173 |	You just need to have your tablet plugged in
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:11,072	| IOT173 |	And I found that out again through software updated explained all that to me so
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:17,472	| IOT173 |	I have a case that doubles as a stand for my tablet I just leave it in there and plug it in and now I feel Echo Show capable
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:19,776	| IOT173 |	Without having to buy Amazon
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:22,336	| IOT173 |	Starting to see how you feel about
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:26,688	| IOT173 |	Special capabilities I'm not 100%
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:30,016	| IOT173 |	I never was sold on it to see if it wins me over
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,040	| IOT173 |	There you go
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:32,320	| IOT173 |	All right
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:34,368	| IOT173 |	Thank you for that Pro tip and now
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,392	| IOT173 |	Let's get to other tip

EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:04,576	| IOT173 |	Remember
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:05,344	| IOT173 |	Smarter homes
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:06,368	| IOT173 |	Start with
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,392	| IOT173 |	Schlage
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:09,696	| IOT173 |	Okay this week's voicemail is from
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:10,720	| IOT173 |	Rob
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:14,048	| IOT173 |	Hi Stacy this is Rob Lowe in Chicago
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:19,168	| IOT173 |	We are doing a commercial build out of her office spaces and looking to do some kind of Bluetooth
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:23,520	| IOT173 |	Door lock for both our offices as well as other folks in the building
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,288	| IOT173 |	However
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:26,080	| IOT173 |	I know a decal won't work
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,872	| IOT173 |	Ana commercial space
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:28,896	| IOT173 |	Need to be able to push it open
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:29,920	| IOT173 |	From the inside
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:32,480	| IOT173 |	So wondering if there is a commercial version of a
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:35,040	| IOT173 |	Schlage archival or anything like that
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:36,064	| IOT173 |	Thanks have a great day
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:37,856	| IOT173 |	Rob
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,392	| IOT173 |	This is a good question
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,160	| IOT173 |	Really glad you asked it
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:42,720	| IOT173 |	And we came up with a couple Solutions
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:44,256	| IOT173 |	You're very expensive
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:46,560	| IOT173 |	One of them we think is actually probably opt
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:49,888	| IOT173 |	Which is buying a
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:51,168	| IOT173 |	Bluetooth lock
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:52,192	| IOT173 |	From a company called
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:55,776	| IOT173 |	Ultraloq that is ultraloq with an l o q
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:58,592	| IOT173 |	Actually if you have a deadbolt this lock won't work because
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:27:59,360	| IOT173 |	It
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:27:59,872	| IOT173 |	Cover up your Deadpool
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:04,992	| IOT173 |	So this is waterproof so you can do indoor and outdoor
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:06,016	| IOT173 |	You can use a fingerprint
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,296	| IOT173 |	A cold
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:09,600	| IOT173 |	Or a key to unlock but you have to
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:11,904	| IOT173 |	To pick a fingerprint or a code you can't do both
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:17,280	| IOT173 |	And it is Bluetooth enabled so that means you can't do it remotely
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,816	| IOT173 |	Does wifi bridge but
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:22,656	| IOT173 |	People seem to like it except for the fact that they don't love the
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:24,960	| IOT173 |	Functionality so I would say go key code
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:29,824	| IOT173 |	Yeah definitely that would be the way to go get rid of biometrics
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:35,712	| IOT173 |	So that you said say say this does not require attack it won't work or the Deadpool it works with a traditional lock
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:36,736	| IOT173 |	Door strike
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,296	| IOT173 |	Doesn't look like it belongs in an office because it's
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:40,832	| IOT173 |	Satin nickel hits
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,624	| IOT173 |	Believer and
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:44,672	| IOT173 |	Battery powered obviously because
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:46,464	| IOT173 |	No power to your door
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:49,536	| IOT173 |	And it's only 199 from
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:50,560	| IOT173 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:52,352	| IOT173 |	Cam
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:58,240	| IOT173 |	Which I think is pretty reasonable considering this is really a very unique lock and that its Bluetooth without a deadbolt
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:00,032	| IOT173 |	Oh and I saw its
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:02,080	| IOT173 |	145 99 on Home Depot
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:06,944	| IOT173 |	Who was out there you go there you go it does work with Android and iOS
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:08,480	| IOT173 |	And with the app
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:12,064	| IOT173 |	You can knock on your display screen if you have IOS
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:13,088	| IOT173 |	Or you can shake
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:16,672	| IOT173 |	Your Android phone to unlock on either one of those platforms
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,208	| IOT173 |	Mexican Andy
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:19,488	| IOT173 |	Until
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:20,768	| IOT173 |	Any other weird
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:21,280	| IOT173 |	Category
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:23,584	| IOT173 |	I don't even know how to think about this
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,120	| IOT173 |	There is a
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:25,888	| IOT173 |	Comedy called haven
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,936	| IOT173 |	Is Hayden lock.com
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:30,240	| IOT173 |	And this is instead of a
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:30,752	| IOT173 |	Door lock
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,544	| IOT173 |	This is actually
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:34,592	| IOT173 |	Bar that you either screw into your floor
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:36,640	| IOT173 |	Beer fluoride
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:40,736	| IOT173 |	Little unclear about the install there in this bar actually has a little
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:44,320	| IOT173 |	Thumbs up
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:46,112	| IOT173 |	Pops in front of your door and prevents it
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:48,672	| IOT173 |	From opening so this is smartphone tested
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:49,952	| IOT173 |	This works with a smartphone
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:50,720	| IOT173 |	And
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:51,744	| IOT173 |	I don't even know what to say
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:57,888	| IOT173 |	Save-A-Lot when it's unlocked when it's unlock a little pop-up art is down into the base of it and the door can freely
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:00,192	| IOT173 |	Is Bluetooth enabled
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:00,960	| IOT173 |	10
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:01,728	| IOT173 |	When you
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:04,288	| IOT173 |	Want the door lock that little section pops back up
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:07,104	| IOT173 |	It keeps the door from opening it's been interesting it's like a
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:08,640	| IOT173 |	Extending the Seal of a door
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,664	| IOT173 |	Are door frame
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:12,736	| IOT173 |	And just having something that blocks the door from opening so
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:14,272	| IOT173 |	You can step on it to lock it
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:15,040	| IOT173 |	Kind of interests
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:15,808	| IOT173 |	But it's not cheap
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:17,344	| IOT173 |	And it is kind of odd
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:18,624	| IOT173 |	It's 349
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:24,512	| IOT173 |	So is this is important to you and I can't imagine how this gets installed in carpet but
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:27,584	| IOT173 |	If this works for you and you like to look at this it's
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:35,264	| IOT173 |	They say it's 10 times stronger than a Deadpool and it sort of makes sense because a deadbolt is rather small compared to the large Center
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:37,824	| IOT173 |	Pop-up section of this that has more surface
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:38,848	| IOT173 |	Knots to the door
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,896	| IOT173 |	Yes they do have a tape
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:42,688	| IOT173 |	They have a tape install
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,224	| IOT173 |	So you use
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:45,504	| IOT173 |	3M VHB tape
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:47,040	| IOT173 |	And 3 m is like
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,320	| IOT173 |	Secret winner in this market
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:49,344	| IOT173 |	You guys I mean how much
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:52,160	| IOT173 |	3M double-sided tape have item play them
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:55,744	| IOT173 |	For me it's command strips but that's because a lot of things are temporary for test
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:58,560	| IOT173 |	Yes so those are the options
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:01,120	| IOT173 |	I also was looking because I saw this in this house
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:02,400	| IOT173 |	Fairly common
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:05,984	| IOT173 |	I think I saw it at csrc. But a magnetic lock that
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:07,520	| IOT173 |	They're basically electromagnetic
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:10,336	| IOT173 |	Things that you use to replace your
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:12,896	| IOT173 |	Lock cylinder and then also the key stripe
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:17,504	| IOT173 |	The inside of the door frame and those basically when you
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:21,344	| IOT173 |	The clothes when there's electricity running through activating these magnets
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:22,112	| IOT173 |	And then
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:27,232	| IOT173 |	Turn off my electricity and then I can unlock the door they do require
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:31,328	| IOT173 |	Power and they also I didn't find anything that was bluetooth enabled
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:34,144	| IOT173 |	So you may look for something like that if you
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:36,704	| IOT173 |	Do you have like an existing smart home system cuz a lot of
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:40,288	| IOT173 |	Companies offer that but otherwise and that's actually cheaper you can buy
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:41,056	| IOT173 |	Something to replace you
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:43,360	| IOT173 |	Door cylinder for like 60 bucks
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:45,664	| IOT173 |	Assuming you have liar power available to the door
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:46,176	| IOT173 |	Yes
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:48,992	| IOT173 |	But you got to have power in
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:49,504	| IOT173 |	It's not going to be blue
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:52,320	| IOT173 |	So those are the things we found
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:53,088	| IOT173 |	And
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:53,600	| IOT173 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:56,928	| IOT173 |	Actually call us back let us know what you chose or if you hate all of your apps
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:00,256	| IOT173 |	That does it for this segment
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:01,536	| IOT173 |	The show
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:02,816	| IOT173 |	Stay tuned for
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:03,584	| IOT173 |	Mark Allen
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:05,888	| IOT173 |	Jacuzzi he's going to talk about how
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,168	| IOT173 |	Company
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:08,704	| IOT173 |	Has connected their hot tubs
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:11,008	| IOT173 |	What products be used and a lot more
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,544	| IOT173 |	In the meantime
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:18,944	| IOT173 |	Here's a message for this week sponsor a pharaoh hey everyone we are taking a break from this week's I
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:25,344	| IOT173 |	Iot podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is a pharaoh and I have a pharaoh CEO joke
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:26,624	| IOT173 |	Albert here to talk to us
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:28,416	| IOT173 |	So let's start with what is
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:32,000	| IOT173 |	A pharaoh Pharaoh is a fully upgraded fully Interactive
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:35,584	| IOT173 |	Fully secure sensor to Cloud iot platform
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:36,864	| IOT173 |	Our customers choose a p
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:42,240	| IOT173 |	Because they can cut down their time-to-market by as much as 80% which cuts down on
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:43,008	| IOT173 |	Cost and
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:45,312	| IOT173 |	Complexity
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:49,152	| IOT173 |	The affair of service and how they can reuse 90% of their work
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:52,224	| IOT173 |	Project in consumers love how easy it is
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:55,552	| IOT173 |	Just to get their devices connected and how fast and responsive they operate
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:33:01,696	| IOT173 |	UK and last week we talked about the work that you've done with Kenmore at this week we're going to dive deeper into the security you guys
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:03,488	| IOT173 |	So tell me about your secure
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:10,656	| IOT173 |	Security is a big deal and it's only going to get more important both for businesses and consumers
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:11,680	| IOT173 |	The challenge though
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:15,264	| IOT173 |	Is the iot is an end-to-end kind of Technology
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:16,288	| IOT173 |	And so is secure
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:17,568	| IOT173 |	Jamaica
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:18,336	| IOT173 |	He trustworthy
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:19,616	| IOT173 |	Not only do you have to
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:21,152	| IOT173 |	Secure all of the data path
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:22,176	| IOT173 |	But you also have to see
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:22,944	| IOT173 |	Your identities
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:24,480	| IOT173 |	Build security with
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:27,552	| IOT173 |	Resilience and then you also have to secure the manufacturing process
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:28,832	| IOT173 |	Supply chain
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:31,392	| IOT173 |	So what is it mean to be able to ensure Trust
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:32,160	| IOT173 |	Throughout the supply chain
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:34,208	| IOT173 |	If you think of your PC
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:37,536	| IOT173 |	And their firewalls also
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:39,584	| IOT173 |	The place in malware still continues to get
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:42,144	| IOT173 |	So we know you have to go
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:43,424	| IOT173 |	Beyond secure data path
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:45,728	| IOT173 |	Devices
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:47,008	| IOT173 |	Don't have a lot of love
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:48,032	| IOT173 |	Processing power
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:50,336	| IOT173 |	So we really need a different strategy
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:54,176	| IOT173 |	Compared to the PC or smartphone
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:55,712	| IOT173 |	Also have a much longer life
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:58,016	| IOT173 |	PC and you have to ensure
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:58,528	| IOT173 |	Did their secure
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:03,904	| IOT173 |	5 years 10 years 20 years on this will be the next Battle Ground
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:05,952	| IOT173 |	When you have to go beyond just securing
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:08,256	| IOT173 |	Potato Patch
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:09,024	| IOT173 |	Formatting mine
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:11,840	| IOT173 |	Text one
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:12,352	| IOT173 |	Building Trust
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:13,632	| IOT173 |	Kitchen Hardware
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:16,192	| IOT173 |	In the right place is in the process and to
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:18,240	| IOT173 |	Integrating them into the rest of
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:20,288	| IOT173 |	Decentralized iot stack
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:21,312	| IOT173 |	Across multiple
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:27,456	| IOT173 |	Protocols if you're using a communication protocol built on TCP IP this is relatively straightforward
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:29,760	| IOT173 |	But if you're using something else like Bluetooth
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:30,528	| IOT173 |	It's not straight
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:34,368	| IOT173 |	To dress this we came up with two very useful inventions
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:36,672	| IOT173 |	One something that we refer to as an
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:37,440	| IOT173 |	Estem
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:38,208	| IOT173 |	Coyote
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:42,560	| IOT173 |	This is similar to the SIM card in your smartphone but it's a hardware root of trust for
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:43,584	| IOT173 |	The device
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:44,352	| IOT173 |	Second
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:48,192	| IOT173 |	Something we call VPN for iot what are the shortcomings of
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:51,776	| IOT173 |	Historically has been that it works only over TCP IP network
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,824	| IOT173 |	So this is not totally appropriate
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:54,592	| IOT173 |	Propriety
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:56,896	| IOT173 |	We've developed technology that overcomes these
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:59,456	| IOT173 |	Okay so in practice how does this process work
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,736	| IOT173 |	There's a hard word of trust
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:07,136	| IOT173 |	It's built in a secure facility that enables us to build the rest of the system at not secure facilities and then we use that
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:07,648	| IOT173 |	Cryptographically
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:11,744	| IOT173 |	The device is who it says it is when it connects
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:14,048	| IOT173 |	That sounds great so where can we go to find out
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:16,864	| IOT173 |	The best place is a pharaoh. IO

EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:28,896	| IOT173 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:32,736	| IOT173 |	This is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Mark
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:34,784	| IOT173 |	Alan who's VP of it
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:36,064	| IOT173 |	Add jacuzzi
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:37,600	| IOT173 |	Hi Mark how are you doing
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:38,880	| IOT173 |	Good how you doing Stacy
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:41,952	| IOT173 |	Man I have to say I'm really excited because
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:42,976	| IOT173 |	Where can we talk about connect
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:46,304	| IOT173 |	I also
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:49,632	| IOT173 |	So before we started recording I learned a little bit about hot tub
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:51,680	| IOT173 |	I'm going to give you guys the same
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:52,960	| IOT173 |	Benefit so
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:54,240	| IOT173 |	Mark briefly tell us
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:58,848	| IOT173 |	The journey that you guys are on a Jacuzzi when did you launch your connected products and
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:00,640	| IOT173 |	Refit on why
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:02,944	| IOT173 |	We've been looking at this iot Plaza
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:09,088	| IOT173 |	For quite a while back when it was you don't machine-to-machine and trying to figure out when the right time was to Diamonds.
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:13,440	| IOT173 |	No pun intended but we wants the initiative back
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:14,976	| IOT173 |	In June of last year
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:17,280	| IOT173 |	And it was a really quick production cycle
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:21,120	| IOT173 |	We dedicated a few people from the company and partnered with particle
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:22,656	| IOT173 |	Man from Jason partner perspective
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:25,728	| IOT173 |	And a very rapid implementation
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:26,496	| IOT173 |	Cycle
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:31,360	| IOT173 |	And launched our first product went down a manufacturing line in November of last year
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:34,688	| IOT173 |	Wow and you now told me that they're like
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:36,480	| IOT173 |	500 of these guys
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:37,248	| IOT173 |	Out in the fields that are
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:39,296	| IOT173 |	Thousand out in the field
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:39,808	| IOT173 |	And half of them
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:41,344	| IOT173 |	That's correct
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,368	| IOT173 |	Yeah we're still names
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:43,904	| IOT173 |	Itsy bitsy. So far as
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:44,672	| IOT173 |	Phenomenal
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:48,512	| IOT173 |	So we're going to talk about what you guys have learned from this we're also going to talk about the
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:49,536	| IOT173 |	The process of
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:50,560	| IOT173 |	Connecting these things
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:52,352	| IOT173 |	And get into why
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:55,936	| IOT173 |	So let's start with what are the benefits for a consumer
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:57,216	| IOT173 |	Who is buying a connected
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:36:59,264	| IOT173 |	And then what are the benefits for
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:03,616	| IOT173 |	Yeah from a consumer perspective we've had an Apple mobile app
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:04,384	| IOT173 |	In the past
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:05,920	| IOT173 |	That you can control your hot tub
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:09,504	| IOT173 |	And that's obviously the first dentist said if it connected hot tub is sick
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:11,040	| IOT173 |	Consumer can control their hot tub
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:12,576	| IOT173 |	So from a vacation
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:13,088	| IOT173 |	Homer some
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:14,880	| IOT173 |	Monster on their way home
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:18,720	| IOT173 |	From work and they want to eat the hot tub up a couple of degrees
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:20,000	| IOT173 |	Let's ready for when
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:21,280	| IOT173 |	Make it home they have that obvious
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:23,584	| IOT173 |	Above and beyond that
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:25,376	| IOT173 |	The true iot hot tub
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:27,680	| IOT173 |	They get the additional benefit of the hot tub unit
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:28,448	| IOT173 |	Communicate back
EDL	00:37:29,216	00:37:30,752	| IOT173 |	So maintenance reminders
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:31,776	| IOT173 |	I have to replace
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:32,288	| IOT173 |	Filters
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:34,336	| IOT173 |	As well as
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:35,104	| IOT173 |	The ability to
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:35,872	| IOT173 |	To get air noise
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:36,896	| IOT173 |	Application so happy
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:37,664	| IOT173 |	Don't forget something
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:38,176	| IOT173 |	What's wrong with that
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:39,712	| IOT173 |	That are notification
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:41,504	| IOT173 |	To them as well as
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:42,272	| IOT173 |	Comes to us
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,296	| IOT173 |	As well as notified
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:45,600	| IOT173 |	Local dealer so action can be taken on the
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:48,416	| IOT173 |	And your initial thought maybe
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:50,208	| IOT173 |	How important is air notice
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:50,976	| IOT173 |	Vacation in a hot tub
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:55,840	| IOT173 |	But with a hot tub is in an area where it freezes and it's a vacation home
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:57,120	| IOT173 |	Someplace that you don't
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:57,888	| IOT173 |	Visit on reggae
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:59,168	| IOT173 |	Basis in a power goes out
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:00,704	| IOT173 |	Or iot device
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:01,472	| IOT173 |	Asus battery backup
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:02,496	| IOT173 |	Got that your notification
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:05,312	| IOT173 |	Because now you only have a certain amount
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:07,872	| IOT173 |	Time to drain a hot tub or restore the power
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:09,408	| IOT173 |	Before damage
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:12,736	| IOT173 |	So the dealer or the
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:14,016	| IOT173 |	Consumer can take Act
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:14,784	| IOT173 |	Prior to damage
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:16,832	| IOT173 |	Wow
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,368	| IOT173 |	Okay I'm like sitting here
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:19,136	| IOT173 |	Like I know nothing about
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:21,696	| IOT173 |	So you guys sell your hot
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:23,232	| IOT173 |	2
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:24,000	| IOT173 |	People not
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:28,352	| IOT173 |	Right here we have an independent dealer Network and we still are hot tubs today in Des Peres theater
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:30,656	| IOT173 |	So some of your thousand
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:32,960	| IOT173 |	Connected hot tubs are probably sitting around
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:35,520	| IOT173 |	Inventory dealers as opposed to
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:36,288	| IOT173 |	Consumers not coming
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:39,360	| IOT173 |	Yeah it's true it's the right now we're in the process
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:40,640	| IOT173 |	Assuming those hot tubs.
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:42,176	| IOT173 |	What's the dealers in Salinas
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:44,992	| IOT173 |	Supply chain so all of those hot tubs 1000 hot tubs
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,272	| IOT173 |	The $500 right now
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:49,344	| IOT173 |	Disconnect consumers backyard and the other five
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,416	| IOT173 |	Okay so let's
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:57,792	| IOT173 |	Talk about those 500 hot tubs what have you learned so far I don't know if you've seen a lot of Arab
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:38:59,840	| IOT173 |	What do you learn from
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:00,864	| IOT173 |	The 500
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:03,680	| IOT173 |	We've learned quite a bit about the process of iot
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:08,032	| IOT173 |	So we are on probably our I would say 8
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:08,800	| IOT173 |	18 Federation
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:10,080	| IOT173 |	From lunch
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:12,128	| IOT173 |	I've just fine-tuning ever
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:13,152	| IOT173 |	Everything from
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:15,200	| IOT173 |	The firmware upgrade advantage
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:17,248	| IOT173 |	Price of doing coyote
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:18,272	| IOT173 |	Keep us on the way we did it is
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:20,320	| IOT173 |	Firmware
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:22,368	| IOT173 |	Servicing from the firmware to the
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:23,136	| IOT173 |	Marshall application
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:25,184	| IOT173 |	So we've learned a lot about her
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:26,720	| IOT173 |	Consumers in the we're also
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:27,744	| IOT173 |	Have just launched
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:29,024	| IOT173 |	In-app purchasing
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:32,864	| IOT173 |	So the idea being that when a maintenance notification is given to a user
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:33,632	| IOT173 |	Result
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:36,960	| IOT173 |	Replacement for example we know exactly which
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:37,728	| IOT173 |	Hot tubs
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:38,496	| IOT173 |	Summer house
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:43,616	| IOT173 |	So they don't have to hunt around about which filter fits their hot tub when they get a maintenance notice
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:46,944	| IOT173 |	Application that they need a filter replacement they can immediately click on to
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:50,016	| IOT173 |	And they are directed it exactly
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:53,088	| IOT173 |	It is that through the dealer or is that Direct
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:54,624	| IOT173 |	ESO
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:56,416	| IOT173 |	The way it's set up today is it
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:58,720	| IOT173 |	Direct from us and then we do a pro C
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:39:59,488	| IOT173 |	Feedback to their local
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:01,280	| IOT173 |	In the future we'd like
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:02,048	| IOT173 |	Like to set it up
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:03,072	| IOT173 |	The point where it seems
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:05,888	| IOT173 |	Soaked through the dealer and then they will also have an option
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:06,912	| IOT173 |	Pick that up in there
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:09,728	| IOT173 |	Okay cuz this is a really interesting
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:11,008	| IOT173 |	Conundrum for many
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:13,056	| IOT173 |	Companies when they're dealing with the dealer Network
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:14,080	| IOT173 |	And attract
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:17,408	| IOT173 |	So how did you guys approach your dealers
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:18,688	| IOT173 |	When you were watching this in
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:19,968	| IOT173 |	Cut them into
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:20,736	| IOT173 |	The process
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:21,504	| IOT173 |	I don't know what
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:23,040	| IOT173 |	Is it still important in this day and age to have
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:25,344	| IOT173 |	Yes absolutely important for us
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:25,856	| IOT173 |	A couple of different
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:29,440	| IOT173 |	This one is our dealers not only seller hot tubs
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:30,208	| IOT173 |	But they also service
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:33,792	| IOT173 |	And then from a tumor perspective hot tub
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:34,816	| IOT173 |	You know it's an important
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:35,840	| IOT173 |	Purchase it says
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:36,608	| IOT173 |	Significant
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:37,120	| IOT173 |	Much like a
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:39,424	| IOT173 |	So we encourage our can
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:41,216	| IOT173 |	Somerset actually do what we call wet
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:44,800	| IOT173 |	Physically go to a dealer to sit in a hot tub into a wet
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:47,104	| IOT173 |	Hot tubs are very different
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:49,664	| IOT173 |	Not only by brand but also by model
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:52,480	| IOT173 |	To encourage them to go into a dealer and actually do a wet test
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:52,992	| IOT173 |	Before they purchase
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:57,088	| IOT173 |	So do you or critical in that sense and they also are the ones that
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:57,856	| IOT173 |	Do the actual answer
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:58,368	| IOT173 |	Installation of God
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:00,160	| IOT173 |	To the approach
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:01,952	| IOT173 |	To our dealers was at this
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:04,256	| IOT173 |	Benefit the dealer from being able to
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,024	| IOT173 |	Provide
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:07,840	| IOT173 |	A connected hot tub and then also from a dealer for
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:11,424	| IOT173 |	We give the dealer a portal that enables them to
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:12,448	| IOT173 |	Co-star
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:15,008	| IOT173 |	Disconnected hot tubs
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:15,520	| IOT173 |	What's the status
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:18,592	| IOT173 |	And then also any error message
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:20,640	| IOT173 |	Respect
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:22,176	| IOT173 |	Station quickly
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:23,456	| IOT173 |	CNE hot tubs
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:25,760	| IOT173 |	Have errors and then they can also run remote
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:28,576	| IOT173 |	So from a dealer perspective
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:29,088	| IOT173 |	Huge fan
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:31,136	| IOT173 |	In the past they would get a call from
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:32,160	| IOT173 |	Consumers
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:36,256	| IOT173 |	And they would roll is an was going to everything in it
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:37,536	| IOT173 |	I hoping that they have
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:38,048	| IOT173 |	What's needed
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:41,120	| IOT173 |	Now they run remote diagnostic
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:43,168	| IOT173 |	Annie's got a pretty good idea what's wrong with
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:44,192	| IOT173 |	Hot tub before they go out
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:49,312	| IOT173 |	And I bet there's actually some really interesting things
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:50,848	| IOT173 |	I'm assuming type Geographic
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:53,407	| IOT173 |	Custard so if I sell
EDL	00:41:53,407	00:41:55,967	| IOT173 |	I got X number of hot tubs in my service area
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:56,735	| IOT173 |	There's like
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:57,759	| IOT173 |	If it's going to freeze break
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:00,575	| IOT173 |	You could send out a friendly warning
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:02,111	| IOT173 |	Establishes relationship
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:02,879	| IOT173 |	Ongoing relationship
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,415	| IOT173 |	That's exactly
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:10,303	| IOT173 |	And what about you guys because I know in some Industries like the insurance industry freaks
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:11,327	| IOT173 |	Temple there is also
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:17,471	| IOT173 |	It's not exactly a dealer network but there's there's a middleman and they're looking at connector products
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:23,615	| IOT173 |	Bypass them but get more information on their customers and understand what they need and establish a direct relationship with
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:25,663	| IOT173 |	Securities if you're looking at
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:26,687	| IOT173 |	Doing that somehow
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:27,455	| IOT173 |	All is well
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:29,503	| IOT173 |	We see the value in the data
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:31,295	| IOT173 |	Right so yeah that's
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:32,319	| IOT173 |	Phenomenal
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:33,855	| IOT173 |	Solana park for eyes
EDL	00:42:33,855	00:42:35,647	| IOT173 |	So looking at the data.
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:36,415	| IOT173 |	Coming in from all of us
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:38,463	| IOT173 |	So in the past
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:40,511	| IOT173 |	Any data that we were receiving
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:41,791	| IOT173 |	The hot tub was warranty
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:43,583	| IOT173 |	You type data in that warranty dated
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:44,351	| IOT173 |	Was coming in
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:45,375	| IOT173 |	From a
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:48,191	| IOT173 |	Technician that was out in the field and repairing a hot
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:49,983	| IOT173 |	And say hey here's what it heard in
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:52,799	| IOT173 |	Right to his only when we receiving date it was
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:55,615	| IOT173 |	And that was a human interaction
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:57,919	| IOT173 |	Certification for
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:00,735	| IOT173 |	Now the day that we're getting in the hot tub
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:03,551	| IOT173 |	Is not only errors but it's also any type of that
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:04,575	| IOT173 |	Activity that's going on in
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:08,159	| IOT173 |	Hot tubs we can see FaceTime temperature how much the
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:09,439	| IOT173 |	Just turned on how much
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:11,999	| IOT173 |	Turned on when there are errors week
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:13,535	| IOT173 |	Correlation between
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:14,815	| IOT173 |	Between those errors
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:16,607	| IOT173 |	And other things that are going on in
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:19,167	| IOT173 |	Hottub usage temperature all kinds
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:21,215	| IOT173 |	So the data for us
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:22,239	| IOT173 |	Scream lyrics
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:25,055	| IOT173 |	The other part of it too is
EDL	00:43:25,055	00:43:26,335	| IOT173 |	Nunnally correlation
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:27,871	| IOT173 |	But then also
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:28,383	| IOT173 |	Future product
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:30,943	| IOT173 |	So in the past we would go out with
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:31,967	| IOT173 |	We would survey
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:32,735	| IOT173 |	100 users
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:34,015	| IOT173 |	Hunter customer
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:36,319	| IOT173 |	What's important in a hot tub
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:38,623	| IOT173 |	Now we have that data and it's not only a hundred.
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:40,159	| IOT173 |	Will eventually be Oliver
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:42,719	| IOT173 |	So will definitely Drive
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:43,743	| IOT173 |	Product
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:45,023	| IOT173 |	And that's a
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:46,815	| IOT173 |	Huge mean that the value of that is
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:47,839	| IOT173 |	Unbelievable
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:52,703	| IOT173 |	Oh yeah and a lot of people tend to say oh my gosh that sounds amazing I would totally use that
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:53,215	| IOT173 |	And then
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:56,287	| IOT173 |	Okay let's talk about the process a little bit
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:59,615	| IOT173 |	When you guys made this decision you said you worked
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:00,895	| IOT173 |	Particle
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:02,687	| IOT173 |	I mean it is not as simple as saying
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:06,015	| IOT173 |	Someone calling up and saying Hey I want some iot on my Jacuzzis
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:08,575	| IOT173 |	You're like who talk to you about this wear today
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:11,135	| IOT173 |	Order come from and how did you start approaching this as a
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:12,415	| IOT173 |	Problem to solve
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:15,999	| IOT173 |	Yeah like I said we had a review of some application mobile app
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:16,511	| IOT173 |	Controller Hut
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:17,791	| IOT173 |	And
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:21,119	| IOT173 |	We had been thinking about doing some type of connector
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:22,143	| IOT173 |	Hot tub
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:26,751	| IOT173 |	So we were looking at doing long before we knew really what I was he was
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:29,311	| IOT173 |	Thinking about doing a machine-to-machine kind of
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:31,359	| IOT173 |	And we've been thinking about that
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:34,175	| IOT173 |	3 years and we had approached two different companies
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:37,247	| IOT173 |	Thanks for doing something like that and it had just never found
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:38,015	| IOT173 |	The Wright company
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:38,783	| IOT173 |	Need a partner with
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:42,367	| IOT173 |	And then we actually was our CEO had that I think
EDL	00:44:42,367	00:44:43,903	| IOT173 |	Been sitting on a flight neck
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:45,439	| IOT173 |	To one of the CEOs
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:47,487	| IOT173 |	Vertical and just had been talking
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:49,535	| IOT173 |	About it and that sparked interest
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:50,815	| IOT173 |	And that's what beginning
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:51,583	| IOT173 |	Discussion
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:55,423	| IOT173 |	In the particle partnership was it just was a perfect
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:56,191	| IOT173 |	Fit from day one
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:45:01,823	| IOT173 |	When they came in to meet with us and we started talking about what we wanted to do and where they were at
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:03,103	| IOT173 |	Process it was a
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:05,151	| IOT173 |	Okay and I have to ask
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:07,199	| IOT173 |	I'm really excited
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:07,711	| IOT173 |	Zach who is the
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:12,575	| IOT173 |	Must have said you guys using Wi-Fi or
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:15,903	| IOT173 |	Cellular cellular and it was important
EDL	00:45:16,415	00:45:17,951	| IOT173 |	We have used Wi-Fi in the past
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:18,975	| IOT173 |	Center previous product
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:20,767	| IOT173 |	And Wi-Fi for us
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:21,535	| IOT173 |	Dad
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:22,815	| IOT173 |	Some issues
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:24,607	| IOT173 |	Because of our product being in the backyard
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:26,655	| IOT173 |	And because our product
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:27,423	| IOT173 |	Is under the
EDL	00:45:27,423	00:45:28,703	| IOT173 |	Covers in a hot tub
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:31,519	| IOT173 |	So we have electronics that are under the covers
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:34,335	| IOT173 |	We have water and then we have the backyard the disc
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:35,103	| IOT173 |	The backyard
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:37,407	| IOT173 |	So we were dealing with all of those things
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:38,431	| IOT173 |	Estranged
EDL	00:45:38,431	00:45:39,455	| IOT173 |	Connect to somebody
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:41,247	| IOT173 |	A consumers Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:42,015	| IOT173 |	And that just
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:43,039	| IOT173 |	Percentage a lot of issues
EDL	00:45:43,551	00:45:46,111	| IOT173 |	So we decided that we wanted to go
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:48,671	| IOT173 |	Cellular to alleviate those issues and also make
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:49,183	| IOT173 |	Easier on the
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:50,719	| IOT173 |	So that was one of the
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:53,023	| IOT173 |	Score of ordering with particle
EDL	00:45:53,535	00:45:54,303	| IOT173 |	Is we really wanted to you
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:55,839	| IOT173 |	Taylor number
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:45:57,631	| IOT173 |	So I'm very familiar with particle
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:45:58,655	| IOT173 |	Do you just
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:05,055	| IOT173 |	Did you buy the boards and just slap a mind as part of your electronics or how integrated and how much work did you do
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:05,823	| IOT173 |	Do with them
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:08,895	| IOT173 |	From the Ford and physical stuff all the way up to
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:09,919	| IOT173 |	Your hosting
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:11,967	| IOT173 |	And building the app
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:13,503	| IOT173 |	I wish it were that easy
EDL	00:46:13,503	00:46:14,783	| IOT173 |	We wanted more of an integrated
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:16,831	| IOT173 |	We have a lot invested in our
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:18,623	| IOT173 |	The structure that
EDL	00:46:19,647	00:46:21,183	| IOT173 |	So now the partnership
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:24,255	| IOT173 |	Particle was really taking their existing or
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:25,023	| IOT173 |	And cuss
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:27,071	| IOT173 |	Mising that and allowing
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:27,839	| IOT173 |	Particle
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:29,375	| IOT173 |	How to do a lot of work in interphase
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:31,423	| IOT173 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:46:31,935	00:46:34,751	| IOT173 |	And then building out the
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:36,031	| IOT173 |	Particle cloud
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:36,799	| IOT173 |	Customizing
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:39,615	| IOT173 |	Oracle cloud and then Doling out AWS
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:40,895	| IOT173 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:42,943	| IOT173 |	Jacuzzi so that we had a
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:44,223	| IOT173 |	Really tightly integrated
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:45,759	| IOT173 |	From Indian
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:46,783	| IOT173 |	And how do you guys connect
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:48,063	| IOT173 |	Ford dealers
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:50,111	| IOT173 |	Thor dealer portal is provided through
EDL	00:46:50,111	00:46:51,903	| IOT173 |	Salesforce vs Salesforce
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:55,487	| IOT173 |	Community how was the activity that are notification and everything
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:56,255	| IOT173 |	Comes in
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:46:57,279	| IOT173 |	From AWS
EDL	00:46:57,791	00:46:58,559	| IOT173 |	Salesforce
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:47:00,095	| IOT173 |	So are notifications
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:01,375	| IOT173 |	Country style source
EDL	00:47:01,375	00:47:02,143	| IOT173 |	As well as all the nodes
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:04,703	| IOT173 |	Any Tire Dealer portal
EDL	00:47:06,495	00:47:07,775	| IOT173 |	So what would you
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:09,311	| IOT173 |	Like to see
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:12,383	| IOT173 |	After you've done this and you're operating this and you
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:14,175	| IOT173 |	Hopefully will see it grow to
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:15,967	| IOT173 |	I don't know how many hot tubs are sold a year
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:18,527	| IOT173 |	Thousands hundreds of thousands of hot tubs
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:19,551	| IOT173 |	What do you need
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:22,111	| IOT173 |	Yeah I think the one thing that makes me the most nervous
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:28,511	| IOT173 |	Is not so much on the jacuzzi side is it is on the consumer privacy
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:29,023	| IOT173 |	Issues
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:31,839	| IOT173 |	Things like gdpr
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:32,863	| IOT173 |	And castle
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:34,399	| IOT173 |	Those things make me nervous
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:36,191	| IOT173 |	I don't know if they do you
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:37,471	| IOT173 |	Those things make me nervous
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:39,007	| IOT173 |	Comes to iot
EDL	00:47:39,775	00:47:41,311	| IOT173 |	And especially with the fact
EDL	00:47:41,311	00:47:42,079	| IOT173 |	The California
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:43,103	| IOT173 |	Just came out
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:46,175	| IOT173 |	Announce that they're pretty their own version of gdb
EDL	00:47:46,175	00:47:48,479	| IOT173 |	PR what Hoops are we going to have to
EDL	00:47:48,479	00:47:52,575	| IOT173 |	Jump through in order to continue to advance this last
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:53,855	| IOT173 |	In the future
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:54,879	| IOT173 |	How are we going to be able
EDL	00:47:55,391	00:47:55,903	| IOT173 |	Continue
EDL	00:47:56,671	00:47:57,439	| IOT173 |	Do business
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:58,463	| IOT173 |	With all of us
EDL	00:47:58,463	00:47:59,487	| IOT173 |	Deregulation
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:00,767	| IOT173 |	They're going to exist in the difference
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:03,839	| IOT173 |	The world would you like to see one Unified
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:07,679	| IOT173 |	Maybe one unified regulation is kind of absurd but maybe
EDL	00:48:07,679	00:48:08,447	| IOT173 |	Three or four
EDL	00:48:08,447	00:48:09,471	| IOT173 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:10,495	| IOT173 |	I mean it would be
EDL	00:48:10,495	00:48:12,287	| IOT173 |	Astounding right would be abs
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:13,311	| IOT173 |	Absolutely amazing
EDL	00:48:13,311	00:48:14,591	| IOT173 |	You have one Unified
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:16,127	| IOT173 |	Version of gdpr
EDL	00:48:16,127	00:48:18,431	| IOT173 |	I think that probably it probably will never happen
EDL	00:48:19,199	00:48:19,967	| IOT173 |	Our lifetime
EDL	00:48:19,967	00:48:24,319	| IOT173 |	But even if we had three or four different Unified gdpr
EDL	00:48:24,319	00:48:24,831	| IOT173 |	Thai policy
EDL	00:48:25,343	00:48:27,135	| IOT173 |	To start getting to the farm we have
EDL	00:48:27,135	00:48:27,903	| IOT173 |	State-level
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:28,927	| IOT173 |	DPR policy
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:30,463	| IOT173 |	In my mind that's going to win
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:31,743	| IOT173 |	Nightmare
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:36,351	| IOT173 |	And to be clear your issue isn't necessarily with the regulations with ideas
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:37,631	| IOT173 |	Giving users controller
EDL	00:48:37,631	00:48:40,447	| IOT173 |	30. It is more just trying to implement many
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:41,983	| IOT173 |	Conversion 10 variations of
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:43,263	| IOT173 |	Those types of regulations
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:44,543	| IOT173 |	Describe
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:46,335	| IOT173 |	Yeah I have no problem with
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:47,615	| IOT173 |	Consumer privacy
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:49,151	| IOT173 |	I've completely believe in
EDL	00:48:49,151	00:48:49,919	| IOT173 |	Consumer privacy
EDL	00:48:49,919	00:48:52,735	| IOT173 |	It's more of trying to implement that
EDL	00:48:52,735	00:48:53,503	| IOT173 |	Across
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:54,783	| IOT173 |	Different Geographic
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:55,551	| IOT173 |	Hilarious
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:57,087	| IOT173 |	So if you have a different policy
EDL	00:48:57,087	00:48:58,623	| IOT173 |	In California than you do Intex
EDL	00:48:59,903	00:49:01,695	| IOT173 |	Trying to make sure that
EDL	00:49:01,695	00:49:03,487	| IOT173 |	You treat that data differently
EDL	00:49:03,999	00:49:05,023	| IOT173 |	California for those
EDL	00:49:05,535	00:49:08,351	| IOT173 |	First thing you do in Texas in designing your application
EDL	00:49:08,351	00:49:09,631	| IOT173 |	Around that and then
EDL	00:49:09,631	00:49:11,679	| IOT173 |	You know that balloons up into
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:13,215	| IOT173 |	30 different policy
EDL	00:49:13,215	00:49:14,751	| IOT173 |	Then doing the development
EDL	00:49:15,263	00:49:15,775	| IOT173 |	Around that
EDL	00:49:16,287	00:49:16,799	| IOT173 |	Keeping up with
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:20,127	| IOT173 |	Since we're in privacy let's talk about our other favorite
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:21,407	| IOT173 |	My friend security
EDL	00:49:21,919	00:49:23,711	| IOT173 |	So how are you guys
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:24,479	| IOT173 |	Dealing
EDL	00:49:24,479	00:49:25,503	| IOT173 |	With six
EDL	00:49:25,503	00:49:26,015	| IOT173 |	Security
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:28,831	| IOT173 |	All the various levels cuz I can see a hot tub
EDL	00:49:31,391	00:49:37,791	| IOT173 |	So we were very careful from the very beginning working with Oracle and Pandora to make
EDL	00:49:37,791	00:49:41,119	| IOT173 |	Make sure that we use the industry best practice
EDL	00:49:41,631	00:49:42,399	| IOT173 |	Straight from beginning
EDL	00:49:42,911	00:49:44,447	| IOT173 |	So we do it a whole
EDL	00:49:44,447	00:49:45,215	| IOT173 |	Variety of different
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:48,543	| IOT173 |	Security measures depending on you know what devices
EDL	00:49:48,543	00:49:49,311	| IOT173 |	Communicating
EDL	00:49:49,311	00:49:51,615	| IOT173 |	So depending is particle stylist
EDL	00:49:51,615	00:49:54,175	| IOT173 |	Communicating with a w a sore ass particles
EDL	00:49:55,199	00:49:56,991	| IOT173 |	Device where is the mobile app is
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:49:58,527	| IOT173 |	Communicating
EDL	00:49:58,527	00:50:01,599	| IOT173 |	Directly with particle you know we do different things
EDL	00:50:01,599	00:50:03,135	| IOT173 |	Cherokee's all
EDL	00:50:04,159	00:50:04,927	| IOT173 |	Great measures
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:06,207	| IOT173 |	Spell our consumers
EDL	00:50:06,207	00:50:09,023	| IOT173 |	Rest assured that there when they communicate with their hot tub kits
EDL	00:50:10,303	00:50:12,351	| IOT173 |	Right and also that no one will get boiled alive
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:15,167	| IOT173 |	That's exactly true
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:16,191	| IOT173 |	Well that's also handled
EDL	00:50:16,703	00:50:18,239	| IOT173 |	Within our controller
EDL	00:50:18,239	00:50:18,751	| IOT173 |	In the hot tub
EDL	00:50:19,519	00:50:21,311	| IOT173 |	So if that hot tub
EDL	00:50:21,311	00:50:22,079	| IOT173 |	Decides to
EDL	00:50:22,079	00:50:24,639	| IOT173 |	For some reason try to overtemp it goes into
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:25,407	| IOT173 |	Andover temperature
EDL	00:50:25,407	00:50:26,943	| IOT173 |	So that it does not allow the
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:39,743	| IOT173 |	Cuz people you know they get into these and maybe they're not their best
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:41,023	| IOT173 |	Selves who knows
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:42,303	| IOT173 |	So okay so
EDL	00:50:42,303	00:50:44,607	| IOT173 |	Let's talk about what all of this cost
EDL	00:50:45,119	00:50:46,399	| IOT173 |	Because this is very different
EDL	00:50:46,911	00:50:49,983	| IOT173 |	I imagine it's very different to build a connected product
EDL	00:50:51,519	00:50:53,823	| IOT173 |	Just kind of some ongoing overhead
EDL	00:50:53,823	00:50:54,847	| IOT173 |	Be crazy expensive
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:51:00,479	| IOT173 |	Last a long time so I'm trying to think about how you change how you sell these things how you
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:01,759	| IOT173 |	Projector
EDL	00:51:01,759	00:51:03,807	| IOT173 |	Liabilities for these things how does that all
EDL	00:51:04,319	00:51:06,111	| IOT173 |	How does connectivity change that
EDL	00:51:06,623	00:51:07,135	| IOT173 |	Ma
EDL	00:51:07,903	00:51:10,975	| IOT173 |	So right now we're targeting our Amir products
EDL	00:51:11,999	00:51:12,767	| IOT173 |	We quickly hope
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:14,815	| IOT173 |	Platform will
EDL	00:51:15,327	00:51:15,839	| IOT173 |	Easter Sunday
EDL	00:51:16,351	00:51:18,911	| IOT173 |	Quickly plan on having the iot Plaza
EDL	00:51:18,911	00:51:19,935	| IOT173 |	Wheat bran
EDL	00:51:19,935	00:51:21,727	| IOT173 |	SmartStyle on all of our
EDL	00:51:21,727	00:51:23,007	| IOT173 |	Prices and
EDL	00:51:23,007	00:51:24,031	| IOT173 |	It should vary
EDL	00:51:24,031	00:51:26,079	| IOT173 |	Quickly be a revenue generator
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:28,639	| IOT173 |	Through the driving
EDL	00:51:28,639	00:51:29,919	| IOT173 |	Additional hot tub
EDL	00:51:29,919	00:51:31,455	| IOT173 |	Sales because of it being
EDL	00:51:31,455	00:51:34,271	| IOT173 |	Product we believe that it's a differentiator
EDL	00:51:34,271	00:51:36,063	| IOT173 |	In the industry as well as
EDL	00:51:37,087	00:51:37,855	| IOT173 |	Accessories
EDL	00:51:37,855	00:51:38,879	| IOT173 |	Accessory sales
EDL	00:51:38,879	00:51:39,647	| IOT173 |	Or the app
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:41,183	| IOT173 |	It's also when somebody is
EDL	00:51:41,183	00:51:41,951	| IOT173 |	With that mess
EDL	00:51:42,463	00:51:43,487	| IOT173 |	For a
EDL	00:51:43,999	00:51:45,279	| IOT173 |	Or for chemical
EDL	00:51:46,047	00:51:48,095	| IOT173 |	Mike that that additional sales footage
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:48,863	| IOT173 |	Brandon
EDL	00:51:48,863	00:51:49,887	| IOT173 |	Products with lead
EDL	00:51:49,887	00:51:50,911	| IOT173 |	It's also will drive.
EDL	00:51:51,423	00:51:53,983	| IOT173 |	Recently I read about GE Appliances
EDL	00:51:53,983	00:51:56,543	| IOT173 |	They are doing a smart fridge and
EDL	00:51:56,543	00:51:57,055	| IOT173 |	It actually
EDL	00:51:57,567	00:52:00,127	| IOT173 |	Won't dispense water if you
EDL	00:52:00,127	00:52:02,431	| IOT173 |	Don't put a GE branded filter
EDL	00:52:02,431	00:52:03,199	| IOT173 |	Into
EDL	00:52:03,199	00:52:04,223	| IOT173 |	The refrigerator
EDL	00:52:04,223	00:52:07,039	| IOT173 |	As you can imagine that did not go over well with
EDL	00:52:07,039	00:52:08,575	| IOT173 |	People are you thinking about
EDL	00:52:08,575	00:52:11,135	| IOT173 |	Doing any sort of DRM associated with
EDL	00:52:11,135	00:52:12,671	| IOT173 |	Aker jacuzzi filter only works
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:17,279	| IOT173 |	No I mean that's I don't know that the we could ever get to that
EDL	00:52:17,791	00:52:21,119	| IOT173 |	You know our warranty states that you should be using your
EDL	00:52:21,119	00:52:22,911	| IOT173 |	Yeah jacuzzi branded filters
EDL	00:52:23,423	00:52:24,959	| IOT173 |	How everything there are aftermarket

EDL	00:52:31,871	00:52:34,431	| IOT173 |	Person accessories but we get to a point where we
EDL	00:52:34,431	00:52:35,711	| IOT173 |	Physically turn
EDL	00:52:35,711	00:52:36,735	| IOT173 |	Are hot tub off
