EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:23,200	| IOT078A |	But Carlos tells us
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:25,760	| IOT078A |	Everything that happened and what he learned from it
EDL	00:01:25,760	00:01:26,784	| IOT078A |	It's a good interview
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:27,552	| IOT078A |	So
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:29,088	| IOT078A |	Stay tuned for a moment from
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:30,368	| IOT078A |	A message from our sponsor
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:37,280	| IOT078A |	This week sponsor is armed nothing highlights iot security more than a hacked car driven in
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:43,680	| IOT078A |	Into a ditch Charlie Miller part of the team that have two cheap in 2015 will keynote arms techcon in 2016

EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:56,480	| IOT078A |	Moving vehicle and how we can tighten security across the network so join arm this month in Santa Clara for arm techcon and
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:02:02,880	| IOT078A |	Register today at arm techcon. Com I will be there so I will see you
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:09,280	| IOT078A |	Okay hopefully you're not going to be in a jeep so good
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,048	| IOT078A |	Let's talk
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:10,816	| IOT078A |	About
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:13,376	| IOT078A |	Nuthatch keeps other will get to hacked cameras
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:17,216	| IOT078A |	I don't think there's where that a Jeep is involved in the
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:17,984	| IOT078A |	In the DDOS attack
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:20,288	| IOT078A |	Verso
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:22,336	| IOT078A |	All right
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:23,104	| IOT078A |	The new wing
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:23,872	| IOT078A |	Hub
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:26,432	| IOT078A |	We had heard that this was coming from a leech
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,968	| IOT078A |	Amazon screenshot
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:28,736	| IOT078A |	In semi
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:29,248	| IOT078A |	Pink stuff at the home
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,296	| IOT078A |	Lo behold
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:33,088	| IOT078A |	In October
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,112	| IOT078A |	Wink will be
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,648	| IOT078A |	You providing us with a brand new hub
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,696	| IOT078A |	And it has
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,488	| IOT078A |	An internet port which
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:42,048	| IOT078A |	Kevin you are not excited by but some people might find it
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:45,888	| IOT078A |	I'm not really moved by that but I do think it's a good addition
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:47,936	| IOT078A |	And it's going to have Bluetooth
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:52,544	| IOT078A |	The reason Bluetooth is so exciting as it can act as a link for
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,312	| IOT078A |	Your
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:54,592	| IOT078A |	Bluetooth enabled
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:56,896	| IOT078A |	Things like a doorbell and it translates it over
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:01,248	| IOT078A |	Wi-Fi network is only have remote access to all of the stuff in your house without all these little
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:03,040	| IOT078A |	Like Bluetooth bridges that you have to
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:05,856	| IOT078A |	And so that's cool
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:06,880	| IOT078A |	Other reason
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:09,696	| IOT078A |	The Bluetooth is exciting is a new thing that we did
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,464	| IOT078A |	It's going to make
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:12,512	| IOT078A |	Actually setting up iot devices
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:15,328	| IOT078A |	Easier in this only happens during the
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,096	| IOT078A |	Initial setup
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:18,400	| IOT078A |	But during the initial setup your instead of
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:21,728	| IOT078A |	Relying on the soft AP creation which is what we call it when
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,264	| IOT078A |	How to connect a device
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:24,544	| IOT078A |	Plugging in
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:26,080	| IOT078A |	Creates its own wifi hotspot
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,104	| IOT078A |	Has to find it in the
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:34,016	| IOT078A |	Everything happens right on my Android
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:37,344	| IOT078A |	Because my phone is like trying so hard
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,112	| IOT078A |	2
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:39,136	| IOT078A |	You keep me online
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:41,696	| IOT078A |	I have to turn off the cellular data on my phone
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:44,512	| IOT078A |	Actually hook things up to my device
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,280	| IOT078A |	My phone otherwise is
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:45,792	| IOT078A |	Like it never works
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:52,960	| IOT078A |	So yeah the phone the phone is trying to get that redundant connection because it thinks you want to be connected all the time obviously and
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:53,728	| IOT078A |	Make sense
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:57,312	| IOT078A |	It hates when I like adding a device using my Android is always
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:03:59,872	| IOT078A |	What's up
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:02,432	| IOT078A |	The Bluetooth connection no allows
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:03,200	| IOT078A |	The
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:05,760	| IOT078A |	Data about why something's messing up
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:06,528	| IOT078A |	2
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:10,880	| IOT078A |	It tells the devices Echo stop doing this so now they've built software that makes it a lot easier to
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:14,464	| IOT078A |	And this will be nice for people who are like
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,000	| IOT078A |	A little bit more normal who are like
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:17,280	| IOT078A |	Not listeners
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,303	| IOT078A |	Perhaps of the show and
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:20,351	| IOT078A |	I did not know I could turn off my cellular data on my
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,143	| IOT078A |	And
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,167	| IOT078A |	That is going to be
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:27,263	| IOT078A |	Wonderful the other thing they added as part of the setup process is if you have an old hub
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,823	| IOT078A |	You can actually transfer everything over
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:33,151	| IOT078A |	The Staples connect Hub actually did this but
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,431	| IOT078A |	And it's no longer on the
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:39,807	| IOT078A |	Useful so if you have an old week though you might be saying
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:40,575	| IOT078A |	Gosh
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:41,599	| IOT078A |	Do I upgrade
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:42,879	| IOT078A |	Kevin are you saying that
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:50,047	| IOT078A |	Yeah I'm kind of I'm kind of on the fence on this and I'm a big fan / user
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:56,191	| IOT078A |	Of the wink Hub that I bought maybe a year-and-a-half ago or fantastic for me my entire smart home is built around it
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:05:03,103	| IOT078A |	The fact that this one is 25% Slimmer it's nice that's okay it's not a compelling reason to me
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,871	| IOT078A |	Ethernet
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:08,223	| IOT078A |	Personally not compelling to me however I can definitely see why people might want that
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:14,623	| IOT078A |	I actually preferred of wireless connection with the wink Hub because I can put it anywhere that it does not. Hang off a router
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:20,511	| IOT078A |	That was one of the actual selling points to me what again this is a bonus for for a lot of people I'm sure
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:26,911	| IOT078A |	Turn the radios they've also added a thread capable radio and really there's not much that takes advantage of
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:29,983	| IOT078A |	Not yet a compelling reason to upgrade
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:32,031	| IOT078A |	So I will tell you
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,079	| IOT078A |	Tell me you're not home Kik
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:34,591	| IOT078A |	Compatible
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,383	| IOT078A |	At this moment
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,919	| IOT078A |	There is a place for a home
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:38,687	| IOT078A |	Kit radio
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,455	| IOT078A |	But
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:43,551	| IOT078A |	Place for it you can't go until you're
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:45,087	| IOT078A |	You're actually part of the home
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,391	| IOT078A |	Correct
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:47,903	| IOT078A |	So
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:49,439	| IOT078A |	That is
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:51,999	| IOT078A |	TVD so if homekit is important to you
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:53,535	| IOT078A |	This may not be the Hub
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:56,095	| IOT078A |	Yet yet
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:05:59,679	| IOT078A |	But again
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:07,103	| IOT078A |	I do like an again not enough for me to upgrade you like the fact that they've I think
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:11,967	| IOT078A |	Up the memory inside from 64 mag to 512 mag
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:18,111	| IOT078A |	My Hub run stable so I had to run into that issue one thing I do like and I'm considering this in my
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:19,647	| IOT078A |	Decision making
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:26,047	| IOT078A |	Process here they have beefed up the security and I believe I think they've done it through
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:30,399	| IOT078A |	Hardware in that the wink Hub when it boots up will make sure
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,679	| IOT078A |	It has
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,447	| IOT078A |	The same
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:39,103	| IOT078A |	Secure verified firmware that it had the last time it booted up and if it doesn't
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:43,199	| IOT078A |	It will be able to revert back to the safe secure
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:45,503	| IOT078A |	Meaning it's a lot less
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:49,087	| IOT078A |	Susceptible to being hacked or reprogrammed without your knowledge
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,879	| IOT078A |	So that's something
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:52,415	| IOT078A |	That has me thinking about it
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,951	| IOT078A |	The security efforts they went
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,463	| IOT078A |	Through here
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:57,279	| IOT078A |	Given the beginning
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,303	| IOT078A |	Horribly inside
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:58,815	| IOT078A |	Secure hub
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,863	| IOT078A |	It just was it was hacked mode
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,399	| IOT078A |	Multiple times they fixed it
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:05,215	| IOT078A |	But that really shows that they are working
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,239	| IOT078A |	Hard on getting
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:06,751	| IOT078A |	Ignis Wraith
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:10,079	| IOT078A |	And I will say that the new Hub is $99
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:10,591	| IOT078A |	And
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:13,919	| IOT078A |	They're adding a new retail partner so it will be available
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,455	| IOT078A |	On their site
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:16,735	| IOT078A |	In Home Depot
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,503	| IOT078A |	And at
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,015	| IOT078A |	Walmart
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:20,063	| IOT078A |	Yeah I saw that
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:21,855	| IOT078A |	Song that's that's good
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:27,231	| IOT078A |	Yeah I thought it was I thought it was really kind of worthwhile because Walmart is definitely
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:29,023	| IOT078A |	Now I also kind of wonder if it's
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:30,047	| IOT078A |	Because they burn Target
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,119	| IOT078A |	They had their big giant security
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:33,887	| IOT078A |	Blind
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,655	| IOT078A |	Recall kind of thing
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,679	| IOT078A |	And that I think
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,727	| IOT078A |	Turn them off
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:44,127	| IOT078A |	Yeah I could be I could well be it's hard to decide what I mean so long as there were they mainstream retailer I think I vote
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:50,527	| IOT078A |	Was very very well for forty Winks one other one other aspect that again is on Meatheads
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:52,063	| IOT078A |	Me thinking maybe I upgrade
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,599	| IOT078A |	That new Wi-Fi radio
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:57,695	| IOT078A |	Is no longer just 2.4 gigahertz actually supports 5 gigahertz haswell
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,743	| IOT078A |	Yeah that's that's pretty big
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:04,351	| IOT078A |	It's $99 I mean this is not like a $500 outlay of cash so
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,631	| IOT078A |	I say that I
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:10,495	| IOT078A |	Probably not going to upgrade but I have a feeling at some point I'm just going to pull the trigger and do it anyway
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,543	| IOT078A |	Sew-in and I asked I asked WinCo's like
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:16,895	| IOT078A |	What do you tell people who have this is something they should upgrade to and he's like you don't
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:19,455	| IOT078A |	You can if you want we're still supporting the old version
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:23,551	| IOT078A |	This is really a product to get new people in the
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:30,975	| IOT078A |	Amen in that respect I think it's a very compelling product at that price point for what it supports the radio
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:33,023	| IOT078A |	Upgrade the security
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:36,607	| IOT078A |	Yeah I mean again I bought my wink very happy with it
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,887	| IOT078A |	If I didn't have one
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:43,519	| IOT078A |	Without a doubt I probably go out and get this one so you can also wait for Christmas
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:45,055	| IOT078A |	And you know give someone you love

EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:54,783	| IOT078A |	Good point
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,831	| IOT078A |	So if you're not in any Rush

EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:16,031	| IOT078A |	That's that's the Wink News I'm excited in for all of us who were like
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:19,615	| IOT078A |	Quirky went bankrupt what happens to WinCo o-flex potwin
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:21,663	| IOT078A |	What happened to wink now we can be a little bit by
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,199	| IOT078A |	I think
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:24,735	| IOT078A |	It feels like ants
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,527	| IOT078A |	Company in a product that we're like
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:27,807	| IOT078A |	They're behind it
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:31,391	| IOT078A |	So let's talk about how your wink might be delivered to you
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:40,095	| IOT078A |	Yes so some people may really like it is whereas other people may really hate this but Amazon is
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:42,655	| IOT078A |	Reportedly working on in home package deliveries
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:49,055	| IOT078A |	Not at home in home your package will be in your house I will they do that well the information says
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:51,615	| IOT078A |	Listen attack princess report this as well
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:58,015	| IOT078A |	That Amazon is working with some of its iottie retailers or the products
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:00,063	| IOT078A |	It sells it products with
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,855	| IOT078A |	Such as August and garageio
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:08,511	| IOT078A |	Working with them to give temporary access to get in your home to leave a package
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:13,631	| IOT078A |	That's kind of scary and cool at the same time so August make smart locks
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:16,703	| IOT078A |	Garageio makes
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:23,103	| IOT078A |	Siri you'd order something from Amazon and give the okay to have the package delivered in your house provided you
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:26,431	| IOT078A |	You have an August lock or garageio garage door opener
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:31,551	| IOT078A |	I don't know I mean it's his great Stacy for people who
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:36,927	| IOT078A |	Aren't there to receive packages don't want them sitting out all the time maybe they've had packages stolen
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:41,279	| IOT078A |	But are you going to give access to your house
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:45,119	| IOT078A |	So August has this quote they had actually the access
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,143	| IOT078A |	August access
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,167	| IOT078A |	4
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,447	| IOT078A |	Almost a year now
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,727	| IOT078A |	Amanda
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,775	| IOT078A |	They will that be
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,799	| IOT078A |	People into
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:55,871	| IOT078A |	Like people are actually using this for
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:56,895	| IOT078A |	Both
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:59,967	| IOT078A |	Normal people like your Maids your dog walkers those
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:02,527	| IOT078A |	Things but also for like delivery of services
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:07,647	| IOT078A |	So it's a formal service that August offers and they have Partnerships with
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,439	| IOT078A |	Postmates in
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,743	| IOT078A |	I want to say
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:12,511	| IOT078A |	Sears appliance
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:13,791	| IOT078A |	That could be a
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:18,399	| IOT078A |	And with that I mean the ideas you know if you have Smart cameras in your house
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,167	| IOT078A |	You can actually watch this house
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:22,751	| IOT078A |	Which if the person went into your house in like
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:23,263	| IOT078A |	Mike stole your dog
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,823	| IOT078A |	Like oh well that's who did it
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:29,151	| IOT078A |	I'm not sure if that's that's comforting or not
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,455	| IOT078A |	So this makes sense
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:34,015	| IOT078A |	And I love that Amazon might give is
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:34,783	| IOT078A |	Imprimatur
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,551	| IOT078A |	To this
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,575	| IOT078A |	And say hey guys
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,623	| IOT078A |	Why don't you have that like
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:41,439	| IOT078A |	I actually today today on Wednesday while we
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,975	| IOT078A |	We're recording this I'm getting a makeup delivery
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,023	| IOT078A |	At home and I'm really sad about it
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:46,559	| IOT078A |	Really hot and
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:51,167	| IOT078A |	So I would love the ability
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,959	| IOT078A |	We're like my Blue Apron tool
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,007	| IOT078A |	When those real
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:55,519	| IOT078A |	Inside
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:56,799	| IOT078A |	I just feel slightly better
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,383	| IOT078A |	Sophia
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:06,783	| IOT078A |	I definitely see the value I just wonder what happens the first time something doesn't go
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:13,183	| IOT078A |	Alright like somebody is delivering something in your house and something missing or they're sitting on your couch watching TV for an hour
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:15,231	| IOT078A |	Can you find out what is
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:21,119	| IOT078A |	Amazon going to Deming they're putting potentially their name and brand behind this that's the surprising bit to me
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,655	| IOT078A |	In a situation like this
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:23,935	| IOT078A |	I imagine you have a cat
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:27,263	| IOT078A |	If Amazon actually does create its own
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,543	| IOT078A |	Own network of delivery
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,567	| IOT078A |	People with
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:31,615	| IOT078A |	Its own airplanes all that good stuff
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,639	| IOT078A |	True true
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,663	| IOT078A |	Treated like
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:34,431	| IOT078A |	Budget Inn
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,455	| IOT078A |	Employees I mean
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:37,503	| IOT078A |	We let people into our homes all the time
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,551	| IOT078A |	Not everybody but some people do
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,575	| IOT078A |	And you don't have to do
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,623	| IOT078A |	That's the other thing
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,903	| IOT078A |	I mean
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:45,695	| IOT078A |	Laundry for people who feel like
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:51,071	| IOT078A |	You know and I think having a camera will help
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,607	| IOT078A |	I'm not sure I would do it
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:54,655	| IOT078A |	But I also work from home so I'm not sure I really
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:59,519	| IOT078A |	I just want as many options as possible to have the
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:01,823	| IOT078A |	Storage lockers
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:02,335	| IOT078A |	They have
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:08,223	| IOT078A |	Am I have drones delivering stuff to you one day they have them
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:09,247	| IOT078A |	Putting stuff in the
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:10,783	| IOT078A |	People's cars
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:17,183	| IOT078A |	Anything I can do to remove barriers between you and a product they're doing or trying to do so I guess
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,719	| IOT078A |	Again I think it'll be
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:21,023	| IOT078A |	Polarizing
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,815	| IOT078A |	But the end of the day you're right it's
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,631	| IOT078A |	It's up to you if they do decide to offer this
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:27,679	| IOT078A |	Each individual makes a decision so
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:29,727	| IOT078A |	And by golly if they're going to offer me Disco
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,007	| IOT078A |	Super excited
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:34,847	| IOT078A |	Oh you have to go around
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:36,895	| IOT078A |	That this locked
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:37,919	| IOT078A |	Because none of my front doors have
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:42,271	| IOT078A |	But it's free delivery if you let us put an ad on your door lock
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:48,927	| IOT078A |	Man I bought so many I have the ad version of the Kindle
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,719	| IOT078A |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,999	| IOT078A |	I have bought so many
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,535	| IOT078A |	$3 books
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:54,047	| IOT078A |	Because of that thing
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,583	| IOT078A |	There you go
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:57,119	| IOT078A |	I'm like
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:57,887	| IOT078A |	You're very good
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:59,167	| IOT078A |	Okay so
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:00,703	| IOT078A |	That's cool stuff coming
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:02,239	| IOT078A |	In-services friend
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:08,639	| IOT078A |	Let's talk about the Apple Watch 2 as a fitness tracker since
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:10,687	| IOT078A |	Last week because we were so busy talking about I don't even know
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:17,343	| IOT078A |	Well that's okay because I literally just got it the night before the last show so it's probably best that we waited a week because
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:22,463	| IOT078A |	I've now had an extra seven days to determine if it's a good Fitness tracker
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:28,863	| IOT078A |	And I have to say in just to put some perspective around this I run everyday I think today is day 111 of my daily
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:34,751	| IOT078A |	Running Street I do track my steps I'm not so keen on tracking my sleep which the Apple watch really does not do
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:40,127	| IOT078A |	Effectively partially because of battery life partially because there's no native function to do so
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:46,271	| IOT078A |	What is a fitness tracker having previously warned the fitbits and Darius Android Wear watches
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:52,927	| IOT078A |	I'm pretty impressed I have to say no granted I bought the series to watch which has GPS
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:56,767	| IOT078A |	And that is that that was a key
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:15:02,655	| IOT078A |	Negative for me on the first Apple watch I had to run with my phone if I want to use the Apple activity
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,703	| IOT078A |	Cracker witch
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:06,239	| IOT078A |	Just didn't like running is my phone
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:09,823	| IOT078A |	So the GPS is working fantastic I've compared to the
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:15,199	| IOT078A |	Various seven or eight runs that I've had this with prior runs GPS looks spot-on
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:18,527	| IOT078A |	The heart rate monitor is kind of disappointing to me though
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:23,647	| IOT078A |	I do run with the heart rate monitor on and it seems like no matter what every time I start a run
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:28,511	| IOT078A |	The Apple watch has my heart rate pegged around 160 to 170
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:34,655	| IOT078A |	Yeah that's like what my eight and a half minute mile pace is when I've actually been running for a bit like
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,471	| IOT078A |	What's going on
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:43,871	| IOT078A |	The strange thing is usually about halfway through the first mile it seems to settle down back into the
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:46,175	| IOT078A |	140s Maybe 150s
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:52,575	| IOT078A |	What is throwing off my average heart rate for sure so that's very strange to me I don't know why that's doing that don't know if that's
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:55,647	| IOT078A |	Just me and my Apple watch with others are having that same issue whatever
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:58,975	| IOT078A |	How does the heart rate monitor work is it is it the lights is it a galvanic
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,255	| IOT078A |	Carrabba's
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:06,655	| IOT078A |	Yeah I know it's it's the same as the original Apple watches are totally unchanged it's the same for Led You Know
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:11,007	| IOT078A |	Node sensors under the under the the base of the Apple watch so
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:12,799	| IOT078A |	No difference there and I
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:16,639	| IOT078A |	I don't recall this being an issue with my earlier version but then again
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:19,455	| IOT078A |	I was so kind of turned off McNab GPS I really wouldn't
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:23,295	| IOT078A |	Spend a lot of time using it as a fitness tracker so
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:29,183	| IOT078A |	Regular heart rate monitor is fine I mean if I check my heart rate now I'm sure it's you know probably 165 70 beats a minute
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,719	| IOT078A |	Uggs
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:32,511	| IOT078A |	No I'm old
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:37,631	| IOT078A |	So that's that's 1 1/4 I will also say this
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:44,543	| IOT078A |	If you want to take your Fitness data out of the Apple iOS ecosystem it is still nearly Impala
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:49,407	| IOT078A |	Possible there are some third-party apps that try and do this for you they don't get all the data
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:53,503	| IOT078A |	Apple has not made it easy to get at share the data and that's disappointing to me I have
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:17:00,415	| IOT078A |	I don't know 7 years now of data and RunKeeper so I like to put my my
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:05,535	| IOT078A |	I did in there I have to do it manually with the Apple watch and that's that's frustrating disappointing
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:07,583	| IOT078A |	It's it's just disappointing
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,887	| IOT078A |	One last bit on the GPS
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:12,191	| IOT078A |	There's no indicator to tell you
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:12,959	| IOT078A |	If
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:15,007	| IOT078A |	The watch has a GPS signal and I
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:16,543	| IOT078A |	Down that frustrating at first
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:23,455	| IOT078A |	But they do a really good job at using Wi-Fi assisted GPS and other methods to
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,223	| IOT078A |	You actually
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:26,783	| IOT078A |	Get your signal pretty quick you don't know it
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:29,087	| IOT078A |	When it has a signal yet
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:29,855	| IOT078A |	It's
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:31,135	| IOT078A |	Pinspot on
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:34,719	| IOT078A |	So kudos to the man that I do is that an indicator there so
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:35,743	| IOT078A |	Okay and then
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:37,023	| IOT078A |	How does it affect the battery life
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:42,399	| IOT078A |	Yeah good question because the original Apple watch was definitely just a one-day
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,679	| IOT078A |	Device on a charge
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:48,287	| IOT078A |	It pretty much still is I'm getting marginally better battery life and that's including
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:54,687	| IOT078A |	The GPS tracking as well as listening to music on my Bluetooth headset headphones and heart rate monitor
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:59,807	| IOT078A |	Typically if I go out and run anywhere from music 35 miles in a day
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:01,343	| IOT078A |	I still have
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,903	| IOT078A |	Battery life left at the end of the day
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:09,535	| IOT078A |	So the GPS isn't hitting it that much and warm apple has boosted the battery capacity which I believe they have
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:10,815	| IOT078A |	This watch is a little thicker
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:14,655	| IOT078A |	I think it did a good job managing that I quit on
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:21,055	| IOT078A |	I can probably answer that question better next show because I'm running a half marathon on Sunday with it which will be
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,847	| IOT078A |	Roughly two hours of running
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:25,407	| IOT078A |	I'm sure to get through it all because Apple says
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:26,943	| IOT078A |	5 hours with GPS
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,711	| IOT078A |	So
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,479	| IOT078A |	Okay well
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:29,503	| IOT078A |	I'm back in next week
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,551	| IOT078A |	Alright in kind of
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,831	| IOT078A |	Smaller news Atwood
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:34,111	| IOT078A |	Definitely thought we should cover
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:36,159	| IOT078A |	We have to talk about the DDOS attack
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:37,951	| IOT078A |	Brian Krebs
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,743	| IOT078A |	And the reason we have to talk about it
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,023	| IOT078A |	Is
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:42,559	| IOT078A |	Apparently this was a
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:45,119	| IOT078A |	Between a 600 and 700 gigabit
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,911	| IOT078A |	Per second DDOS attack which is freaky
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,215	| IOT078A |	And
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:53,567	| IOT078A |	Part of the devices that were in this attack or actually
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:56,127	| IOT078A |	Security cameras IP security cameras
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:57,151	| IOT078A |	And
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:59,199	| IOT078A |	Some smart TVs
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:18:59,967	| IOT078A |	So
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,735	| IOT078A |	That's insane
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:03,551	| IOT078A |	That's another reason to like lockdown your
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:05,599	| IOT078A |	Because my God
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,415	| IOT078A |	That's actually at this event that I'm in
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:10,207	| IOT078A |	We'll talk about it next week
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:11,999	| IOT078A |	Cuz I got a bunch more iot stuff happening
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:12,767	| IOT078A |	Today
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:14,303	| IOT078A |	But one of the big seems is peep
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,583	| IOT078A |	People keep bringing up his attack
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,095	| IOT078A |	Can their legs look
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:18,911	| IOT078A |	Having connected devices everywhere
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:20,959	| IOT078A |	And just bringing him into your home
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:21,983	| IOT078A |	And your business
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:26,591	| IOT078A |	Increase your attack surface but it also increases the tools that hackers
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:27,359	| IOT078A |	Could use to it
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:27,871	| IOT078A |	Attack people
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:28,895	| IOT078A |	And
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:30,943	| IOT078A |	Because he's are devices
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:31,967	| IOT078A |	The people you know
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:33,503	| IOT078A |	You can tell when your
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,015	| IOT078A |	Computers at fact
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,319	| IOT078A |	For the most part
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:37,087	| IOT078A |	Put
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:38,879	| IOT078A |	Because you don't check in on your iPad
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:39,903	| IOT078A |	Very often
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,719	| IOT078A |	Because hackers are very Savvy about how to
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:43,487	| IOT078A |	I use it
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,255	| IOT078A |	Decency
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,023	| IOT078A |	Can be infected in
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:45,791	| IOT078A |	Depart of like
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:46,559	| IOT078A |	A botnet army
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:55,775	| IOT078A |	I was just going to say you never know as long as you're getting you know your camera feed on command or on demand
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:20:00,639	| IOT078A |	You don't know what else that processor inside that device is doing with the connection that has
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:01,407	| IOT078A |	So
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,431	| IOT078A |	You just wouldn't know
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:06,015	| IOT078A |	Exactly so there's a lot of talk out there about this being a
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:06,783	| IOT078A |	Threat against
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:07,551	| IOT078A |	Free speech be
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:09,087	| IOT078A |	Because Brian Krebs was actually take
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:09,599	| IOT078A |	Down by
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:11,647	| IOT078A |	Was actually
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:12,671	| IOT078A |	Attacked
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:13,951	| IOT078A |	And his
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:14,975	| IOT078A |	Security provider prolex
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:16,767	| IOT078A |	Akamai
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:18,047	| IOT078A |	They said hey you know what
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:19,583	| IOT078A |	We're doing this for you
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:22,143	| IOT078A |	For free we had to absorb you know almost 700
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:22,911	| IOT078A |	Gigabits per second
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,423	| IOT078A |	Traffic
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:26,495	| IOT078A |	Do this so now he's actually under
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:27,263	| IOT078A |	Google
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:28,031	| IOT078A |	Has there
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,055	| IOT078A |	Shield Project
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:29,567	| IOT078A |	Journalist
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,615	| IOT078A |	So kudos to Google
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,895	| IOT078A |	Golfer for having that
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,175	| IOT078A |	Cuz they they aren't there now hosting
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,711	| IOT078A |	But
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:38,015	| IOT078A |	All in all this is just a this is just kind of
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,807	| IOT078A |	Scary
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:41,599	| IOT078A |	And not just for the
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:43,903	| IOT078A |	Consumer report for the World At Large
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:46,207	| IOT078A |	This is going to be out there in that that's going to be a big
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:53,887	| IOT078A |	Nothing here is with the proliferation of so many connected devices
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:21:00,031	| IOT078A |	I suspect this is not the first time we're not the last time rather that we're going to see this I mean
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:05,663	| IOT078A |	So many of them really are insecure and people don't realize that and we've harped on this before
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:09,247	| IOT078A |	Security of a device should be part of your decision making process
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,015	| IOT078A |	And
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:13,343	| IOT078A |	So I'll try this there was a there was a story about
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:15,903	| IOT078A |	I think it was a Texas mom I can't remember who.
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:16,672	| IOT078A |	Houston
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,464	| IOT078A |	And their baby camera
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:19,232	| IOT078A |	Was hacked
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:21,792	| IOT078A |	And what was interesting here is they were like
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:23,840	| IOT078A |	Look we actually change the password
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:24,864	| IOT078A |	My camera
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,656	| IOT078A |	From you know password rap
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:29,984	| IOT078A |	We change that
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:32,544	| IOT078A |	And what happened was they hadn't changed their password on
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,056	| IOT078A |	Their router
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:38,688	| IOT078A |	I'm bringing this up because we hear a lot today about this is how you saw this you changed
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:39,456	| IOT078A |	The password on your device
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:41,248	| IOT078A |	I feel like most sophisticated
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,064	| IOT078A |	But
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:46,368	| IOT078A |	Now you got to go back and be like oh
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:47,136	| IOT078A |	My router
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:47,904	| IOT078A |	Password
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:48,416	| IOT078A |	Change that
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:52,768	| IOT078A |	If it's a whole chain of devices that's the thing and then
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:59,168	| IOT078A |	I think people will miss out on that and I just will do what you would just Jezebel change the password on a particular device sale
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:00,448	| IOT078A |	Okay now the problem is fixed
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:03,264	| IOT078A |	And yet the weak Link in the chain is not fixed so
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:08,896	| IOT078A |	It's actually getting kind of crazy man you almost have to be an IT Network admin to start
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:10,944	| IOT078A |	Really making sure that you're 100% secure
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:12,480	| IOT078A |	Yes and that's
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:12,992	| IOT078A |	Not tenable
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:17,600	| IOT078A |	It's not why we think about that maybe next week I'll have a brand new security model
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:19,648	| IOT078A |	Why haven't you come back with a solution
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:21,184	| IOT078A |	Probably not guys
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:22,464	| IOT078A |	Talk about it
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:27,584	| IOT078A |	Cool news sap has decided they're going to spend up to
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:30,912	| IOT078A |	2 to billion dollars in int Investments they started out by buying a
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:31,680	| IOT078A |	Company called
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:32,448	| IOT078A |	Platte1
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:34,752	| IOT078A |	That is kind of a Jasper like service that offers
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:36,800	| IOT078A |	Tizen 2
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:38,336	| IOT078A |	Rihanna platform
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:40,896	| IOT078A |	Coyote
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:41,920	| IOT078A |	And I also bought it
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,432	| IOT078A |	Company in
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,224	| IOT078A |	When was Norway
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:47,296	| IOT078A |	Adam and that does kind of
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,064	| IOT078A |	Vision stuff
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:49,344	| IOT078A |	Patience.
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:53,184	| IOT078A |	They see the future it sees things
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:58,816	| IOT078A |	Computer vision in also is part of creating a digital twin
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:01,376	| IOT078A |	And this is a concept that super popular in the industrial leader
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:03,168	| IOT078A |	It is a cool concept
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:04,960	| IOT078A |	Comes from NASA
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:05,728	| IOT078A |	And
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:07,008	| IOT078A |	The idea is that
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:09,824	| IOT078A |	In the real world you have a device or app
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:10,336	| IOT078A |	Piece of machinery
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:14,176	| IOT078A |	And it is so outfitted with sensors that you can create a digital version of it that
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,456	| IOT078A |	Do all kinds
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:16,224	| IOT078A |	Crazy cool testing
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:17,504	| IOT078A |	NC housing
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,016	| IOT078A |	Affected
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:19,552	| IOT078A |	I think it's going to be
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,344	| IOT078A |	If you imagine like a r
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:24,672	| IOT078A |	The face
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,184	| IOT078A |	Woo
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:28,000	| IOT078A |	Scary
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:28,768	| IOT078A |	That's Tuff
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,304	| IOT078A |	But they did
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,328	| IOT078A |	Which has the digital
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:33,376	| IOT078A |	Capabilities
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,656	| IOT078A |	That's that's good news for them
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:36,192	| IOT078A |	Keep and keep
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,216	| IOT078A |	In the investment going
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:37,984	| IOT078A |	This is
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:39,520	| IOT078A |	A good thing for you Kevin
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:40,800	| IOT078A |	Because
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,080	| IOT078A |	It involves Google
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:42,592	| IOT078A |	Also we should give
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:47,968	| IOT078A |	Oh yes I consult for Google but not in their Smart Home
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:48,992	| IOT078A |	. also
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:50,528	| IOT078A |	My opinions are my own
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:53,344	| IOT078A |	So particle a developer board
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:56,416	| IOT078A |	They have teamed up with Google Cloud
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:59,232	| IOT078A |	To send data from physical devices directly into the
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:00,256	| IOT078A |	Google Cloud platform
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:01,280	| IOT078A |	Infer analyze
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,072	| IOT078A |	And
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:05,376	| IOT078A |	I forgot this was kind of cool because
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:07,680	| IOT078A |	It particle has its own cloud
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:08,448	| IOT078A |	So there
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:08,960	| IOT078A |	Tainan
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:09,984	| IOT078A |	The Google stuff
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:12,032	| IOT078A |	And because Google has it's like
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:13,056	| IOT078A |	Like crazy information
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,104	| IOT078A |	World I can see
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:15,616	| IOT078A |	Google like
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:22,784	| IOT078A |	Overtime but they've actually been experimenting with particle boards
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,856	| IOT078A |	Time data from their G bikes
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:28,160	| IOT078A |	With the purple acid trackers
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:30,464	| IOT078A |	They're showing basically how they
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:33,024	| IOT078A |	Track these things see what he
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:34,048	| IOT078A |	KFC usage patterns
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,096	| IOT078A |	Data visualization
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:42,496	| IOT078A |	That sounds like a very googly thing to do and I do love the bikes by the way I ride them every time I go out there
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:48,896	| IOT078A |	Interesting Lee this ties into a theme that we heard a Google IO has continued in some of the newer products
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:49,920	| IOT078A |	The Google hasn't asked
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:53,760	| IOT078A |	Let's machine learning Google is really making a machine learning push
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:55,808	| IOT078A |	So this is a really nice tie and I think
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:57,088	| IOT078A |	Yeah because
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:59,904	| IOT078A |	Machine learning is great about looking
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:01,184	| IOT078A |	Camphor like clusters
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:02,208	| IOT078A |	Patterns
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:04,000	| IOT078A |	Once has been trained
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:04,768	| IOT078A |	On what to look
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:06,048	| IOT078A |	4 and what to optimize for
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:09,120	| IOT078A |	There's going to be so much data from
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:12,192	| IOT078A |	Putting sensors in the world we're going to have to rely on computers to start
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,216	| IOT078A |	Like helping us filter
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:16,288	| IOT078A |	I just think it'll be fascinating
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:16,800	| IOT078A |	To see
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,080	| IOT078A |	Like you can imagine
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,384	| IOT078A |	Bikes and where they're Park
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:21,408	| IOT078A |	Are they are
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,944	| IOT078A |	You'll you'll be able to see like
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:24,992	| IOT078A |	Usage patterns like where
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:26,016	| IOT078A |	Kind of cluster.
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:28,832	| IOT078A |	I don't know
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:31,904	| IOT078A |	Now it's 5 completely agree
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,928	| IOT078A |	Maybe not about the bike so much
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:35,744	| IOT078A |	But you know that I like to buy
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,280	| IOT078A |	And then
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:37,792	| IOT078A |	Finally
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:40,096	| IOT078A |	Snapchat glasses
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:44,448	| IOT078A |	Yeah from a new company will not new cover a newly named company snap
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:47,264	| IOT078A |	No more chat
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:49,056	| IOT078A |	We're just taking pictures
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:51,872	| IOT078A |	Yes
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:57,760	| IOT078A |	Yet this is kind of interesting only because I'm not to tie into a whole Google theme here but
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:26:03,904	| IOT078A |	Google Glass which I think was 2013 was available really got pans
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:05,440	| IOT078A |	Mainly because
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:10,816	| IOT078A |	The creepy factor of having a camera that could take pictures and record video and sell it
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:13,888	| IOT078A |	And yet this is exactly what the Snapchat glasses
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:17,472	| IOT078A |	Do but then again this is Snapchats
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:19,520	| IOT078A |	This is not all right it's all about
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:22,080	| IOT078A |	Sharing snaps videos
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:28,992	| IOT078A |	What's wrong with your social friend so so these are sunglasses that will I think they cost 129
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:31,040	| IOT078A |	$1 when they become available
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:34,112	| IOT078A |	And they have a camera built-in obviously and they will
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,648	| IOT078A |	Literally record
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:38,464	| IOT078A |	Short snaps of a videos
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:44,864	| IOT078A |	And there I believe there's a light to tell you to let others around you know yeah okay to let others know that that's a
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:46,144	| IOT078A |	That's actually recording
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:52,544	| IOT078A |	And it will automatically send these circular videos and if you notice that that's Heather differential
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:54,848	| IOT078A |	Getting these to your friends on Snapchat
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:55,616	| IOT078A |	So
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:56,128	| IOT078A |	Important
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,408	| IOT078A |	Are Samurai
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:59,712	| IOT078A |	They disappear it's after 24 hours I think
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:07,136	| IOT078A |	Oh yeah used to be a lot less than that but I think it is up to 24 hours now they have a couple different ways I am not on
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:10,208	| IOT078A |	Snapchat these days I couldn't tell you not with the kids you're not hip
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:14,816	| IOT078A |	I'm cool I'm not well that's that's why I actually joined it not to be hip and cool.
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:19,936	| IOT078A |	See what my kids are doing and when I saw that they were doing like not need to see this anymore so I got off
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:22,496	| IOT078A |	Snapchat I hope it was all innocent fun Kevin
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:30,176	| IOT078A |	It was fun I don't know about Innocent but yeah whatever the kids some discussions were had
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:32,224	| IOT078A |	So
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:33,760	| IOT078A |	Yes I think
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:35,808	| IOT078A |	I will be curious about their reception
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:38,368	| IOT078A |	Because it might be a wonderful example of
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,904	| IOT078A |	Just it being the right time
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:41,440	| IOT078A |	So the generational shift
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,720	| IOT078A |	Google glasses
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,256	| IOT078A |	Yes
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:46,304	| IOT078A |	Might be enough to be like
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:47,328	| IOT078A |	Yeah we don't care about 5
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:49,632	| IOT078A |	We can walk into bars with
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:50,912	| IOT078A |	Crazy teal
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,704	| IOT078A |	Coral or Black sunglasses
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,216	| IOT078A |	I'm just be like
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:54,496	| IOT078A |	Yeah
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:55,008	| IOT078A |	Record this
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,056	| IOT078A |	I don't like it
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:04,480	| IOT078A |	I8 yeah I think it's interesting I think you're spot on I think the demographic is very different and it will be more
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:05,248	| IOT078A |	Italy
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:09,344	| IOT078A |	Accepted by the younger demographic, and that's fine I mean times are changing
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:13,440	| IOT078A |	Yeah I mean you got your phone with that say just use your phone
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:16,256	| IOT078A |	I will I will say that using your phone
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:17,536	| IOT078A |	Is a pain
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,584	| IOT078A |	Because you have to pull it out take the camera
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:20,864	| IOT078A |	Wait for
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,656	| IOT078A |	I mean it's not okay
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,680	| IOT078A |	Pain is really at the wrong
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:25,984	| IOT078A |	Satchel Paige
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:29,824	| IOT078A |	Picture with my butt
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:30,592	| IOT078A |	Where is fu
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:32,640	| IOT078A |	The fact that their sun glasses
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:33,408	| IOT078A |	Is kind of nice Beach
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:34,176	| IOT078A |	Because it's not like you're
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:35,200	| IOT078A |	Going to be walking around in
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:35,712	| IOT078A |	Inside with
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,808	| IOT078A |	Do you know this it just feels Connecticut outdoor fun
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:41,600	| IOT078A |	People might already be in public places
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:45,440	| IOT078A |	Maybe that was Google Glasses overstep is they
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,208	| IOT078A |	They made it
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:47,232	| IOT078A |	Too much
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:48,768	| IOT078A |	Always uncut
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:50,816	| IOT078A |	In your face scary where is apparel
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:52,864	| IOT078A |	Look at someone's walking around outside and
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:53,888	| IOT078A |	Has a pair of sunglasses on it
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,448	| IOT078A |	If I'm outside
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:58,240	| IOT078A |	No I'm probably
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:00,032	| IOT078A |	Other people
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:01,056	| IOT078A |	Can see me I feel like I'm in a more
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:02,848	| IOT078A |	So that's
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,896	| IOT078A |	A small difference
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:11,296	| IOT078A |	I will see how they look different I mean Google glass look like to some degree of a small computer
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,064	| IOT078A |	Strapped to your
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:14,624	| IOT078A |	Glasses frame
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,136	| IOT078A |	It was
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,416	| IOT078A |	Yeah
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:18,976	| IOT078A |	It was scary I did I I still have pictures
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:20,768	| IOT078A |	Stop myself wearing those things yes
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:22,048	| IOT078A |	There you go
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:27,168	| IOT078A |	Hopefully Snapchat will not have their Robert scoble in the shower moment and maybe that's all they need
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,448	| IOT078A |	Maybe that's all
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:35,872	| IOT078A |	I hope not I'm sorry to break that up some things cannot be unseen
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,640	| IOT078A |	Sad
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:40,224	| IOT078A |	Okay so real fast we're just going to stay at the sweet home
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:42,272	| IOT078A |	Which is a wonderful site
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:43,808	| IOT078A |	Part of The Wirecutter site
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:45,344	| IOT078A |	Actually The Wire
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:47,392	| IOT078A |	I like the sweet home
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:48,928	| IOT078A |	About sheets FaceTime
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:54,048	| IOT078A |	So they have decided that the best Wi-Fi home security camera
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:54,560	| IOT078A |	What is
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:55,840	| IOT078A |	Now
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:58,144	| IOT078A |	No longer The Nest it is now the
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:01,472	| IOT078A |	I'm going to say I always thought I was feeling nervous saying this
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:03,264	| IOT078A |	The Logitech
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,288	| IOT078A |	Litchi Circle
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:07,616	| IOT078A |	Which is about $170 on Amazon
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:10,176	| IOT078A |	They like it because it has a lot of really awesome
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:11,200	| IOT078A |	Some features and
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:11,968	| IOT078A |	And it doesn't have the
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:12,992	| IOT078A |	Subscription plan
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:14,272	| IOT078A |	So
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:20,160	| IOT078A |	I'm so anti subscription to although
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:22,208	| IOT078A |	So our last week's guests talked about
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:24,768	| IOT078A |	It was Canary CEO and they actually have a
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:27,072	| IOT078A |	Membership
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:27,840	| IOT078A |	Where in
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:28,352	| IOT078A |	And his whole point
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:29,888	| IOT078A |	It's not just about
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:32,960	| IOT078A |	Cloud storage you have to offer real service so there is is
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:34,496	| IOT078A |	If your home is burglarized
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:36,032	| IOT078A |	They will help you
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:36,544	| IOT078A |	You call them up
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:37,824	| IOT078A |	They tell you like what you
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:39,104	| IOT078A |	With your insurance
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:40,384	| IOT078A |	Please stay home
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:41,920	| IOT078A |	Which feels
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:43,200	| IOT078A |	Nice
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:43,712	| IOT078A |	I can't hold
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,016	| IOT078A |	But
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:48,576	| IOT078A |	The Wirecutter second choice is the
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:50,368	| IOT078A |	Netgear Arlo Q
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,648	| IOT078A |	Which is expensive
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:52,928	| IOT078A |	But apparently
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:53,696	| IOT078A |	Very nice
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:55,488	| IOT078A |	And their budget pick is the blink
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:56,256	| IOT078A |	Twitch
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:57,792	| IOT078A |	I have one suggest
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:30:58,816	| IOT078A |	People that they should stick
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:30:59,840	| IOT078A |	A fridge so they
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:01,376	| IOT078A |	A visual of
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:04,192	| IOT078A |	Because it's like $100.
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:07,776	| IOT078A |	Stick on the wall
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:11,104	| IOT078A |	And then the nest cam is like a
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:11,872	| IOT078A |	Yeah yeah yeah
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:12,384	| IOT078A |	Have you really likes my
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:15,456	| IOT078A |	So
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:17,504	| IOT078A |	That I thought was worth mentioning it
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:18,784	| IOT078A |	Because people really love their
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:20,832	| IOT078A |	Home Security
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:21,600	| IOT078A |	Cameras to spy
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:25,184	| IOT078A |	Set tax
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:32,096	| IOT078A |	Well yeah but if they're going to get the Amazon in home package delivery service then they may want this
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:34,656	| IOT078A |	Stay tuned for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,680	| IOT078A |	Hpe

EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:42,848	| IOT078A |	Our Guest Carlos Herrera who is the CEO of petnet you are really going to like this one
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:51,296	| IOT078A |	Everyone we are going to take a break for a moment for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:52,832	| IOT078A |	This week sponsor is HP
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:56,160	| IOT078A |	And we have Nigel Upton who is the director
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:58,976	| IOT078A |	4 hpe universal iot
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:01,792	| IOT078A |	Hi Nigel you told me
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:03,840	| IOT078A |	About this concept of
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:05,376	| IOT078A |	Any device any network
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:07,168	| IOT078A |	What do you mean by
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:14,336	| IOT078A |	There are so many different types of things in the internet of things as you know there are literally millions
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:17,664	| IOT078A |	All things are not created equal
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:23,296	| IOT078A |	Do I seem like a connect to doorbell or a smart refrigerator
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:26,880	| IOT078A |	It's already difference to a complex piece of machinery
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:33,280	| IOT078A |	Fences all over it and say an aircraft engine or in the middle of a manufacturing plant and
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:34,048	| IOT078A |	Premises
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:37,120	| IOT078A |	The whole thing's not connected equally
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:42,752	| IOT078A |	There is a different sense of priority and different type of network
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:45,568	| IOT078A |	Appropriate for the right type of device
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:48,128	| IOT078A |	Signature what kind of networks are you thinking
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:51,968	| IOT078A |	You should when you think of things like connected cause
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:58,880	| IOT078A |	Then you think about cellular connectivity and that's a really good fit for the type of conductivity for the connected car
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:00,672	| IOT078A |	If you think about
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:02,464	| IOT078A |	Saya doorbell
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:05,024	| IOT078A |	Then why fight would be much more appropriate
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:08,864	| IOT078A |	Because it would normally connecting to your hair with Wi-Fi but we have
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:11,168	| IOT078A |	Too many use cases
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:13,472	| IOT078A |	Where you think about
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:19,872	| IOT078A |	Something you ate merging Technologies like the long range low-power wide area Networks
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:26,016	| IOT078A |	Galatians like the Lora Alliance oh companies like sigfox making tremendous strides
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:31,136	| IOT078A |	People looking at how to
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:33,184	| IOT078A |	Types of palm trees
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:36,512	| IOT078A |	The process they wanted to use was to be able to
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:42,144	| IOT078A |	Digitally manage how these trees are grown and so they put sensors in the ground
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:48,544	| IOT078A |	Sunday use a lure that's worth to be able to connect the senses together they didn't gather dates and put it through again
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:51,872	| IOT078A |	Gateway diesel
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:58,784	| IOT078A |	Because of this particular case it's one of the largest plantations in Malaysia
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:04,672	| IOT078A |	And the only connectivity choice they have a satellite there is no other choice what is hpe
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:05,440	| IOT078A |	Come into all of this
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:08,256	| IOT078A |	The platform
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:11,328	| IOT078A |	Which is absolutely agnostic
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:15,168	| IOT078A |	On any type of device over any type of network
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:21,568	| IOT078A |	To ensure that they choose the appropriate
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:25,920	| IOT078A |	Work whether it's based on latency or whether it's based on cost
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:28,480	| IOT078A |	What's the type of deployment of devices or things
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:30,016	| IOT078A |	Does are actually doing
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:33,088	| IOT078A |	And I would encourage any purchaser
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:35,136	| IOT078A |	Eleni iot platform
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:42,048	| IOT078A |	Kissing kiss about making sure that you have a platform that is open to allow you to be able to make
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:43,584	| IOT078A |	The choice of network
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:45,888	| IOT078A |	Like type of device
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:46,912	| IOT078A |	Where can I find out my

EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:38,368	| IOT078A |	Glitter or mission is
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:39,392	| IOT078A |	Very simple
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:40,928	| IOT078A |	It's to help
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:41,696	| IOT078A |	Pet owners
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:45,024	| IOT078A |	The right tools so that they could feed their pets
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:46,304	| IOT078A |	The right amount of food
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:49,888	| IOT078A |	Pacifically for their pet and also to help guide them
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:51,168	| IOT078A |	The right type of
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:54,496	| IOT078A |	Meaning matching the right ingredients to their pets
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:59,104	| IOT078A |	Endemic qualities are pets nutritional needs
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:00,384	| IOT078A |	Self dispensing
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:02,944	| IOT078A |	Pet feeder and then you have a $49
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:04,480	| IOT078A |	Bold
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:06,016	| IOT078A |	Basically
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:07,040	| IOT078A |	Tell you when to stop
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:13,696	| IOT078A |	That's exactly right they're both have a
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:14,464	| IOT078A |	Companion app
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:18,560	| IOT078A |	When you on board to the device we ask you some really key questions about your pet
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:20,096	| IOT078A |	We have some about your
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:22,656	| IOT078A |	Are there age weight level of activity
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:24,448	| IOT078A |	Lost asking about their breed
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:26,496	| IOT078A |	And eventually bought some of allergies
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:29,824	| IOT078A |	The reason we ask these questions is so that then we can
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:31,104	| IOT078A |	Figure out
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:34,944	| IOT078A |	How many calories should be eating per day people are overfeeding their pet
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:36,224	| IOT078A |	Almost Hospital
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:36,736	| IOT078A |	The world
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:40,320	| IOT078A |	And if there's almost a billion to MediCare at the dogs around the world
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:45,952	| IOT078A |	Almost half of them were obese or overweight there's ways to to prevent this and it's just about having the right tools
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:48,768	| IOT078A |	So this brings us to
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:50,816	| IOT078A |	You guys have had this out on the mark
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:57,728	| IOT078A |	Yeah we launched the smart feeder the first product in August of 2015 so it's our one year anniversary
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:36:59,776	| IOT078A |	The product Market
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,568	| IOT078A |	So about that time
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:02,336	| IOT078A |	You guys
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:03,360	| IOT078A |	Went down for about 12 hours
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:04,640	| IOT078A |	Is it a server issue
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:06,432	| IOT078A |	People
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:07,456	| IOT078A |	Up
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:08,480	| IOT078A |	Sat
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:11,040	| IOT078A |	There is a lot of like
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:14,880	| IOT078A |	Oh my God about holiday what if my dog died
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:16,160	| IOT078A |	In
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:17,184	| IOT078A |	Much has been made of
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:20,000	| IOT078A |	What I thought was really
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:21,024	| IOT078A |	Pricing was when I asked
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:21,792	| IOT078A |	About this
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:22,816	| IOT078A |	You said that you guys were
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:24,096	| IOT078A |	We're actually from the Aerospace
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,120	| IOT078A |	Industry which I think of
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:27,168	| IOT078A |	Because having so many redundant
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:29,472	| IOT078A |	So careful
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:29,984	| IOT078A |	So I left
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,776	| IOT078A |	Understand how you guys
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:37,408	| IOT078A |	In a week we come from a very core team cuz they're very strict
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:38,944	| IOT078A |	Engineering background
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:41,760	| IOT078A |	When we notice this particular failure which
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:44,064	| IOT078A |	Made it so that our haircuts
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:48,160	| IOT078A |	Are trusting us when we went down we were
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:49,440	| IOT078A |	We were serious
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:51,488	| IOT078A |	They were at we actually went down at
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:53,536	| IOT078A |	About 8 p.m. Pacific time and we were up
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:55,840	| IOT078A |	Until 8 a.m.
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:58,144	| IOT078A |	The next day but looking for a fix
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:00,448	| IOT078A |	You know when you're at when you're designing
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:01,472	| IOT078A |	He's very large scale
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:03,776	| IOT078A |	Engineering Systems
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:08,384	| IOT078A |	You can choose your path so you can make a closed system you can make it an open
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:10,688	| IOT078A |	The world we live in now
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:15,040	| IOT078A |	Everyone's more inclined to build an open system because you end up in a greeting with
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:21,184	| IOT078A |	Pieces of the system that other companies are just better at you know they're there better at building
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:24,000	| IOT078A |	Distributed real-time data distribution
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:26,048	| IOT078A |	What we wanted to do is
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:31,680	| IOT078A |	Ensure that we were leaning on those capabilities leaving on those companies who are experts at 6
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:33,984	| IOT078A |	We end up with a system that is
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:37,568	| IOT078A |	Integrative third-party services in a lot of iot companies
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:41,152	| IOT078A |	Are built this way because if you really wanted to close a system
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:45,760	| IOT078A |	Mensaje we'll build everything you'll never finish you never bring your product to Market
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:47,296	| IOT078A |	With the amount of money that you have
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:49,856	| IOT078A |	To the system that we built
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:51,392	| IOT078A |	How's redundancies employees
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,416	| IOT078A |	But a lot of the
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:54,976	| IOT078A |	Received a lot of failures that are small.
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:56,768	| IOT078A |	Our customers don't even notice
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:39:00,096	| IOT078A |	We both redundancies for them immediately but a lot of them
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:01,376	| IOT078A |	We see them
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:03,168	| IOT078A |	As we encounter them right
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:05,728	| IOT078A |	And one spring counter them then were building their redundancy
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:07,776	| IOT078A |	That's different than
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:11,104	| IOT078A |	The Aerospace world where you know you're building aircraft
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:13,664	| IOT078A |	Chinese aircraft have to stay in the air forever all the time
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:15,712	| IOT078A |	You can't have any failures
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:18,272	| IOT078A |	And uses the aircraft systems are
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:20,576	| IOT078A |	Designed and developed on a 20-year cycle
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:24,672	| IOT078A |	Are we in the iot world we build things in them
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:26,720	| IOT078A |	Through your cycle right so you end up
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:29,024	| IOT078A |	Sacrificing
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:30,048	| IOT078A |	A lot of tests
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:30,816	| IOT078A |	Time
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:32,864	| IOT078A |	In order to get your product to Market
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:34,144	| IOT078A |	And at the same time
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:34,912	| IOT078A |	A lot of
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:36,704	| IOT078A |	Test time cost
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:38,240	| IOT078A |	As much as development time
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:40,032	| IOT078A |	She really just don't have the budget
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:40,544	| IOT078A |	Detestable
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:42,336	| IOT078A |	Do you really have to do
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:44,896	| IOT078A |	Just be on your toes and ensure that you can react quickly
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:46,432	| IOT078A |	And in a plane
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:47,456	| IOT078A |	Cost
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:50,784	| IOT078A |	Dollars vs
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:52,320	| IOT078A |	800
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:54,368	| IOT078A |	Pet feeder
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:55,392	| IOT078A |	So
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:57,184	| IOT078A |	How many third parties
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:58,464	| IOT078A |	We're in your sis
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:00,768	| IOT078A |	How do you think that
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:01,792	| IOT078A |	Compares to other IO
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:07,168	| IOT078A |	For us we have a 7 third-party integration
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:12,544	| IOT078A |	Aldi's third-party Integrations we've got them right there. They're not small companies.
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:14,336	| IOT078A |	I won't mention any of them but there
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:15,104	| IOT078A |	Large
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:18,176	| IOT078A |	Publicly traded companies there
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:19,712	| IOT078A |	They build their systems with
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:21,248	| IOT078A |	Redundancies in place
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:23,296	| IOT078A |	And you know of any one of these can
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:24,064	| IOT078A |	Fell
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:26,368	| IOT078A |	The killer dolls to build a system that
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:30,208	| IOT078A |	Can quickly react and switch over to a redundant system
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:34,048	| IOT078A |	Redundant systems are usually a little less capable right so you end up with
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:38,912	| IOT078A |	For processing less bandwidth but it keeps the system up and going so
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:41,472	| IOT078A |	The key to it all is to try to predict
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:44,032	| IOT078A |	All the potential failures
EDL	00:40:44,032	00:40:48,128	| IOT078A |	Android software to detect and fill over as quickly as possible
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:50,176	| IOT078A |	A lot of people saw this
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,456	| IOT078A |	Outage
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:52,736	| IOT078A |	Hazard
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:54,272	| IOT078A |	Good example of a resume
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:55,808	| IOT078A |	Why do why companies should put
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:56,832	| IOT078A |	Intelligence
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:58,880	| IOT078A |	So in the case
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:01,440	| IOT078A |	The internet going out
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:02,720	| IOT078A |	Servers failing
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:04,000	| IOT078A |	Or else
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:04,512	| IOT078A |	Everything
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:05,536	| IOT078A |	Default back
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:07,328	| IOT078A |	Physical devices
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:16,800	| IOT078A |	In the in the Aerospace world we call that a no comms scenario no communication
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:23,712	| IOT078A |	The interesting thing is an iot world you're very dependent on Communications but you have to design it so that if you lose
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:24,992	| IOT078A |	Communications for
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:29,088	| IOT078A |	Any amount of time whether it's one second one minute 12 hours in our case
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:31,392	| IOT078A |	Your system can still do
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:33,696	| IOT078A |	The basic functionality so with every
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:40,352	| IOT078A |	Every scenario where you lose a particular capability in this case we lost Communications to from our servers to our devices
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:42,144	| IOT078A |	The devices still have to
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:42,912	| IOT078A |	Work and
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:49,824	| IOT078A |	We will end up losing a little capability like you lose the real time on activity where you get the updates break-resistant
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:50,592	| IOT078A |	Wait for the update
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:51,616	| IOT078A |	Come out of your home
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:53,663	| IOT078A |	All the way to our servers and then down to your phone
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:56,479	| IOT078A |	Oh what Still Remains was ability to
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:41:57,503	| IOT078A |	Feed your pet
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:42:01,343	| IOT078A |	And what's interesting is that we built that in that was actually
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:07,999	| IOT078A |	The capability that is in the system was in the system prior to the failure so everyone's pets were fed
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:09,791	| IOT078A |	What happened was
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:12,095	| IOT078A |	People weren't getting the updates to their phone
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:14,143	| IOT078A |	Prince can you guys did a great job
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:16,191	| IOT078A |	I mean sending out of
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:16,703	| IOT078A |	Proactive email
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:18,495	| IOT078A |	Hey by the way this is
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:19,007	| IOT078A |	What's happening
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:20,799	| IOT078A |	I think it did get lost.
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:21,567	| IOT078A |	The pets were actually
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:22,335	| IOT078A |	Fed
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:23,359	| IOT078A |	That maybe the media is false
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:24,639	| IOT078A |	I'm real sorry about that
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:27,711	| IOT078A |	Certainly we didn't react
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:31,551	| IOT078A |	On the media friends I called his kind of like startups
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:34,367	| IOT078A |	Learning exercise right week
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:37,439	| IOT078A |	We didn't know how to react to a crisis we're so busy
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:41,279	| IOT078A |	Just building. Morales is awesome let's build his capability
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:45,631	| IOT078A |	That we we we weren't prepared for the media
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:46,655	| IOT078A |	Getting ahold of the
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:48,191	| IOT078A |	Story at 8 p.m. where
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:51,519	| IOT078A |	You know in the other side of the world it's 8 a.m.
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:54,335	| IOT078A |	And this the story is going
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:58,943	| IOT078A |	Live and it's spreading the end it's all the s*** it's a very important issue people are trusting
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:01,247	| IOT078A |	That we are feeding their pets in
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:06,367	| IOT078A |	Here we are with pet owners are not receiving confirmation that their pets are being fat
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:12,767	| IOT078A |	And that turns into panic and spin a sort of way or you know that's a startup we we are attempting to
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:15,583	| IOT078A |	Abdul exclamations infrastructure
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:16,863	| IOT078A |	DIYs I can
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:19,935	| IOT078A |	React quickly do that now we know we learned our lesson but
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:23,263	| IOT078A |	Rest assured on the engineering side your pets
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:25,055	| IOT078A |	We're said at the time that was scheduled
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:26,591	| IOT078A |	What else
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:27,359	| IOT078A |	Would you
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:28,639	| IOT078A |	I can see
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:30,175	| IOT078A |	Wiehle Ave
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:32,991	| IOT078A |	Like so you've integrated lots of
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:33,759	| IOT078A |	Partners
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:35,039	| IOT078A |	Are there steps
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:35,807	| IOT078A |	Is part of that energy
EDL	00:43:35,807	00:43:36,319	| IOT078A |	Operation that you
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:38,111	| IOT078A |	As an entrepreneur
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:39,647	| IOT078A |	To help
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,183	| IOT078A |	Maybe increase your
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:42,975	| IOT078A |	Liability or maybe
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:43,999	| IOT078A |	Just
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:45,279	| IOT078A |	I'm like
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:47,327	| IOT078A |	The importance of dashboarding what would we take away is
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:51,679	| IOT078A |	We need to build out more tools
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:52,959	| IOT078A |	That can help
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:53,727	| IOT078A |	Detect
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:55,263	| IOT078A |	Sellers more quickly
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:57,055	| IOT078A |	You know and not just tools so that
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:44:00,127	| IOT078A |	We wake up the engineering team and they start
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:02,431	| IOT078A |	Taqueria fix it also alerts
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:06,527	| IOT078A |	Rpr partners and our marketing to answer prepare for
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:11,647	| IOT078A |	For the backlash because people are paying attention they're trusting these devices.
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:13,951	| IOT078A |	Smart home that's the value proposition
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:17,023	| IOT078A |	You know the smart home is taking care of this for me when it doesn't
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:18,303	| IOT078A |	People get upset Justin
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:21,631	| IOT078A |	If I had someone helping you out in the home you know
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:27,007	| IOT078A |	If they didn't do their job I'd be upset at them cuz that's what that's the value proposition that you're paying for
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:30,079	| IOT078A |	We need to understand as a company
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:32,383	| IOT078A |	I think all iot companies to understand that
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:34,687	| IOT078A |	The value proposition
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:36,735	| IOT078A |	Needs to be real and he still always work
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:39,807	| IOT078A |	And when it doesn't work you need to prepare for
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:40,575	| IOT078A |	For those scenarios
EDL	00:44:42,111	00:44:42,879	| IOT078A |	In the software
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:43,647	| IOT078A |	World
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:44,671	| IOT078A |	There's this concert
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:45,439	| IOT078A |	Set that move fast
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:50,047	| IOT078A |	Curious because
EDL	00:44:50,559	00:44:51,839	| IOT078A |	A lot of people think that
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:52,863	| IOT078A |	That's a very Silicon Valley eat
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:55,167	| IOT078A |	It also kind of feels like
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:56,191	| IOT078A |	Maybe not the right
EDL	00:44:57,471	00:44:57,983	| IOT078A |	Hardware company
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:45:00,287	| IOT078A |	What do you think about
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:00,799	| IOT078A |	That is like
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:02,079	| IOT078A |	Amantra
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:03,103	| IOT078A |	Just in general
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:08,991	| IOT078A |	I think I think it's it's to be honest you have to move fast what happened Hardware however
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:11,295	| IOT078A |	You can only move as fast
EDL	00:45:12,063	00:45:15,647	| IOT078A |	As you can test an iterate through things in software
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:16,927	| IOT078A |	You can iterate
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:18,463	| IOT078A |	Through version
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:24,863	| IOT078A |	Quickly I mean you can walk over to someone's desk say hey can you try this get another build out in your test servers and your
EDL	00:45:24,863	00:45:25,375	| IOT078A |	You're up and running
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:28,959	| IOT078A |	With Hardware it's a little different you you do get the
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:29,983	| IOT078A |	Soccer park
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:31,519	| IOT078A |	Every all Hardware has software
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:34,847	| IOT078A |	However if there's an issue with your Hardware
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:36,127	| IOT078A |	Florida shooting
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:38,943	| IOT078A |	We had back in August of last year
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:42,271	| IOT078A |	Summit a few hundred customers were affected
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:44,831	| IOT078A |	In order to fix that piece of hardware
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:46,111	| IOT078A |	It took us three months
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:48,671	| IOT078A |	We have to re-engineer Reed School
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:50,719	| IOT078A |	Get the new tool.
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:51,487	| IOT078A |	Production
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:54,303	| IOT078A |	Make sure that will was come out of the fact
EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:56,351	| IOT078A |	Was what we wanted
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:46:00,447	| IOT078A |	Finally finally we have to Ocean Freight which takes another month
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:04,287	| IOT078A |	And after that we have to track the product
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:06,335	| IOT078A |	The stores and they finally the new customers
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:11,455	| IOT078A |	We moved fast and we broke things the whitcomb's
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:12,479	| IOT078A |	Hardware
EDL	00:46:12,479	00:46:14,271	| IOT078A |	You're governed by
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:16,063	| IOT078A |	Hardware Manufacturing
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:17,599	| IOT078A |	Do you have to
EDL	00:46:17,599	00:46:19,647	| IOT078A |	Follow that process to a T
EDL	00:46:19,647	00:46:20,415	| IOT078A |	In
EDL	00:46:20,415	00:46:21,439	| IOT078A |	Do you think
EDL	00:46:21,439	00:46:24,255	| IOT078A |	Some of this is a functionality of you guys being a startup
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:25,791	| IOT078A |	And
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:26,559	| IOT078A |	Figure company
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:28,351	| IOT078A |	Wouldn't have these
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:29,375	| IOT078A |	Kind of challenges
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:30,399	| IOT078A |	Is possibly cuz there
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:30,911	| IOT078A |	Building
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:34,495	| IOT078A |	You know we have a lot of advisors
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:36,287	| IOT078A |	A lot of them
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:37,823	| IOT078A |	How many of them are
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:38,847	| IOT078A |	Big corporations
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:41,407	| IOT078A |	Not have dual consumer electronics for decades
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:43,711	| IOT078A |	And you'd be surprised
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:46,783	| IOT078A |	They have the same issues with the with the luxury they have
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:48,831	| IOT078A |	Is the house larger budget
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:50,111	| IOT078A |	They have more time so
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:55,487	| IOT078A |	With a start-up you know that the fundraising cycle Avicii fundraising cycle
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:56,511	| IOT078A |	Bushes
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:46:58,559	| IOT078A |	On the schedule that you need to have
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:47:00,095	| IOT078A |	Minimum viable product
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:04,447	| IOT078A |	Then you need to be in the Market within the second year then you need to be able to scale
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:06,751	| IOT078A |	Within the 30 are you here all these
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:08,287	| IOT078A |	Early man
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:10,847	| IOT078A |	A company that has been due to
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:12,127	| IOT078A |	Decatur
EDL	00:47:12,127	00:47:14,687	| IOT078A |	They have a 8-year product development cycle
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:18,783	| IOT078A |	Windows 8 years and not just developing one version their developing five
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:21,855	| IOT078A |	And they're doing marketing research and they're calling in
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:24,415	| IOT078A |	Groups of people to test and provide feedback
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:26,719	| IOT078A |	And by the time to get to eat
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:30,815	| IOT078A |	To the eat there like we are 99% confident this probably is going to work
EDL	00:47:31,327	00:47:34,399	| IOT078A |	We are 9% confident that people are going to buy this
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:37,215	| IOT078A |	And that was 8 years later
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:39,519	| IOT078A |	And there's benefits to that there's also
EDL	00:47:39,519	00:47:42,847	| IOT078A |	The big challenge is to that because it's your designing something 8 years ago
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:47,199	| IOT078A |	I know you could arguably say that it's it's already obsolete by the time
EDL	00:47:47,199	00:47:48,735	| IOT078A |	You get to Market so
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:51,295	| IOT078A |	I think with was larger with a larger company
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:52,831	| IOT078A |	Did you get it
EDL	00:47:52,831	00:47:56,415	| IOT078A |	More robust reliable iot product however
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:47:59,487	| IOT078A |	It don't get the Innovation The Cutting Edge technology because
EDL	00:47:59,999	00:48:05,119	| IOT078A |	A lot of these systems are just designed you know 5 to 8 years ago imagine 5/8 years ago
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:09,983	| IOT078A |	What what did we have
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:11,519	| IOT078A |	It was only a year after.
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:17,407	| IOT078A |	Nothing displays in my decision
EDL	00:48:17,919	00:48:19,711	| IOT078A |	There's a balance that I think a lot of
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:24,319	| IOT078A |	The Innovation that comes out of startups has to be balanced with
EDL	00:48:24,319	00:48:25,599	| IOT078A |	Agility and just
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:27,135	| IOT078A |	Awesome people
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:31,231	| IOT078A |	In the company that can react quickly that can build
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:33,535	| IOT078A |	Solutions to account for
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:34,303	| IOT078A |	The flaws
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:35,327	| IOT078A |	Fastest
