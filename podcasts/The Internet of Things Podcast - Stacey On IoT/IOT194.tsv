EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:34,112	| IOT194 |	Alright so for everyone who did not read this New York
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:39,232	| IOT194 |	And story what they did is they looked at location data coming off of your ass
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:40,768	| IOT194 |	So when you
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:43,072	| IOT194 |	Tell an app that can track your location
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:46,400	| IOT194 |	You think that it's doing it for various reasons like geofencing
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:47,680	| IOT194 |	But in reality that dated
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:48,448	| IOT194 |	Can get
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:51,008	| IOT194 |	Told to advertisers and others who are interested in
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:51,776	| IOT194 |	Finding out demographic
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,080	| IOT194 |	The New York Times
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,616	| IOT194 |	Took that and they basically
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,408	| IOT194 |	Look at some of those files
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,968	| IOT194 |	House and saw that they could identify people
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:01,248	| IOT194 |	And they had a lot of quotes
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,784	| IOT194 |	Our people were like I am shot
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:03,552	| IOT194 |	Just drop
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,320	| IOT194 |	Did this happen
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:06,368	| IOT194 |	So old what was it take
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:08,416	| IOT194 |	Well I think I'm glad that
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:11,488	| IOT194 |	Story first of all it you no yes
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,512	| IOT194 |	It's just like you said
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:14,816	| IOT194 |	Your listeners may not be surprised
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:16,096	| IOT194 |	Just like my
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,632	| IOT194 |	Theaters on my personal blog
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:20,960	| IOT194 |	Won't be surprised that this is happening because
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:21,728	| IOT194 |	I think
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:24,288	| IOT194 |	If I remember correctly I've been writing about this for 10 years
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:27,872	| IOT194 |	I think I started writing about data and privacy van
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,408	| IOT194 |	Facebook launch
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,688	| IOT194 |	Beacon
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,712	| IOT194 |	Essentially
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:33,248	| IOT194 |	If you think about it
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,272	| IOT194 |	This is just
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,832	| IOT194 |	An extension of that idea crossed
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:37,856	| IOT194 |	Every little lie
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,392	| IOT194 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,672	| IOT194 |	What is that
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,208	| IOT194 |	New York Times
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:44,000	| IOT194 |	A writing about this
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:44,768	| IOT194 |	After
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:48,096	| IOT194 |	Megan has happened so
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:50,656	| IOT194 |	Long ago these things started happening
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:52,960	| IOT194 |	And so now to talk about it
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,240	| IOT194 |	Is actually taking
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,288	| IOT194 |	Some
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,824	| IOT194 |	Action head is much more difficult
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:01,920	| IOT194 |	Because it's a little too late in Insidious
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,688	| IOT194 |	Attractive
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:03,968	| IOT194 |	Virginia's widely spread
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:05,760	| IOT194 |	I mean they just looked at
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:06,272	| IOT194 |	Summit
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,552	| IOT194 |	You know
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:10,112	| IOT194 |	There's not a day goes by when Piano Bar
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:12,928	| IOT194 |	Reaching some unknown
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:16,768	| IOT194 |	@nina Android store for example as you know
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,815	| IOT194 |	But having absolute unique information
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:22,143	| IOT194 |	The other thing is this has been happening for a long time
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:25,727	| IOT194 |	I'm not focusing on the fact that it is
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,519	| IOT194 |	Chrome extensions which doula
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,031	| IOT194 |	For a long time
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:32,383	| IOT194 |	You remember a long time ago there was a coming call report
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,175	| IOT194 |	And it was a plug-in
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:36,991	| IOT194 |	Legacy
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,295	| IOT194 |	Guess what quotes. DW used
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:42,111	| IOT194 |	Plugins like that
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,135	| IOT194 |	Extensions like that
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,439	| IOT194 |	Nicole
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,463	| IOT194 |	Recedes from
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:48,255	| IOT194 |	Amazon are they can
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,535	| IOT194 |	Figure it out like
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:52,607	| IOT194 |	Just a metadata going on forever
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,143	| IOT194 |	So the question is
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,679	| IOT194 |	What can you do about
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:58,751	| IOT194 |	Looking back we can't do anything about it
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:04:59,775	| IOT194 |	Looking forward weekend
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,567	| IOT194 |	Show my view
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,663	| IOT194 |	You know it's just my opinion is
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:08,223	| IOT194 |	That we should be looking to
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:09,759	| IOT194 |	Very highly regulated
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:12,063	| IOT194 |	All the data around
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:14,879	| IOT194 |	All the applications in privacy around
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:17,183	| IOT194 |	Watch devices rychcik morning our homes
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:19,487	| IOT194 |	They should be higher
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,255	| IOT194 |	Standard
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:22,303	| IOT194 |	Sparkles make Alexa type device
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:26,143	| IOT194 |	Absolutely you the next time you feel I think
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:26,911	| IOT194 |	You know
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:28,959	| IOT194 |	Amazon cannot get a vivid
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:30,751	| IOT194 |	Saying that all we didn't know
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:32,799	| IOT194 |	Looking Glass time for so long
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:33,823	| IOT194 |	Even app
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,383	| IOT194 |	I think Dad should be
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:38,943	| IOT194 |	National
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:40,479	| IOT194 |	Data privacy
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:41,759	| IOT194 |	ICB no
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,039	| IOT194 |	Quality should be
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,575	| IOT194 |	Another amendment to the car
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:47,903	| IOT194 |	Rihanna
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,695	| IOT194 |	Actually beginning to
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:54,303	| IOT194 |	See the merging of the man and machine have to change
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:55,327	| IOT194 |	NBA
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:56,607	| IOT194 |	And the cost
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:58,143	| IOT194 |	Execution has to kind of
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:03,007	| IOT194 |	Adaptive at the time and it needs to be in my mind around this notional
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:05,311	| IOT194 |	What color person data is invalid
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:06,335	| IOT194 |	Can be used
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:09,407	| IOT194 |	Right now all our personal data has no sense of pain
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:12,479	| IOT194 |	It is basically up for grabs
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,503	| IOT194 |	And for Abused
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:16,319	| IOT194 |	Nina from Manas air down to all the nefarious
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:20,159	| IOT194 |	Latest very little light control
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:23,999	| IOT194 |	What are our rights as Citizens
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,791	| IOT194 |	Okay so that's going forward
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:28,607	| IOT194 |	I don't know if I should be a
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:32,191	| IOT194 |	I'm not a constitutional scholar but that feels like
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:33,471	| IOT194 |	Such a high hurdle to pass
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,007	| IOT194 |	Because you have to get
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:36,287	| IOT194 |	So many states
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:40,383	| IOT194 |	I do think there are things we can do retroactively
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:40,895	| IOT194 |	2
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:42,431	| IOT194 |	Help with
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,711	| IOT194 |	Privacy in apps
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,015	| IOT194 |	With our devices that were wearing
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,575	| IOT194 |	Filtering out or data places
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:50,367	| IOT194 |	So what would you say
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:52,927	| IOT194 |	I mean I look at things like apple and their privacy
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:59,583	| IOT194 |	Even things like the loophole disease
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:02,399	| IOT194 |	Apps are explained is the fact that
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:05,215	| IOT194 |	When you give permissions in an app
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,239	| IOT194 |	Holistic
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:08,543	| IOT194 |	Permissions they're not telling you everything you're doing
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,055	| IOT194 |	I think
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,407	| IOT194 |	Popeyes
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:14,943	| IOT194 |	50 Constitutional Amendment
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:17,759	| IOT194 |	It if you don't start the conversation now
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,551	| IOT194 |	20 years from now
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:25,439	| IOT194 |	I think it did it needs to be
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,719	| IOT194 |	Some
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,743	| IOT194 |	Conversation with diesel
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:28,767	| IOT194 |	Today
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,327	| IOT194 |	Saying that enough
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:35,423	| IOT194 |	I have all the answers but I think your feet are smart people.
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,191	| IOT194 |	In the market today
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:39,775	| IOT194 |	Because going forward it would not just be
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,055	| IOT194 |	Largest yacht
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:43,103	| IOT194 |	Devices you can be

EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:48,735	| IOT194 |	Which is it
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:52,319	| IOT194 |	Verbena robot assistants all these things
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,855	| IOT194 |	Wales become part of society
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,135	| IOT194 |	They are part of
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:58,207	| IOT194 |	Society I think of them as inanimate object
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:01,279	| IOT194 |	Text but they are sending data they are translating us
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:06,911	| IOT194 |	So we need to kind of thinking about these things
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,191	| IOT194 |	It's not just privacy
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,215	| IOT194 |	A larger
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,031	| IOT194 |	Stop
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,335	| IOT194 |	Insurance
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,615	| IOT194 |	Companies decide
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:17,151	| IOT194 |	That you don't deserve insurance
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:21,247	| IOT194 |	Senior master go out because you forgot to wear your
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:25,599	| IOT194 |	That is like humans
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:30,463	| IOT194 |	It's all carpet rights and what they can do with the data
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:32,511	| IOT194 |	No one is actually talking about
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:36,351	| IOT194 |	Peace about this about 2 years ago
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:36,863	| IOT194 |	What's call
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,703	| IOT194 |	Service no terms of trust
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,471	| IOT194 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,007	| IOT194 |	Basically actually eggs
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,799	| IOT194 |	Explaining to people
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,127	| IOT194 |	Howard this week
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:48,895	| IOT194 |	Collector
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:50,431	| IOT194 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:55,039	| IOT194 |	No one wants to do that because the lawyer have put so much
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,343	| IOT194 |	Yuno constraints around
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:01,951	| IOT194 |	I don't think it's just the lawyers I would argue that the easiest way to make a buck
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:04,511	| IOT194 |	Is to sell information to marketing
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:08,351	| IOT194 |	And I think that's a really big challenge
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:10,399	| IOT194 |	When they're trying to do something
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:12,447	| IOT194 |	Right
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,727	| IOT194 |	Maybe they've got investors
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:14,751	| IOT194 |	Who am I
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,311	| IOT194 |	It's very easy to give that
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:23,455	| IOT194 |	I mean that is definitely market for data looking Facebook and Google.
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:26,527	| IOT194 |	Facebook Tina Carter used to abuse
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:29,599	| IOT194 |	Privacy and data it continues to be used to knock
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,391	| IOT194 |	Civic Society
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,695	| IOT194 |	We can send a few more hours
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:38,559	| IOT194 |	Registering
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:41,375	| IOT194 |	Exactly the same thing
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:44,447	| IOT194 |	This is my whole point
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:51,103	| IOT194 |	Talk about the fact that
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,127	| IOT194 |	Dangers of bleach
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:55,199	| IOT194 |	Marriott 500 million
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:58,015	| IOT194 |	The cost to a human the time
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,295	| IOT194 |	Cosme
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:01,855	| IOT194 |	Protect my son
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,135	| IOT194 |	How is Maddie are going to
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:07,487	| IOT194 |	There was just a government Accounting Office
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,279	| IOT194 |	Report on the Experian app
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:13,119	| IOT194 |	And they were like this was so eminently affordable
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,399	| IOT194 |	And if you read that report it
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,703	| IOT194 |	Joe Ingram
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:21,311	| IOT194 |	These guys basically had and collected all of this
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,103	| IOT194 |	Some of their
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,871	| IOT194 |	Coliseum
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:24,895	| IOT194 |	They were aware
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,223	| IOT194 |	Good Security in place
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:28,991	| IOT194 |	End
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:29,503	| IOT194 |	They just really
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:34,623	| IOT194 |	Jackie and I think this is where I feel that if you have us
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:36,671	| IOT194 |	Stronger
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,951	| IOT194 |	Privacy Amendment
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,487	| IOT194 |	Answer the call
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,119	| IOT194 |	You know I like to see
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:47,935	| IOT194 |	The other US government impose like a 5 billion dollar
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,031	| IOT194 |	And I think the next one
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,823	| IOT194 |	Will be like overall we can't do that
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:55,359	| IOT194 |	Impose
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:56,895	| IOT194 |	Find
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:59,967	| IOT194 |	The Bible in dollars on. In the brain
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:01,759	| IOT194 |	Using diesel
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:04,319	| IOT194 |	So the environment pollution is
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:06,879	| IOT194 |	Solution
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,159	| IOT194 |	Data privacy leaves
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:13,279	| IOT194 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:15,839	| IOT194 |	From that standpoint needs to be regulated just like
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,631	| IOT194 |	Yarn company.
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:25,823	| IOT194 |	Automobile driving regulations
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,431	| IOT194 |	I'm just say
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:34,527	| IOT194 |	These are trying to do something about our government doesn't do anything about
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,319	| IOT194 |	Okay so you're
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,599	| IOT194 |	GDP
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:39,135	| IOT194 |	Do you want something
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:41,695	| IOT194 |	Stronger
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:45,535	| IOT194 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:47,071	| IOT194 |	Business
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,351	| IOT194 |	Needs to happen baby
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,375	| IOT194 |	Is people
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:51,935	| IOT194 |	Netherlands government
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:52,959	| IOT194 |	I think there's a lot of
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:56,031	| IOT194 |	Partizan will have to be taken care of
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:58,591	| IOT194 |	Gdpr is a good starting point for Europe
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,639	| IOT194 |	I think you would have to come up with
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,407	| IOT194 |	Changing battery
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:04,991	| IOT194 |	Okay and that actually ties into and we
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:08,319	| IOT194 |	We kind of talked about the things I wanted to talk about with Google CEO
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:08,831	| IOT194 |	Testifying for
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:13,439	| IOT194 |	They talked about algorithmic bias they talked about the data breaches
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:16,511	| IOT194 |	And what I didn't see was this kind of conversation
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:20,351	| IOT194 |	About what we need to do in privacy in till
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,119	| IOT194 |	Constitutional Amendment
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,239	| IOT194 |	Capricious
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,543	| IOT194 |	I think the basic tenets would be.
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:31,871	| IOT194 |	Companies like Google and Facebook should not be at the
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,919	| IOT194 |	For the conversation at all
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,223	| IOT194 |	Okay so you lost your seat at the table
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,759	| IOT194 |	They have
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:39,807	| IOT194 |	Whether it is
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,391	| IOT194 |	I would go as far as
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,671	| IOT194 |	Including Amazon in
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,999	| IOT194 |	Companies of flights
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:49,535	| IOT194 |	I would say that as
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,559	| IOT194 |	Access point
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:52,095	| IOT194 |	The Trust on these
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:52,863	| IOT194 |	To advance
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,143	| IOT194 |	Mega platform
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,959	| IOT194 |	Alarm concern is you
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:59,263	| IOT194 |	I assume the worst before
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,031	| IOT194 |	Anyway
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:03,615	| IOT194 |	When it comes to Google
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,127	| IOT194 |	How to say taxi
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,431	| IOT194 |	I would throw in
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:09,759	| IOT194 |	I would throw in companies that we don't even think about
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:14,623	| IOT194 |	Actually have a lot of information and I would also think about things like
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:18,463	| IOT194 |	Kirby feels like can I just put my data in an escrow somewhere like a last
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,767	| IOT194 |	And I can use that
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:22,047	| IOT194 |	Retail stores
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,071	| IOT194 |	Hotels in
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:26,399	| IOT194 |	Things like that but maybe the solution there is really just tired
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:28,447	| IOT194 |	Those guys to make it
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:31,007	| IOT194 |	Play there's nothing which teaches you a lesson.
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:34,335	| IOT194 |	Five Below
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:38,687	| IOT194 |	A lot of money and security
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,455	| IOT194 |	Ming tombs
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:42,527	| IOT194 |	Everybody spending money on making things
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,039	| IOT194 |	Sakura
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,855	| IOT194 |	I think this is all nonsense to say that
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:48,671	| IOT194 |	This cannot be done as most of these people
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:49,439	| IOT194 |	Don't spend the money
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:54,559	| IOT194 |	Don't know there's an idea that you can't ever be security
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,327	| IOT194 |	Always be
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,607	| IOT194 |	You have to upgrade your sister
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:14:00,703	| IOT194 |	You have to start somewhere actually care about security
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:03,263	| IOT194 |	And I think that's the key thing is like
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,799	| IOT194 |	The idea that you
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,103	| IOT194 |	Xperience Fitness
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:12,479	| IOT194 |	That's all they business is number one thing they need to do is four-pack data
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:14,015	| IOT194 |	Facebook forgot say
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,295	| IOT194 |	They have a deal
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,319	| IOT194 |	The whole business is
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,183	| IOT194 |	In English
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:22,207	| IOT194 |	Seriously
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,487	| IOT194 |	How are you
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:26,047	| IOT194 |	Talk about dereliction of Duty
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,583	| IOT194 |	Do you have to be
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,119	| IOT194 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:32,703	| IOT194 |	Sandra said we were going to talk about the app
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:35,007	| IOT194 |	You know what apple and
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,567	| IOT194 |	To make it mandatory
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:39,359	| IOT194 |	Perhaps just explained
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:42,175	| IOT194 |	Policies and data collection in a simple English
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:45,759	| IOT194 |	In plain English that is actually one of the things that we talked about
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,831	| IOT194 |	Digital standard reference
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:50,623	| IOT194 |	Currency around iot devices
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:52,159	| IOT194 |	Components there is
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,975	| IOT194 |	Aceite in English
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:57,535	| IOT194 |	I think that requires a lot of effort
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,047	| IOT194 |	Shimmer
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:00,607	| IOT194 |	The media needs to be
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,887	| IOT194 |	We have to get better at explaining
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:02,911	| IOT194 |	Things to people in
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,215	| IOT194 |	So
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:05,727	| IOT194 |	So we'll see
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:08,287	| IOT194 |	Next story I picked this because
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:09,823	| IOT194 |	Don't know
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:12,383	| IOT194 |	It's like the 18th time as somebody's video cameras been
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:15,967	| IOT194 |	This is a story from USA Today and someone
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:17,759	| IOT194 |	The camera had been
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:20,063	| IOT194 |	I went into this
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,855	| IOT194 |	Because it was Ness
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:24,927	| IOT194 |	NASDAQ actually has a really good
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:25,695	| IOT194 |	Google yes
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:26,975	| IOT194 |	Google
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,487	| IOT194 |	Alphabet
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:29,791	| IOT194 |	They have really good
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:33,119	| IOT194 |	Devices they do a lot of things
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:37,727	| IOT194 |	You have to change your password
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:41,567	| IOT194 |	Make sure that your device is not behaving weirdly and sending things to China
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,591	| IOT194 |	Is there supposed to
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,615	| IOT194 |	And so
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:45,151	| IOT194 |	I was surprised to see this
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:48,735	| IOT194 |	And what happened it looks like if somebody was using the same password
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:50,015	| IOT194 |	In multiple places in there
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,063	| IOT194 |	So 1
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:55,647	| IOT194 |	Happy stories are like panties so insecure
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:57,695	| IOT194 |	Really this isn't an iot device thing this is Jay
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:59,231	| IOT194 |	Or password practice
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:00,511	| IOT194 |	But
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,815	| IOT194 |	Nest actually pointed out that
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,839	| IOT194 |	Hey this is a
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:04,863	| IOT194 |	Good reason to
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,887	| IOT194 |	I have to factor out there
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:07,935	| IOT194 |	Haitian on your device is especially
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:08,959	| IOT194 |	Cameras
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,775	| IOT194 |	You iot companies that
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:15,615	| IOT194 |	So how this person had to factor
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,639	| IOT194 |	The camera wouldn't have been
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:20,479	| IOT194 |	And I would basically say hey device makers
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,015	| IOT194 |	Especially for
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:25,855	| IOT194 |	Matt amazing speakers things that really have a presence in
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,367	| IOT194 |	People's homes
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,903	| IOT194 |	Camera audio
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:31,743	| IOT194 |	Lock that down on my echo device
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:34,559	| IOT194 |	Yeah I mean do I disagree with more
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:37,631	| IOT194 |	I think
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:40,703	| IOT194 |	Idea of two-factor Authentication
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,471	| IOT194 |	NIU
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:45,055	| IOT194 |	Usable two-factor authentication in front of a human being
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,335	| IOT194 |	And they have no idea what you're
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:49,151	| IOT194 |	Play hockey at the show my mom house
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:51,711	| IOT194 |	Once she saw it she knew how it works
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:59,647	| IOT194 |	What time to gation and I think this is the biggest challenge we have is the technology
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,695	| IOT194 |	Has become so complex
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:03,231	| IOT194 |	And so pervasive
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:09,119	| IOT194 |	Ss80 but I mean the company than the brand
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:11,679	| IOT194 |	Taking the time to explain 2
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:14,239	| IOT194 |	Xi'an customers like what they can do
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:15,519	| IOT194 |	They should be doing
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,799	| IOT194 |	And everything is very different
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:20,127	| IOT194 |	Just be nice like by techies for tacky
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:26,015	| IOT194 |	Even if you explain it
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:26,783	| IOT194 |	It is okay
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:30,367	| IOT194 |	You're like I want to get to this I want to set this up I don't want to mess with it
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:32,415	| IOT194 |	I will say that I've seen some really in
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,183	| IOT194 |	Interesting incentives
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,975	| IOT194 |	Curso MailChimp office
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:37,535	| IOT194 |	Doctor
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:39,583	| IOT194 |	Fortnite did two-factor Authentication
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:41,887	| IOT194 |	Free dance
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,655	| IOT194 |	All right
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:44,959	| IOT194 |	Special dance whatever
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:47,263	| IOT194 |	So you know if Nest said hey
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:51,615	| IOT194 |	Two-factor will give you a month or maybe two months of the subscription
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:53,151	| IOT194 |	I think people would be like
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:54,943	| IOT194 |	I'll do it
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:56,479	| IOT194 |	Maybe
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:01,855	| IOT194 |	Plastic idea
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,367	| IOT194 |	I think
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:06,719	| IOT194 |	You know everybody should do it like at the more security we can provide
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,231	| IOT194 |	I like
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:11,839	| IOT194 |	Mostly Apple ecosystems
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:13,887	| IOT194 |	I use face ID
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,935	| IOT194 |	You don't like fingerprints and
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:21,823	| IOT194 |	Still time to get devices I kind of see how they made it all the work release
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:25,151	| IOT194 |	So I appreciate that
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,943	| IOT194 |	Knox
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:30,527	| IOT194 |	That's true and there are ways to say hey
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,295	| IOT194 |	What devices are in
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:34,111	| IOT194 |	Another op
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:35,647	| IOT194 |	To see that
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:41,279	| IOT194 |	Okay. But I think you should keep writing about it I think that's
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:44,607	| IOT194 |	Give me a writer on iot
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:46,399	| IOT194 |	It's your job to kind of sad
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:48,959	| IOT194 |	A little bit of a standard motor standard form
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:54,591	| IOT194 |	Because media is not doing this then the companies will pay no tax
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:57,663	| IOT194 |	There's no incentive to spend an extra dollar on
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:00,223	| IOT194 |	You see that is Ole Miss still the side of me
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:00,991	| IOT194 |	My story isn't it
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,271	| IOT194 |	Spend years I am not

EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:35,199	| IOT194 |	Notable mostly because this is the only place you can get Z-Wave stuff right now
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,479	| IOT194 |	Silicon labs
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:40,063	| IOT194 |	Sigma and so basically next iteration better
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:41,599	| IOT194 |	Securities lower power
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,111	| IOT194 |	Pretty standard

EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:44,064	| IOT194 |	I don't agree with that ass
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:44,576	| IOT194 |	Aspect
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:47,648	| IOT194 |	I can't divorce the technology from the person but in this case
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:49,952	| IOT194 |	Smart person
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:53,536	| IOT194 |	Let's talk about backpack
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:54,304	| IOT194 |	Coyote backpack
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,352	| IOT194 |	Because
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:22:00,704	| IOT194 |	I thought this was a great story and misfits and we talked a lot about Smart Home
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,216	| IOT194 |	Surveillance
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:06,848	| IOT194 |	And if we can grab
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:08,640	| IOT194 |	Places we can improve the world
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:10,176	| IOT194 |	And that's really Pollyanna
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:11,968	| IOT194 |	I do think
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:13,760	| IOT194 |	Be able to understand what's happening with
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:15,552	| IOT194 |	Culture
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:18,112	| IOT194 |	Temperatures around plants
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:19,392	| IOT194 |	Is a really big deal in Amarillo
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:22,208	| IOT194 |	So
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,488	| IOT194 |	Pretty cool
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:28,864	| IOT194 |	Data to educating farm and garden
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:32,704	| IOT194 |	At some point
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:35,520	| IOT194 |	Utopian do you get to view
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:39,616	| IOT194 |	Okay well we're not going to do ads
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:41,408	| IOT194 |	Is the University of Washington
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,176	| IOT194 |	His dying
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:44,480	| IOT194 |	Steve
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:47,040	| IOT194 |	That is true we have to start separating
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:53,952	| IOT194 |	Chrissy ads on Facebook
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:54,976	| IOT194 |	And Google
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:58,560	| IOT194 |	To be fair the ads on the podcast really transparent hand
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:00,096	| IOT194 |	I'm not taking any information for me
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,936	| IOT194 |	So this is at the University of
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:07,008	| IOT194 |	You're really adorable they're little
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:09,824	| IOT194 |	Backpacks are iot sensors they put on
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,360	| IOT194 |	Actual bees
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:12,640	| IOT194 |	Is that a yes
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:17,248	| IOT194 |	I have to double-check this cuz I'm like peanut robot bees right no there
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:18,784	| IOT194 |	Tiny little sensor
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:20,832	| IOT194 |	For real B
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:24,928	| IOT194 |	So yeah I'm like indecision to research thing
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:28,000	| IOT194 |	These things weigh a hundred to micrograms
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,792	| IOT194 |	So very very tiny and I guess
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,072	| IOT194 |	These are really strong
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:32,864	| IOT194 |	I'm not sure about
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:34,144	| IOT194 |	The radio
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:34,912	| IOT194 |	That was the biggest
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:38,752	| IOT194 |	Unsurprisingly the limit here is
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:39,776	| IOT194 |	Honeycomb
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:43,104	| IOT194 |	Bet that is it is a mess
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:47,712	| IOT194 |	I don't know what they're going to call it but
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,224	| IOT194 |	It's
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:50,528	| IOT194 |	Somebody I can make that joke might as well
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:51,552	| IOT194 |	There you go
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:55,904	| IOT194 |	So I thought this was cool in the show notes for anyone who wants to watch the video on it
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,952	| IOT194 |	Is adorable and
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:02,048	| IOT194 |	Again better information on the world around us is going to help us live in it better
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:06,656	| IOT194 |	I can just say IBS mean exactly 10 years since I met you
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:08,704	| IOT194 |	And you are
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:11,008	| IOT194 |	Way more Narnia now that you are
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:16,640	| IOT194 |	JustFab
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,664	| IOT194 |	Story Piccolo
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:19,456	| IOT194 |	Has me inside yeah
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:21,504	| IOT194 |	You still there
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:22,784	| IOT194 |	Nothing is change
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:24,576	| IOT194 |	Just a little bit more and dance
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:28,160	| IOT194 |	Alright this is also super nerdy but this is nerdy more in a
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:30,208	| IOT194 |	Economics way
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:33,280	| IOT194 |	Which is a company that does Cloud Server
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:37,376	| IOT194 |	Surprises they finally announced
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:38,912	| IOT194 |	And you guys
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:44,288	| IOT194 |	I'm not going to get into like what the heck serverless is but think about it as if you have a
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:45,056	| IOT194 |	Man that you need
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:45,824	| IOT194 |	2
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:50,688	| IOT194 |	Give like your sensors like I saw something now I'm going to go
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:52,224	| IOT194 |	Is super common in the
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:56,576	| IOT194 |	Serverless it allows you to spin up a server in the cloud that you
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,344	| IOT194 |	You can talk to it
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:25:00,160	| IOT194 |	Trigger that command without actually having that running all the
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,440	| IOT194 |	Which is
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,720	| IOT194 |	Prosthetics
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,512	| IOT194 |	So this is part of any
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,280	| IOT194 |	Expanded
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,048	| IOT194 |	Functional program
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,608	| IOT194 |	AWS Hadoop
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:09,888	| IOT194 |	4 years with Lambda
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,936	| IOT194 |	Google has it with iot function
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:13,472	| IOT194 |	Microsoft has something called
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:13,984	| IOT194 |	Azure
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:16,544	| IOT194 |	And now pivotal has it
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,312	| IOT194 |	Which is
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:20,640	| IOT194 |	About darn time because this is be platform for
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,408	| IOT194 |	Enterprises
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:22,432	| IOT194 |	Is when they're trying to build this
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:27,040	| IOT194 |	So I have no idea if you want to talk about service soon but if you have something
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:30,624	| IOT194 |	You know
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,440	| IOT194 |	Adventure
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,464	| IOT194 |	The whole cloud is like
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:37,792	| IOT194 |	Basically abstracting resources and
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:40,608	| IOT194 |	Making them available when you need them so
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:42,400	| IOT194 |	10 years
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:44,192	| IOT194 |	You know 15 years after
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:46,752	| IOT194 |	About 15 about 14 years after Amazon
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:49,312	| IOT194 |	Stocks that evolution
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:55,456	| IOT194 |	AWS cloud
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:58,784	| IOT194 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:25:59,808	| IOT194 |	I'll Trust You Man
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:02,880	| IOT194 |	So either way I think this is just the next evolution
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:05,952	| IOT194 |	You know he had to have made an investment in a company called
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:06,720	| IOT194 |	Solo
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,024	| IOT194 |	Richardson's Ice Computing space vs timeout
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:14,912	| IOT194 |	Maybe I'll profile
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:16,704	| IOT194 |	Talk to the phone.
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,472	| IOT194 |	She's pretty amazing
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:21,056	| IOT194 |	Alright amazing people
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:22,592	| IOT194 |	She's also
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:27,200	| IOT194 |	But I do believe that the edge Computing is
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:28,736	| IOT194 |	Talk about it
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:30,784	| IOT194 |	What timezone yashow Eureka Nevada
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:32,064	| IOT194 |	I think a lot of people
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:34,112	| IOT194 |	Understanding
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:37,696	| IOT194 |	Take me to be going forward and I think
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:42,304	| IOT194 |	As you see that become more and more prevalent and you'll see more and more
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:43,072	| IOT194 |	Ideas
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:44,864	| IOT194 |	New ideas emoji
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:45,888	| IOT194 |	Cloud 19
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:47,936	| IOT194 |	Sara Lance is going to be right.
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:49,216	| IOT194 |	No pun intended
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:51,264	| IOT194 |	Are you sure cuz you did bring us
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:51,776	| IOT194 |	Bee honeycomb
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:54,336	| IOT194 |	Earlier but this one was like not intended
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:59,712	| IOT194 |	Honeycomb mesh that have funny on come on
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,552	| IOT194 |	Okay and yes
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:05,600	| IOT194 |	I was actually this week at an edge Computing thing
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:08,160	| IOT194 |	I'll probably write about in the newsletter I will not
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:09,696	| IOT194 |	Deal with this now because
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:11,744	| IOT194 |	We have to go to our voicemail
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:14,816	| IOT194 |	Without Kevin here I'm intrigued to see
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:16,352	| IOT194 |	You don't really want to do this
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:17,888	| IOT194 |	Alright so
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:20,960	| IOT194 |	We take these questions from our listeners hotline

EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:33,248	| IOT194 |	And ask
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,016	| IOT194 |	Question
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,040	| IOT194 |	We take a winner every month

EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:45,792	| IOT194 |	And it's certified to work with Amazon
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:49,888	| IOT194 |	Ignored all of our conversations about privacy and
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:50,656	| IOT194 |	You do want Amazon
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:55,264	| IOT194 |	Upgrade your smartphone with the safety simplicity
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:55,776	| IOT194 |	InStyle
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:59,616	| IOT194 |	Voicemail is from Scott who is a SmartThings
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:00,640	| IOT194 |	User
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:02,432	| IOT194 |	Practice car
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:05,760	| IOT194 |	Stacy and Kevin this is Scott in Houston
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:08,576	| IOT194 |	I've been using the family cell phones as presence sensor
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:09,856	| IOT194 |	Control automation
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,136	| IOT194 |	Samsung smart
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:14,464	| IOT194 |	I really wanted a way to make my car reliable
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:16,000	| IOT194 |	Presents to buy salsa
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,536	| IOT194 |	It would be nice to be able to
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:20,096	| IOT194 |	Track the location of my car and initiate
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:21,632	| IOT194 |	At home
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:23,680	| IOT194 |	Based on one or more geofence
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:24,448	| IOT194 |	This location
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:25,728	| IOT194 |	What is your recommendation
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,752	| IOT194 |	4 pi to do this
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:28,288	| IOT194 |	So Scott
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:29,312	| IOT194 |	The answer is
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:29,824	| IOT194 |	Actually really simple
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:32,128	| IOT194 |	And depending on how much money you want to spend
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:37,248	| IOT194 |	So I did this for a long time I put a SmartThings
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:38,016	| IOT194 |	Presence detectors
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:42,112	| IOT194 |	Is it a zigbee or Z-Wave sensor that just basically says
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:44,160	| IOT194 |	The range of the Hub right now
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:49,792	| IOT194 |	I used it actually to tell me when my husband was coming home so I can run downstairs and watch the dishes tonight
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:53,888	| IOT194 |	So that is about $20
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:56,960	| IOT194 |	Cheap option or you can go with the fancy hundred-dollar Ops
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:57,728	| IOT194 |	Which is a
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:58,752	| IOT194 |	Acellular
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:00,800	| IOT194 |	Connection to detect your car wherever
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:01,568	| IOT194 |	It is
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:03,360	| IOT194 |	And this is $99
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:05,408	| IOT194 |	And you will have to pay US Cellular
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:07,200	| IOT194 |	Subscription fees so you're going to
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:08,992	| IOT194 |	Really really really want to track
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:10,016	| IOT194 |	If you're going to do that
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:10,784	| IOT194 |	And
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:13,856	| IOT194 |	If you happen to have a Subaru or a Tesla
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:15,136	| IOT194 |	There is actually a
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:16,672	| IOT194 |	A program called
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:18,464	| IOT194 |	It does have a monthly fee but it's
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:21,280	| IOT194 |	It's cheaper
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:24,096	| IOT194 |	And we get into your house you can actually control your
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,120	| IOT194 |	SmartThings stuff
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:25,632	| IOT194 |	From
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:27,680	| IOT194 |	Options for youth
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:32,032	| IOT194 |	I mean you could buy a iPhone for like 50 bucks
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:34,080	| IOT194 |	Find my phone
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,616	| IOT194 |	That doesn't coordinate with SmartThings
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:40,736	| IOT194 |	I'm just saying there are other options
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:42,272	| IOT194 |	Simple life hacks
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:47,392	| IOT194 |	So yes there
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:48,416	| IOT194 |	All right
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:52,256	| IOT194 |	We have reached the end I want to say a big thank you thank you old
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:57,376	| IOT194 |	And stay tuned for Bianca Wylie we're going to be talking about smart cities
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:58,144	| IOT194 |	Including
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:59,680	| IOT194 |	Alphabet sidewalk labs

EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:02,752	| IOT194 |	So expect more updated privacy
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:05,056	| IOT194 |	How to be a better Citizen and now
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:07,872	| IOT194 |	What do a word from our sponsor
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:11,712	| IOT194 |	Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:17,856	| IOT194 |	From our sponsor digicert and I have Mike Nelson
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,136	| IOT194 |	Security here to talk to you
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:20,928	| IOT194 |	Hi Mike how are you
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:22,464	| IOT194 |	Hey Stacy good how are you doing
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:24,256	| IOT194 |	Excellent all right
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,536	| IOT194 |	Let's get this started by
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:26,816	| IOT194 |	It's a little bit about
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:30,656	| IOT194 |	We are the world's leading provider of
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:31,424	| IOT194 |	Scalable pki
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:36,032	| IOT194 |	For identity encryption and we use these Solutions
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:38,080	| IOT194 |	Or web servers for Enterprise
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:40,128	| IOT194 |	Security as well as iot devices
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:41,152	| IOT194 |	Last week Utah
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,688	| IOT194 |	News about this survey that
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:46,272	| IOT194 |	And how the respondents were divided in the category
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:48,064	| IOT194 |	There's a top-tier
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:51,392	| IOT194 |	With organizations who demonstrated more of a Mastery peyote
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:52,928	| IOT194 |	Security and a bottom tier
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:54,720	| IOT194 |	Which were organizations that were released
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:55,488	| IOT194 |	Struggling to implement
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:58,560	| IOT194 |	Can you tell me more about the differences
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:30:59,840	| IOT194 |	The survey found between these two
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:05,728	| IOT194 |	Yeah we asked the respondent about the iot security incidents that their organization
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:07,264	| IOT194 |	Inside experience from the past
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:09,824	| IOT194 |	After years and the difference between the top and bottom
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:10,848	| IOT194 |	Unmistakable
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:14,432	| IOT194 |	The company struggling most with iot implementation or the bottom
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:16,992	| IOT194 |	We're much more likely to get hit with coyotes
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:17,504	| IOT194 |	Security answer
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:19,552	| IOT194 |	Every one of them
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:20,832	| IOT194 |	The bottom tier responding
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:23,136	| IOT194 |	Experience in iot related
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:25,184	| IOT194 |	Security incident over the past 2 years
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:27,232	| IOT194 |	Compared to just 32%
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:28,000	| IOT194 |	The Top Gear
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:29,792	| IOT194 |	The bottom tier were also
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:30,560	| IOT194 |	More than
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:31,328	| IOT194 |	6 *
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:32,096	| IOT194 |	More likely
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:34,400	| IOT194 |	I have experience in OT tonight
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:35,680	| IOT194 |	Service attack more than
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:36,960	| IOT194 |	6 times likely to
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:37,984	| IOT194 |	Experience
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:42,592	| IOT194 |	Access to the device they were also much more likely to experience data breaches
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,384	| IOT194 |	And 4 and 1/2
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:45,152	| IOT194 |	X
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:46,176	| IOT194 |	As likely to occur
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:47,456	| IOT194 |	Experience malware
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:49,504	| IOT194 |	Ransomware attacks

EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:52,576	| IOT194 |	Shows that
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:55,648	| IOT194 |	Those organizations that are working to master iot
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:57,184	| IOT194 |	Security are much better off
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:58,208	| IOT194 |	Wow that's
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:01,024	| IOT194 |	What were the top tier organizations
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:01,792	| IOT194 |	Doing that letter
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,352	| IOT194 |	We are still
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,632	| IOT194 |	Talk to your organization
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:07,424	| IOT194 |	What they were doing that was leaving them
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:10,240	| IOT194 |	Successful and their response is really I don't
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,008	| IOT194 |	People shock you
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:14,080	| IOT194 |	Are the basic blocking and tackling security
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:15,360	| IOT194 |	Practices things like
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,640	| IOT194 |	Encryption of data
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:18,432	| IOT194 |	Open transit in that rest

EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:24,064	| IOT194 |	Performing risk assessments on their devices and putting them play Skillet
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:25,856	| IOT194 |	Security Solutions so that there's
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:26,624	| IOT194 |	Security
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:29,696	| IOT194 |	Scale not just for what they have today but for what they'll have in

EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:16,544	| IOT194 |	Day-to-day life
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:18,336	| IOT194 |	What does it mean to be all of those
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:21,920	| IOT194 |	I need a lotion
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:27,040	| IOT194 |	Friend it's writing and thinking about data technology procurement
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:31,648	| IOT194 |	And how those things work together for government policy and in the tech reset Canada world
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:32,928	| IOT194 |	Advocating
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:36,256	| IOT194 |	For public good in the Innovation economy which means looking at
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:38,560	| IOT194 |	What is happening in technology how its effect
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:39,328	| IOT194 |	Our lives and
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,376	| IOT194 |	Our economies
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:42,144	| IOT194 |	Insertive
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:43,168	| IOT194 |	Understanding how we can
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:43,936	| IOT194 |	Participate
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:45,216	| IOT194 |	And make sure it is happening
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:48,032	| IOT194 |	With as much public good involved as possible
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:49,568	| IOT194 |	We talked a lot about
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:50,592	| IOT194 |	Smart cities
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:53,920	| IOT194 |	On the show and really any time at the Internet of Things is
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:56,224	| IOT194 |	And what we don't usually talk
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:57,760	| IOT194 |	Talk about is this idea that
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:59,040	| IOT194 |	We are bringing
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:00,576	| IOT194 |	Private companies in
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:02,624	| IOT194 |	To gather data
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:04,416	| IOT194 |	To analyze data for cities
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:06,208	| IOT194 |	And in a lot of cases
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:08,512	| IOT194 |	There's a big tension between
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:10,048	| IOT194 |	What is civil government
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:12,352	| IOT194 |	So asking citizens what they want telling them
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:14,400	| IOT194 |	And bringing these private
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:15,936	| IOT194 |	Companies in to do
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:20,288	| IOT194 |	What hasn't historically been the role of government but is it kind of like an entirely new role
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:23,360	| IOT194 |	And that tension is something that
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:24,128	| IOT194 |	I don't think we have
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:26,176	| IOT194 |	Policies for I don't even think we talked about it
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:27,968	| IOT194 |	So I'd love to get your
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:29,248	| IOT194 |	Take on
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:30,528	| IOT194 |	What the challenge isn't
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:32,064	| IOT194 |	Tensions are between Smart City
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:33,856	| IOT194 |	Please and governments and citizens
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:35,392	| IOT194 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,160	| IOT194 |	Yeah and I think
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:38,208	| IOT194 |	What's really surfacing
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:42,048	| IOT194 |	In the Smart City discussions right now is that we don't have
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:43,072	| IOT194 |	Great mechanism
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:44,864	| IOT194 |	Democratically in
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:46,656	| IOT194 |	Formed technology policies
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:47,680	| IOT194 |	We have
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:51,008	| IOT194 |	Historically methods to engage people in urban
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:53,056	| IOT194 |	Planning and even that isn't great
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:54,336	| IOT194 |	It's not a very inclusive
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:55,616	| IOT194 |	The process is not accept
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:56,384	| IOT194 |	The bullet ends
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:58,688	| IOT194 |	To be at least in Toronto the domain of
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:34:59,968	| IOT194 |	White homeowners
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:02,016	| IOT194 |	Urban planning and public counsel
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:05,600	| IOT194 |	Station is already problematic now in terms of how we're going to bring technology
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:06,880	| IOT194 |	Into that the history of
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:10,208	| IOT194 |	Procurement of Technology definitely did not involve public
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:10,976	| IOT194 |	Consultation
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:13,024	| IOT194 |	Right like it's operational for a city
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:14,560	| IOT194 |	If he needs to buy.
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:15,328	| IOT194 |	Technology
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:16,864	| IOT194 |	That's something that's done
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:17,888	| IOT194 |	Tamina weather
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:19,936	| IOT194 |	The CIA
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:21,728	| IOT194 |	Depending on the city but it's
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:22,752	| IOT194 |	Not something that you
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:25,056	| IOT194 |	You go out to the public and say hey were thinking of
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:26,336	| IOT194 |	Procuring some technology
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:28,640	| IOT194 |	What's happening I think is as these two things
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:32,480	| IOT194 |	Come together as how he use that technology actually impact
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:34,784	| IOT194 |	How you're using urban planning tools
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,576	| IOT194 |	Another
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:38,624	| IOT194 |	We don't have a way to have
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:40,160	| IOT194 |	Discussions about this in this
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:42,464	| IOT194 |	Standard public consultation method
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:43,232	| IOT194 |	That we had
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:49,376	| IOT194 |	For years and years and years and so this is surfacing this real tension here in that there's an oversized info
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:53,472	| IOT194 |	I'm coming from the technology side right now because it's not just
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:54,752	| IOT194 |	Selling software that
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:55,520	| IOT194 |	Support
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:57,056	| IOT194 |	A standard City operation
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:58,592	| IOT194 |	Now it's beginning to
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:04,736	| IOT194 |	Potentially influence and drive them and the outputs of some of that maybe data or maybe they don't know
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:08,576	| IOT194 |	And these are things that we really need to understand like
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:11,136	| IOT194 |	Who's receiving those things how are they being used
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:12,160	| IOT194 |	And I think
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:14,208	| IOT194 |	One thing that is really important
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:16,256	| IOT194 |	Products to think about with vendors and
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:19,328	| IOT194 |	Technology is that I would argue it's being 20 years
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:21,120	| IOT194 |	Really bad
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:23,168	| IOT194 |	Technology procurement within government
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:27,776	| IOT194 |	Memphis to sweeping statement but a lot of vendors sell to government and it is
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:29,056	| IOT194 |	Extremely difficult
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:30,080	| IOT194 |	For those vendors
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:30,848	| IOT194 |	To stop selling
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:33,920	| IOT194 |	Anti-government so once you get in with government often
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:34,688	| IOT194 |	You become
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,968	| IOT194 |	Whether or not the solution
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:37,760	| IOT194 |	Good cities and other government
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:39,808	| IOT194 |	Relinquish a lot of that powering
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:40,832	| IOT194 |	Control
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,624	| IOT194 |	So I think you put all of us
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:44,672	| IOT194 |	Think together and you have a recipe here for trouble
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,952	| IOT194 |	And where we need to assess
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:49,024	| IOT194 |	How do we return the start of Technology governance piece
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:50,560	| IOT194 |	Do something that's more democratically inform
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:53,632	| IOT194 |	Yes and I became aware of your work on these topics
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:54,912	| IOT194 |	Lakes around the city of
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:55,680	| IOT194 |	Toronto
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:57,984	| IOT194 |	The Waterfront development with sidewalk labs
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:36:59,776	| IOT194 |	Google /
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:00,544	| IOT194 |	Alphabets
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:04,384	| IOT194 |	Siri and that seems kind of like a microcosm for a lot of these issues that
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:07,200	| IOT194 |	Talking about do you want to talk a little bit
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:08,224	| IOT194 |	About that
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:09,760	| IOT194 |	Kind of drive this home for
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:12,064	| IOT194 |	Certainly and I think what
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:13,088	| IOT194 |	Critical condition
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:14,368	| IOT194 |	Stand is that this
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:15,904	| IOT194 |	Project is not happening
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:17,696	| IOT194 |	With the city of Toronto directly
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:18,976	| IOT194 |	It's happening with
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:24,864	| IOT194 |	Public corporation that's in charge of Waterfront revitalization and so while the city of Toronto is an actor
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:26,400	| IOT194 |	This is not something that's happening
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:27,424	| IOT194 |	Between the residence
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,192	| IOT194 |	The city in the vendor
EDL	00:37:29,216	00:37:29,984	| IOT194 |	Another
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:31,520	| IOT194 |	Waterfront Toronto
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:32,544	| IOT194 |	Is the partner in his
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:34,592	| IOT194 |	Is the person who put out the proposal
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:36,896	| IOT194 |	It's a nuanced but it's important understand because it's
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:38,688	| IOT194 |	City of Toronto dealing
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:44,320	| IOT194 |	The way that this is really come to a head in Toronto is that from the time they are
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:45,600	| IOT194 |	P was
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:46,880	| IOT194 |	Put out and
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:48,160	| IOT194 |	You know where we are now
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:49,952	| IOT194 |	Which is more than a year later
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:50,976	| IOT194 |	Is that it
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:52,512	| IOT194 |	Incredibly clear
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:55,584	| IOT194 |	That people generally are unable
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:56,864	| IOT194 |	To weigh in on
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:37:59,936	| IOT194 |	How technology might be used in a neighborhood
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:01,728	| IOT194 |	Because we're lacking the public
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:05,312	| IOT194 |	Education layer that we need and I think this is emblematic of the last
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:05,824	| IOT194 |	20 years
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:08,128	| IOT194 |	Technology is that it has not
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:08,896	| IOT194 |	Attained
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:11,200	| IOT194 |	Is social license required
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:11,968	| IOT194 |	To go forward with
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:18,880	| IOT194 |	And so on the heels of this great enthusiasm for Innovation and economic development we stopped asking what
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:20,416	| IOT194 |	The impacts are of the resident
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:21,184	| IOT194 |	People who live with
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:25,024	| IOT194 |	Ecology and I argue in some cases and places
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:25,792	| IOT194 |	We are
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:26,816	| IOT194 |	Entrenching
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:28,864	| IOT194 |	Essentially a surveillance
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:29,632	| IOT194 |	Society
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:30,656	| IOT194 |	Because
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:31,424	| IOT194 |	We're not
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:32,448	| IOT194 |	Interrogating
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,984	| IOT194 |	Enough why are we putting
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:34,752	| IOT194 |	Technology
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:36,288	| IOT194 |	Who is it benefiting and
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:42,688	| IOT194 |	Do we really need it is this even primarily the core of some of the issues that were experiencing in cities and we know sit
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:46,016	| IOT194 |	Cities are really facing austerity you know they don't have a lot of money
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:47,808	| IOT194 |	So I think a lot of the stuff here
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:49,088	| IOT194 |	Really needs
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:49,600	| IOT194 |	Apod
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:50,880	| IOT194 |	Thoughtfulness
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:55,488	| IOT194 |	And thank you for going to go forward with technology we really need me to make sure
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:58,048	| IOT194 |	A good number of people understand why we're
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:38:59,584	| IOT194 |	Doing it and really are on board with it
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:01,632	| IOT194 |	Okay there's a lot to unpack
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:04,704	| IOT194 |	So let's start with maybe something
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:05,984	| IOT194 |	A little bit specific
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:07,264	| IOT194 |	Because I think that'll help
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:11,360	| IOT194 |	Talk about will talk about your ideal process and we'll do it with something that I think is
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:12,384	| IOT194 |	It has a lot of ram if I
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:16,224	| IOT194 |	Asian so smart lighting is one of the more popular options
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:17,504	| IOT194 |	Because cities have to replace
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:18,784	| IOT194 |	Street lights with LED
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:22,368	| IOT194 |	Clear cost
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:26,976	| IOT194 |	And they have all these cool projects
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:30,048	| IOT194 |	But it's also a place where you know you could add Wi-Fi but
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:31,328	| IOT194 |	Also add cameras
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:32,864	| IOT194 |	There's all kinds of
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:36,704	| IOT194 |	So talk to me about what an ideal process
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:37,472	| IOT194 |	Ferb
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:37,984	| IOT194 |	Adding smart
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:40,032	| IOT194 |	Tierpoint
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:42,080	| IOT194 |	The reason for the replacement
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:45,408	| IOT194 |	Is because there's a better technology available
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:47,968	| IOT194 |	And so that makes a lot of sense to do
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:50,784	| IOT194 |	Which is something that's understood 3/3
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:54,624	| IOT194 |	How people can get on board with both cost-savings environmental benefit make sense
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:40:00,000	| IOT194 |	Now these other things you get into this world of just because you can doesn't mean you should
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:02,816	| IOT194 |	Write like and I think this is this moment where we say
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:04,352	| IOT194 |	Is putting WiFi
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:05,120	| IOT194 |	Public space
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:06,400	| IOT194 |	The
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:08,192	| IOT194 |	Pressing urgent
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:09,984	| IOT194 |	Policy issue in cities
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:11,264	| IOT194 |	And I would say
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:12,544	| IOT194 |	No
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:16,384	| IOT194 |	Just as a starting point in a city in Toronto and now we all need to
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:20,224	| IOT194 |	I think about City to City what the differences are and you know how you would prioritize
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:26,368	| IOT194 |	Decision I think you have to look at some of these other bits and pieces and say okay hold on yes we could do all of those things
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:28,160	| IOT194 |	But we don't have
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:28,672	| IOT194 |	Have to do all of those
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:32,256	| IOT194 |	But if there's a real reason to do those things of course we should do that
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:34,560	| IOT194 |	So this is when you can enter into
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:36,608	| IOT194 |	Kind of conversations a public at
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:37,632	| IOT194 |	Education piece
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:39,936	| IOT194 |	Prior to doing the rest of that Edition
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:45,312	| IOT194 |	And to talk to people and understand like a is this something you would like to have in here are the benefits.
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:46,592	| IOT194 |	The potential cost
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:47,616	| IOT194 |	Is always a trade-off
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:48,896	| IOT194 |	Discussion and policy
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:49,664	| IOT194 |	So
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:55,808	| IOT194 |	How do you go about having those conversations in a broad enough way that's difficult right
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:41:02,720	| IOT194 |	Exactly and that's very difficult to do a consultation about
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:04,256	| IOT194 |	Public Wi-Fi seems like
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,792	| IOT194 |	Not the worst idea
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:10,144	| IOT194 |	But also I think it's also the time right now what I think everybody is scared
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:10,912	| IOT194 |	To do
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:13,984	| IOT194 |	For me is that is a responsible move right now
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:16,544	| IOT194 |	It's just stop putting more stuff
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:19,360	| IOT194 |	And until we have had a bit of a wholesale discussion
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:21,664	| IOT194 |	About many of those components
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:25,760	| IOT194 |	Because you can't go off doing one off one off one off right you can't be doing that
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:27,552	| IOT194 |	Street lights
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:32,672	| IOT194 |	Cameras again
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:35,488	| IOT194 |	That's why I think it's a really good time for
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:37,024	| IOT194 |	People that pause and say hey
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:38,304	| IOT194 |	Weaning calves
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:41,120	| IOT194 |	A digital and data infrastructure
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:42,912	| IOT194 |	Plan for City and.
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:44,704	| IOT194 |	Something that we can talk about all these
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:45,728	| IOT194 |	Components together
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:46,752	| IOT194 |	You know what the public
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:49,056	| IOT194 |	With stakeholders with industry
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:53,919	| IOT194 |	Then you take that plan and you use it to inform a whole set of
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:56,223	| IOT194 |	Procurement if we would have had that done
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:57,759	| IOT194 |	A lot of the issues
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:42:01,343	| IOT194 |	With the sidewalk Toronto project wouldn't be issues because we would have already
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:02,879	| IOT194 |	He had set out some policy guide
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:05,695	| IOT194 |	The problem with this particular project
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:08,255	| IOT194 |	Bring it back to it is that we don't have that
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:09,791	| IOT194 |	And so now we're freestyling
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:10,815	| IOT194 |	With a vendor
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:13,119	| IOT194 |	Which to me is not how you do good
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:17,471	| IOT194 |	Policy so I think this is really a point in time where you don't try to do little one off stuff
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:21,311	| IOT194 |	We need to think about that we have a digital and Aiden fish structure policy
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:22,335	| IOT194 |	Four cities
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:25,151	| IOT194 |	And that that is something that's done with good Democratic process
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:27,967	| IOT194 |	And then you're set up well to go ahead and do lots of
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:29,247	| IOT194 |	If you
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:35,647	| IOT194 |	Sedona wholesale policy it enables you to take advantage of those opportunities for you're going in and email adjusting into
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:37,951	| IOT194 |	The structure but then you make sure it's all aligned with your Paula
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:41,279	| IOT194 |	What is difficult for everybody to do right now
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:42,815	| IOT194 |	Is to take the time to
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:43,583	| IOT194 |	Stop
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:44,351	| IOT194 |	And do that polish
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:46,143	| IOT194 |	So with that in mind
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:47,935	| IOT194 |	Let's talk about how we create
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:49,471	| IOT194 |	Digital infrastructure
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:53,567	| IOT194 |	Because I will tell you I live in Austin and we just did a
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:55,103	| IOT194 |	Got it was like 5 or 10 years
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:56,383	| IOT194 |	Code next
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:57,919	| IOT194 |	We're basically trying to like
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:43:00,735	| IOT194 |	Identify and improve housing in the inner city of
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:02,015	| IOT194 |	We're having a portability
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:05,599	| IOT194 |	And holy cow we went through this process for
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:07,391	| IOT194 |	Many many years
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:10,207	| IOT194 |	Many people wait in any people had strong feelings
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:12,255	| IOT194 |	And in this last election they were like
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:12,767	| IOT194 |	You know what
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:14,047	| IOT194 |	What do a boat
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:14,815	| IOT194 |	To see if we should have
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:16,095	| IOT194 |	Scrap everything we just did with
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,143	| IOT194 |	Devil didn't pass
EDL	00:43:18,911	00:43:19,679	| IOT194 |	But
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:20,447	| IOT194 |	The point is
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:23,519	| IOT194 |	Doing anything at a policy layer is
EDL	00:43:24,031	00:43:25,311	| IOT194 |	Hard and it's
EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:26,335	| IOT194 |	Uncertain
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:28,127	| IOT194 |	And it's expensive and
EDL	00:43:28,127	00:43:28,895	| IOT194 |	The people who
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:30,687	| IOT194 |	Complain the loudest are often
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:31,967	| IOT194 |	People who want things
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:32,991	| IOT194 |	How to say the same
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:36,063	| IOT194 |	So very curious like if we stop this
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,087	| IOT194 |	What should that
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,367	| IOT194 |	Digital infrastructure
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:40,927	| IOT194 |	The process look like and how do we think that's
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:41,695	| IOT194 |	Going to unfold
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:43,231	| IOT194 |	Klepto
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:45,791	| IOT194 |	A couple pints and I think one of them is that
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:47,327	| IOT194 |	We already have
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:48,607	| IOT194 |	City policies in
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:50,399	| IOT194 |	Implants right and so
EDL	00:43:50,399	00:43:52,191	| IOT194 |	It's not like those things don't exist
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:55,263	| IOT194 |	And I find that this is part of where the Smart City narrative is very
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:57,823	| IOT194 |	Its aggressive and overconfident in that it
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:58,591	| IOT194 |	Forgetting
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:43:59,615	| IOT194 |	That cities have
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:00,639	| IOT194 |	Plant City
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:02,431	| IOT194 |	Plant City top priority
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:03,199	| IOT194 |	Cities have long term
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:06,015	| IOT194 |	We're not starting from zero
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:12,415	| IOT194 |	What we're doing is we're looking at what is already prioritize and what is already the policy for the city
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:13,183	| IOT194 |	Writ large
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:15,487	| IOT194 |	And then you look at that and you say
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:16,511	| IOT194 |	How can technology
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:18,047	| IOT194 |	Support
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:20,095	| IOT194 |	Those priorities and those plants
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:22,655	| IOT194 |	And you're using technology in a small
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:23,423	| IOT194 |	Tool fence
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:26,751	| IOT194 |	To say hey these are the things we're trying to achieve
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:28,543	| IOT194 |	How can technology help get us there
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:30,591	| IOT194 |	The second thing to me is that
EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:32,895	| IOT194 |	Right now is not the time to
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:35,455	| IOT194 |	Minimize or pretend as though
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:36,479	| IOT194 |	The impact
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:38,015	| IOT194 |	I'm all of this data collection
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:43,391	| IOT194 |	I kind of act like head in the sand or like well not a big deal we already have a lot of
EDL	00:44:43,391	00:44:47,743	| IOT194 |	Attack so just put a bit more and you know like this is the future this is how it goes
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:51,071	| IOT194 |	This is really a really important time to stop and say
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:52,607	| IOT194 |	We know we're
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:55,423	| IOT194 |	Getting to volumes of data collection where
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:58,239	| IOT194 |	Free diamonds are going to be more at risk
EDL	00:44:58,239	00:45:00,287	| IOT194 |	The freedom to participate in
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:05,151	| IOT194 |	Society with that what you're doing being known to others I think this is also a time of
EDL	00:45:05,151	00:45:06,431	| IOT194 |	Great unintended pun
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:09,503	| IOT194 |	Consequences for what it means for some of the players in technology
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:13,599	| IOT194 |	Have a lot of data as it is what is it looks to be creating
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:16,671	| IOT194 |	More power asymmetry between corporate actors and
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:17,951	| IOT194 |	The state does that little talk
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:21,535	| IOT194 |	These are fundamental element that have to do with power and
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:22,815	| IOT194 |	Control and
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:25,887	| IOT194 |	And these are things where we want to exert
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:27,167	| IOT194 |	Right around
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:27,935	| IOT194 |	Our freedom
EDL	00:45:28,447	00:45:30,239	| IOT194 |	And taking and maybe walk
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:31,519	| IOT194 |	Getting back some of the decision
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:32,799	| IOT194 |	Bands that were made without
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:34,335	| IOT194 |	Consent abroad
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:35,103	| IOT194 |	Social life
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:38,175	| IOT194 |	This is the time to do that but in order to do that
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:41,247	| IOT194 |	You have to make sure that you got a bigger set of players out
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:44,063	| IOT194 |	At the table because right now it's all you bring in
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:46,367	| IOT194 |	It policy people and academics
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:47,391	| IOT194 |	And vendors
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:48,671	| IOT194 |	You know you're going to keep having
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:49,439	| IOT194 |	Missing conversations
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:52,511	| IOT194 |	This is the point in history to bring in
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:55,071	| IOT194 |	Everybody like this has to become
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:58,399	| IOT194 |	Social issue where the public is at the table in large numbers
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:03,007	| IOT194 |	We need to make a comfortable space for people who don't have a tech background
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:04,287	| IOT194 |	Participated
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:08,127	| IOT194 |	Because things about democracy control Freedom privacy those aren't
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:09,151	| IOT194 |	Technical issues
EDL	00:46:10,175	00:46:10,943	| IOT194 |	Deeply
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:12,479	| IOT194 |	Social and ethical issues
EDL	00:46:12,479	00:46:14,527	| IOT194 |	So we need to figure out a way
EDL	00:46:14,527	00:46:15,295	| IOT194 |	To make that space
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:16,575	| IOT194 |	Comfortable
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:18,111	| IOT194 |	Way more people than
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:18,879	| IOT194 |	Currently is
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:20,159	| IOT194 |	And if we don't do that
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:23,231	| IOT194 |	We're treading ahead with stuff that does not have consent
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:28,351	| IOT194 |	And the public and I think what we seen in the last year is it high time to stop doing that
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:29,631	| IOT194 |	Because of all the unintended
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:31,679	| IOT194 |	So I think we're falling into this
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:36,287	| IOT194 |	Surveillance State not just because it's easier in the public may not quite realize it
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:38,335	| IOT194 |	I think we're also doing this just
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:41,663	| IOT194 |	In general especially I'm in the US year in Canada
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:42,431	| IOT194 |	Because of
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:43,711	| IOT194 |	X
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:44,991	| IOT194 |	Political leadership
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:46,015	| IOT194 |	That we currently
EDL	00:46:46,015	00:46:46,783	| IOT194 |	We have
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:49,599	| IOT194 |	So I worry that it's easier as a government
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:50,623	| IOT194 |	To say
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:51,903	| IOT194 |	Yes we need this
EDL	00:46:52,415	00:46:54,463	| IOT194 |	Stoking that fear and that feels
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:55,743	| IOT194 |	Not a technology issue
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:57,279	| IOT194 |	Tissue that feels kind of like a
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:58,047	| IOT194 |	Overall political
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:47:02,655	| IOT194 |	Climate issue and I'm not sure how we addressed that because right now we're in the state where we
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:03,423	| IOT194 |	We have all these
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:05,215	| IOT194 |	Crazy tools available to us
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:06,751	| IOT194 |	Bixby used for something like what
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:08,287	| IOT194 |	China's doing with their social
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:09,055	| IOT194 |	Scores
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:11,871	| IOT194 |	But I think like two points on. The first one is
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:12,895	| IOT194 |	People like to point
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:16,735	| IOT194 |	China there's a lot of stuff going on in North America that is profiling
EDL	00:47:16,735	00:47:19,807	| IOT194 |	On people using social media information
EDL	00:47:19,807	00:47:21,599	| IOT194 |	Whether it's a bank looking at it
EDL	00:47:21,599	00:47:22,111	| IOT194 |	Whether it's
EDL	00:47:22,623	00:47:23,903	| IOT194 |	Employer looking at it
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:25,439	| IOT194 |	We're doing a lot of this same
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:27,487	| IOT194 |	Stuff but we're not doing it
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:29,279	| IOT194 |	Necessarily is National policy
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:31,839	| IOT194 |	I just want to say that because I think a lot of times
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:32,607	| IOT194 |	People liked
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:34,399	| IOT194 |	2.2 China and I think that furthers
EDL	00:47:34,911	00:47:38,751	| IOT194 |	This misunderstanding that is a lot of bad stuff happening in North America to
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:40,031	| IOT194 |	In some ways worse because
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:43,615	| IOT194 |	It's not so highlighted as state policy it's more
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:45,663	| IOT194 |	Again like various actors
EDL	00:47:45,663	00:47:46,431	| IOT194 |	Freestyling
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:52,575	| IOT194 |	I think the other thing about the political climate we're in is that it's not just that we have the kind of actors who my
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:54,111	| IOT194 |	Pro surveillance
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:58,719	| IOT194 |	Because of for me a significant moment in time with post 911
EDL	00:47:58,719	00:47:59,743	| IOT194 |	Winspear
EDL	00:47:59,743	00:48:00,767	| IOT194 |	Became
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:01,535	| IOT194 |	A driver
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:03,071	| IOT194 |	And a rationale for many
EDL	00:48:03,583	00:48:06,655	| IOT194 |	Including technology but the flip of that which is
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:08,191	| IOT194 |	Older the 9/11
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:10,495	| IOT194 |	Is efficiency efficiency efficiency
EDL	00:48:10,495	00:48:13,311	| IOT194 |	Until when governments are make it you know they're being
EDL	00:48:13,311	00:48:15,359	| IOT194 |	Sold that they're going to save a whole bunch of money so
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:17,663	| IOT194 |	Magical they got some Hobbies
EDL	00:48:17,663	00:48:18,431	| IOT194 |	Technologies
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:19,967	| IOT194 |	Great times of efficiencies
EDL	00:48:19,967	00:48:20,735	| IOT194 |	Without
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:21,503	| IOT194 |	Interrogating
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:22,271	| IOT194 |	Kudos
EDL	00:48:22,271	00:48:23,807	| IOT194 |	Efficiencies impact
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:25,855	| IOT194 |	Politically is a whole nother round
EDL	00:48:25,855	00:48:27,903	| IOT194 |	Trouble because that's happening
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:33,023	| IOT194 |	To write and I think this is where you look into the work of like a Virginia Eubanks with the automated
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:33,791	| IOT194 |	Quality
EDL	00:48:33,791	00:48:37,375	| IOT194 |	Roblox glitches that you know where you look at using software to create a fish
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:40,959	| IOT194 |	To be sure but you know who it continually in trenches and accelerate
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:42,239	| IOT194 |	Discrimination of poor people
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:43,007	| IOT194 |	And
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:44,543	| IOT194 |	It's not like it's benign
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:46,335	| IOT194 |	It's done intentionally but it's
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:50,175	| IOT194 |	Sounds very defensible to say well we're just using technology for efficient
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:52,223	| IOT194 |	But we're not
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:56,319	| IOT194 |	Sing ourselves efficiencies mean when you look at how are those deficiencies applied
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:57,087	| IOT194 |	And so I think
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:49:01,951	| IOT194 |	Completely right about the first Realm of the political thing but I think there's this other longer
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:05,279	| IOT194 |	Political issue which is who in the government doesn't want to think they can
EDL	00:49:05,279	00:49:06,815	| IOT194 |	Can buy their way out of things like
EDL	00:49:06,815	00:49:10,655	| IOT194 |	Affordability or sustainability like for me but this is a persistent
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:11,679	| IOT194 |	Interrogation of
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:12,959	| IOT194 |	Quite a bit smart cities
EDL	00:49:12,959	00:49:15,263	| IOT194 |	Stop the saying it's technology what we need
EDL	00:49:15,263	00:49:17,311	| IOT194 |	Or his political leadership what we need
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:23,711	| IOT194 |	Right so we as people really need to be involved in this stuff because it cannot just be left up at that political level
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:25,503	| IOT194 |	Because there's way too many disincentives
EDL	00:49:25,503	00:49:26,271	| IOT194 |	Actually Act
EDL	00:49:26,271	00:49:29,855	| IOT194 |	That's right with this business such a alluring short-term
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:30,623	| IOT194 |	Jobs
EDL	00:49:30,623	00:49:33,951	| IOT194 |	And efficiencies Merida is that what is that look like in 10 years
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:35,231	| IOT194 |	Which is what we all have to live with
EDL	00:49:35,999	00:49:37,535	| IOT194 |	So with that in mind
EDL	00:49:38,047	00:49:39,583	| IOT194 |	I'm coming up to the end of the interview
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:45,983	| IOT194 |	Give me some concrete things I should do one as a citizen what should citizens be pushing for
EDL	00:49:45,983	00:49:47,007	| IOT194 |	Thinking about in Dewey
EDL	00:49:48,543	00:49:49,311	| IOT194 |	Start encountering some
EDL	00:49:50,079	00:49:50,847	| IOT194 |	And then
EDL	00:49:50,847	00:49:53,919	| IOT194 |	I guess as a city manager or a
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:55,967	| IOT194 |	Politician what are some concrete things
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:56,991	| IOT194 |	Each participant
EDL	00:49:56,991	00:49:58,527	| IOT194 |	Can do to improve this
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:49:59,807	| IOT194 |	To have these
EDL	00:50:01,087	00:50:07,231	| IOT194 |	I think I'm the first one in terms of what can a resident do I think we need to be really aware of
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:13,631	| IOT194 |	The demands on people's time and elitism of Technology like one thing we have to do is we have to realize
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:17,727	| IOT194 |	Not every residents going to be able to put Smart City policy at the top of what they're worried about
EDL	00:50:17,727	00:50:20,543	| IOT194 |	So I think we have to think about if you are engaging with
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:22,847	| IOT194 |	Politicians get in touch with you
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:24,895	| IOT194 |	Officials are more friends than just a
EDL	00:50:24,895	00:50:25,663	| IOT194 |	Smart City
EDL	00:50:25,663	00:50:32,063	| IOT194 |	I think you're a non-resident technologist and residents. Should be just getting in touch with their elected officials and saying hey
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:36,927	| IOT194 |	I'm getting alot about data and data collection and how my data is being used
EDL	00:50:36,927	00:50:37,695	| IOT194 |	You have to start
EDL	00:50:37,695	00:50:39,487	| IOT194 |	What concern you can start with like how much
EDL	00:50:39,487	00:50:41,279	| IOT194 |	What do we know about what's going on how much
EDL	00:50:41,279	00:50:46,399	| IOT194 |	Are we doing this in a way that is aligned with stuff that we've all participated on in Polish
EDL	00:50:46,399	00:50:50,239	| IOT194 |	Right now it's just signaling to politicians that people care about
EDL	00:50:50,239	00:50:51,775	| IOT194 |	And to my earlier point
EDL	00:50:51,775	00:50:52,799	| IOT194 |	A lot of people can't
EDL	00:50:52,799	00:50:55,103	| IOT194 |	Care about this because they got real
EDL	00:50:55,103	00:51:00,479	| IOT194 |	Lots of other things about survival to care about so if you are caring about this try to think about it in a way we think
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:06,879	| IOT194 |	What are the implications of data and Technology on poor people on racialized people on people that are being surveilled
EDL	00:51:06,879	00:51:07,903	| IOT194 |	For a long time already
EDL	00:51:07,903	00:51:08,927	| IOT194 |	And also
EDL	00:51:08,927	00:51:10,975	| IOT194 |	How do you engage with people who aren't showing up
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:13,023	| IOT194 |	How do you make sure that people in
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:16,095	| IOT194 |	Community housing aren't the ones you're getting more surveillance
EDL	00:51:16,095	00:51:17,631	| IOT194 |	Because they're getting something for free
EDL	00:51:17,631	00:51:22,751	| IOT194 |	Like we always have to think about that I think is a really important time to remember what are Civic responsibilities are
EDL	00:51:22,751	00:51:23,775	| IOT194 |	In terms of
EDL	00:51:23,775	00:51:26,335	| IOT194 |	What a city manager might be doing or an elected
EDL	00:51:26,335	00:51:29,407	| IOT194 |	Official I think this gets back to reminding everybody who's in
EDL	00:51:29,407	00:51:30,943	| IOT194 |	Charge the government
EDL	00:51:30,943	00:51:32,735	| IOT194 |	Charge and what is the government have
EDL	00:51:32,735	00:51:34,527	| IOT194 |	They have pre-existing policies
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:37,599	| IOT194 |	Until I think we have to turn this conversation around
EDL	00:51:37,599	00:51:40,927	| IOT194 |	How to say the vendors this is what we're trying to do in the city
EDL	00:51:40,927	00:51:42,719	| IOT194 |	How are you helping us do that
EDL	00:51:42,719	00:51:46,303	| IOT194 |	Not what is your shiny new thing and how do I find a house for
EDL	00:51:46,303	00:51:48,351	| IOT194 |	It's right it's the other way around it
EDL	00:51:48,351	00:51:51,679	| IOT194 |	Here's what we're trying to do if you want to be part of our
EDL	00:51:51,679	00:51:54,239	| IOT194 |	Procurement these are requirements that we're looking
EDL	00:51:54,239	00:51:55,775	| IOT194 |	Free to me and to have
EDL	00:51:55,775	00:51:56,799	| IOT194 |	Technology
EDL	00:51:56,799	00:52:00,639	| IOT194 |	Nothing really being formed by pre-existing democratically inform policy
EDL	00:52:00,639	00:52:02,687	| IOT194 |	That would be helpful as the next
EDL	00:52:02,687	00:52:08,831	| IOT194 |	And I think that's a good interim step before we necessarily have digital's and data infrastructure planning or not
EDL	00:52:08,831	00:52:09,855	| IOT194 |	Master planning whatever
EDL	00:52:09,855	00:52:10,623	| IOT194 |	Procurement
EDL	00:52:10,623	00:52:12,159	| IOT194 |	Is a really really
EDL	00:52:12,159	00:52:14,719	| IOT194 |	Garden place for everybody Ted Turner eyes right now
EDL	00:52:14,719	00:52:15,999	| IOT194 |	Because we don't have
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:16,767	| IOT194 |	How to change
EDL	00:52:16,767	00:52:19,071	| IOT194 |	That much like you can do a lot with an existing
EDL	00:52:19,071	00:52:19,839	| IOT194 |	Procurement
EDL	00:52:19,839	00:52:21,119	| IOT194 |	To have it operate
EDL	00:52:21,119	00:52:22,911	| IOT194 |	In a better way in Mark's pants
EDL	00:52:22,911	00:52:29,311	| IOT194 |	And you know and looking at are we looking at open source stuff rather than just proprietary are we looking at in traffic
EDL	00:52:29,311	00:52:35,711	| IOT194 |	Mobility can we share Solutions with other cities like cities need to start working together a bit better on this stuff because even in Canada
EDL	00:52:35,711	00:52:39,551	| IOT194 |	We got cities that are doing way better than Toronto and we're not really
EDL	00:52:39,551	00:52:40,831	| IOT194 |	Implementing their work
EDL	00:52:41,343	00:52:44,927	| IOT194 |	And so we should be thinking about that as well like as elected officials
EDL	00:52:44,927	00:52:47,743	| IOT194 |	City managers how do we accelerate the best practice
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:51,839	| IOT194 |	Implementation there is I think a room to be sharing more into me
EDL	00:52:51,839	00:52:53,375	| IOT194 |	Like learn from each other more in a pint
EDL	00:52:53,887	00:52:56,447	| IOT194 |	Awesome alright well now I feel like I have to go out in
EDL	00:52:56,959	00:52:58,495	| IOT194 |	Possibly a better citizen
EDL	00:52:58,495	00:53:00,543	| IOT194 |	What Bianca thank you so much
EDL	00:53:00,543	00:53:01,567	| IOT194 |	For coming on the show this
EDL	00:53:01,567	00:53:02,079	| IOT194 |	Sweet I really am
