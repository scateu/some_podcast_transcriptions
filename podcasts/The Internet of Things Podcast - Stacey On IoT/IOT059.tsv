EDL	00:00:13,312	00:00:14,080	| IOT059 |	Podcast
EDL	00:00:14,080	00:00:14,848	| IOT059 |	I am your host
EDL	00:00:15,360	00:00:16,640	| IOT059 |	And she's co-host
EDL	00:00:16,640	00:00:17,152	| IOT059 |	Is
EDL	00:00:18,688	00:00:21,248	| IOT059 |	That's right y'all Kevin is a Google IO
EDL	00:00:21,248	00:00:23,040	| IOT059 |	Actually so is yonko
EDL	00:00:29,440	00:00:30,464	| IOT059 |	But something in 4k
EDL	00:00:30,976	00:00:31,488	| IOT059 |	He's busy
EDL	00:00:32,000	00:00:33,024	| IOT059 |	Spelling is Nuova.
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:34,816	| IOT059 |	Exactly
EDL	00:00:34,816	00:00:36,608	| IOT059 |	Yonko is
EDL	00:00:36,608	00:00:39,168	| IOT059 |	Former colleague of mine from Ikea
EDL	00:00:39,168	00:00:41,728	| IOT059 |	He is the smartest man in the room if you want to talk about
EDL	00:00:42,240	00:00:45,824	| IOT059 |	Well a lot of things but the fate of digital media television
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:48,384	| IOT059 |	Like both hardware and Zack
EDL	00:00:48,384	00:00:49,920	| IOT059 |	Programming and
EDL	00:00:49,920	00:00:51,200	| IOT059 |	I don't know what else yonko
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:00:59,904	| IOT059 |	Good I was always exciting
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:00,672	| IOT059 |	Weather for this week
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:02,976	| IOT059 |	And I should get right to it because I
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:04,000	| IOT059 |	I think there's a bunch of
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:05,280	| IOT059 |	Google News throughout
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:06,816	| IOT059 |	Vishal today right
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:11,424	| IOT059 |	We have a lid actually we have the words with Nest to be confused
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:13,984	| IOT059 |	Basically
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:17,312	| IOT059 |	Just announced a whole bunch of new Integrations for the
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:18,336	| IOT059 |	Works with Nest program
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:21,152	| IOT059 |	So we're going to talk about a couple of them
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:24,480	| IOT059 |	Most notably for a lot of old-school smart-home people
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:27,808	| IOT059 |	The Belkin WeMo finally works now with
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:28,320	| IOT059 |	The nest
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:32,672	| IOT059 |	So this is exciting because a lot of people have wemos
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:37,280	| IOT059 |	And it works with your nest thermostat so if your thermostat notices the house is empty
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:38,304	| IOT059 |	Light skin turn off
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:41,632	| IOT059 |	Maybe your Crock-Pot or your curling iron whatever is in there
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:43,936	| IOT059 |	What I saw at Weston
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:49,312	| IOT059 |	It does
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:53,664	| IOT059 |	Lucretia how that works
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:55,456	| IOT059 |	Two cameras work
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:56,736	| IOT059 |	Each other
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:58,528	| IOT059 |	Oh so this is the August doorbell cam
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:01,600	| IOT059 |	Okay so this is actually cool so the August doorbell cam
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:03,392	| IOT059 |	Basically what you do
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:05,440	| IOT059 |	Is when someone
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:06,976	| IOT059 |	Comes to your door
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:08,768	| IOT059 |	Eventually the August
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,328	| IOT059 |	Emotion sensor
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:13,120	| IOT059 |	As part of this soda
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:15,424	| IOT059 |	And utility comes when the August doorbell is like
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:19,008	| IOT059 |	Hey something's at the door and what'll happen is it will trigger your
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:21,312	| IOT059 |	Camera
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:23,616	| IOT059 |	Basically being able to say
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,920	| IOT059 |	Because they have this August Access program
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:30,272	| IOT059 |	Can say the person at my door it's the guy from Postmates
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,040	| IOT059 |	Delivering something
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:33,856	| IOT059 |	You can actually let him into your house
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:34,624	| IOT059 |	If you have an August lock
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,976	| IOT059 |	Now if you have an S cam you can also keep an eye on it
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:40,768	| IOT059 |	While he drives whatever inside your
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:41,536	| IOT059 |	Front door
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,304	| IOT059 |	So
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,352	| IOT059 |	The light bulb
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,120	| IOT059 |	Integration made
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:45,888	| IOT059 |	More off your scent
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:48,960	| IOT059 |	Beware the camera senses motion
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:49,728	| IOT059 |	10
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:51,520	| IOT059 |	Lightbox go on or off
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:52,032	| IOT059 |	If you want to
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,408	| IOT059 |	Exactly
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:58,944	| IOT059 |	Dollars for you
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:01,760	| IOT059 |	So there's one that I want to talk about because I think it's
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:04,064	| IOT059 |	I don't know if it's pee or if it's going to be like
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:05,088	| IOT059 |	The Breakthrough device
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:06,112	| IOT059 |	It makes the Internet of Things
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,136	| IOT059 |	Things useful for like
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,416	| IOT059 |	Middle America
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:11,744	| IOT059 |	I don't know if we talked about the
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:14,560	| IOT059 |	Febreze connect but basically this is one of those
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,328	| IOT059 |	You know how you can
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:17,120	| IOT059 |	Plugin sense
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:19,680	| IOT059 |	It's not potpourri it's like those sensory
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,704	| IOT059 |	Essential oils
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,728	| IOT059 |	You can actually
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,776	| IOT059 |	Plug the P&G
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,336	| IOT059 |	Febreze Connect into an outlet in
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:27,872	| IOT059 |	Control it from your smartphone
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:30,432	| IOT059 |	So what they done with their nest integration is
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:32,224	| IOT059 |	They've got algorithms
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:33,248	| IOT059 |	Because everyone has to have them
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:35,296	| IOT059 |	That will actually
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:36,320	| IOT059 |	Time your
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,344	| IOT059 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,392	| IOT059 |	Spike turning on the hbac
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:43,232	| IOT059 |	Whiskey release a fragrance in your house so like
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,768	| IOT059 |	Fragrances disbursed
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:45,792	| IOT059 |	Most efficiently
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,328	| IOT059 |	Okay
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:49,120	| IOT059 |	What kind of extensor doesn't smell
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,400	| IOT059 |	Aladdin one Rohan.
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,032	| IOT059 |	Yeah so I kind of like
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:04:01,664	| IOT059 |	But I really am curious because the pg4 rescan it is what it is like
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,456	| IOT059 |	Maybe it's like an ant
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:07,296	| IOT059 |	Grandma or someone always has those like fragrance
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,576	| IOT059 |	It was in their house right
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,112	| IOT059 |	I don't have them
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:17,280	| IOT059 |	Maybe it's when you turn 40 or 50 you get this and I just haven't experienced it yet
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:24,703	| IOT059 |	Baby. So anyway I'm really curious to see
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,519	| IOT059 |	If people find this really useful because
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:31,359	| IOT059 |	It's a product a lot of people buy already and it's actually relatively
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:32,895	| IOT059 |	So I don't know
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,199	| IOT059 |	So
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,271	| IOT059 |	AR
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,039	| IOT059 |	Worth mentioning
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:43,391	| IOT059 |	Just in general some of the other companies that it's going to work with is a thermostat to work with Lutron
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:46,719	| IOT059 |	Misfit Waxman which is a water leak
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,743	| IOT059 |	Sensor so
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:49,279	| IOT059 |	This is cool because if it detects
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:51,327	| IOT059 |	There's a leak and your way from home
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:55,423	| IOT059 |	It's going to give you a one touch dial to an emergency contact
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:57,471	| IOT059 |	Hopefully we will eventually
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:02,591	| IOT059 |	Instead of just being able to call someone and be like hey something's making my house go turn off the water would be awesome if
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,919	| IOT059 |	Here's the number of local plumber
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,687	| IOT059 |	That's a business model
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,247	| IOT059 |	So I have a question
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:13,343	| IOT059 |	You sing this
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,903	| IOT059 |	Is Nest sort of
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:19,999	| IOT059 |	I mean obviously everybody likes to work with other devices but everybody else
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:22,559	| IOT059 |	Do you think that is is part of it like
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,351	| IOT059 |	Tassets mix together
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,631	| IOT059 |	Dick Hannah Lofton
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,655	| IOT059 |	How many devices
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,263	| IOT059 |	He said I could
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,847	| IOT059 |	So the way Nest has
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:38,431	| IOT059 |	People share data with it like Nest is very limiting
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,479	| IOT059 |	With what people can do on its play
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:44,575	| IOT059 |	So some companies like SmartThings had decided it didn't want to work with nest
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:49,439	| IOT059 |	Because it didn't like the terms other companies have talked to me behind the scenes and said
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:55,583	| IOT059 |	Just ask them to do a lot that they didn't want to do and it first they didn't have the power to say noted
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,607	| IOT059 |	But now that they're
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:59,423	| IOT059 |	More platforms out there that they could integrate with
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,471	| IOT059 |	To have negotiating power with nest
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:04,543	| IOT059 |	So I think there's kind of a power shift happening in the industry
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,103	| IOT059 |	Competitive thing
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:09,407	| IOT059 |	I don't know we don't see a camera on here
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,711	| IOT059 |	Example I don't see any
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,479	| IOT059 |	Fire smoke detector
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,271	| IOT059 |	I don't think that desk
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,039	| IOT059 |	Could resend
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:15,807	| IOT059 |	It's
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,575	| IOT059 |	Program
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:22,207	| IOT059 |	From somebody who has an established thing so you know it's got so many lighting kind of things I don't think that if it
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:25,279	| IOT059 |	Ever decided to introduce a light bulb that I could take all those others back
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:25,791	| IOT059 |	Because
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:28,095	| IOT059 |	Users would probably revolt
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,911	| IOT059 |	So I guess the answer here is
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,703	| IOT059 |	Nest is kind of growing and learning ally
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:34,495	| IOT059 |	The industry as a whole
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,519	| IOT059 |	And I'm guessing
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:38,847	| IOT059 |	What I would look for is the security stuff
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,871	| IOT059 |	They don't have a lot of
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:43,455	| IOT059 |	Security sensors or anything like that so I'd be curious
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:43,967	| IOT059 |	Skitto
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,015	| IOT059 |	How that kids integrated
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,295	| IOT059 |	We don't see a lot of those.
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:47,807	| IOT059 |	Decorations
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,087	| IOT059 |	Travis just
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,391	| IOT059 |	Especially
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,671	| IOT059 |	In light of the
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,999	| IOT059 |	Confucius over there with
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:56,767	| IOT059 |	Getting you
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,559	| IOT059 |	New devices on the house
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,095	| IOT059 |	Launching new devices
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,399	| IOT059 |	Power struggle
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,167	| IOT059 |	Having some of that maybe
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,471	| IOT059 |	But
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:06,751	| IOT059 |	It's interesting to see like this
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,799	| IOT059 |	These moves under those
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:09,823	| IOT059 |	Google sites
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,615	| IOT059 |	It is
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,383	| IOT059 |	I think
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:14,431	| IOT059 |	For a while nested no
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:16,479	| IOT059 |	How it wanted to play the smart home game
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:22,111	| IOT059 |	Seed a little bit to the reality of the industry which people buy one else devices
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:24,159	| IOT059 |	Instead of hugs and hugs are just too hard
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:26,207	| IOT059 |	Plus that's not a strategy they ever really
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,487	| IOT059 |	Working and pursuing
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,279	| IOT059 |	So I don't know
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,047	| IOT059 |	Bassinet stuff
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:34,655	| IOT059 |	I want to talk real fast about some big news that actually happened last week
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,423	| IOT059 |	Which was
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:38,495	| IOT059 |	Amazon web services launched an iot button
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,519	| IOT059 |	Basically
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:42,079	| IOT059 |	It's like the Amazon Dash buttons
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:43,103	| IOT059 |	So those are that
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,127	| IOT059 |	One press button
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:44,895	| IOT059 |	Is that you
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:46,175	| IOT059 |	Can use order like
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:46,943	| IOT059 |	Certain products
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,735	| IOT059 |	Brita water filters
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,503	| IOT059 |	Toilet paper
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,551	| IOT059 |	Do you have a dash button
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:57,183	| IOT059 |	Okay me either I've never been like super excited about it but this
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,999	| IOT059 |	Is basically a programmable button
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,023	| IOT059 |	That connects to
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:06,143	| IOT059 |	The Amazon iot Cloud so Amazon Lambda and what's interesting there
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:08,703	| IOT059 |	Where is it people are super excited about it because
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:11,263	| IOT059 |	Right now getting a device on to Amazon's iot cloud
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:16,639	| IOT059 |	Requires you to get a certificate
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,175	| IOT059 |	Enter the code on the back of this
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,967	| IOT059 |	Iot dash button
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,527	| IOT059 |	And boom your device is online and
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:23,551	| IOT059 |	You can start playing with it
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,319	| IOT059 |	So
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:28,671	| IOT059 |	To me this is kind of fun because it's a marketing move and it also gives you like
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,183	| IOT059 |	Ability to be liked
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:31,487	| IOT059 |	Turn on my Hue Lights
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:32,255	| IOT059 |	Quick
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,023	| IOT059 |	Do that
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,047	| IOT059 |	Exciting
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,839	| IOT059 |	How did the differences
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,119	| IOT059 |	Specifically for Developers
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,911	| IOT059 |	Exodus not something that
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,679	| IOT059 |	You would envision
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:43,263	| IOT059 |	Gettings consumers like this
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:44,287	| IOT059 |	The first step
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,311	| IOT059 |	Amazon
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,103	| IOT059 |	White label e-juice at some point
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:48,127	| IOT059 |	Settings
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:53,759	| IOT059 |	1 this is totally for developers It's 1999
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,039	| IOT059 |	Find a ticket sold out right now
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,831	| IOT059 |	This is to get them to try
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:59,391	| IOT059 |	I forbid you actually have to learn
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:02,463	| IOT059 |	Like so I talked to someone who is set up
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:03,743	| IOT059 |	A Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:07,839	| IOT059 |	As their home automation Hub and they use this to connect
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:09,887	| IOT059 |	Route command
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:13,215	| IOT059 |	From the dash button to AWS Back Down 2
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:16,287	| IOT059 |	Wichita to like their lights
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,055	| IOT059 |	So
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,847	| IOT059 |	They had the three press it's a it's a
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,383	| IOT059 |	One single press
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:20,895	| IOT059 |	A double press
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,431	| IOT059 |	Lawncrest
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,199	| IOT059 |	3 button options
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:28,063	| IOT059 |	They said it was fun but this is also they also pointed out this only has a thousand clicks
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,087	| IOT059 |	Before it runs out of batteries
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,671	| IOT059 |	You throw it out and get it
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:35,999	| IOT059 |	So I don't think this is going to be like this huge thing
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,559	| IOT059 |	Super home because most people don't
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,863	| IOT059 |	Program and you can't just be theirs
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,399	| IOT059 |	GUI interface
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,471	| IOT059 |	Hue Lights over tula
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:46,751	| IOT059 |	The button
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:48,799	| IOT059 |	Programa as easily as I could like
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:54,687	| IOT059 |	But I think it's good because right now in the cloud Wars
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,991	| IOT059 |	The warrior for iot is
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,015	| IOT059 |	The word for develop
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:02,111	| IOT059 |	And this puts Amazon kind of in a stronger position to get them
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:03,903	| IOT059 |	Right now probably
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:05,439	| IOT059 |	Microsoft Azure is one of the
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,463	| IOT059 |	The number one clouds for
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:07,999	| IOT059 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,279	| IOT059 |	And then IBM
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:12,095	| IOT059 |	And its iot foundation
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:12,863	| IOT059 |	Cloud
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:13,631	| IOT059 |	It's probably
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,399	| IOT059 |	Second
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:14,911	| IOT059 |	So
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:19,263	| IOT059 |	Alright yonko you just got back from CVS
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,543	| IOT059 |	Yes
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,823	| IOT059 |	Just got back from Shanghai
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,871	| IOT059 |	I don't even know how many hours ago because
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,687	| IOT059 |	That's quite a jacket
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:28,991	| IOT059 |	But it was sad
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,783	| IOT059 |	Interesting events with cas
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:33,087	| IOT059 |	Obviously everybody knows the main Show in Las Vegas
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:34,879	| IOT059 |	DeSoto
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,647	| IOT059 |	A couple of
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,159	| IOT059 |	Spin-off
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,207	| IOT059 |	Cities around the world
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:43,583	| IOT059 |	But csho tries to be the
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,119	| IOT059 |	The whole wheel trade show
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,655	| IOT059 |	Specific event than Asia
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:47,679	| IOT059 |	Unifocus
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,983	| IOT059 |	And this year
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,007	| IOT059 |	I was there last
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,543	| IOT059 |	Egg for 3 days
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:54,847	| IOT059 |	Show happen
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,383	| IOT059 |	And it's
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:59,199	| IOT059 |	Chinese
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:02,783	| IOT059 |	Oh you got to explain cuz yonko you and I were at CES together so
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:05,087	| IOT059 |	Yes
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:06,879	| IOT059 |	To be honest
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,695	| IOT059 |	I mean it's it's as much smaller show so I think
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,719	| IOT059 |	In Las Vegas today
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:12,511	| IOT059 |	I don't know how to 20000
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,279	| IOT059 |	50000
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,071	| IOT059 |	Attendees every year something
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:18,143	| IOT059 |	Hear that 30000
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,423	| IOT059 |	And was also at
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,959	| IOT059 |	300 exhibitors
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:26,847	| IOT059 |	Magical anyway you could actually see
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,359	| IOT059 |	Almost everyday
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,663	| IOT059 |	But it was a little hard to understand
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:32,223	| IOT059 |	It was in China and
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:32,991	| IOT059 |	That was very
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:33,503	| IOT059 |	The folks on the
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:37,087	| IOT059 |	So I try to find my way around anyway and try to see you
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:41,695	| IOT059 |	Reckful riding outside
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:43,743	| IOT059 |	The media Focus
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:44,767	| IOT059 |	And there wasn't quite as much
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:47,071	| IOT059 |	Ragazza media Austin
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,095	| IOT059 |	Shipping devices
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:48,863	| IOT059 |	Thanks
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:50,399	| IOT059 |	In part because I didn't have any TV stand
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:56,799	| IOT059 |	Exhibiting in Santiago Peak
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:01,663	| IOT059 |	TV's really didn't play that much of a role which was kind of surprising
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:04,991	| IOT059 |	But everything else bad drones
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,271	| IOT059 |	They had IRT they had
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:09,855	| IOT059 |	Weird fun devices to haneda robotic suitcases
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:13,183	| IOT059 |	It was kind of cool it's a it's a suitcase of kind of follows you around
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,719	| IOT059 |	You hold a sensor on your hand and it dries
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,487	| IOT059 |	Behind
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:17,535	| IOT059 |	Tickets at the airport
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:18,815	| IOT059 |	Pretty cool
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,351	| IOT059 |	I like it when is that coming out
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,567	| IOT059 |	Butts
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:31,871	| IOT059 |	A lot of things to be honest that had
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,151	| IOT059 |	Big Sean
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,431	| IOT059 |	Previous in CSS
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,455	| IOT059 |	It was weird
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,503	| IOT059 |	Especially pets
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:40,063	| IOT059 |	You have a lot of Cs and out in all states
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,087	| IOT059 |	You are
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:41,855	| IOT059 |	Twice now together
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:43,903	| IOT059 |	When you franchise a little further into
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:44,671	| IOT059 |	To the hearts
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,439	| IOT059 |	You would like
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,743	| IOT059 |	Who would make a massaging West
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:52,351	| IOT059 |	Well the people who does it go to CSS Rancho de adictos other people with me
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,911	| IOT059 |	Pretty weird products
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,191	| IOT059 |	Interesting stuff
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:03,359	| IOT059 |	And any cool Smart Home Trends or anything like that or was it pretty much the same
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:08,223	| IOT059 |	I think it was a lot of the same things except a lot of
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:10,527	| IOT059 |	Cause of Chinese takes
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:12,319	| IOT059 |	Trends
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,623	| IOT059 |	Pop that has to do with
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,903	| IOT059 |	Light companies.
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:17,439	| IOT059 |	Business
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:22,047	| IOT059 |	So you can look you up
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,071	| IOT059 |	That's right and
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:25,119	| IOT059 |	Facebook Snapchat
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:27,167	| IOT059 |	Just one of those other exam
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,191	| IOT059 |	And then there are big
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,983	| IOT059 |	People have this conception
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,007	| IOT059 |	Chinese cat
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:36,127	| IOT059 |	I think it's partially true partially that's whatever
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,919	| IOT059 |	Anthony. But there are some obvious example
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:40,735	| IOT059 |	Ding dong ding dong
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:41,503	| IOT059 |	Is
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:43,039	| IOT059 |	Did Chinese Amazon Echo
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,575	| IOT059 |	John Bailey
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:46,879	| IOT059 |	And it's made by jd.com
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:47,903	| IOT059 |	Chinese speak
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,183	| IOT059 |	Meijer retailer
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:51,487	| IOT059 |	So they decided to make that one smart speaker
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,279	| IOT059 |	I think the exterior
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:56,607	| IOT059 |	Last year but they just added more capabilities to it
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,655	| IOT059 |	So it's not black
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:13:59,935	| IOT059 |	Wind speed
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:01,983	| IOT059 |	That's not quite as round
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:03,007	| IOT059 |	Olympic death
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:03,775	| IOT059 |	Shape
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:05,311	| IOT059 |	But it does a lot of the same things
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:06,847	| IOT059 |	Ask question
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,127	| IOT059 |	I can't read some stuff
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:09,663	| IOT059 |	The news
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:11,455	| IOT059 |	Korea calendar
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:13,503	| IOT059 |	You can play music on
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,271	| IOT059 |	And
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,295	| IOT059 |	All those things
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,831	| IOT059 |	Thing that you can do which was
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,343	| IOT059 |	Surprising
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:20,671	| IOT059 |	That was the first
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,231	| IOT059 |	That's what everyone does
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:25,279	| IOT059 |	Yeah I think so maybe that's
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:30,399	| IOT059 |	But yeah so they told me they were going to add that as well and
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,679	| IOT059 |	I thought it was interesting
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:33,215	| IOT059 |	Because it's a very popular product
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:34,751	| IOT059 |	The US and
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:37,311	| IOT059 |	Supposedly it's inspiring companies that Google to do the same
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:40,639	| IOT059 |	Officer assaulted by big companies in China
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:44,223	| IOT059 |	Alright well we got to cut this short
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:46,783	| IOT059 |	So thank you so much Uncle for coming in
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:47,551	| IOT059 |	Thanks
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:56,255	| IOT059 |	Hi we're going to have a quick message with Kevin bomber who's CEO of my devices in a quick sponsor
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:56,767	| IOT059 |	Good interview
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:03,167	| IOT059 |	Hey baby how's it going
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,703	| IOT059 |	You're here to talk about cayenne
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:05,983	| IOT059 |	What is cayenne
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:09,567	| IOT059 |	So Kyon is the world's first
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,591	| IOT059 |	Dragon drop
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:12,383	| IOT059 |	Iot project Builder
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:16,223	| IOT059 |	That empowers users to quickly create iot projects
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:17,759	| IOT059 |	So we're literally talking
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:20,575	| IOT059 |	You're taking an iot project Down 2 minutes
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:21,599	| IOT059 |	Instead of
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:22,879	| IOT059 |	Mutts
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:23,903	| IOT059 |	And why did you build this
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:30,303	| IOT059 |	The primary reason is when you look across the landscape of iot platforms are out there there's hundreds of them
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:36,191	| IOT059 |	Organizations who want to start building iot projects just don't want to spend the time or the money
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:40,287	| IOT059 |	Did it takes to get invested in one of these large iot platform
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:42,847	| IOT059 |	So even though ours is a very powerful plant
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:49,247	| IOT059 |	For misery easy to get up and running literally in minutes and we launched this at the end of January 2016 Ranieri
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:53,855	| IOT059 |	20000 developers and we think we're satisfied
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:56,415	| IOT059 |	Create rules and triggers you can do scheduling
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:16:02,815	| IOT059 |	Are you going to visualization and business intelligence so we think it's a great way to get started with an iot project we wanted to be the
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:04,607	| IOT059 |	AutoCAD for iot
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:06,655	| IOT059 |	All right so where can you find Cayenne
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:11,263	| IOT059 |	Stacy the easiest way to get it is to go to my devices. Com
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:15,871	| IOT059 |	Or you can go on to the Google Play Store and search for cayenne
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:22,271	| IOT059 |	From my devices or on the iPhone store so it's available as an app or off of my devices. Com
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:24,831	| IOT059 |	Thank you so much Kevin thank you
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:35,071	| IOT059 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is Stacey Higginbotham and I am here
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:37,375	| IOT059 |	Rick clemmer who is the president in
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,143	| IOT059 |	CEO of Xanax
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:40,191	| IOT059 |	Hey Rick how you doing today
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:40,959	| IOT059 |	Terrific
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:45,055	| IOT059 |	Thanks a lot for having us I'm so excited
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,847	| IOT059 |	VR technology for
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,639	| IOT059 |	I want to ask you so many questions
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,431	| IOT059 |	First let selfie
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:50,943	| IOT059 |	People what NF
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:53,247	| IOT059 |	So our real focus is
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:55,039	| IOT059 |	Providing secure connection
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:17:00,671	| IOT059 |	For the smarter world you know what you call it internet of things we're not really sure what the internet of things really is
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:03,231	| IOT059 |	So we like to call it this morning world which is more include
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:04,767	| IOT059 |	Includes wearables
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,791	| IOT059 |	Include smartrdriver
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:08,095	| IOT059 |	So as we think about
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,887	| IOT059 |	The Internet of Things or is
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,679	| IOT059 |	People like to think about the Internet of Things
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:17,567	| IOT059 |	We actually think about it as a smart of world and how we can make all of our Lives easier and safer and more
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,871	| IOT059 |	Secure okay well that kills my first Quest
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,967	| IOT059 |	Like it's too many things
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:26,271	| IOT059 |	So you guys make all of these chips
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,551	| IOT059 |	You make microprocessor
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:29,343	| IOT059 |	The tiny little brains
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:31,135	| IOT059 |	Who makes sensors
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:33,695	| IOT059 |	We do
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:36,511	| IOT059 |	Secure things that organizes things
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:42,655	| IOT059 |	We do anything else we make the connectivity to be able to do it and importantly we make the security
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:49,311	| IOT059 |	For example the chip that's on if you've recently gotten a bank card that has a chip in it we make
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,847	| IOT059 |	There's a good chance that we make
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:54,431	| IOT059 |	The ship that's on your card in fact if you're in China
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:57,759	| IOT059 |	And you have a contactless card which is more advanced than the US
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,783	| IOT059 |	Payment cards
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:02,111	| IOT059 |	There's a virtually a assurance that it's an egg
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:03,647	| IOT059 |	Picture of associated with it
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:05,439	| IOT059 |	Alright so this week you guys did
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:07,487	| IOT059 |	Really too cool announcement
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:10,303	| IOT059 |	I'm sure you did more than just too cool announcements but I'm thinking about
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:11,327	| IOT059 |	The coolest
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:14,911	| IOT059 |	And one of those was the first of those
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:15,679	| IOT059 |	Was
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,447	| IOT059 |	With a smart car
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,727	| IOT059 |	You guys
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:18,239	| IOT059 |	Have our work
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:19,775	| IOT059 |	Blue Button
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:25,663	| IOT059 |	Department of Defense
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:31,039	| IOT059 |	Department of energy
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,319	| IOT059 |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:39,231	| IOT059 |	Yeah so what we're basically doing is providing the capability for car companies and for the men
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:40,511	| IOT059 |	Manufacturers that are providing
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:42,815	| IOT059 |	Technology for the car companies
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,375	| IOT059 |	Actually have a demonstrated will product
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:48,191	| IOT059 |	So that's the Computing horsepower has them
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:54,079	| IOT059 |	Microcontroller that we use for automotive it also has a microprocessor that's out of her digital networks business
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:57,919	| IOT059 |	It has all kinds of sensor capability and software
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:00,991	| IOT059 |	12 users to really experiment with a.
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,271	| IOT059 |	What's with assisted driving
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,551	| IOT059 |	With automated driving
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:05,855	| IOT059 |	Figure out how you can make driving more safe
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:07,391	| IOT059 |	If you look at that
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:10,207	| IOT059 |	Through basically the third level
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:15,327	| IOT059 |	It's about 80% of the semiconductor content of a completely self-driving car but
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:16,607	| IOT059 |	It really provides
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,119	| IOT059 |	Much more
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:19,935	| IOT059 |	Safety it provides much more assistance
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:23,007	| IOT059 |	What's the driver about 85% of all accidents
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:24,543	| IOT059 |	What's the did happen today
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:26,079	| IOT059 |	Are created by driver error
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:31,199	| IOT059 |	So if we can make the driver smarter but they're running the more information or helping them out
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:32,735	| IOT059 |	It will make driving Cypress
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,015	| IOT059 |	So 80 /
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:34,527	| IOT059 |	Percent of
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:35,807	| IOT059 |	Conductor Conte
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:36,831	| IOT059 |	My car is
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:38,367	| IOT059 |	Adidas today
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:39,647	| IOT059 |	No not today
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:47,071	| IOT059 |	I think when we look at it going forward you know the significant growth engine associated with components
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:49,887	| IOT059 |	Will be in the p****** 8 oz
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:53,471	| IOT059 |	If you look at the Innovations in the automotive industry
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:59,615	| IOT059 |	About 90% of the Innovations in the automotive industry is coming from Electronics today so it's not coming would steal its
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:03,711	| IOT059 |	You know with different forms of them mechanical
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:05,503	| IOT059 |	Platform Electronics
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:06,783	| IOT059 |	Ixtel driving innovation
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,575	| IOT059 |	And the car today but 90% of it
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:12,159	| IOT059 |	It really the area that we see the most opportunity to really
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:13,695	| IOT059 |	Assist drivers in make
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:14,719	| IOT059 |	Driving safety
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:16,255	| IOT059 |	Is in the area beta
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:17,791	| IOT059 |	As we bring
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:18,303	| IOT059 |	More
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:20,607	| IOT059 |	Computing into the car I think we're going to see this
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,423	| IOT059 |	But the car is a really good one
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:25,727	| IOT059 |	What needs
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:27,007	| IOT059 |	How to change about
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:28,031	| IOT059 |	How cars are made
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:30,079	| IOT059 |	How even car manufacturer
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:30,591	| IOT059 |	Think about
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:32,895	| IOT059 |	Vehicles and then also
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,431	| IOT059 |	As a user how should I think
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:34,943	| IOT059 |	About my day
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:41,855	| IOT059 |	Yeah so you know it's really interesting because the user experience if we can help a driver you know I'll give you
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,135	| IOT059 |	One example of its kind of be
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:46,463	| IOT059 |	Extreme so you know we are one of the key semiconductor
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:52,863	| IOT059 |	Suppliers to BMW in the seven series which was the car of the year at the New York Auto Show
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:54,655	| IOT059 |	BMW
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:57,215	| IOT059 |	You're such a good partner that we had an investor day in
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:21:00,287	| IOT059 |	New York and they actually brought that car to show to our investors
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:03,615	| IOT059 |	Because of the capability we have over $300
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:04,895	| IOT059 |	Semiconductor content
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:06,431	| IOT059 |	In the BMW 7 Series
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:11,551	| IOT059 |	And with that the feature you can take the key fob that we manufacture by the way
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:12,063	| IOT059 |	You know better
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:14,879	| IOT059 |	But you can take the key fob and you could actually
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:18,976	| IOT059 |	Park the car so when you approach the parking spot if it was too close
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:22,560	| IOT059 |	She could get out of the car close the door in with the key fob
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:24,096	| IOT059 |	Actually pull your car in a park
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,120	| IOT059 |	Associated with
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:33,056	| IOT059 |	No this is just parking the simple parking spot where there's no closed doors but it also would do parallel parking impact
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:39,712	| IOT059 |	I had that lady I was trying to shesus with my husband can't park the car in the garage so he can use the five to be able to do that so
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:44,576	| IOT059 |	So you know what it's really about making driving safer
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:47,136	| IOT059 |	But things as simple as parking
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,416	| IOT059 |	Is a convenience
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:53,280	| IOT059 |	So we make all of our life easier but really the key features are being able to make it safer
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,560	| IOT059 |	Warning so if your
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:58,144	| IOT059 |	If you happen to doze off or be doing something
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:59,936	| IOT059 |	And you do across a lane
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:01,216	| IOT059 |	Being able to have Lane change warning
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:06,848	| IOT059 |	Stability where somebody stops in front of you and you don't happen to be looking to Auto stopping word
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:07,616	| IOT059 |	Stops your card
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:09,920	| IOT059 |	So that you don't run into another car
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:14,016	| IOT059 |	So that's really the key features that were trying to be able to provide when it comes to the
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:17,856	| IOT059 |	So
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:18,624	| IOT059 |	You're talking to
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:20,672	| IOT059 |	The car maker so I think it's really interesting.
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:23,488	| IOT059 |	Most of my electronics items last
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:27,328	| IOT059 |	Baby 7 years maybe 10 if they're really amazing
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,096	| IOT059 |	And hardened
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,376	| IOT059 |	But my car
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,144	| IOT059 |	Actually last 11 years
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:33,984	| IOT059 |	Right
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:38,848	| IOT059 |	That's about the average age by the way of the US Car Fleet I think
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:40,128	| IOT059 |	So
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:42,688	| IOT059 |	I guess how should they be thinking about it as they add more
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,224	| IOT059 |	More advanced
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:45,504	| IOT059 |	About module
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:52,928	| IOT059 |	So one of the key things that we're trying to do is work with the car company so we provide the Platforms in the technology
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:59,072	| IOT059 |	So they can upgrade that on the Fly and actually was some of the products actually upgrade over there so for example and
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:22:59,840	| IOT059 |	Security
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:03,168	| IOT059 |	There's always hackers are always making progress and Improvement
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:09,824	| IOT059 |	So we actually are trying to develop technology we're over the air or let you know through the network
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:13,152	| IOT059 |	We can actually upgrade the security levels associated with
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:17,248	| IOT059 |	One of the key things in working with car companies after the
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:18,784	| IOT059 |	Hacking incidents that took place last
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:23,136	| IOT059 |	The car companies are very interested in security so we're working
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:26,720	| IOT059 |	With the car companies on a three-tiered approach to be able to make
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:28,512	| IOT059 |	The cars absolutely safer soap
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:31,840	| IOT059 |	For example will put a secure element the same device
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,888	| IOT059 |	As I used on your bank card
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:38,240	| IOT059 |	In conjunction with the input the LTE input into your car
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:40,800	| IOT059 |	ISO that provides that someone can't hack into
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:41,824	| IOT059 |	Qcarbo32
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:42,592	| IOT059 |	Access
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,616	| IOT059 |	We can put
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:44,896	| IOT059 |	Hi security
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:46,176	| IOT059 |	In conjunction with my crew
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:49,504	| IOT059 |	Controller so that the processing knows that any input coming in
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:51,040	| IOT059 |	Is actually supported
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:57,184	| IOT059 |	And actually we're the leader in NBA goal networking you know if you'll have the transceivers in the car because of all the lights
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:57,952	| IOT059 |	Points
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:01,280	| IOT059 |	It's a were actually typing out a product later this year will but
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:04,096	| IOT059 |	The basically the same thing as a secure element
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:04,864	| IOT059 |	We have
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:09,728	| IOT059 |	Which bank cards are electronic passports in conjunction with a transceiver string vehicle networking
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:13,056	| IOT059 |	Subwoofer secure a note in the car so now you don't need that for the
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:13,824	| IOT059 |	Complete Car Care
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:16,384	| IOT059 |	Your electric windows you probably don't care if
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:18,944	| IOT059 |	If that's secure to keep it from being hacked
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:22,784	| IOT059 |	Your mirrors you probably don't care that Jasmine is you know
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,064	| IOT059 |	Prevent that from being hacked
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:26,624	| IOT059 |	But your engine control your breaking your speed
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:29,952	| IOT059 |	Those are things that you want to have control over that somebody can't hack intake
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:32,256	| IOT059 |	Are they thinking about how to
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:34,560	| IOT059 |	Speed up the development process
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:38,656	| IOT059 |	On vehicle because I know right now things are coming out on cars
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:39,168	| IOT059 |	Thought of
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:41,984	| IOT059 |	Really built like 4 years ago
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:45,568	| IOT059 |	Yes it is changing and one of the things that we're working with them
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:48,640	| IOT059 |	Is how to provide that information you if you look at it
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:55,040	| IOT059 |	Historically the car companies have used intermediary electronics companies now they're working with a Semiconductor Company
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,320	| IOT059 |	You still have the
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:58,112	| IOT059 |	Continental Zar Bashas
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:25:00,672	| IOT059 |	For example or delphi's build the product
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:06,304	| IOT059 |	Weather doing is a working with the semiconductor companies to understand that technology and then specifying that
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:10,144	| IOT059 |	To those companies so that the decision process about what they do
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:12,960	| IOT059 |	Is now a shared responsibility associated with
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:14,752	| IOT059 |	But that's really a significant change for
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:15,520	| IOT059 |	For the car companies
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:17,568	| IOT059 |	A lot of the car companies are putting some
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:21,920	| IOT059 |	Lead technologist in Silicon Valley so they know more about what's going out
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:28,320	| IOT059 |	I wanted to things that were excited about the blue box is being able to work with all the car company so they have the ability to
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,856	| IOT059 |	Begin to think about 8oz
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:31,392	| IOT059 |	In automated driving
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:35,744	| IOT059 |	Without having to have a complete architecture of a car but just having a simple
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:37,792	| IOT059 |	Experimental tool that they can use
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:38,304	| IOT059 |	Is to be able to
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:39,840	| IOT059 |	Experience
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:43,168	| IOT059 |	A Dawson the efficiencies of automated driving
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:43,936	| IOT059 |	Eros on demand
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:50,592	| IOT059 |	Alright well let's think about smart cities because you guys are working with the Department of Transportation on the 40 million dollar Grant
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:53,152	| IOT059 |	Smarter cities
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:53,920	| IOT059 |	Trials here
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:54,688	| IOT059 |	Here in the US
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:55,456	| IOT059 |	What do you think of
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:26:02,368	| IOT059 |	You know I think it's a really a phenomenal experience so you know secretary box
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:06,208	| IOT059 |	Department of Transportation that has originated this with this
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:08,768	| IOT059 |	Were they had a grant in the rooster
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:15,168	| IOT059 |	I think it was like maybe 50 or 60 cities across the US that actually applied for this and the finalists were
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:18,496	| IOT059 |	They're so sweet five or six and they ended up with Seven Cities original
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:20,032	| IOT059 |	Nothing we're close enough
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:26,432	| IOT059 |	Could not eliminate down to the absolute by but they have seven cities that are going through this process and what
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:32,832	| IOT059 |	What they've done is we're working with them to be able to provide the technology to each one of these cities so that they can then structure there
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:33,344	| IOT059 |	Proposal
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:37,184	| IOT059 |	To Department of Transportation to be able to facilitate this now
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:39,232	| IOT059 |	In addition to the 40 million dollars
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:45,376	| IOT059 |	Vulcan Ventures going to Paul Allen's companies adding another 10 million out so it's actually a 50 million dollar Grant
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,912	| IOT059 |	The city that Wednesday is
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:49,472	| IOT059 |	So we're working with them where they can drive
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:51,776	| IOT059 |	You smarter driving so the Billet deeper
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:53,056	| IOT059 |	Buses and
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:56,896	| IOT059 |	Police cars and Transit vehicles to be able to communicate with
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,664	| IOT059 |	Each other
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:00,224	| IOT059 |	So that you can prevent accidents so that you
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:01,760	| IOT059 |	Can regulate traffic
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:05,344	| IOT059 |	So that you can provide the capability associate with that but we just announced
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,368	| IOT059 |	What's the today
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,904	| IOT059 |	Soda partnership
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:12,512	| IOT059 |	We had originally we announced a couple months ago after CS with the Department of trash
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:14,304	| IOT059 |	Station we just announced
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:16,096	| IOT059 |	Expanded program with the Department
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:17,632	| IOT059 |	Transportation today
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:18,912	| IOT059 |	So we take some of these
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:21,216	| IOT059 |	Security capability and Technology
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:23,008	| IOT059 |	Need to wear for government documents
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:26,848	| IOT059 |	And expand the program to include that so we're now working with the cities
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:29,408	| IOT059 |	On how they can do Transit ticketing
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:35,808	| IOT059 |	Be able to facilitate that where they can do electronic vacation of government documents you know where the Red Sun
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,832	| IOT059 |	Driver's license
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:37,856	| IOT059 |	Exactly
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:39,136	| IOT059 |	Regulations
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:42,976	| IOT059 |	So then you won't have to worry about you know the the Youth of today
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:46,560	| IOT059 |	You know we're all trying to get their fake driver's license so they can go the bars
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:49,632	| IOT059 |	If we can put a chip in it then you can at least be sure
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:51,680	| IOT059 |	It's really a driver's license
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,448	| IOT059 |	Continue don't have that
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:59,616	| IOT059 |	I know some teenagers who don't like the fact that we're proposing this but in Europe
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,896	| IOT059 |	All drivers license X
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:02,944	| IOT059 |	We have a chip so you can authenticate that
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:03,712	| IOT059 |	Chucky
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:07,552	| IOT059 |	A police officer they can actually scan that to confirm that it's a real device
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:12,672	| IOT059 |	You know it's not like you have the opportunity to have a fake ID
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:13,952	| IOT059 |	Let me ask you
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,232	| IOT059 |	2 questions about
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:17,792	| IOT059 |	Kind of smart cities in actually this relates to driving
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:19,072	| IOT059 |	What about standard
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:21,120	| IOT059 |	Cuz I can see a lot of cities being like
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:22,400	| IOT059 |	Hey
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:28,032	| IOT059 |	We got this reading is even even bigger standard like we're going to use RFID to track people
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,848	| IOT059 |	How do you see
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:33,920	| IOT059 |	Your customers thinking about
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:35,456	| IOT059 |	The fact that people travel from place to
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:37,248	| IOT059 |	Things need to work sort of the
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:42,112	| IOT059 |	Yeah so that's one of the challenges that we have is
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:45,952	| IOT059 |	Is we need to be sure that we can provide the technology whatever it is so you know
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:49,024	| IOT059 |	Iconnectivity yoga all those areas you talk about with
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:50,816	| IOT059 |	Bluetooth or NFC
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:55,424	| IOT059 |	You know that's all connectivity capability until there are standards associated with connectivity
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:56,448	| IOT059 |	Is positive
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:29:03,104	| IOT059 |	But we also have to be sure that the interoperability exist so that you know is you have a electronic wallet on your smartphone
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:05,152	| IOT059 |	Did it came work around the world
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:06,944	| IOT059 |	Night so final question
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:08,480	| IOT059 |	What are you most
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:08,992	| IOT059 |	Excited about
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,832	| IOT059 |	So you know in the next 5 years
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:18,976	| IOT059 |	I think we're going to see a lot of change I think the ability to make all of our Lives safe
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:21,792	| IOT059 |	By having security associated with it
