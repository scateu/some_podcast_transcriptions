EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:49,728	| IOT209 |	Back it up
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:55,616	| IOT209 |	Let's kick it off this week Apple had a big announcement which I didn't even really
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:59,968	| IOT209 |	I was like I don't really need to watch this it is probably not to be hardware-related but
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,992	| IOT209 |	Attitude in
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:01,760	| IOT209 |	Husky
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:03,296	| IOT209 |	And
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:06,368	| IOT209 |	Really
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,136	| IOT209 |	Wall Street
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:10,208	| IOT209 |	Focus on the services Market
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:14,304	| IOT209 |	They offered a subscription service for newspapers newsletters and
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,072	| IOT209 |	Others
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:15,840	| IOT209 |	Subscriptions
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:16,352	| IOT209 |	And
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,376	| IOT209 |	There is now an app
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:21,216	| IOT209 |	And don't forget Apple arcade which is there
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:25,312	| IOT209 |	Subscription for $10 a month to play a hundred or more games
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:33,760	| IOT209 |	I did forget Apple arcade how dare I
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:35,296	| IOT209 |	That's all right
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:38,112	| IOT209 |	See this is this is why we work well together
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:42,976	| IOT209 |	They did have some Hardware came out the week before
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:47,584	| IOT209 |	And none of it was home care to where I accumulated which I think what kind of
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:49,888	| IOT209 |	Become numb to waiting for anything new there
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:53,984	| IOT209 |	Yes I'm not holding my breath
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,032	| IOT209 |	New and improved
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:04:01,920	| IOT209 |	Not the way we had hoped in her so we thought there would be more sensors health-related stuff it's really just
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:06,272	| IOT209 |	Minor improvements in the Bluetooth connectivity in the battery life and
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,552	| IOT209 |	Addition of wireless charging
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:08,576	| IOT209 |	I'll take what I can
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:15,232	| IOT209 |	In-ear devices
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:21,375	| IOT209 |	I would say apple probably isn't because there are devices out there that do offer any other headphones with
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:23,167	| IOT209 |	In your sensors and such but
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:27,263	| IOT209 |	Apple doesn't typically do things until they're ready to do it so clearly they weren't
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:34,431	| IOT209 |	This brings us back to something they did do a long time ago being the Forefront of digital assistants
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,735	| IOT209 |	And haven't done much sense
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,015	| IOT209 |	I saw this news tonight
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:44,159	| IOT209 |	What is all this mean for Siri in the homepod
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:46,719	| IOT209 |	With all of this Services strategy that Apple Isabel
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:56,191	| IOT209 |	I struggle to find really anything
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:05:03,103	| IOT209 |	Siri you're coming sure you can control your Apple TV music subscription and such
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,871	| IOT209 |	My voice
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:04,895	| IOT209 |	That's not new
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:08,223	| IOT209 |	There's nothing Hunt related here so that
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:10,527	| IOT209 |	Another got the homepod out there they seem to have
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:15,391	| IOT209 |	I want to say no dependents because clearly it's there on the market still on for sale but
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:17,695	| IOT209 |	Nothing new is happening with the homepod
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:21,279	| IOT209 |	Nothing really new is happening with Siri
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:22,303	| IOT209 |	2
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:23,583	| IOT209 |	There
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,607	| IOT209 |	Digital assistant
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,911	| IOT209 |	Or homepod with your services right now
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:29,215	| IOT209 |	And that's what kind of surprised me because
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:31,007	| IOT209 |	Amazon for example
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:34,847	| IOT209 |	Has historically made Amazon is the original
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:39,967	| IOT209 |	Delivers products from all over the place and it is a platform that I go to to find all kinds of crazy
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:41,759	| IOT209 |	And it's
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,295	| IOT209 |	Steadily increasing is
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:46,111	| IOT209 |	Scroll trying to take a cut out of every transaction
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,647	| IOT209 |	Jeff Bezos estate
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,183	| IOT209 |	And so
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,463	| IOT209 |	Insomuch as
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:52,511	| IOT209 |	You know we talked about it on the show
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:54,815	| IOT209 |	Amazon's digital assistant
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:59,679	| IOT209 |	It's not yet an integral part of Amazon strategy here
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:02,495	| IOT209 |	Amazon does have a strategy
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:05,567	| IOT209 |	Invoice shopping
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:08,383	| IOT209 |	Isn't so far gaining a lot of ground
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:10,431	| IOT209 |	But I do think it
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:13,759	| IOT209 |	Amazon is collecting device data
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,807	| IOT209 |	And getting it
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,575	| IOT209 |	Users
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:17,599	| IOT209 |	Comfortable with having
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:21,183	| IOT209 |	Advantage more and more of their lives
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:26,815	| IOT209 |	It soon it will manage their shopping or it might just make shopping easier through programs like
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,095	| IOT209 |	Amazon
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:33,215	| IOT209 |	Which is where you have even let Amazon delivery folks into your home
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,263	| IOT209 |	If you have a certified Smart Lock
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:35,775	| IOT209 |	Camera
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,311	| IOT209 |	Orchestra Smart Lock
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:40,383	| IOT209 |	I think I agree with everything you said I think
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:43,199	| IOT209 |	Apple also is a middleman
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,223	| IOT209 |	Poor
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,991	| IOT209 |	Services
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,271	| IOT209 |	End
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:47,807	| IOT209 |	Purchases
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:49,599	| IOT209 |	In a different way
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:52,415	| IOT209 |	Mainly within its own ecosystem in a sentence
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:56,511	| IOT209 |	They obviously have third-party partners with absence on but they get a cut of everything
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:07:01,119	| IOT209 |	Everything you do Apple getting a cut of everything in the iOS ecosystem
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:01,887	| IOT209 |	And
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:07,007	| IOT209 |	They actually did expand beyond their ecosystem in one of their services
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:09,311	| IOT209 |	The Apple TV
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:11,103	| IOT209 |	Is coming to several
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,383	| IOT209 |	Smart TVs
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:13,663	| IOT209 |	So
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,455	| IOT209 |	The different way
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:18,783	| IOT209 |	Expand beyond their platform
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:21,599	| IOT209 |	We saw this with iTunes remember way back when
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,903	| IOT209 |	Finally did a Windows version of iTunes
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:31,583	| IOT209 |	Apple music which was originally beats music and started out on Android is obviously Apple
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,375	| IOT209 |	As well
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:37,215	| IOT209 |	So maybe they're just expanding to other platforms around inner
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:37,983	| IOT209 |	Payment
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:42,591	| IOT209 |	Where is something like Amazon and Google is expanding
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,103	| IOT209 |	Around
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:45,919	| IOT209 |	Their platform encompasses all kinds of other
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:48,223	| IOT209 |	Where is Apple's like new
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:49,759	| IOT209 |	Not going to do it
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,039	| IOT209 |	Corral
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:51,807	| IOT209 |	Correct
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:54,111	| IOT209 |	There's no real crate answer here other than
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,415	| IOT209 |	The services strategy doesn't seem to
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:56,927	| IOT209 |	Incorporated
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,719	| IOT209 |	Really at all
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:05,631	| IOT209 |	Apple is clearly not welcoming the open ecosystem that I think is necessary for this
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,911	| IOT209 |	Successful digital assistant
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,727	| IOT209 |	So I expect
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:14,591	| IOT209 |	Crummy experience there and double down on privacy as the reason
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:19,199	| IOT209 |	Yeah I think that's really good operating procedure for them right now
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:22,271	| IOT209 |	It was worth talking about since everyone loves Apple
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,551	| IOT209 |	I would say
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,575	| IOT209 |	Maybe not.
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:28,415	| IOT209 |	A fun topic
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:29,951	| IOT209 |	Cyber security
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,487	| IOT209 |	So this week
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:36,607	| IOT209 |	We got big news cyberex which is an industrial iot security startup they raised 18 million
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,935	| IOT209 |	Let it around led by Qualcomm
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,495	| IOT209 |	And even capital
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:43,775	| IOT209 |	Which is
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:50,687	| IOT209 |	In cigarettes is a company that I dealt with a lot they do a lot of reports around Industrial iot
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:56,831	| IOT209 |	Viruses malware bad practices all of this stuff
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,623	| IOT209 |	Business Development
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,903	| IOT209 |	It's pretty much a straight up
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:00,927	| IOT209 |	Investment
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,719	| IOT209 |	We expect all the expansion
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:08,351	| IOT209 |	What's interesting about cyber X is it has focused
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:09,375	| IOT209 |	Almost entirely
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,655	| IOT209 |	Industrial
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,679	| IOT209 |	Coyote and
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,215	| IOT209 |	The software monitors net
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:14,751	| IOT209 |	Work traffic on equipment and then
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:17,823	| IOT209 |	Figures out what a normal data flow looks like
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:21,919	| IOT209 |	When the network traffic doesn't follow that behavior is
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:23,967	| IOT209 |	Wait
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:28,063	| IOT209 |	Weird data structures soy
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:32,415	| IOT209 |	If your industrial centrifuge start sending out weird versions of its data
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,951	| IOT209 |	Hyperx Cloud flight
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:37,023	| IOT209 |	And it also looks at who's access
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:38,559	| IOT209 |	Which individuals are a
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,327	| IOT209 |	Accessing
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:39,839	| IOT209 |	The network
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:44,703	| IOT209 |	So it's a pretty broad array of things
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,471	| IOT209 |	Consumers
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:46,751	| IOT209 |	But
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:49,311	| IOT209 |	The reason I pulled this funding is because
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,335	| IOT209 |	We're seeing a
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:55,967	| IOT209 |	Huge need for this as things come online and as things that will formally not connected
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:57,759	| IOT209 |	So
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:02,111	| IOT209 |	MIT technology review actually had a really good overview
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:02,623	| IOT209 |	Triton
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:03,647	| IOT209 |	Malware
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:06,463	| IOT209 |	It was first discovered on Schneider all
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:06,975	| IOT209 |	Electric stuff
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:10,047	| IOT209 |	And basically attacks the safety
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:13,375	| IOT209 |	Systems of the programmable logic controllers
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:13,887	| IOT209 |	That sort of thing
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:19,519	| IOT209 |	Are these are the things that control the big honkin machines that run inside and
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,031	| IOT209 |	Industrial plant
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,311	| IOT209 |	And
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:25,663	| IOT209 |	Damn it story basically whatever I thought about Triton Triton
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:28,479	| IOT209 |	It's malware targets Industrial iot
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,783	| IOT209 |	I didn't think of it as
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,063	| IOT209 |	In quietness alarmist
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,599	| IOT209 |	Language in
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:36,415	| IOT209 |	MIT calls it the most murderous malware
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,463	| IOT209 |	Wow
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,231	| IOT209 |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:41,023	| IOT209 |	It is designed
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,327	| IOT209 |	TLC's are for health and safety
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:47,423	| IOT209 |	Books for physical workers in the plant and also just for making
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:48,191	| IOT209 |	Plant
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,727	| IOT209 |	Operate as it's supposed to
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:53,823	| IOT209 |	So I guess in that sense yes you could blow up a plant
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:57,919	| IOT209 |	Getting a ride to Safety Systems which is what am I
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:59,199	| IOT209 |	Yard list
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,503	| IOT209 |	It's actually
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:03,039	| IOT209 |	Interesting to me that
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:07,135	| IOT209 |	First I was like why are companies like a cyber X looking at
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,415	| IOT209 |	Industrial only
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:13,023	| IOT209 |	But when you explain how it monitors for deviations in data and there were traffic
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,095	| IOT209 |	Total sense that companies like this
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,655	| IOT209 |	Focus on Industrial
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:23,519	| IOT209 |	Oversimplify things but in the smart home you've got so many variables
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:26,591	| IOT209 |	People searching different websites doing different activities etcetera
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:27,871	| IOT209 |	In a plant
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:32,479	| IOT209 |	Things should be doing the same thing mostly the same all the time
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:35,295	| IOT209 |	Innocent little easier to
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:35,807	| IOT209 |	Detect
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:42,463	| IOT209 |	Or look for something is out of the norm I'm curious about what people will companies leaving smart home because of the wide
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,999	| IOT209 |	Variables but
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,023	| IOT209 |	It just makes sense to me now
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:47,071	| IOT209 |	And that's a good one
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:52,703	| IOT209 |	That's not the only thing you should do with industrial iot security probably should have some auditability
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:56,543	| IOT209 |	Around your data that sort of thing and they're definitely companies providing that
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,127	| IOT209 |	There's several layers that
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:03,199	| IOT209 |	Coming to play the Cyber X definitely it's always one
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:09,855	| IOT209 |	The other story so Heather MIT technology review
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,391	| IOT209 |	Potential for harm
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:13,183	| IOT209 |	Prior to this
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,975	| IOT209 |	Aluminum
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:15,743	| IOT209 |	Producer
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:16,511	| IOT209 |	Can aluminum foil
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,047	| IOT209 |	Norsk Hydro
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,583	| IOT209 |	Was struck by ransomware
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,887	| IOT209 |	We're in this ransomware actually
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,423	| IOT209 |	Shut the plant down in
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:28,287	| IOT209 |	Their losses this particular incident have reached
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:31,103	| IOT209 |	40 million US dollars
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:33,151	| IOT209 |	Crazy
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:36,479	| IOT209 |	Basically because their systems were attacked by the ranch
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,527	| IOT209 |	Swear they had to shut things down
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,063	| IOT209 |	And
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,343	| IOT209 |	They're gradually now ramp
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:42,367	| IOT209 |	Production
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:43,647	| IOT209 |	So
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,183	| IOT209 |	There's a lot of question
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:50,303	| IOT209 |	Cyber X will software
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,839	| IOT209 |	In this case
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:54,399	| IOT209 |	If it started behaving weirdly I don't know if it would catch the
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:57,471	| IOT209 |	Before it launched the attack basically
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:00,287	| IOT209 |	Suspect not only because
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:03,615	| IOT209 |	Ransomware is a little bit different in that
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:10,271	| IOT209 |	It won't take actions like in a plant in like you know make a plant grow up instead somebody
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:12,575	| IOT209 |	Has access to take control of the system
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:18,719	| IOT209 |	And can bring shut it down and say I'm not turning back on $1000000 or whatever it is
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:22,559	| IOT209 |	Yeah and you don't even have to attack the actual physical
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,863	| IOT209 |	Plant infrastructure
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:27,167	| IOT209 |	Computers Lakewood database
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:31,007	| IOT209 |	There's to This shows
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,543	| IOT209 |	Two different vectors of attack
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:34,335	| IOT209 |	Equally catastrophic
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,103	| IOT209 |	I shouldn't say
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,895	| IOT209 |	Because you know obviously
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:39,711	| IOT209 |	Oil refinery exploded in spew toxic gases everywhere
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:41,503	| IOT209 |	People that is
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:44,319	| IOT209 |	That's much worse than not having enough Coke cans to
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:46,367	| IOT209 |	But
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,183	| IOT209 |	From a company in an economic perspective
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,719	| IOT209 |	Attacks
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,487	| IOT209 |	Are things you really
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:57,375	| IOT209 |	So it was worth talking about just to kind of drive home how important cybersecurity
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,727	| IOT209 |	Even an industrial system
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:03,775	| IOT209 |	Which may not be connected to the internet
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:08,127	| IOT209 |	Nation states and other hackers are targeting
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:08,895	| IOT209 |	Comes as well
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,175	| IOT209 |	And so
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:13,503	| IOT209 |	It's going to get really interesting
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:20,159	| IOT209 |	Another security over to the Smart Home
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,487	| IOT209 |	Which makes a mesh wi-fi system
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:29,375	| IOT209 |	They announced their own security service
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:31,423	| IOT209 |	A couple weeks back it was not surprising
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:32,703	| IOT209 |	Because
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:35,007	| IOT209 |	Pretty much everybody else Comcast
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:35,519	| IOT209 |	Euro
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,567	| IOT209 |	Other companies I can't think of right now
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:42,431	| IOT209 |	I'll have these types of services and usually monitoring your network traffic
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:43,967	| IOT209 |	They're saying hey
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,527	| IOT209 |	Your thermostat probably should not be talking
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:49,087	| IOT209 |	That's weird
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:50,111	| IOT209 |	Shut that down
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:52,415	| IOT209 |	Who doesn't have one
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:57,023	| IOT209 |	What doesn't have parental controls
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,559	| IOT209 |	Add-on subscription type
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:01,119	| IOT209 |	Security service
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:05,727	| IOT209 |	It does have security features such as parental controls and guest networks and all
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:08,031	| IOT209 |	But what you're describing from plume
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,567	| IOT209 |	I don't know
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:15,967	| IOT209 |	The Google I've never heard Google talk about I'm sure you know I just don't know there's there's no mention of
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:17,759	| IOT209 |	Any over and above tech security
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,295	| IOT209 |	Here's the question
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:22,111	| IOT209 |	A lot of these services
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,903	| IOT209 |	Are predicated on the idea
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:28,511	| IOT209 |	Their services through a service provider and they're also boxes
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:30,815	| IOT209 |	Norton has one of his cloak
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,583	| IOT209 |	Core
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:33,887	| IOT209 |	These are like this and you can buy them
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,423	| IOT209 |	My question is
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,447	| IOT209 |	Do we really need
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:37,983	| IOT209 |	In
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:38,751	| IOT209 |	So far
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:44,127	| IOT209 |	The answer based on my eye so I got the Eero service just to see what it would look
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:46,175	| IOT209 |	The answer seems to be no
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:48,991	| IOT209 |	The things that are getting attached
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:50,271	| IOT209 |	Are my computers and
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:50,783	| IOT209 |	IPhones
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,319	| IOT209 |	B
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:56,415	| IOT209 |	I hope you saw not so much a part of it is because I tend to buy
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:58,719	| IOT209 |	Decent stuff I don't put weird
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:01,023	| IOT209 |	Beauty Brands in my house
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:03,071	| IOT209 |	I know some companies
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:07,679	| IOT209 |	Some of the more well-known iot companies they're actually proactively doing network monitoring
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:10,751	| IOT209 |	So
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:13,567	| IOT209 |	Me doing it as just another layer in in another saying that
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,103	| IOT209 |	I am just one person
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:18,175	| IOT209 |	This is all anecdotal this is not actually true data
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:22,527	| IOT209 |	But so far I haven't seen an attack stops that would really
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,063	| IOT209 |	Warrant
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:29,439	| IOT209 |	Paying for this I think the Avalon of
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:29,951	| IOT209 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,743	| IOT209 |	See that's what I think is
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:36,095	| IOT209 |	Missing
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:37,375	| IOT209 |	And your question about
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:40,191	| IOT209 |	Is a reason necessary I don't know the answer that question
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:43,263	| IOT209 |	That's probably more about personal Comfort level thing
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:46,079	| IOT209 |	But I just went to the Google Wi-Fi security features webpage
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:50,943	| IOT209 |	Firewall WPA2
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:53,247	| IOT209 |	Automatic updates and TLS
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:54,271	| IOT209 |	Communication
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:58,879	| IOT209 |	There's no network monitoring mentioning or anything like that
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:16:59,647	| IOT209 |	Centris
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:03,231	| IOT209 |	Probably do it
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:04,767	| IOT209 |	Civil engineering
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:06,303	| IOT209 |	They're pretty smart people
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:09,119	| IOT209 |	So in some ways I think this is
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,143	| IOT209 |	This could be two things
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:13,727	| IOT209 |	136
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:17,055	| IOT209 |	To get you to buy a subscription
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:21,151	| IOT209 |	And is falls into the need for a subscription Revenue source.
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,175	| IOT209 |	The product
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:25,247	| IOT209 |	Cuz they're trying to continually update these things
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:27,039	| IOT209 |	They're trying to add you services
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:27,551	| IOT209 |	Viable to
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:32,415	| IOT209 |	So include for example his talked about adding a subscription fee
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,183	| IOT209 |	For it
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,975	| IOT209 |	Devices
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,487	| IOT209 |	Which
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:41,887	| IOT209 |	So this could just be a way to legitimize charge
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,167	| IOT209 |	4
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:43,935	| IOT209 |	Charging people
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,519	| IOT209 |	Could be an N actually with
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:51,871	| IOT209 |	You have zero your house I think you pay what $10 a month for similar service
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:53,151	| IOT209 |	Yes
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:56,991	| IOT209 |	How is $60 for the years of $5
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,295	| IOT209 |	Yes but
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,831	| IOT209 |	I do get a blocking
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:01,599	| IOT209 |	I get it
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,367	| IOT209 |	VPN
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:02,879	| IOT209 |	Password
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:05,951	| IOT209 |	I probably get a pony that I haven't paid for
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,743	| IOT209 |	I have it actually picked up yet I do
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:10,303	| IOT209 |	You got horny and you get a pony
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,095	| IOT209 |	So
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:16,703	| IOT209 |	I don't know I'm not sold
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:17,983	| IOT209 |	I'll be real here
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:18,751	| IOT209 |	Nothing
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:20,287	| IOT209 |	I think a lot of our listeners
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:25,407	| IOT209 |	Just based on comments on the website and enter voicemail
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:30,783	| IOT209 |	They actually are concerned again I think it's a personal choice and I think it's probably
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,807	| IOT209 |	Protective than not
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:35,903	| IOT209 |	But I don't pay for Energy Services that's just me personally
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,719	| IOT209 |	Get off work
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,231	| IOT209 |	Go for it
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:43,327	| IOT209 |	I just turn my lights off
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:44,607	| IOT209 |	Not again
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:45,887	| IOT209 |	All right
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:46,911	| IOT209 |	Let's talk about chips
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:51,519	| IOT209 |	At music which is a car in California
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:53,055	| IOT209 |	Powered
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:55,359	| IOT209 |	SOC use for the
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,383	| IOT209 |	Internet of Things
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:19:00,223	| IOT209 |	Solar powered
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:02,527	| IOT209 |	That
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:05,087	| IOT209 |	You can put into an iot device and
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,647	| IOT209 |	I love all of you
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:13,791	| IOT209 |	It's basically the reason you basically designed a chip that could run
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:16,351	| IOT209 |	Bluetooth radio in a small application
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,655	| IOT209 |	Very very very low power
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,959	| IOT209 |	And idea was you could
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,775	| IOT209 |	Battery
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:25,823	| IOT209 |	Small TV
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:27,103	| IOT209 |	TurboTax
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:28,383	| IOT209 |	And we just run forever
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:30,175	| IOT209 |	And that apparently is what they have.
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:32,735	| IOT209 |	I wrote about them a couple months ago
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:33,759	| IOT209 |	High School start
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:38,367	| IOT209 |	6 smart for them to combine photo photovoltaic and in there
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:40,927	| IOT209 |	Article on demand wake up Technologies
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:45,791	| IOT209 |	They say I say
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:47,327	| IOT209 |	200 times lower power
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,607	| IOT209 |	Then other
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,887	| IOT209 |	Relating of similar Champs
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:50,911	| IOT209 |	Sound
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:53,471	| IOT209 |	And it basically the idea here is
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:54,751	| IOT209 |	If you're going to have a sensor
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:20:01,663	| IOT209 |	And you're going to have a billion
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,711	| IOT209 |	You cannot be changing their batteries all the time
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,991	| IOT209 |	You just got to set it and forget it
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:06,271	| IOT209 |	And that
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:07,551	| IOT209 |	What does technology could help
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:12,415	| IOT209 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,439	| IOT209 |	Robot
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:19,327	| IOT209 |	Which of course I love to talk about so I was very interested in this
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,119	| IOT209 |	A story from earlier this week
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:23,423	| IOT209 |	Google AI blog
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:26,239	| IOT209 |	Showing off the lot
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:30,847	| IOT209 |	Which is exactly what it sounds like
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:33,919	| IOT209 |	Initially the robot did not know how to
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:35,967	| IOT209 |	Toss the right items into
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:38,527	| IOT209 |	The appropriate bin when sorting things
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:41,599	| IOT209 |	But using Google's AI
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:44,671	| IOT209 |	About ten thousand grass and throw attempts
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:47,231	| IOT209 |	14 hours that took of training time
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:48,255	| IOT209 |	They now
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:51,583	| IOT209 |	Show that the passing by has four C's of
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:53,119	| IOT209 |	Up to 85%
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:54,143	| IOT209 |	And
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:56,959	| IOT209 |	That's amazing to me because in such a short time
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:02,079	| IOT209 |	This arm has learned how to properly sort things into the right boxes
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:05,151	| IOT209 |	Certified cell phone by analyzing
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:06,687	| IOT209 |	Results over time
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,991	| IOT209 |	Ann supervised learning
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:12,575	| IOT209 |	That's what I do everyday unsupervised learning
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:16,159	| IOT209 |	I just think about you all these massive warehouses where we have
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:19,744	| IOT209 |	People going around
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:20,768	| IOT209 |	Turn on the picking
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,304	| IOT209 |	Of products and what not
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:26,656	| IOT209 |	I know they've got some robots in those warehouses and all but when you start combining
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:31,776	| IOT209 |	The mobility of a robot then with the self-learning of hay and I can go pick this product I know where it is
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:33,312	| IOT209 |	Yes ma'am
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:39,456	| IOT209 |	Just think about it and recycling right now
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:46,880	| IOT209 |	Like a huge percentage of recycling isn't sorted correctly so if we can somehow automate that so people don't have to
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,392	| IOT209 |	To do it
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:51,744	| IOT209 |	Cuz it's like Yaki job no one really wants it
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:55,840	| IOT209 |	We could actually lower the total cost of recyclables Witchwood
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:56,864	| IOT209 |	Presumably
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:59,168	| IOT209 |	Encourages to recycle more
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:21:59,936	| IOT209 |	Yay
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:02,752	| IOT209 |	Absolutely there's a lot of potential here
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:08,128	| IOT209 |	Any of the downside is that there are currently people that have jobs that do these types of things
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:10,176	| IOT209 |	Honest I think people could probably better spend their
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:12,992	| IOT209 |	Doing other things
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:14,272	| IOT209 |	So I love this
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:16,064	| IOT209 |	They should start a podcast
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:16,576	| IOT209 |	It's all the rage
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:17,856	| IOT209 |	All right
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:19,136	| IOT209 |	Hey
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:21,440	| IOT209 |	Other robots these robots are flying robot
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:23,232	| IOT209 |	Yes
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:27,328	| IOT209 |	You saw the UPS Now using drones for medical Palos
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,352	| IOT209 |	I did
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:30,400	| IOT209 |	Does this mean I get my new kidney deliver via drone
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:33,472	| IOT209 |	It wouldn't be delivered to your home
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:39,104	| IOT209 |	The Drone could actually deliver to the hospital if you're getting a kidney transplant
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:40,128	| IOT209 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:44,224	| IOT209 |	There are some limitations here granted this is all part of
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:46,784	| IOT209 |	Under the FAA as well just got approval
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:48,320	| IOT209 |	I should say that
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:50,112	| IOT209 |	Test program right now but
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:51,136	| IOT209 |	The drowning
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:54,464	| IOT209 |	Paramedical payloads up to about 5 lb
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,768	| IOT209 |	So maybe a couple kidneys on
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:59,840	| IOT209 |	Over distances up to about 12 and a half miles so
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:02,144	| IOT209 |	Specific
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:05,216	| IOT209 |	But lots and lots of potential in a very
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:08,800	| IOT209 |	Time efficient manner for something that mean when you need
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:12,640	| IOT209 |	Say that kidney or a heart or whatever it might be
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:17,760	| IOT209 |	When you see the kidney call UPS
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:19,808	| IOT209 |	It's a very specialized but important
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,600	| IOT209 |	I'm having impactful
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,368	| IOT209 |	Project right now
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:24,416	| IOT209 |	Yeah I just looked at the
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:30,048	| IOT209 |	Average weight of an adult human kidney is a quarter pound
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:31,840	| IOT209 |	Dry ice
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:32,864	| IOT209 |	Whatever
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:34,912	| IOT209 |	I don't know how to dress
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:38,240	| IOT209 |	Order 3 and get a discount I mean come on
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:38,752	| IOT209 |	Free shipping
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,568	| IOT209 |	This makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:42,336	| IOT209 |	Especially in
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,360	| IOT209 |	Anybody who set
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:45,664	| IOT209 |	Just in New York or San Francisco traffic
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:48,480	| IOT209 |	Literally literally
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:53,600	| IOT209 |	What else
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:54,624	| IOT209 |	Oh
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,928	| IOT209 |	Speaking of New York City
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:24:00,000	| IOT209 |	Police Department is using AI to detect
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:01,280	| IOT209 |	Crime
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:02,816	| IOT209 |	Patterns
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:03,584	| IOT209 |	Which
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:05,120	| IOT209 |	You seem very excited by this
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:12,032	| IOT209 |	Interesting and obits
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:16,384	| IOT209 |	Yeah but the New York Police Department Ashley
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:18,432	| IOT209 |	Said this month that they're using
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:19,456	| IOT209 |	Attract
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,736	| IOT209 |	Crimes and Spa
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:24,576	| IOT209 |	They've been doing it since late 2016 which I found
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,112	| IOT209 |	Very interesting
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,136	| IOT209 |	They call this
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:30,464	| IOT209 |	Modernizr is not obviously spelled correctly
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:33,024	| IOT209 |	Starts up things in spells incorrectly so
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:35,072	| IOT209 |	Nicr after the work pattern
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:41,216	| IOT209 |	There's some people who are rightly concerned about racial biases being reinforced
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:44,544	| IOT209 |	It's going to open up things to a lot of
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:45,312	| IOT209 |	Scrutiny
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:48,640	| IOT209 |	Make the world
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:50,432	| IOT209 |	I think we're going to see very starkly
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:52,480	| IOT209 |	We have
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:56,064	| IOT209 |	Structured our society disadvantage some people over others
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:57,600	| IOT209 |	And
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:25:00,672	| IOT209 |	I think when put in very black-and-white terms through
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:02,464	| IOT209 |	Data analysis
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:06,560	| IOT209 |	Will no longer be able to lie to ourselves and say that this is an individual's fault
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:09,632	| IOT209 |	And we'll have to start looking at culpability of us as a society
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:12,704	| IOT209 |	Which could be interesting or we could just shrug our shoulders
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:18,336	| IOT209 |	I will say even though I think I should have disclosed this making 2016
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:20,896	| IOT209 |	The police department is taking up
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:24,736	| IOT209 |	Slow approach in using us because they're not
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,272	| IOT209 |	Using it for crimes
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,040	| IOT209 |	Such as
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,064	| IOT209 |	Recent homicides
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:31,648	| IOT209 |	They are basically using to track petty larceny is to
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:36,000	| IOT209 |	Ingest data and gather analyzing and so on so
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:39,328	| IOT209 |	That's probably wise but
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:41,888	| IOT209 |	Doing the wrong thing
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:43,168	| IOT209 |	The measured approach
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:44,960	| IOT209 |	Speaking of data
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:46,240	| IOT209 |	McDonald's
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:47,520	| IOT209 |	Smitty big acquisition
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:52,128	| IOT209 |	Yes
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:53,664	| IOT209 |	McDonald's is acquiring dynamic
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:55,968	| IOT209 |	Which
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:57,504	| IOT209 |	Analyzes
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:58,528	| IOT209 |	Names of data

EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:04,672	| IOT209 |	Based on
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:06,720	| IOT209 |	Weather time of day
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:07,488	| IOT209 |	What you ordered
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:12,352	| IOT209 |	Yeah it's rather smart use of external data
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:16,448	| IOT209 |	What happens at the drive-in
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,544	| IOT209 |	Define often
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:22,336	| IOT209 |	I don't know once a week
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:22,848	| IOT209 |	Once a month
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:32,064	| IOT209 |	I go there too often
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:34,624	| IOT209 |	Bentley and publicly minutes and that's all I'm going to say on that
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:37,952	| IOT209 |	Okay Kevin I would like you

EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,264	| IOT209 |	This week's question is
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,288	| IOT209 |	From Joe
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:57,312	| IOT209 |	Let's hear it
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,360	| IOT209 |	Hello Stacy and Kevin
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:00,384	| IOT209 |	This is Joe
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:02,432	| IOT209 |	And you may use the song the show
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:05,504	| IOT209 |	I recently had motorized
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:07,296	| IOT209 |	Z-Wave window blinds
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:07,808	| IOT209 |	Install
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:11,904	| IOT209 |	And was able to connect them to my wake up without problem
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:14,720	| IOT209 |	However I was disappointed
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:16,512	| IOT209 |	That the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,536	| IOT209 |	Discover.
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:22,400	| IOT209 |	I was hoping for them to be found at least that's what you heard Z-Wave device
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:24,192	| IOT209 |	They could be voice
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:24,960	| IOT209 |	Bald
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:26,240	| IOT209 |	To turn on off
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:28,032	| IOT209 |	Raise or lower the blinds
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:31,360	| IOT209 |	And I could find no related madam
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:31,872	| IOT209 |	Skill
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:33,664	| IOT209 |	La poblana
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:35,200	| IOT209 |	Manufacturers Graber
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:38,016	| IOT209 |	Z-Wave motor by others
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:39,040	| IOT209 |	Valley Football
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:42,112	| IOT209 |	I was wondering if you had any tips or tricks
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:46,208	| IOT209 |	To get the echo to recognize the Z-Wave motor
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:47,488	| IOT209 |	Text
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:49,280	| IOT209 |	Ojo I have been there
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:54,912	| IOT209 |	Exactly where you are now I have connected my selfie blinds to my wink home hub
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,960	| IOT209 |	And I did it in a weird way
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:59,264	| IOT209 |	As a zwave device and
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:02,080	| IOT209 |	Not only can I not connect it to Madame a
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:03,360	| IOT209 |	I also
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:05,152	| IOT209 |	Have it backwards
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:06,176	| IOT209 |	So instead of
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:08,736	| IOT209 |	Can I say open the blinds in the app
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:10,784	| IOT209 |	It actually closes the blinds in real life
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,576	| IOT209 |	Is apparently unknown
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:13,856	| IOT209 |	Law that happens to Lots
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:15,904	| IOT209 |	Yay
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:17,952	| IOT209 |	But isn't that what you're asking
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:19,744	| IOT209 |	You would like for it to work with Madam a
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:21,024	| IOT209 |	And here we have good news
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:25,632	| IOT209 |	Yeah the good news is you can get it working with Madam a
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:26,912	| IOT209 |	Will Google home if you prefer
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:32,800	| IOT209 |	The bad news is you can't do it with have to do it with SmartThings
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:34,336	| IOT209 |	So yes unfortunately
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:38,176	| IOT209 |	That's because the way wink
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:40,736	| IOT209 |	Actually sees that device just
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:43,552	| IOT209 |	Treats it as
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:45,600	| IOT209 |	It's a generic Z-Wave
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:48,672	| IOT209 |	And the challenges wink support
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:52,256	| IOT209 |	Madame only for supported
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:53,024	| IOT209 |	Lights
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:53,536	| IOT209 |	So
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:55,840	| IOT209 |	You can do a lighting shortcut
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:58,656	| IOT209 |	As long as the lights are supported in granted
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:29:59,424	| IOT209 |	Youku
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:03,264	| IOT209 |	Make your Z-Wave device look like a light but it still isn't
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,032	| IOT209 |	Supported by
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:05,056	| IOT209 |	So it won't actually work
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:10,688	| IOT209 |	Right and technically it doesn't quite work with SmartThings
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:15,808	| IOT209 |	Unless you actually change it to a dimmer switch in SmartThings there's
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:20,416	| IOT209 |	A device Handler that that handles this so you don't even have to change it to a dimmer switch
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:24,000	| IOT209 |	Install that and so on
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:26,048	| IOT209 |	So you can change it to a dimmer switch
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:28,096	| IOT209 |	Things and then it would work
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:33,728	| IOT209 |	That's a terrible answer because I know you have as well
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:38,336	| IOT209 |	Unfortunately you know it's not crazy expensive I think it's 99 bus right now
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:40,896	| IOT209 |	Sometimes it's even as low as 70
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:46,016	| IOT209 |	Right now I mean actually mine cortical SmartThings Hub cost me $10 because
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:48,576	| IOT209 |	I bought the USB SmartThings link
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:50,112	| IOT209 |	Spectacles into an Android TV
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:51,392	| IOT209 |	So
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:52,416	| IOT209 |	That made it a hub
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,464	| IOT209 |	I think that was
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:55,744	| IOT209 |	Especially
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:57,280	| IOT209 |	Because they like me
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:59,584	| IOT209 |	No like it was like the holidays
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:04,448	| IOT209 |	So they don't like me I think you're right it maybe like 30 or $40 that USB stick
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:07,776	| IOT209 |	I don't know their opinions on you kept sorry
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:12,896	| IOT209 |	For the day sorry about that
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:13,920	| IOT209 |	And
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:19,552	| IOT209 |	You know you can maybe you'll just invest in the Ikea blinds when they come out in August
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:20,064	| IOT209 |	Stand
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,856	| IOT209 |	That should work
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:22,880	| IOT209 |	With Madeline
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:30,048	| IOT209 |	I would replace my Hub before I replace my blind cuz I have a feeling those blinds for the motor for that probably wasn't going to
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:30,816	| IOT209 |	Expensive
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:31,328	| IOT209 |	That is true
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:33,120	| IOT209 |	That's why I'm still stuck with
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:34,400	| IOT209 |	Janky setup
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:35,936	| IOT209 |	Psy
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:36,960	| IOT209 |	All right
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:39,264	| IOT209 |	Well that's it for that
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:43,872	| IOT209 |	Time to Say Goodbye Tevin and then hear from our guest Steve Mueller
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:47,200	| IOT209 |	Who is the head of innovation at Fort Rock we're going to be talking about
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:50,272	| IOT209 |	Why you won't be entering as many passwords
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:51,296	| IOT209 |	In the near future
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,624	| IOT209 |	You
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:56,416	| IOT209 |	The first
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:58,208	| IOT209 |	A message from our sponsor
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:00,768	| IOT209 |	This week sponsor is a pharaoh
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:09,984	| IOT209 |	Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from this week's podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is a
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:12,288	| IOT209 |	Pharaoh and I have a pharaoh CEO
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:13,056	| IOT209 |	Jailbreak
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:14,336	| IOT209 |	Here to talk to us
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,896	| IOT209 |	Data and AI
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:21,760	| IOT209 |	So Jo you and I've been having a series of conversations including on Topix
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:23,552	| IOT209 |	Bank of things
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:27,392	| IOT209 |	Using Bluetooth low energy to create a secure payment platform
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:30,720	| IOT209 |	And the platform approach to iot
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:34,560	| IOT209 |	And this week I'd love to talk about data analytics and AI
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:35,840	| IOT209 |	But first
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:38,912	| IOT209 |	Would you remind our listeners what it is that a pharaoh does
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:45,056	| IOT209 |	Yeah a pharaoh provides and iot platform that simplifies how you connect anything to the internet
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:47,360	| IOT209 |	We can help you build business cases take you
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,896	| IOT209 |	You all the way through roll out
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:51,200	| IOT209 |	Mongoloid management of your entire fleet of devices
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:52,736	| IOT209 |	As well as data analytics
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:58,880	| IOT209 |	Customers tell us that a pharaoh is the best choice for into end-user experience and developer productivity
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:00,416	| IOT209 |	And it's also beautiful design
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:01,952	| IOT209 |	Really easy to use
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:02,720	| IOT209 |	Fast
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:03,744	| IOT209 |	And very very secure
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:09,632	| IOT209 |	SoJO there's no AI without data increasingly there's not enough data without iot
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:13,472	| IOT209 |	So can you explain for us the relationship between these two
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:13,984	| IOT209 |	Concepts
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:15,776	| IOT209 |	Why do we care about art
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:20,896	| IOT209 |	Machine learning AI ultimately gives us insights that we can use to achieve objective
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:24,736	| IOT209 |	But what do we have to feed a i with we have to feed it with structured data
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:31,392	| IOT209 |	And where does that structure data come from what comes from anywhere anything that can generate in one of the biggest problems that we have with
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:32,416	| IOT209 |	IRT
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:36,256	| IOT209 |	Is structuring the date of the right way many other iot Solutions
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:37,792	| IOT209 |	Allow the developer to just
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,840	| IOT209 |	Send free form data up to
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,632	| IOT209 |	The cloud the hazard with
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:47,776	| IOT209 |	Yes is that the developer doesn't always think through how the data should be structured to best serve
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:50,848	| IOT209 |	Artificial intelligence engine and without that
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:51,872	| IOT209 |	Planning and forethought
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:53,664	| IOT209 |	It's very easy
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:54,688	| IOT209 |	To create
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:56,480	| IOT209 |	A huge amount of data
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:58,784	| IOT209 |	But either has to be normalized before
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:00,064	| IOT209 |	Can be used by AI
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:01,344	| IOT209 |	Or in the worst-case
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:02,112	| IOT209 |	Just can't be used at all
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:04,160	| IOT209 |	So a pharaoh takes a different
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:04,928	| IOT209 |	Approach
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:05,696	| IOT209 |	How does a pharaoh
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:07,232	| IOT209 |	In many a i
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,536	| IOT209 |	What's the date of that you're dealing with
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:11,072	| IOT209 |	Comes without much contacts
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:11,840	| IOT209 |	Attached to it
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:13,888	| IOT209 |	Now she wants may be aware of the contacts
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:15,168	| IOT209 |	But the metadata to do
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:16,448	| IOT209 |	Describe it just isn't there
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:17,472	| IOT209 |	The best possible
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:19,520	| IOT209 |	What solution is to have what we call structured data
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:23,360	| IOT209 |	Where there's a data schema in each field is labeled and understood
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:26,176	| IOT209 |	From the outset
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:28,480	| IOT209 |	Affero guides the developer through giving
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:30,016	| IOT209 |	Each captured data element
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:30,784	| IOT209 |	That needed Kant
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:32,064	| IOT209 |	In this way
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:34,368	| IOT209 |	Data captured using a pharaoh
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:40,256	| IOT209 |	Is already ready to be used with AI machine learning and also used in conjunction with other structured data sources
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:45,888	| IOT209 |	These have been great before we go please remind us where people can go to
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:47,168	| IOT209 |	To get more information about it
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:49,728	| IOT209 |	You can always go to
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:51,008	| IOT209 |	Acero. IO
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:52,800	| IOT209 |	/ Go - big
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:53,568	| IOT209 |	As a great place to start
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:55,360	| IOT209 |	If you're a developer
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:57,920	| IOT209 |	Check out developer. Afero. IO
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:35:02,016	| IOT209 |	And you can check out all the resources that we have on a pharaoh. IO
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:13,792	| IOT209 |	Would welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:18,656	| IOT209 |	Is Eve Baylor who is VP of innovation and emerging technology
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:20,448	| IOT209 |	At Fort Rock
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:21,472	| IOT209 |	Hi and how are you doing
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:24,800	| IOT209 |	I'm great thanks Davie High everybody
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,568	| IOT209 |	So
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:26,592	| IOT209 |	She
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:30,944	| IOT209 |	If you guys haven't recalled she was on the show before probably about a year ago and we talked about
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:31,968	| IOT209 |	Identity
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:35,552	| IOT209 |	And I really thought we have to solve this problem by now but
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:37,088	| IOT209 |	I still have so many
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,624	| IOT209 |	Passwords so
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:40,928	| IOT209 |	Much difficulty logging on two devices
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:43,488	| IOT209 |	Multiple times in a month
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:46,304	| IOT209 |	I'm actually getting more frustrated not less
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:47,072	| IOT209 |	So
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:47,840	| IOT209 |	We're going to talk about
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:50,656	| IOT209 |	Why that is and maybe some of the
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:51,424	| IOT209 |	Technology
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:52,448	| IOT209 |	That might help make it better
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:53,728	| IOT209 |	That sound good
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:56,544	| IOT209 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:36:01,152	| IOT209 |	Year people been working on it for maybe 15-20 years
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:04,224	| IOT209 |	By golly these are smart people they should be here by now
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:09,088	| IOT209 |	We've solved all kinds of other problems I feel like the best place to start is to break down
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:12,160	| IOT209 |	Infer definition
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:15,488	| IOT209 |	Thanks when I think about logging into things and lie, that's my identity on these devices
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:18,560	| IOT209 |	Nope that's Authentication
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:20,096	| IOT209 |	So let's tell me the difference between the two
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:22,144	| IOT209 |	So you know
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:23,680	| IOT209 |	Identity
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:28,032	| IOT209 |	The information that represents you that the stuff that's true
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:29,056	| IOT209 |	Entrusted
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:30,080	| IOT209 |	About you
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:33,664	| IOT209 |	Authentication is the active
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:48,512	| IOT209 |	And what the companies that want you to prove that you're you to them want to do with that information
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:49,280	| IOT209 |	Is
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:50,816	| IOT209 |	Experience
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:53,120	| IOT209 |	And give you a personalized experience
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:57,984	| IOT209 |	And they want your partner in this
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:37:00,544	| IOT209 |	Help you pay for things that help you have
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:02,336	| IOT209 |	An experience that is connected
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:11,808	| IOT209 |	It can happen
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:14,880	| IOT209 |	Continuously
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:15,904	| IOT209 |	The beginning of
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:21,536	| IOT209 |	Quicken YouTube about username and password
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:24,608	| IOT209 |	Stop music at the beginning of a session
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:25,120	| IOT209 |	At least
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:28,448	| IOT209 |	With that company that were having a digital experience
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:32,032	| IOT209 |	Okay let's talk about that because this was an article that
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:33,312	| IOT209 |	Really resonated with me
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:34,080	| IOT209 |	With my
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:36,896	| IOT209 |	I don't know 60 some-odd devices in my house and
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:39,200	| IOT209 |	And I am constantly being asked to
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:42,272	| IOT209 |	Authenticate myself to them
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:46,624	| IOT209 |	What is going on in this article the writer promise
EDL	00:37:47,136	00:37:47,648	| IOT209 |	Outline the problem
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:51,488	| IOT209 |	And then he said but guys it's going to get better cuz we have new standards
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:52,000	| IOT209 |	It's coming along
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:54,560	| IOT209 |	So explain to me
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:55,584	| IOT209 |	First
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:57,632	| IOT209 |	Why all these companies need me to like
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:37:58,400	| IOT209 |	Constantly login
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:37:59,936	| IOT209 |	Account goodlord
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:04,544	| IOT209 |	Yeah it is it is kind of constant cuz there's so many companies
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:10,688	| IOT209 |	He did mention that a sign in with Facebook button how he's never going to do it
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:11,456	| IOT209 |	Do that
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:12,736	| IOT209 |	And that enables
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:17,600	| IOT209 |	Companies
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:18,880	| IOT209 |	Multiple town
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:21,696	| IOT209 |	So when I login with Facebook and Google then they get all that
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:22,464	| IOT209 |	Data about
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:23,232	| IOT209 |	Where I'm going right
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:25,792	| IOT209 |	David that where you're going
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:29,376	| IOT209 |	And the companies that leverage that's fine with whoever button
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:30,656	| IOT209 |	They're getting data
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:39,104	| IOT209 |	Units of mutual benefit for Facebook on Google
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:40,128	| IOT209 |	And then
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:42,176	| IOT209 |	You get the benefit of having service
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:43,456	| IOT209 |	Easier sign in
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:44,480	| IOT209 |	Experience
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:48,832	| IOT209 |	I guess you could say the mutual benefit all around but there's also some privacy
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:53,952	| IOT209 |	Yeah I'd rather use like a password manager or maybe have
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:54,720	| IOT209 |	Chrome
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:56,000	| IOT209 |	12 Chrome keeps my
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:57,536	| IOT209 |	Information that I've shared
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:38:58,048	| IOT209 |	Google
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:04,192	| IOT209 |	Give you the choice of buying with Facebook as a button
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:05,216	| IOT209 |	Versus
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:10,592	| IOT209 |	You know creating a whole new password and you know not using
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:15,200	| IOT209 |	It's good to have a choice because
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:15,968	| IOT209 |	Puppies
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:19,040	| IOT209 |	And I tend to be more private
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:24,416	| IOT209 |	And not take that off
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:26,720	| IOT209 |	The author the Facebook of the Google button
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:32,864	| IOT209 |	So I tend not to use that because I don't want to share Facebook information with Google information
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:38,240	| IOT209 |	Calling again
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:45,152	| IOT209 |	It really is an authentication problem
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:46,176	| IOT209 |	Enter
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:50,016	| IOT209 |	And you don't want any friction and entering the Third
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:53,088	| IOT209 |	Enough work another solution to the problem
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:57,696	| IOT209 |	India password manager
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:39:58,464	| IOT209 |	People
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:02,816	| IOT209 |	Often times I recommended on data privacy day
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:06,400	| IOT209 |	When everybody I'm not a security professional
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:06,912	| IOT209 |	Professional
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:09,728	| IOT209 |	Well you know
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:13,824	| IOT209 |	Password managers that can help you in a reduced fraction
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:15,104	| IOT209 |	Okay
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:17,920	| IOT209 |	In that particular article this is not the solution they talk
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:22,272	| IOT209 |	What about coming to save us all from the charity of having eight thousand
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:24,064	| IOT209 |	And remembering them all
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:24,576	| IOT209 |	Edamame
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:25,856	| IOT209 |	So
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:31,232	| IOT209 |	New standard actually called
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:33,280	| IOT209 |	Web
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:35,072	| IOT209 |	Uth which was
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:38,912	| IOT209 |	Sedimented into the World Wide Web Consortium
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:43,776	| IOT209 |	And that is helping you too
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:45,568	| IOT209 |	More
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:50,176	| IOT209 |	Including some biometric
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:51,712	| IOT209 |	Indication
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:55,040	| IOT209 |	Fingerprint
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:56,320	| IOT209 |	Facial recognition
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:58,368	| IOT209 |	Into the browser
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:40:59,392	| IOT209 |	Which is where we have
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:01,184	| IOT209 |	Call me
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:04,768	| IOT209 |	And so
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:07,840	| IOT209 |	Standardization
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:14,240	| IOT209 |	As of last week and the browser makers have been fighting
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:15,520	| IOT209 |	Watershed forgetting
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:17,568	| IOT209 |	Stronger methods
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:19,616	| IOT209 |	Username password
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:20,640	| IOT209 |	To be supported
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:23,200	| IOT209 |	That's actually really good
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:26,528	| IOT209 |	The future of Authentication
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:33,184	| IOT209 |	Let's talk about this a little bit because there's things that need to happen for
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:33,696	| IOT209 |	45802
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:34,976	| IOT209 |	1
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:37,792	| IOT209 |	People have to implement it on the browser side
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:38,304	| IOT209 |	End
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:39,328	| IOT209 |	On the
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:42,400	| IOT209 |	Application side or is there device side
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:43,680	| IOT209 |	Aspects like
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:46,496	| IOT209 |	What needs to happen for phyto to actually
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:49,824	| IOT209 |	Work for an individual or an individual's device
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:51,616	| IOT209 |	And then the second thing is
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:52,895	| IOT209 |	It's only works right now
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:54,431	| IOT209 |	Browser-based
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:55,967	| IOT209 |	And so what is that
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:41:59,807	| IOT209 |	The biggest
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:02,879	| IOT209 |	I would say I've been
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:03,647	| IOT209 |	Browser maker
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:06,207	| IOT209 |	Powerful
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:07,743	| IOT209 |	Do what they want
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:09,279	| IOT209 |	And
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:10,303	| IOT209 |	Getting browser
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:11,839	| IOT209 |	Change
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:13,631	| IOT209 |	I was going to be?
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:18,495	| IOT209 |	Absorb
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:26,175	| IOT209 |	I think that this barrier is going to fall
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:29,759	| IOT209 |	In the case of
EDL	00:42:30,527	00:42:32,063	| IOT209 |	Applications
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:39,743	| IOT209 |	NetSpend
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:41,535	| IOT209 |	Tazewell Virginia
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:42,303	| IOT209 |	And I think that we can
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:47,935	| IOT209 |	Master cycle of incorporating
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:49,727	| IOT209 |	Then we can expect
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:55,103	| IOT209 |	Generally what we see is that
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:59,455	| IOT209 |	I can't rely on
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:02,527	| IOT209 |	Smartphones and applications on mobile devices
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:04,831	| IOT209 |	I think I'll be able to take advantage
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:09,695	| IOT209 |	Okay so I could have
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:10,463	| IOT209 |	This additional at
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:11,231	| IOT209 |	Application even
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:11,743	| IOT209 |	If I'm signing in
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:13,791	| IOT209 |	Okay
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:16,095	| IOT209 |	So here's where things get
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:16,607	| IOT209 |	Billy fun
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:19,167	| IOT209 |	Not only am I asked like
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:20,959	| IOT209 |	Buy devices to Lake login
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:25,311	| IOT209 |	Things like I've let you out for your own safety which is fine I get it
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:27,359	| IOT209 |	So I'm logging into individual apps
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:28,639	| IOT209 |	But then
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:30,687	| IOT209 |	Another layer
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:34,015	| IOT209 |	Sometimes I want to link my apps together so I'm like a
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:36,319	| IOT209 |	Nest I want you to talk to my Amazon Echo
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:37,855	| IOT209 |	Intend
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:40,927	| IOT209 |	That goes like hey you got insert your
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:42,207	| IOT209 |	Nest password
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:42,719	| IOT209 |	And I'm like okay
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:44,511	| IOT209 |	Back and forth I go
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:47,839	| IOT209 |	So I I look at things like that is that something that
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:49,631	| IOT209 |	I should see get better here
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:54,495	| IOT209 |	I think it will get better and me article
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:55,775	| IOT209 |	YouTube
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:58,079	| IOT209 |	So
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:00,639	| IOT209 |	Cookies
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:02,431	| IOT209 |	People now know about cookies I think
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:06,271	| IOT209 |	Gdpr apocalypse
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:10,623	| IOT209 |	Yes I accept cookies in my browser
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:12,927	| IOT209 |	Equivalent
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:14,719	| IOT209 |	When it comes to anything.
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:20,095	| IOT209 |	Typically what apps do
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:23,167	| IOT209 |	The best possible experience
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:25,983	| IOT209 |	It has tokens
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:27,519	| IOT209 |	Forever
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:30,591	| IOT209 |	This is why things that aren't
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:33,407	| IOT209 |	Birthday your bank app
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:34,943	| IOT209 |	Can't believe me just watch
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:38,783	| IOT209 |	I think about my
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:47,999	| IOT209 |	Right I think of a token like a
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:48,767	| IOT209 |	The key to my house
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:52,351	| IOT209 |	I'm going to give it to someone and then I'm going to revoke it after a certain set
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:54,143	| IOT209 |	Because
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:54,911	| IOT209 |	You should know
EDL	00:44:55,935	00:44:56,959	| IOT209 |	That's what I thought
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:10,783	| IOT209 |	And you could have a vehicle
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:11,551	| IOT209 |	You
EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:13,343	| IOT209 |	Could have somebody else using
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:15,135	| IOT209 |	Typically
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:16,415	| IOT209 |	Mobile devices
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:20,255	| IOT209 |	Anthony
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:22,559	| IOT209 |	Other kinds of
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:23,327	| IOT209 |	Connected
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:24,351	| IOT209 |	Smart devices
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:37,407	| IOT209 |	Very short life
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:40,479	| IOT209 |	And that's where tokens really don't want to be what I call
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:45,087	| IOT209 |	Naughty forever
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:50,463	| IOT209 |	Password list
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:01,727	| IOT209 |	Do
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:03,519	| IOT209 |	Authentication using
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:09,151	| IOT209 |	All kinds of things
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:11,199	| IOT209 |	Sky's the limit
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:12,479	| IOT209 |	Indication
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:19,135	| IOT209 |	True I would love my daughter loves to take my Fitbit
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:21,439	| IOT209 |	When I'm having a shower or some
EDL	00:46:21,439	00:46:22,463	| IOT209 |	Michelle Financial take it
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:24,767	| IOT209 |	I would love for it to be like
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:25,535	| IOT209 |	Hey
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:26,303	| IOT209 |	You're not Stacy
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:28,607	| IOT209 |	No I'm not looking
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:29,631	| IOT209 |	It doesn't have
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:30,911	| IOT209 |	But that's okay
EDL	00:46:30,911	00:46:32,191	| IOT209 |	This is not a highly secure
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:32,703	| IOT209 |	Pair device
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:33,983	| IOT209 |	But I see what she
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:35,007	| IOT209 |	But
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:36,799	| IOT209 |	The flip side of that is
EDL	00:46:37,311	00:46:39,871	| IOT209 |	Because I Am The Keeper of the passwords
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:42,943	| IOT209 |	On all of our connected home devices I'm also like
EDL	00:46:43,967	00:46:46,783	| IOT209 |	I'm basically like the person everyone calls on when
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:50,879	| IOT209 |	When stuff goes wrong or things get unlinked need to be reeling
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:55,743	| IOT209 |	And you know it's a multi-user environment and sometimes I wish that we had a way of
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:46:56,767	| IOT209 |	Authentication
EDL	00:46:57,535	00:47:00,095	| IOT209 |	You know everybody who belongs in the environment with admin rights
EDL	00:47:01,375	00:47:03,167	| IOT209 |	That is like a whole nother level of complex
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:04,959	| IOT209 |	I'm curious what you have
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:05,471	| IOT209 |	How to say about that
EDL	00:47:06,495	00:47:09,055	| IOT209 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:47:09,567	00:47:11,103	| IOT209 |	I can show you that
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:13,151	| IOT209 |	Small slice
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:16,223	| IOT209 |	The identity challenge with large
EDL	00:47:16,735	00:47:18,527	| IOT209 |	Talking about it
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:20,575	| IOT209 |	What is a delegate
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:23,391	| IOT209 |	If you think about it
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:25,951	| IOT209 |	What what I'm shorthanded as identity is really
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:27,999	| IOT209 |	Identity and access management
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:35,679	| IOT209 |	IT staff to manage
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:36,447	| IOT209 |	My house I don't
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:37,215	| IOT209 |	I don't know
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:40,799	| IOT209 |	That's exactly what I am
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:48,735	| IOT209 |	And exactly what
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:50,783	| IOT209 |	How to do
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:54,623	| IOT209 |	Enterprise I am contact you don't want to
EDL	00:47:54,623	00:47:57,183	| IOT209 |	Because you don't want to turn

EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:13,823	| IOT209 |	That's
EDL	00:48:14,847	00:48:16,895	| IOT209 |	So what is the solution here
EDL	00:48:17,919	00:48:21,247	| IOT209 |	The concept of number of people have been working on for a long time

EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:29,183	| IOT209 |	It really isn't your grandfather's I am
EDL	00:48:29,183	00:48:30,463	| IOT209 |	You know
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:32,255	| IOT209 |	What does
EDL	00:48:32,767	00:48:33,535	| IOT209 |	How many light bulbs
EDL	00:48:34,559	00:48:35,327	| IOT209 |	Are you there
EDL	00:48:35,327	00:48:35,839	| IOT209 |	Cousin

EDL	00:49:00,415	00:49:01,439	| IOT209 |	To some
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:02,975	| IOT209 |	Stagnant
EDL	00:49:04,255	00:49:05,535	| IOT209 |	My home
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:07,839	| IOT209 |	I really want to do it by 4
EDL	00:49:08,351	00:49:10,143	| IOT209 |	Function they have in my life
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:12,191	| IOT209 |	Function.
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:13,983	| IOT209 |	Having my life
EDL	00:49:15,775	00:49:16,799	| IOT209 |	The role that they have
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:22,943	| IOT209 |	And you know Enterprise I am we would talk about roll management

EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:31,135	| IOT209 |	Control
EDL	00:49:31,135	00:49:31,647	| IOT209 |	So
EDL	00:49:32,159	00:49:32,927	| IOT209 |	Identity
EDL	00:49:34,975	00:49:36,511	| IOT209 |	You can actually
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:39,327	| IOT209 |	Keep it under control by thinking about
EDL	00:49:39,327	00:49:40,351	| IOT209 |	Other people

EDL	00:50:03,391	00:50:09,535	| IOT209 |	Like I have a
EDL	00:50:10,559	00:50:12,607	| IOT209 |	Because I did something wrong
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:13,119	| IOT209 |	I can
EDL	00:50:21,567	00:50:22,335	| IOT209 |	You can actually do it
EDL	00:50:23,103	00:50:23,871	| IOT209 |	In
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:26,431	| IOT209 |	That would be automatic is part of the
EDL	00:50:26,431	00:50:31,807	| IOT209 |	Device in the app that's associated with that device or is that part of my management panel that's coming with me
EDL	00:50:32,319	00:50:33,343	| IOT209 |	Echo or my
EDL	00:50:33,855	00:50:35,391	| IOT209 |	Hub how do I get this magic
EDL	00:50:41,535	00:50:42,303	| IOT209 |	How you could do this
EDL	00:50:45,119	00:50:47,935	| IOT209 |	Benefit claims and prescription information
EDL	00:50:47,935	00:50:50,239	| IOT209 |	Data
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:50:57,151	| IOT209 |	Standard and standard
EDL	00:51:05,087	00:51:07,647	| IOT209 |	Connected and disconnected and paired and unpaired
EDL	00:51:14,303	00:51:14,815	| IOT209 |	The standard
EDL	00:51:15,327	00:51:16,095	| IOT209 |	And
EDL	00:51:16,095	00:51:17,631	| IOT209 |	Identity relationship
EDL	00:51:18,143	00:51:18,911	| IOT209 |	Enter people
EDL	00:51:18,911	00:51:19,423	| IOT209 |	Deploying
EDL	00:51:20,191	00:51:21,727	| IOT209 |	Actually they are
EDL	00:51:21,727	00:51:24,031	| IOT209 |	Example is a mandate in the UK
EDL	00:51:24,543	00:51:27,103	| IOT209 |	4 - 4
EDL	00:51:27,103	00:51:28,639	| IOT209 |	People who are
EDL	00:51:29,151	00:51:31,199	| IOT209 |	Multiple pension accounts
EDL	00:51:31,967	00:51:35,807	| IOT209 |	And pension pick up like in your 401k
EDL	00:51:35,807	00:51:36,831	| IOT209 |	So they're working
EDL	00:51:37,343	00:51:39,903	| IOT209 |	To the toy how you would aggravate
EDL	00:51:44,255	00:51:47,839	| IOT209 |	To somebody like that and we're working with
EDL	00:51:53,727	00:51:55,007	| IOT209 |	Dashboard console
EDL	00:51:58,079	00:52:01,151	| IOT209 |	So I would probably see my smart home hub people
EDL	00:52:01,151	00:52:06,015	| IOT209 |	Adopt something like this if I wanted to implement this kind of awesome automatic relationship management
EDL	00:52:06,527	00:52:07,807	| IOT209 |	Based on graph
EDL	00:52:07,807	00:52:08,319	| IOT209 |	In my home
EDL	00:52:08,831	00:52:12,159	| IOT209 |	So as a consumer the sounds awesome
EDL	00:52:12,159	00:52:13,951	| IOT209 |	Can't wait for it to be on the horizon
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:15,743	| IOT209 |	What hope do I have
EDL	00:52:15,743	00:52:18,047	| IOT209 |	For making my life easier in the short-term
EDL	00:52:19,071	00:52:20,351	| IOT209 |	In the short-term
EDL	00:52:20,351	00:52:21,631	| IOT209 |	Turn still
EDL	00:52:21,631	00:52:22,655	| IOT209 |	Going to be
EDL	00:52:22,655	00:52:25,471	| IOT209 |	As many accounts of people have to login to
EDL	00:52:25,471	00:52:26,495	| IOT209 |	In the very short of
EDL	00:52:26,495	00:52:27,263	| IOT209 |	Turn
EDL	00:52:27,263	00:52:29,823	| IOT209 |	I do advise people to use password manager
EDL	00:52:29,823	00:52:31,359	| IOT209 |	Some people will be
EDL	00:52:31,359	00:52:32,639	| IOT209 |	Incentivize to you
EDL	00:52:35,711	00:52:39,039	| IOT209 |	And it's up to each individual person to
EDL	00:52:39,039	00:52:40,575	| IOT209 |	Decided
EDL	00:52:40,575	00:52:41,087	| IOT209 |	Privacy
EDL	00:52:50,559	00:52:52,351	| IOT209 |	That's inside if you're willing
EDL	00:52:52,351	00:52:53,631	| IOT209 |	Official finding or not
EDL	00:52:53,631	00:52:56,191	| IOT209 |	And how you're going to manage all those accounts
EDL	00:52:56,191	00:52:56,959	| IOT209 |	But
EDL	00:53:00,031	00:53:02,335	| IOT209 |	Identity is not authentication alone
EDL	00:53:02,335	00:53:04,127	| IOT209 |	Multiple
EDL	00:53:04,127	00:53:04,639	| IOT209 |	Think about
EDL	00:53:05,151	00:53:06,687	| IOT209 |	What identity baijiu
EDL	00:53:06,687	00:53:07,711	| IOT209 |	Identity
EDL	00:53:07,711	00:53:09,503	| IOT209 |	Coming to get protection
EDL	00:53:10,015	00:53:11,295	| IOT209 |	Personalization
EDL	00:53:11,807	00:53:13,599	| IOT209 |	Implement functionality
EDL	00:53:13,599	00:53:15,391	| IOT209 |	Out of your relationship
EDL	00:53:16,159	00:53:16,927	| IOT209 |	Awesome
EDL	00:53:16,927	00:53:21,023	| IOT209 |	It's kind of like I have to share GPS information to get all these cool
EDL	00:53:21,535	00:53:23,839	| IOT209 |	You know mapping data understanding
EDL	00:53:24,351	00:53:25,119	| IOT209 |	Like automatic
EDL	00:53:25,119	00:53:26,399	| IOT209 |	Turning onto things in my house
EDL	00:53:26,911	00:53:27,679	| IOT209 |	So here
EDL	00:53:28,191	00:53:28,959	| IOT209 |	If I'm
EDL	00:53:28,959	00:53:31,263	| IOT209 |	Willing to authenticate as often as needed
EDL	00:53:31,775	00:53:34,335	| IOT209 |	I can do cool things like pay with my ring
EDL	00:53:34,335	00:53:34,847	| IOT209 |	Actually
EDL	00:53:36,639	00:53:37,919	| IOT209 |	Up to you to determine
EDL	00:53:38,687	00:53:42,271	| IOT209 |	How you have a relationship with each other and
EDL	00:53:42,271	00:53:43,295	| IOT209 |	How much it cost
EDL	00:53:43,807	00:53:47,391	| IOT209 |	Actually starting to dictate more of a relationship
EDL	00:53:48,671	00:53:51,487	| IOT209 |	It's possible for consumers to
EDL	00:53:51,487	00:53:53,023	| IOT209 |	Put in a little bit more
EDL	00:53:53,023	00:53:53,791	| IOT209 |	Instagram
EDL	00:53:54,303	00:53:55,583	| IOT209 |	Okay we'll leave
EDL	00:53:56,095	00:53:56,607	| IOT209 |	I feel
EDL	00:53:57,119	00:53:58,911	| IOT209 |	A little better
EDL	00:53:59,423	00:54:00,447	| IOT209 |	And a little bit
EDL	00:54:00,447	00:54:06,847	| IOT209 |	Powerless to start calling on some connected device companies to start implementing some
EDL	00:54:06,847	00:54:07,615	| IOT209 |	Amethyst
EDL	00:54:07,615	00:54:09,151	| IOT209 |	Technology so I can
EDL	00:54:09,151	00:54:12,991	| IOT209 |	I can ease my sign-in burden thank you so much for coming on the show
