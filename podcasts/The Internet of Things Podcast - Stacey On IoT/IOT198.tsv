EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:25,504	| IOT198 |	Dot IO
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:27,552	| IOT198 |	That's a f e r o
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:28,576	| IOT198 |	Dot IO
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:31,136	| IOT198 |	So let's get started with
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:34,464	| IOT198 |	I don't know the biggest news we probably saw was
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:35,488	| IOT198 |	I'm going to go with
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:38,560	| IOT198 |	Google home
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:41,888	| IOT198 |	Yes a Google had a press only event
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:44,960	| IOT198 |	Before CS even open on day one
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:48,288	| IOT198 |	Discussions about what they were going to do because they have this
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,312	| IOT198 |	What looks like a ride
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:51,616	| IOT198 |	Set up in the parking lot
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:52,896	| IOT198 |	And there was a ride
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:53,920	| IOT198 |	I went on it
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:55,456	| IOT198 |	But the big news was
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:58,016	| IOT198 |	Really they're trying to expand
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:02:01,856	| IOT198 |	Make it easier for Hardware makers to implement
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,624	| IOT198 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:03,904	| IOT198 |	Devices
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:08,768	| IOT198 |	Amazon has done with the Echo and the details are scarce it
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:09,792	| IOT198 |	Coming soon
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:10,816	| IOT198 |	For heartburn
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:12,608	| IOT198 |	Makers and you're talking about assistant
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,376	| IOT198 |	Kitchenettes correct
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:15,680	| IOT198 |	In that
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:16,960	| IOT198 |	Almost
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:18,240	| IOT198 |	Compares to
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,008	| IOT198 |	BMO
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:19,776	| IOT198 |	Amazon
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:21,568	| IOT198 |	Connect kit
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,360	| IOT198 |	But that is a hardware base
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:24,640	| IOT198 |	System that lets you build
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:26,944	| IOT198 |	Basically slot this thing into your device
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:27,968	| IOT198 |	You have all the
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:28,736	| IOT198 |	Functionality
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:30,016	| IOT198 |	Connect to
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:33,344	| IOT198 |	Google when is in a hardware device
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:36,416	| IOT198 |	Yet it may one day also have a hardware component
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:38,208	| IOT198 |	It's not
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:39,232	| IOT198 |	What else should we know about it
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:44,096	| IOT198 |	Right so developers and Hardware makers will find out in the coming weeks how they can
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:44,864	| IOT198 |	Unemployment Pat
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:47,168	| IOT198 |	There are some new devices
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:51,264	| IOT198 |	I guess you could call them new form factors is a small little 4 inch touch screen
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:54,336	| IOT198 |	Lenovo device that is
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:56,128	| IOT198 |	Looks like a little mini
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,664	| IOT198 |	Google home hub
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:58,944	| IOT198 |	Really called the
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,224	| IOT198 |	Google Smart Lock
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:01,760	| IOT198 |	So
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:04,064	| IOT198 |	The speaker has a microphone backtracking to watch
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,600	| IOT198 |	Videos on it
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:08,416	| IOT198 |	At least not yet you're not going to see Google photos on it
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,440	| IOT198 |	At least not yet
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,976	| IOT198 |	It's really meant for
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,768	| IOT198 |	Setting Smart Alarm which it will
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,840	| IOT198 |	Set based on your morning and evening routines
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:18,656	| IOT198 |	It's only $79
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:20,960	| IOT198 |	Set those routines
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:23,520	| IOT198 |	Well it's probably going to suggest some
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:25,568	| IOT198 |	But you could have a ride or you
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,080	| IOT198 |	You can set your own
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,872	| IOT198 |	When you think about an hour
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:30,688	| IOT198 |	Use Google Assistant it knows where do you work when you work
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,712	| IOT198 |	You're commuting all that
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,480	| IOT198 |	So based on
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,248	| IOT198 |	Traffic
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:35,296	| IOT198 |	I say hey will you get up earlier today
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,344	| IOT198 |	Etc
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,648	| IOT198 |	It should take care of that for you they said it will suggest
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:40,672	| IOT198 |	Based on your roots
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:43,744	| IOT198 |	That's pretty cool it will not show you photos
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:44,768	| IOT198 |	That's okay
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,304	| IOT198 |	And now that we're talking
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:52,704	| IOT198 |	He better than like I was Google's news the biggest news I don't know the bigger news might be the Samsung ecosystem
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,728	| IOT198 |	I'm kind of effort news
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,520	| IOT198 |	What do you think the TV news with
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,568	| IOT198 |	Remote control with
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,616	| IOT198 |	Of course your buddy Bixby and
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:01,920	| IOT198 |	Matinee and hey Google
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:02,944	| IOT198 |	And I
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:07,296	| IOT198 |	Stepanek coming out of nowhere for Samsung to partner up
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,344	| IOT198 |	Smart TVs with Apple
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,624	| IOT198 |	But yeah so
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:13,184	| IOT198 |	A lot of the Samsung president was
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:15,488	| IOT198 |	Arie hasit the last ice age two years to be honest
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:19,839	| IOT198 |	They were very few alipay product announcements and more of the vision
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:22,143	| IOT198 |	And that vision is still Bixby
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:24,959	| IOT198 |	But I think I said last week in a post that
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:26,495	| IOT198 |	If they do
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:28,543	| IOT198 |	Partner up with somebody else
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,079	| IOT198 |	That maybe that's the white flag
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:30,847	| IOT198 |	Bixby
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:32,383	| IOT198 |	And that's what they've done they are
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,407	| IOT198 |	Partnering with Google
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:36,223	| IOT198 |	You'll have Google assistant on all Samsung
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:37,247	| IOT198 |	Smart TVs
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,527	| IOT198 |	This year
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:43,135	| IOT198 |	The family Hub is getting upgraded the family Hub 2.0 and that's for the fridges
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:46,463	| IOT198 |	Things I've integrated screens I mean they showed up
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,487	| IOT198 |	Photo frame
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:49,023	| IOT198 |	Picture of that again but I
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,327	| IOT198 |	You don't want to spend $1,000 on a fridge for a photo frame
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,351	| IOT198 |	However
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,911	| IOT198 |	It did have recipe suggest
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,959	| IOT198 |	Chin through Bixby
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:59,519	| IOT198 |	Nano however is here I'm not going to spend
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:01,311	| IOT198 |	$8,000 on a fridge with a giant
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,079	| IOT198 |	Ice cream that has
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:02,591	| IOT198 |	Limited value
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:04,127	| IOT198 |	Another drink and you might
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:06,175	| IOT198 |	Yeah I agree
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:08,479	| IOT198 |	That's the trying to do too much I think
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,247	| IOT198 |	The fridge
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:11,295	| IOT198 |	They had in a washing machines that would
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:14,879	| IOT198 |	Give me notifications when the washing machine is done your laundry is ready to be
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,671	| IOT198 |	Put in the dryer were folded in
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,719	| IOT198 |	How do I set notifications
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,255	| IOT198 |	We kind of joke
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:23,583	| IOT198 |	Inside will buy a new washer and dryer but really that's
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,351	| IOT198 |	What's happening
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,119	| IOT198 |	So yes
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:25,887	| IOT198 |	Defiance
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:26,655	| IOT198 |	Space
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:28,191	| IOT198 |	I'm just going to say are you guys ready
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,983	| IOT198 |	Need to have a range hood
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,263	| IOT198 |	It has a
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:33,567	| IOT198 |	Screen init or some sort of crazy a i in it
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,103	| IOT198 |	Mge
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:36,383	| IOT198 |	Appliances
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,663	| IOT198 |	Which is now actually owned by higher
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,199	| IOT198 |	The Chinese company
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,735	| IOT198 |	They were showing off and I see
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:41,759	| IOT198 |	4-H
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,039	| IOT198 |	7 inch
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,831	| IOT198 |	Touchscreen beautiful things
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,135	| IOT198 |	Is part of your downdraft
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:48,927	| IOT198 |	We are still
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:53,023	| IOT198 |	And I mean it's like the Hub of your kitchen it shows recipes
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:54,047	| IOT198 |	It doesn't lie
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:55,071	| IOT198 |	But I don't
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,095	| IOT198 |	Feel like I do this
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:56,863	| IOT198 |	It's crazy expensive
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,399	| IOT198 |	Bosch also
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:03,519	| IOT198 |	Nothing much smaller than that but also did have

EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:06,847	| IOT198 |	Holiday in intelligence associated with
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,199	| IOT198 |	What are those things called
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:13,247	| IOT198 |	When I don't know
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:15,039	| IOT198 |	No no it's the thing that comes over this
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,575	| IOT198 |	Stove in like sucks all the bad Arrow
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:17,599	| IOT198 |	Fan
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,647	| IOT198 |	Yeah okay
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,159	| IOT198 |	Anyway
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,207	| IOT198 |	So I was running around
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,231	| IOT198 |	Like looking at some of the smarter kitchen
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,535	| IOT198 |	Haier washer
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:26,559	| IOT198 |	Against
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,839	| IOT198 |	Same thing what is
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:30,911	| IOT198 |	Become very clear though is you will not be able to buy a device
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:33,215	| IOT198 |	Connected to the internet
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:33,727	| IOT198 |	The fridge
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:36,287	| IOT198 |	Probably even a dishwasher
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:39,103	| IOT198 |	Definitely an oven or stove and probably a wash
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,407	| IOT198 |	So your major appliances
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:44,991	| IOT198 |	Does are going to be connected and when I didn't hear anyone talk about what I asked about
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,783	| IOT198 |	Was like how the heck they plan
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:49,087	| IOT198 |	Sporty's and how long they plan to support these
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,367	| IOT198 |	Because it's
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,391	| IOT198 |	Cyber security risk
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:52,927	| IOT198 |	And please
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,951	| IOT198 |	Some of these are built on like
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:58,559	| IOT198 |	They're not built on Android things anymore they used to be built under like Android tablet
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,095	| IOT198 |	It was like scary as all hell
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,887	| IOT198 |	I don't know what feels risky
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,679	| IOT198 |	Elsa
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,215	| IOT198 |	Maybe not as
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:05,727	| IOT198 |	How much value
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:08,031	| IOT198 |	Send a lot of money on
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:12,383	| IOT198 |	I would say
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:13,407	| IOT198 |	Honestly
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:14,943	| IOT198 |	Team here has been disappointment
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,967	| IOT198 |	I've been looking
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:18,783	| IOT198 |	For like really cool things in Granite were only a day in
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:21,343	| IOT198 |	Days Inn
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:24,415	| IOT198 |	I'm not seeing anything this like
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:26,207	| IOT198 |	Future technology
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:31,071	| IOT198 |	I would agree and we said last year how you saw Madame a
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,863	| IOT198 |	Google home everywhere
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:35,423	| IOT198 |	But this year it's actually
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,703	| IOT198 |	There are more
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:39,519	| IOT198 |	Mentions are products with those Integrations than
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,287	| IOT198 |	There are we
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,055	| IOT198 |	Without those ID
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:41,823	| IOT198 |	Integrations
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,615	| IOT198 |	So it's even more than last year
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:45,663	| IOT198 |	In a lot of wacky stuff
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:49,503	| IOT198 |	I don't know technology companies trying to like
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:51,551	| IOT198 |	Add smart or something to
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:52,831	| IOT198 |	Sleep
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,599	| IOT198 |	And
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:55,903	| IOT198 |	We must address
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:58,463	| IOT198 |	Which is the color
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:01,791	| IOT198 |	Smart toilet that has mattamy built
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:02,303	| IOT198 |	Intuit
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:04,607	| IOT198 |	And I like Poler stuff
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,655	| IOT198 |	They have a powered faucet they have
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:10,495	| IOT198 |	You that are going to let you know have lighting
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,519	| IOT198 |	Recipes for your bath
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,311	| IOT198 |	Routine
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:16,127	| IOT198 |	But I don't know. I don't think I need toilet what about you
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,175	| IOT198 |	I certainly do not
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:18,943	| IOT198 |	And
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:21,759	| IOT198 |	What you could do and I saw this at the color connect
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,783	| IOT198 |	Today
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:24,831	| IOT198 |	They do have
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:25,855	| IOT198 |	A voice integration
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,391	| IOT198 |	In their mirrors now
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,415	| IOT198 |	So That's Amore
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,951	| IOT198 |	Replace I think for it
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:33,791	| IOT198 |	I don't need you know my personal information about my toilet going
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:38,655	| IOT198 |	You don't want Amazon I don't particularly care
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,703	| IOT198 |	My privacy
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,239	| IOT198 |	But most people
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:45,055	| IOT198 |	Probably don't want to hey he just did a number two
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:47,615	| IOT198 |	I think you need a little more toilet paper
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:48,895	| IOT198 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:50,431	| IOT198 |	So I like what colors doing
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,455	| IOT198 |	On the Kinect stuff
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,735	| IOT198 |	With the
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,271	| IOT198 |	Faucets
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:57,087	| IOT198 |	Shower seems we're going to customize shower routines
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:59,647	| IOT198 |	Thanks for individuals you know they menstruate
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:01,695	| IOT198 |	But I don't think it needs to be in a toilet I like
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,719	| IOT198 |	The mirror
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,743	| IOT198 |	I'm looking at that
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,255	| IOT198 |	That's not my intent
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:09,375	| IOT198 |	Actually smart mirrors here mostly from smaller companies and then things like color
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:12,191	| IOT198 |	So what are you looking for in a smart mirror
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,471	| IOT198 |	I'm just curious because
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:15,519	| IOT198 |	I feel so obvious but then I'm like
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,823	| IOT198 |	Wait a second do I really need that
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:22,431	| IOT198 |	I have a Google home in the bathroom I talk to it all the time and it gives me a lot of information I would
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:23,711	| IOT198 |	In the mirror
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,991	| IOT198 |	I think that would be redundant then
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,271	| IOT198 |	I think most
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,039	| IOT198 |	People do not have
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:28,831	| IOT198 |	Like a home hub in the bathroom
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,599	| IOT198 |	No screens
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,367	| IOT198 |	In the bathroom
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:33,183	| IOT198 |	Sorry it's not a home hub it's a mini
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:36,255	| IOT198 |	It's a Google mini so there's no screens but I mean I asked
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,047	| IOT198 |	My calendar I asked you
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:38,815	| IOT198 |	The news
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,351	| IOT198 |	I guess I can play the
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,631	| IOT198 |	Play videos
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,191	| IOT198 |	In the news right now
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:47,263	| IOT198 |	Smart mirror in my bathroom but
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:50,079	| IOT198 |	Yeah there's something about having the visuals
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:52,639	| IOT198 |	When you ask for information like what's the weather today
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,663	| IOT198 |	You don't just get
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,943	| IOT198 |	Hear what today is happening
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,503	| IOT198 |	A visual hour-by-hour perhaps
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,831	| IOT198 |	Cloud with
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:01,599	| IOT198 |	Little raindrop
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,623	| IOT198 |	Important to
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:05,183	| IOT198 |	Or vector with his little eyes crying
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:05,695	| IOT198 |	Cuz it's raining
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:09,023	| IOT198 |	Oh and let's bring this up because Kevin
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:11,839	| IOT198 |	Haven't managed to find the only
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:14,399	| IOT198 |	Possibly madhumeh powered robot in the whole place
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,447	| IOT198 |	And he is very excited and happy
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:17,983	| IOT198 |	And I am

EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,567	| IOT198 |	What is this product and why are you excited about it
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:24,383	| IOT198 |	Alright the robot's name is Timmy
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:25,663	| IOT198 |	If the company is rowboats Hemi
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:31,807	| IOT198 |	It's a $1,500 robot companion robot only obviously more expensive
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,855	| IOT198 |	Repeat all
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:34,623	| IOT198 |	Shut up
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,903	| IOT198 |	Really nice high resolution

EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:43,071	| IOT198 |	Since you can use it for video conferencing you can use it for getting information
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,375	| IOT198 |	But they have announced that they are
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,143	| IOT198 |	Landing
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,679	| IOT198 |	I didn't do it yet they're planning
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:50,239	| IOT198 |	The coming month
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,519	| IOT198 |	Amazon announced
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:54,079	| IOT198 |	So I think that's going to happen
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,103	| IOT198 |	What is 15
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,895	| IOT198 |	$100 so I don't know

EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:24,543	| IOT198 |	We had
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,567	| IOT198 |	A bunch of products
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,335	| IOT198 |	Just come out
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:27,871	| IOT198 |	They can be controlled by Maddow

EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,999	| IOT198 |	Spring I think when I was in
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:46,303	| IOT198 |	Whenever I visited Ikea I got to
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,583	| IOT198 |	And they're pretty cool
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,375	| IOT198 |	Enterprise points
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:50,143	| IOT198 |	Pretty
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:51,679	| IOT198 |	Cheap I don't know do you
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,703	| IOT198 |	Did Ikea
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:54,239	| IOT198 |	I didn't see
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,263	| IOT198 |	Pricing but I
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:56,543	| IOT198 |	No
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:02,431	| IOT198 |	They they are fairly the pricing they gave me
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:02,943	| IOT198 |	It was pretty cheap
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,479	| IOT198 |	So let's see
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,271	| IOT198 |	Other than that
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,295	| IOT198 |	You know there's a lot of
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,831	| IOT198 |	One-off little device
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:11,135	| IOT198 |	Isis there was a lot of stuff with the Amazon
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,159	| IOT198 |	An automotive
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,439	| IOT198 |	So ties in with
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,207	| IOT198 |	Pioneer
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,999	| IOT198 |	Electra bed
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,303	| IOT198 |	Some other companies I'm still waiting for Miami
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,327	| IOT198 |	Nissan auto device
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,095	| IOT198 |	Actually
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,911	| IOT198 |	Really and it's interesting because today
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,703	| IOT198 |	Google also announced to
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:28,031	| IOT198 |	New our Hardware Partners JBLM
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,799	| IOT198 |	Anker
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,591	| IOT198 |	So basically you plug this into your
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,359	| IOT198 |	Cigarette lighter
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:33,151	| IOT198 |	And then it was
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,175	| IOT198 |	Actually let's
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:34,943	| IOT198 |	SU
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:37,247	| IOT198 |	Connect your phone to your car and it
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,015	| IOT198 |	Has its own
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,063	| IOT198 |	Canceling
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:40,575	| IOT198 |	Microphone
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,135	| IOT198 |	To make it better for your input
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,159	| IOT198 |	In the car so
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,695	| IOT198 |	I don't know pricing on those they were
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:47,231	| IOT198 |	Turn off today but
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:48,767	| IOT198 |	Yeah they want in the car as well
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,303	| IOT198 |	In addition
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,351	| IOT198 |	Amazon there was actually one kind of peace
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,655	| IOT198 |	Snooze that I thought was really interesting is that Chamberlain
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,935	| IOT198 |	When is working with them to bring
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:58,239	| IOT198 |	MyQ garage door ecosystem
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:01,311	| IOT198 |	For Amazon Prime members now you can have your package
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,103	| IOT198 |	Is delivered through Amazon
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,383	| IOT198 |	Key Program to your garage
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,943	| IOT198 |	Which I was like all there for that
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,223	| IOT198 |	Amazon key
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:11,039	| IOT198 |	Amazon people in my home no Amazon people in my garage
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,087	| IOT198 |	I don't know Kevin
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,879	| IOT198 |	Yeah that makes more sense
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,671	| IOT198 |	Wouldn't work for me because we leave the
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:17,951	| IOT198 |	Inside door opener
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,231	| IOT198 |	Unlock rather
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,767	| IOT198 |	But
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:22,047	| IOT198 |	Open and close at
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,327	| IOT198 |	No that's okay I just
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:26,911	| IOT198 |	I locked myself out one too many times I just leave it unlocked now but
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:28,703	| IOT198 |	Most people would
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:31,519	| IOT198 |	Haven't set up where we safer more secure
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:33,823	| IOT198 |	And they be comfortable letting Amazon drop
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:34,591	| IOT198 |	The packaging
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,615	| IOT198 |	Garage sales
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:40,479	| IOT198 |	Yeah yeah think about it this way you can put a refrigerator in your garage a lot of people already have something like that
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,527	| IOT198 |	Groceries in crazy stuff
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,063	| IOT198 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,623	| IOT198 |	See okay
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:48,671	| IOT198 |	So that's going to be in 37 cities
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:50,975	| IOT198 |	And there's not a fee associated with that
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:54,559	| IOT198 |	Peoples were like Diehard Chamberlain users may be surprised by that because
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,583	| IOT198 |	Cuz they did a
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:58,655	| IOT198 |	Associated with their if this then that integration
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:01,727	| IOT198 |	People were up in
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:02,239	| IOT198 |	In arms
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:05,311	| IOT198 |	I talked to Jeff Meredith who is the president
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,847	| IOT198 |	And CEO of Chamberlain about this
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:09,663	| IOT198 |	And he said that they are evaluating their
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:11,967	| IOT198 |	A strategy and they don't think they're going to do that going
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,479	| IOT198 |	Forward
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:14,271	| IOT198 |	I don't know what's going to happen
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:17,087	| IOT198 |	Maybe you want
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:17,855	| IOT198 |	See that happening
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:20,415	| IOT198 |	I hope not because most people use
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,951	| IOT198 |	If services
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,487	| IOT198 |	Free so they add on
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:27,327	| IOT198 |	People the wrong way and I understand that
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:30,143	| IOT198 |	Should go back the other way to free but it's up to them
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:33,471	| IOT198 |	Does it cost money for companies to act
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:34,751	| IOT198 |	Their services
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:35,775	| IOT198 |	Those are not free
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,055	| IOT198 |	They're free for us but
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,103	| IOT198 |	What is subsidized
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:39,871	| IOT198 |	Survivor
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:40,383	| IOT198 |	Iherb
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:43,199	| IOT198 |	Cheap small news item
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,223	| IOT198 |	Consider worth talking
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:46,271	| IOT198 |	About let's see D-Link has
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,295	| IOT198 |	Outdoor
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:47,807	| IOT198 |	Outlet
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,855	| IOT198 |	That's going to be about
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:52,671	| IOT198 |	P44 rated
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:54,207	| IOT198 |	So not the best
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:56,255	| IOT198 |	Best version of that but it is a Wi-Fi outdoor
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:59,839	| IOT198 |	Do you want an ip64 rated which means you can drop it
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:01,887	| IOT198 |	You would actually
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:03,679	| IOT198 |	Go with the new tp-link
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:04,959	| IOT198 |	Casa
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:06,751	| IOT198 |	Lineup they actually are
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:08,287	| IOT198 |	Launch in outdoor rated
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,567	| IOT198 |	IPC
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,591	| IOT198 |	64 version
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,359	| IOT198 |	Apple WiFi Outlet
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,383	| IOT198 |	That's pretty sweet
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:13,919	| IOT198 |	They
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:17,247	| IOT198 |	Tp-link guys are actually putting in a whole bunch of new Prada
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,551	| IOT198 |	Ismart Camera
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,319	| IOT198 |	Outlets
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:22,367	| IOT198 |	A bunch of stuff and they're actually going to create some
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,647	| IOT198 |	Smart AI
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,695	| IOT198 |	We're going to be trying that one
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:27,999	| IOT198 |	Later
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:31,071	| IOT198 |	So one other thing that I really like
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,887	| IOT198 |	Because I want to get rid of devices and boxes in my house
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:35,935	| IOT198 |	And I'm not saying I'm going to replace all this
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:37,727	| IOT198 |	However
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:39,263	| IOT198 |	I was very impressed by the
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:41,567	| IOT198 |	The First Alert onelink smoke detectors that
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,335	| IOT198 |	Have
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,103	| IOT198 |	Mesh Network
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:46,943	| IOT198 |	So there is smoke detector carbon monoxide detector
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:49,247	| IOT198 |	They have matinee built-ins they don't like it
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:51,551	| IOT198 |	Speaker so now that you can play music on them
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:54,111	| IOT198 |	There's a Google Assistant model in the works
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,903	| IOT198 |	Unfortunately it sounds like you're going to have to
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,415	| IOT198 |	Choose
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,463	| IOT198 |	Dubai V matinee version
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:15:59,999	| IOT198 |	Google Assistant version
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,535	| IOT198 |	They're working on it
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:04,863	| IOT198 |	There's no pricing yet I know the current model without mesh Network
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,399	| IOT198 |	Is 249
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:10,239	| IOT198 |	So my guess is you're looking at least $300
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,007	| IOT198 |	War
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:12,031	| IOT198 |	These things however
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,055	| IOT198 |	These are your
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:14,591	| IOT198 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:17,919	| IOT198 |	Access points throughout your house they get rid of all the other
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:20,479	| IOT198 |	Devices that you know you smart speakers
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,247	| IOT198 |	What's your
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,271	| IOT198 |	Best access point
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:24,319	| IOT198 |	So you're free up a lot of outlets
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:24,831	| IOT198 |	Everything is big
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:29,695	| IOT198 |	Best networking threats your house that's a bonus
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,999	| IOT198 |	They're smart in the sense that
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:34,559	| IOT198 |	Detect some issue it knows
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:36,351	| IOT198 |	Roommates and just like when you set up
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,143	| IOT198 |	Lights in particular room in your Smart Hub
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:41,215	| IOT198 |	Anakin say hey there's a fire in your office or whatever
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,799	| IOT198 |	I'm sorry it is too or
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:46,335	| IOT198 |	$300
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:49,151	| IOT198 |	Weather for 249 without the mess right now
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,967	| IOT198 |	So 249 without them
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,015	| IOT198 |	I have at least
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,551	| IOT198 |	10 smoke detector
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:17:01,183	| IOT198 |	In my house replace the mall you can have a very capable mesh network with just maybe 2 or 3 days
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:05,023	| IOT198 |	I don't think so Kevin
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,839	| IOT198 |	Let's see what else do
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:10,911	| IOT198 |	Solutran
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:11,679	| IOT198 |	ISmart
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:12,959	| IOT198 |	Fan control switch
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:14,751	| IOT198 |	This is
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,519	| IOT198 |	Nice
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:17,567	| IOT198 |	Because it controls your fan all
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,847	| IOT198 |	Different speed element
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,871	| IOT198 |	We get a lot of requests
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,383	| IOT198 |	For this
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:22,175	| IOT198 |	Most people want Wi-Fi
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:23,967	| IOT198 |	And not like the Lutron
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:24,991	| IOT198 |	Proprietary but if you have
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,271	| IOT198 |	I said
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,551	| IOT198 |	It'll be lovely
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,343	| IOT198 |	Try to think of what else
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:32,159	| IOT198 |	OGE actually has a new
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:32,927	| IOT198 |	Switch
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:33,439	| IOT198 |	It is a wife
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:37,279	| IOT198 |	Lots of people are
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,047	| IOT198 |	Sick of having hub
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:40,095	| IOT198 |	Which Kevin and I will
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:40,863	| IOT198 |	Delivery with Kevin
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,143	| IOT198 |	Like waving his hands like
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:42,655	| IOT198 |	Yes yes
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,447	| IOT198 |	I'm not sick of having
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:48,799	| IOT198 |	I kind of gave in wave the white flag and said I guess I'll die
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:50,335	| IOT198 |	Cuz you're dying a slow painful death
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,871	| IOT198 |	That you wouldn't believe that if you went past
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:56,735	| IOT198 |	Boots like I did today there lots of lots of products there
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,295	| IOT198 |	Manufacturers are
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,319	| IOT198 |	They're starting to move forward
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,599	| IOT198 |	Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,623	| IOT198 |	Send natively work with
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:05,183	| IOT198 |	The digital assistants so that way there's
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:08,511	| IOT198 |	Ange's new CEO
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:12,607	| IOT198 |	So those
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,375	| IOT198 |	Work with
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,143	| IOT198 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,959	| IOT198 |	The Google home
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:19,775	| IOT198 |	And they're $30 for your regular ball than
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,799	| IOT198 |	44 Eur
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,895	| IOT198 |	BR30 bright
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,175	| IOT198 |	It's a little bit expensive but
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,199	| IOT198 |	You know
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:30,271	| IOT198 |	I'm thinking about do I just pull the plug on my way
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:32,831	| IOT198 |	Now cuz I don't really use too many sensors
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,599	| IOT198 |	So
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,135	| IOT198 |	Igo hubless
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,159	| IOT198 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:37,695	| IOT198 |	I cannot go homeless
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:41,535	| IOT198 |	Mistake 4 and all my holiday lighting is on a Z-Wave outdoor
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,047	| IOT198 |	Switch
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,351	| IOT198 |	But now with all the wifi options
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,375	| IOT198 |	The D-League option
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,167	| IOT198 |	Tp-link options
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:51,007	| IOT198 |	You could actually do this in a lot of people are just now getting into the Smart Hub
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,823	| IOT198 |	Probably not though
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:55,871	| IOT198 |	People think they're pretty people out there who are
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:57,407	| IOT198 |	Wifiby
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:00,479	| IOT198 |	And we saw it mean if I'm going to pick trends
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:01,247	| IOT198 |	For the show that
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:01,759	| IOT198 |	Definitely
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,319	| IOT198 |	Oh my God why fire
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:06,367	| IOT198 |	Do not give me anything weird
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,135	| IOT198 |	Newsies
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:09,439	| IOT198 |	Death of the Hub is what it seems like
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:11,487	| IOT198 |	Alright so we're killing the Hub
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:13,535	| IOT198 |	We're going to call at CES 2019
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:19,423	| IOT198 |	Yeah I've given Kevin a moment cuz I say any words
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,703	| IOT198 |	Is it like a eulogy for the Hub
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:22,495	| IOT198 |	I'll miss my hub
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,263	| IOT198 |	Because there are a lot of autumn
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:24,799	| IOT198 |	Instead I set up there
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,079	| IOT198 |	That
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,359	| IOT198 |	Especially with sensors
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,383	| IOT198 |	You know what's going to happen
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,175	| IOT198 |	They're still motion
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:30,943	| IOT198 |	Panthers and
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:31,711	| IOT198 |	Door sensors
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,527	| IOT198 |	My garage door sensor
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,807	| IOT198 |	Z-Wave or zigbee
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:36,575	| IOT198 |	Mike reebals
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:38,623	| IOT198 |	You know Kevin is
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:41,695	| IOT198 |	Assuming the Hub right now to bring it back
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:45,023	| IOT198 |	I will say I ran into two sensors Bluetooth based on sir
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,303	| IOT198 |	From Rubio
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:49,887	| IOT198 |	I'm going to try to get
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:51,679	| IOT198 |	Review units for those to see how long they last
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:53,983	| IOT198 |	Loose you didn't know
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,543	| IOT198 |	Improvement
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,567	| IOT198 |	And also
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,079	| IOT198 |	Profiles
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,103	| IOT198 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,407	| IOT198 |	Going to start doing is
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:04,223	| IOT198 |	It done profiles for lighting
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:07,039	| IOT198 |	Forever
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:09,343	| IOT198 |	But as the expenditure more and more types of
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,879	| IOT198 |	The devices are trying to build
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:14,719	| IOT198 |	Easier to like Herman what they are and how they
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,255	| IOT198 |	Sew in
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:18,303	| IOT198 |	2019-2020
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,327	| IOT198 |	Start seeing that
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,375	| IOT198 |	A different
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:21,887	| IOT198 |	In the number
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,679	| IOT198 |	Hang out there
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:27,263	| IOT198 |	About protocols and stuff
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:27,775	| IOT198 |	We'll talk about
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:29,311	| IOT198 |	Hey guess what
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,847	| IOT198 |	Read Macbeth.
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:32,383	| IOT198 |	If you listen to us
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,175	| IOT198 |	Episode
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:35,967	| IOT198 |	Is the third year that
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:37,759	| IOT198 |	We've heard about the bread
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,551	| IOT198 |	Alliance pushing.
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,575	| IOT198 |	Uniform stand
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,671	| IOT198 |	Dbrand
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:46,719	| IOT198 |	We're just still here on that
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:47,743	| IOT198 |	We're not going to see those products
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,047	| IOT198 |	Yeah we've been
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:51,583	| IOT198 |	Is third time around now
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:54,655	| IOT198 |	Are waiting waiting waiting so I don't understand what's happening there
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:58,495	| IOT198 |	Your interoperability is coming from Amazon Echo or Google home right now
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,007	| IOT198 |	That is
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,031	| IOT198 |	The reality that
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,567	| IOT198 |	Scene in the show
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:02,847	| IOT198 |	Baidu
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:05,919	| IOT198 |	I didn't
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:07,455	| IOT198 |	A lot of really cool tack but I did like
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:08,479	| IOT198 |	Bosch
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:09,503	| IOT198 |	He AI
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:11,039	| IOT198 |	Which is
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:13,343	| IOT198 |	Sims 4 projections
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:15,903	| IOT198 |	And it's basically a
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:16,672	| IOT198 |	Projector is it is
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:19,232	| IOT198 |	Display you mount it underneath a cabinet
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:21,024	| IOT198 |	Kitchen in a project
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,096	| IOT198 |	Videos
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,632	| IOT198 |	It can
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,912	| IOT198 |	Play
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:29,728	| IOT198 |	That she could even estimate the weight of things like
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:31,264	| IOT198 |	Which I thought was
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:31,776	| IOT198 |	Crazy
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:33,056	| IOT198 |	Can identify food
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,872	| IOT198 |	It's very much designed right now
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:39,200	| IOT198 |	I've long thought the smart
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,992	| IOT198 |	Needed a flexible
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:41,760	| IOT198 |	Screen option
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:45,344	| IOT198 |	So I'm kind of excited by this but a lot of other
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,648	| IOT198 |	It's not going to work
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:51,232	| IOT198 |	Well I don't know what the cost is so that could be an issue
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:53,792	| IOT198 |	Flexible screens aren't she be there so
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:56,096	| IOT198 |	I think in the kitchen right now you're looking at a small
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:56,864	| IOT198 |	Smart display
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,912	| IOT198 |	And inexpensive
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:01,216	| IOT198 |	Having a smart display
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:04,032	| IOT198 |	I don't know the price and it's going to come out
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,056	| IOT198 |	In China
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:06,848	| IOT198 |	In March is what
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:07,360	| IOT198 |	She saying
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:08,640	| IOT198 |	And in the US
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:10,688	| IOT198 |	You know
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:12,736	| IOT198 |	Buy flexible I mean more like I could
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:13,504	| IOT198 |	Projected
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:14,272	| IOT198 |	Anywhere
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,552	| IOT198 |	And I could interact with it is
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:17,600	| IOT198 |	Supposed to flexible light foldable
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:18,880	| IOT198 |	Which I'm sure they're both
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,416	| IOT198 |	Prince here at CES
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:23,488	| IOT198 |	What would I do like about it was that you could interact
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:25,280	| IOT198 |	Little bit
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:26,816	| IOT198 |	Interesting Lee
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:29,376	| IOT198 |	Like so like there was a demo where they shooting
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:32,704	| IOT198 |	Or actually they showed a demo of like
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:33,984	| IOT198 |	Ikaw you're like
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:35,008	| IOT198 |	Which part of the cow are you
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:35,520	| IOT198 |	Are you wanting to eat
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:38,080	| IOT198 |	Depressed it was a diagram
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:41,664	| IOT198 |	Are you press it and it would talk to you about how to
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:46,016	| IOT198 |	Rapper take care of that state while you have your state next to you
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:48,832	| IOT198 |	I don't want to see like a picture of a real cow
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,928	| IOT198 |	Bambi was a deer
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:53,952	| IOT198 |	But still
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:59,072	| IOT198 |	I like the thing I like the projection on the cake where you have a slider under the cake
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:00,096	| IOT198 |	And you can say I want
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,120	| IOT198 |	Taking this many
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:01,888	| IOT198 |	Pieces
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:03,936	| IOT198 |	And you would slide and the protector
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:05,728	| IOT198 |	That was awesome
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:06,752	| IOT198 |	Exact
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:08,544	| IOT198 |	Silver $300
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:15,456	| IOT198 |	I would not cuz I don't need a lot of cake well you can also instead of a screen that you have
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:16,480	| IOT198 |	In your kitchen
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,040	| IOT198 |	It's not
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:19,808	| IOT198 |	I mean if you bet
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:20,576	| IOT198 |	Sticky hands
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,344	| IOT198 |	Does it matter
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,624	| IOT198 |	Satanic like a smart
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,136	| IOT198 |	Display the
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,184	| IOT198 |	Turn
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:29,536	| IOT198 |	You need it I don't know I'm kind of one of those little hand sanitizer so I don't have to
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:32,352	| IOT198 |	What does SUS mean
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:34,144	| IOT198 |	Alright Kevin clearly doesn't
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:37,728	| IOT198 |	I'm like at some point in time you have to get hands and you just need to get
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,544	| IOT198 |	Why don't eat ribs or corn on the cob
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:44,128	| IOT198 |	Summers where the food okay
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,152	| IOT198 |	That's distressing
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,432	| IOT198 |	We find out if
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:46,944	| IOT198 |	Fiesta
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,992	| IOT198 |	Alright let's see
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:50,016	| IOT198 |	Before we end
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:51,296	| IOT198 |	What other things
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:51,808	| IOT198 |	Do we think
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,600	| IOT198 |	We're worth noting
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:54,368	| IOT198 |	Iowa
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:58,208	| IOT198 |	Through until smooth it was a lot of 5G I should tell everybody
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:59,232	| IOT198 |	If you're into 5G
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:00,768	| IOT198 |	Place to be
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:01,536	| IOT198 |	So much
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:06,400	| IOT198 |	Surprising again that's that I'm like nothing
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:07,936	| IOT198 |	Super Innovative and I was really
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:10,752	| IOT198 |	If you want to fix
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:13,056	| IOT198 |	She be great if you want to connect an appliance
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:13,824	| IOT198 |	Also fine
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:16,640	| IOT198 |	ACV with
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:18,688	| IOT198 |	Very little for cake
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:23,040	| IOT198 |	Yet we were in one of those Cycles right now right you have
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:25,856	| IOT198 |	Something that really moves the needle and for a couple years
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:27,392	| IOT198 |	Add apps
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:29,440	| IOT198 |	Does whatever that new
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:29,952	| IOT198 |	Today is
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:32,000	| IOT198 |	But now we're next like love
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:34,304	| IOT198 |	Smart speakers digital assistants
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,072	| IOT198 |	WhatsApp
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:37,888	| IOT198 |	Connectivity everything and we're just riding the wave
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:38,912	| IOT198 |	The next big thing
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:40,960	| IOT198 |	Alright so
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:43,008	| IOT198 |	My prediction for the next big thing
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,056	| IOT198 |	Interfaces
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:45,824	| IOT198 |	How about
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:49,920	| IOT198 |	Interfaces that are like embedded in your ears and on your eyeballs
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:50,944	| IOT198 |	Not your eyeballs
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:53,248	| IOT198 |	Kevin and I tribe

EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,832	| IOT198 |	My big thing
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:57,856	| IOT198 |	You know I'm not going to
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,368	| IOT198 |	Surprise you
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:01,952	| IOT198 |	Companions robot assistance
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,768	| IOT198 |	I just look at my eye roll here
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,304	| IOT198 |	Visible or Audible
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:08,352	| IOT198 |	Gyro
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,120	| IOT198 |	She loved
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:12,448	| IOT198 |	What's my Vector I send her videos of vector doing all kinds of cool thing
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:13,472	| IOT198 |	And she loves every single one of them
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:15,776	| IOT198 |	First of all
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,056	| IOT198 |	Alright so
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:21,664	| IOT198 |	We got a mind let's take a moment to go to the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:22,432	| IOT198 |	Highline
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:25,504	| IOT198 |	Hotline is brought to you by Schlage

EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,552	| IOT198 |	Start with slave
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:29,856	| IOT198 |	And by the way we did
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:34,464	| IOT198 |	CSA Wi-Fi powered sled lock which is a first
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:37,792	| IOT198 |	And pretty significant for anybody who doesn't want to deal with
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:38,816	| IOT198 |	Bluetooth CD or
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:41,120	| IOT198 |	So all of that
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:42,144	| IOT198 |	Is now out there

EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:55,712	| IOT198 |	And we've met
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,992	| IOT198 |	Just answer your question
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,296	| IOT198 |	Let's get to this
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:25:59,808	| IOT198 |	Question
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,088	| IOT198 |	Which is
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:01,856	| IOT198 |	Scrum
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:02,368	| IOT198 |	Josh
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:03,392	| IOT198 |	Hi Kevin
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:05,440	| IOT198 |	Joshua Castillo
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:06,464	| IOT198 |	Minnesota
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:08,512	| IOT198 |	Love the podcast appreciate all the info
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,280	| IOT198 |	Operation
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,304	| IOT198 |	My question is about
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:11,840	| IOT198 |	The far-field Mike's
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,888	| IOT198 |	Christian Amazon Echo
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:17,472	| IOT198 |	A Google home wondering why they don't just put those in
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:17,984	| IOT198 |	Phone
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:22,848	| IOT198 |	Turn your phone into basically a portable echo or
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:23,616	| IOT198 |	Google home
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:28,224	| IOT198 |	I like to just be able to go wherever I am take my phone out of my pocket put it on the on the table and
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:33,600	| IOT198 |	I got my assistant right there so why can't they are why don't they put those far-field Mike's
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,368	| IOT198 |	Answer the phone
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,208	| IOT198 |	That's a great
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:39,488	| IOT198 |	Question.
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,768	| IOT198 |	Because of the Samsung press event
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:43,840	| IOT198 |	Their new smart TV remotes that have
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:44,608	| IOT198 |	Fairfield Metro
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:49,984	| IOT198 |	And that's awesome because instead of having the remote in your hand or needing to
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:51,776	| IOT198 |	You can be anywhere in the room right now
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:52,544	| IOT198 |	Centerview
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:53,312	| IOT198 |	Living room
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:54,080	| IOT198 |	Frontier TV
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,128	| IOT198 |	You can just talk to it
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:57,920	| IOT198 |	Her phone so
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:27:00,480	| IOT198 |	That's probably not a typical use case
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:02,272	| IOT198 |	And I don't think the phone manufacturer
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:04,320	| IOT198 |	We Care About That Bass
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,600	| IOT198 |	Good microphone
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:07,648	| IOT198 |	In there for phone calls and
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:08,416	| IOT198 |	Salon
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:10,976	| IOT198 |	Not so much for voice assistants so
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:12,256	| IOT198 |	I don't think it's going to happen
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:18,400	| IOT198 |	But I don't think so it's not a typical use case because you always have your phone with you yes
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:20,448	| IOT198 |	You may put it down and walk away from it
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:22,752	| IOT198 |	And therefore you need a far field microphone but
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:25,056	| IOT198 |	That's not the use case that most
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:25,824	| IOT198 |	Ace Hardware
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:26,848	| IOT198 |	Manufacturers of phones
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:29,664	| IOT198 |	Think about so I don't think it's going to happen
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,944	| IOT198 |	We'll see but that's
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:31,968	| IOT198 |	I know why they don't have it
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:32,736	| IOT198 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:33,504	| IOT198 |	That's it
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:35,552	| IOT198 |	You guys have a question for us

EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:46,304	| IOT198 |	Stay tuned for our interview with Jacob atallah of KB Home talking about how they built
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:47,328	| IOT198 |	A smart home
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:48,352	| IOT198 |	Here in Vegas
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:55,264	| IOT198 |	Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:57,824	| IOT198 |	This week sponsor is fair come a database come
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:27:59,872	| IOT198 |	And I have it all.
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:02,944	| IOT198 |	Oliveira here to talk to us from Farrakhan
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:04,480	| IOT198 |	Terracom lunch
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:08,320	| IOT198 |	Sitri Edge as an iot database back in June
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:10,624	| IOT198 |	And I'm really curious why does the edge need
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:11,136	| IOT198 |	A database
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:13,184	| IOT198 |	Bus station that's a great question
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:16,256	| IOT198 |	I guess it's closer related to why I'd Computing at all right
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:22,656	| IOT198 |	My short answer his response time is really a major transits opening different types of
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:25,728	| IOT198 |	For the market
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:33,664	| IOT198 |	Effaced a few years ago *
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:40,064	| IOT198 |	04 vs of big data but mostly volume velocity variety
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:43,648	| IOT198 |	Spencer's at the same time
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:50,304	| IOT198 |	But of course there is the more complex it gets
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:29:03,616	| IOT198 |	12th Street me all this data to the cloud in order to make this decisions is definitely an all natural way to handle this challenge
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,640	| IOT198 |	Have several problems
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:09,760	| IOT198 |	Like the network latency for example the reliability of the connection with the cloud and of course cost
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:13,344	| IOT198 |	Cloud is not cheap at all I think that's where is Computing really comes into
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:16,672	| IOT198 |	Houses change the application development
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:22,816	| IOT198 |	Well extracting meaningful information out this date in real time this will certainly require more robust infrastructure
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:29,216	| IOT198 |	Fortification point-of-view especially the edge Computing application
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:30,240	| IOT198 |	Make it easier to develop
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:35,872	| IOT198 |	And I think you're going to have to talk about what would be such database to definitely see that they certainly needs to
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:41,760	| IOT198 |	Redesign knowing all the constraint like having for a simple with small footprint gateways on the edge have a girl over the frosting
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:44,320	| IOT198 |	It's very important for this database
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:46,112	| IOT198 |	Ford flexible data schemas
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:52,512	| IOT198 |	All kinds of different variety of data and different types of sensors everyday
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:57,632	| IOT198 |	Everything definitely needs to be extremely fast that I'm out of data points are produced
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:04,032	| IOT198 |	Buy sensors in real time and buy controllers that you have to control it's absolutely incredible
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:06,080	| IOT198 |	Complexity of the environment for this application
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:07,872	| IOT198 |	Did you mentioned other platform
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:09,152	| IOT198 |	What else
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:12,480	| IOT198 |	Can an edge database do to help make a developer's life easier
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:15,552	| IOT198 |	Absolutely important because
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:20,416	| IOT198 |	The truth is that the way a application are being developed right now is on top of different types of
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:35,008	| IOT198 |	What does pacific order in series
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:41,152	| IOT198 |	Usually timestamps for you automatically collecting metadata from the sensors
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,712	| IOT198 |	Application
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:48,320	| IOT198 |	I think those are all features that an education would benefit from having a database on the edge
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:51,136	| IOT198 |	Wow that is a lot of information about databases
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:54,208	| IOT198 |	It's at the edge where can we find out more about this and about Fair
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:59,328	| IOT198 |	We have actually a great white paper that helps you decide until laxative his privates

EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:53,600	| IOT198 |	The Cask
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:56,416	| IOT198 |	To explore where the future will be
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:59,232	| IOT198 |	We strongly believe in innovation
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:04,352	| IOT198 |	And we know that if you want to predict the future the best way to do that
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:06,400	| IOT198 |	Is to make it yourself
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:09,216	| IOT198 |	So we're exploring the edges are
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:11,520	| IOT198 |	Technology and homebuilding back in
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:16,640	| IOT198 |	Intersection between the two and coming up with a very nice home that will be proud to
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:18,688	| IOT198 |	Showcase at the crime of Celia
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:24,832	| IOT198 |	So what this is is a project that is designed to show several things so

EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:31,488	| IOT198 |	Why don't we start with
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:35,584	| IOT198 |	Probably the sustainability or should we go with Innovation which would you like to start with
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:38,400	| IOT198 |	What word starts with j something about
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:40,704	| IOT198 |	Because today in today's environment
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:42,240	| IOT198 |	Sustainable T is tablespoon
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:43,520	| IOT198 |	Everything
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:45,312	| IOT198 |	Start for us at KB Homes
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:49,152	| IOT198 |	Starts with a very quality high-quality home that
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:51,968	| IOT198 |	Is also high-performance home that's where it's at
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:54,016	| IOT198 |	So every home we produce is
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:56,320	| IOT198 |	Energy star label at home
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:57,088	| IOT198 |	That means
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:33:01,440	| IOT198 |	Our customers enjoy a home with less utility bills
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:05,536	| IOT198 |	And more Comfort now with our contact home
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,048	| IOT198 |	Project
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:07,840	| IOT198 |	We went beyond that
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:08,608	| IOT198 |	So
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:11,936	| IOT198 |	Here we looked at how can a home be
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:13,216	| IOT198 |	Energy Independence
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:14,240	| IOT198 |	Ansel
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:15,264	| IOT198 |	Went beyond
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:16,288	| IOT198 |	Our products
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:18,080	| IOT198 |	Auction homes to home.
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:18,848	| IOT198 |	Is
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:19,872	| IOT198 |	NetZero
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:23,712	| IOT198 |	And has battery storage system in it so that it
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:25,760	| IOT198 |	Can be fully Off the Grid
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:32,160	| IOT198 |	As much as possible that's where the customer has very little electricity bill to pay
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:33,696	| IOT198 |	The same time as the
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:37,280	| IOT198 |	Stability and security of energy storage in their home
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:39,840	| IOT198 |	In case the grid goes down at anytime
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:42,144	| IOT198 |	So that some of the sustainability effort
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:43,424	| IOT198 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:45,216	| IOT198 |	The construction Innovation that
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:46,240	| IOT198 |	You guys are experimenting
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:48,032	| IOT198 |	Because I think that's
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:52,640	| IOT198 |	Really honestly. Maybe more game-changing than anything that you're doing here but
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:53,664	| IOT198 |	I don't know we'll see
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:54,944	| IOT198 |	Well there are many
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:56,480	| IOT198 |	Game changers in the home
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:58,016	| IOT198 |	And one of them
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:59,040	| IOT198 |	Is the
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:00,064	| IOT198 |	Outside
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:02,368	| IOT198 |	Fully integrated fabrication
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:05,440	| IOT198 |	Off the home which took place in a factory
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:06,208	| IOT198 |	First
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:07,232	| IOT198 |	You start with
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,000	| IOT198 |	What's called
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,536	| IOT198 |	Building information
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:13,376	| IOT198 |	Modeling Bim Bim models are very very precise
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:16,960	| IOT198 |	They also can visually help
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:17,728	| IOT198 |	An architect
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:19,264	| IOT198 |	See where there are conflicts
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:21,056	| IOT198 |	Between elements of the home
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:21,824	| IOT198 |	Address
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:25,408	| IOT198 |	These complex when everything is clear and the pain model
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:26,176	| IOT198 |	It's ready
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:28,224	| IOT198 |	Then in a factory setting
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:31,040	| IOT198 |	CNC machines take over and
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:33,088	| IOT198 |	Just got up all day
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:34,368	| IOT198 |	Parts of the house
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:35,136	| IOT198 |	In terms of
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:36,672	| IOT198 |	Wolves wall panels
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:38,720	| IOT198 |	Floor panel and
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:40,000	| IOT198 |	Not ready for
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:41,792	| IOT198 |	Shipping to the site
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:42,816	| IOT198 |	We actually took
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:47,936	| IOT198 |	Technologies are available today in terms of off-site fabrication
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:48,960	| IOT198 |	Step further
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:53,312	| IOT198 |	We innovated with the factory to include the insulation
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:54,080	| IOT198 |	At the factory
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:55,360	| IOT198 |	Install it there
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:57,920	| IOT198 |	And also the weatherization
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:35:00,224	| IOT198 |	Sheathing from the outside as well
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:01,504	| IOT198 |	So the house
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,784	| IOT198 |	Came to the side
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:04,576	| IOT198 |	With insulation in place
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:09,696	| IOT198 |	And reduce the amount of Labor needed for insulation on site when the house came on
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:12,768	| IOT198 |	Insight that we had a cranberry that pulled up the house
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:15,840	| IOT198 |	Today's we have the whole frame
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:17,632	| IOT198 |	Structure of the house done
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:19,168	| IOT198 |	So from that point on
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:23,008	| IOT198 |	It was a matter of just finishing up the house the finishes of the house
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:25,568	| IOT198 |	The trim and fixtures
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:27,360	| IOT198 |	And
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:32,224	| IOT198 |	Not want to be missed are all the iot devices and printers that
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:32,992	| IOT198 |	Reports in the house
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:35,040	| IOT198 |	We will get to those
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:37,344	| IOT198 |	And now so prefabrication
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:39,648	| IOT198 |	Sustainability are there other
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:40,416	| IOT198 |	Building
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:41,696	| IOT198 |	Technologies that
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:44,000	| IOT198 |	You guys explored in this that you should talk about
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:45,024	| IOT198 |	Or that you want to share
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:46,816	| IOT198 |	Certainly there are many
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:47,584	| IOT198 |	As a
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:48,864	| IOT198 |	Said earlier
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:49,632	| IOT198 |	We added
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:51,424	| IOT198 |	Insulation in the factory bugged
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:52,448	| IOT198 |	Form of therapy
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:53,216	| IOT198 |	Insulation
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:55,008	| IOT198 |	Was also very innovative
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:55,776	| IOT198 |	It wasn't
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:59,872	| IOT198 |	Fiberglass batt insulation and it was not spray foam
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:03,712	| IOT198 |	Insulation either it was phenolic type of insulation
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:04,736	| IOT198 |	That has
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:06,016	| IOT198 |	Double the amount of
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:07,552	| IOT198 |	Insulation value
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:08,320	| IOT198 |	Corrine
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:09,088	| IOT198 |	Dan
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:10,880	| IOT198 |	Other systems that are on the market
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:11,648	| IOT198 |	It's right now
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:13,440	| IOT198 |	It is a technology coming
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:14,208	| IOT198 |	From Europe
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:18,816	| IOT198 |	That's we adapted here and because it comes in solid panel
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:21,376	| IOT198 |	It was easy for us to cut the fence
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,400	| IOT198 |	Sea machines
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:24,448	| IOT198 |	Put them in the wall base
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:27,264	| IOT198 |	And have the insulation already done in the house
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:29,568	| IOT198 |	That's just one example of several
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:32,640	| IOT198 |	Super materials and material innovation
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:35,456	| IOT198 |	That we are leveraged in this house
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:38,528	| IOT198 |	Oh man I was so excited when I got the spray foam
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:39,808	| IOT198 |	Play my house so now there's a
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:42,368	| IOT198 |	Insulation R-value
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:44,928	| IOT198 |	Gosh all right
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:48,256	| IOT198 |	It's better with the spray foam insulation than what you see
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:50,304	| IOT198 |	5 years ago
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:51,072	| IOT198 |	It is true
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:52,864	| IOT198 |	Go technology
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:53,376	| IOT198 |	Okay
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:56,448	| IOT198 |	Let's talk about some of the other Technologies
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:57,984	| IOT198 |	Putting in the house I promise people
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:59,264	| IOT198 |	Smart home stuff in
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:05,152	| IOT198 |	I'm sure you will deliver before we go into like specific devices talk to me about how you thought
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,176	| IOT198 |	About adding
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:08,224	| IOT198 |	Connected devices and smart
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:08,992	| IOT198 |	To this
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:09,504	| IOT198 |	Particular home
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:11,296	| IOT198 |	What's a seaweed
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:12,064	| IOT198 |	Leverage
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:13,088	| IOT198 |	Technology
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:14,624	| IOT198 |	To add to the
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:16,160	| IOT198 |	Comfort of the home
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:17,440	| IOT198 |	The easel
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:18,464	| IOT198 |	Living at home
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:21,280	| IOT198 |	The wellness house comes
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:22,560	| IOT198 |	From living in a
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:23,328	| IOT198 |	Healthy
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:24,608	| IOT198 |	Well-constructed
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:25,632	| IOT198 |	We wanted
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:27,936	| IOT198 |	Technology to serve
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:29,216	| IOT198 |	The homeowner
EDL	00:37:29,216	00:37:31,008	| IOT198 |	In meaningful ways
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:32,288	| IOT198 |	Beyond where
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:34,080	| IOT198 |	Technologies are at right now
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:35,872	| IOT198 |	We started with
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:37,920	| IOT198 |	Understanding of what Foundation
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:39,200	| IOT198 |	We want to have in the house

EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:42,784	| IOT198 |	Is very important
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:46,112	| IOT198 |	We can transcend
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:47,904	| IOT198 |	The current automated

EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:53,792	| IOT198 |	Smart home or even to think
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:56,608	| IOT198 |	Walking home that will do things on behalf of the homeowner
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:58,144	| IOT198 |	Show

EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:04,544	| IOT198 |	Google we have Google as our platform
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:05,312	| IOT198 |	In the home
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:07,360	| IOT198 |	Boston artificial intelligence
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:09,408	| IOT198 |	And in mesh Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:11,456	| IOT198 |	These are two important
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:12,480	| IOT198 |	Foundation
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:13,504	| IOT198 |	From which
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:15,552	| IOT198 |	We built on centers built
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:17,088	| IOT198 |	Event wall lighting
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:21,696	| IOT198 |	Smart appliances that are smart air conditioning thermostat
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:24,512	| IOT198 |	System back are very responsive
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:27,840	| IOT198 |	To the environment if the home band results was
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:32,192	| IOT198 |	We are getting closer to a pinking home that will do things for you
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:34,752	| IOT198 |	Okay so there's a lot to unpack there
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:37,824	| IOT198 |	And we'll start with this idea of
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:40,128	| IOT198 |	Good connectivity makes for a good home
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:40,896	| IOT198 |	Which I totally agree
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:43,968	| IOT198 |	Like Yay let's get Wi-Fi everywhere
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:46,784	| IOT198 |	How do you build that into a home
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:47,552	| IOT198 |	Amica
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:48,320	| IOT198 |	Easy
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:50,880	| IOT198 |	For the homeowner so what is the process there
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,928	| IOT198 |	We started with great partners
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:54,720	| IOT198 |	That understood that
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:55,744	| IOT198 |	The systems
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:58,048	| IOT198 |	Four of them have to be simple
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:39:01,120	| IOT198 |	And easy to use for the homeowner
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:05,728	| IOT198 |	This is how we can give back time to the homeowner not to give them it's very complex
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:08,800	| IOT198 |	The truth of the matter is
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:12,896	| IOT198 |	That the home of the future could have awkward
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:14,944	| IOT198 |	75 Wi-Fi device
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:16,480	| IOT198 |	And may have
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:19,040	| IOT198 |	Advocated mesh Network
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:19,552	| IOT198 |	Show
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:21,856	| IOT198 |	It's not that easy
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:25,184	| IOT198 |	Going forward then I think we all still need to innovate
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:29,792	| IOT198 |	Little bit more towards an easier system to manage
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:33,888	| IOT198 |	I would say Google did a great thing in October
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:35,680	| IOT198 |	2018 when they
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:37,472	| IOT198 |	Revamp the Google home
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:40,544	| IOT198 |	Which now incorporates all the
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:42,336	| IOT198 |	We don't have to go to
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:43,872	| IOT198 |	20 different apps
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:44,896	| IOT198 |	Open your
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,432	| IOT198 |	Doron look at the light
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:48,992	| IOT198 |	Other things it's all in
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:49,760	| IOT198 |	In one app
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:51,040	| IOT198 |	Within the Google home
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:53,344	| IOT198 |	So it's Innovations like that then
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:54,112	| IOT198 |	Will make it
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:56,160	| IOT198 |	Easier in the future for customers
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:40:01,024	| IOT198 |	The Google mesh network is also very user-friendly you don't have
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:03,328	| IOT198 |	To worry about a lot of IP address
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:04,352	| IOT198 |	Seven Salon
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:05,120	| IOT198 |	Lot of it
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:08,704	| IOT198 |	Ask away from the consumer so that
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:13,056	| IOT198 |	You just have to enjoy I got a new item I can plug it
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:15,872	| IOT198 |	Into the network and it will join the network Tennessee
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:16,896	| IOT198 |	I think
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:22,784	| IOT198 |	Innovations come from many parts but we still have some room to improve in that area going forward
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:27,136	| IOT198 |	Let's talk about things like having sensors built into the walls
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:28,928	| IOT198 |	Thermostats and that sort of thing
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:31,744	| IOT198 |	Even just a few moments ago we were talking about installation
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:33,792	| IOT198 |	Technology has changed so much
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:34,816	| IOT198 |	5 years
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:37,888	| IOT198 |	So that's something I probably wouldn't mess with
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:41,728	| IOT198 |	Because you know you're not going to open up the walls of your home for a while hopefully
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:47,360	| IOT198 |	But how do you think about building in technology which tends to have a much shorter life cycle than traditional building
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:49,664	| IOT198 |	There's no better time
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:51,200	| IOT198 |	Built-in
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:51,968	| IOT198 |	Technology
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:54,528	| IOT198 |	Then when you're starting from a blank canvas
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:56,064	| IOT198 |	It's easier
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:57,600	| IOT198 |	Include items
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:41:00,160	| IOT198 |	Built into the wall but to your point
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:01,696	| IOT198 |	Even these sensors
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:04,000	| IOT198 |	May be surpassed in
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:07,072	| IOT198 |	Few years so the Innovation that we did
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:08,864	| IOT198 |	2
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:09,632	| IOT198 |	Put them
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:11,168	| IOT198 |	In junction box
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:13,216	| IOT198 |	And so you can I park RV
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:16,288	| IOT198 |	We passed to each juncture box
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:22,688	| IOT198 |	Cat5 cable and just in case if that particular sensor or are you
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:24,736	| IOT198 |	Device is not Wi-Fi
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:27,040	| IOT198 |	It will have available to it
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:28,576	| IOT198 |	The cable if we need to use
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:31,136	| IOT198 |	When you create it
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:33,440	| IOT198 |	Provided with power and will
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:34,976	| IOT198 |	Communication
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:35,488	| IOT198 |	Caribou
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:37,280	| IOT198 |	Is future proof
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:38,048	| IOT198 |	To the best
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:39,840	| IOT198 |	Know-how at this time
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:41,632	| IOT198 |	What we have in them
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:43,936	| IOT198 |	Right now are indoor air quality
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:47,264	| IOT198 |	And then you put a cover plate on that juncture bar
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:51,872	| IOT198 |	Women slap in the cover plate so that the air quality
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:58,015	| IOT198 |	Dissenters can continue to sample the air in the house and passively in the background
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:59,551	| IOT198 |	Would be able to
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:00,831	| IOT198 |	Say okay
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:01,855	| IOT198 |	This room
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:03,903	| IOT198 |	Perhaps they tried something
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:05,695	| IOT198 |	And that kitchen this will mean
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:07,231	| IOT198 |	More air at this time
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:12,863	| IOT198 |	And if then sends a signal to the air conditioning system which is zoom we have
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:15,935	| IOT198 |	Glow Housewives
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:18,495	| IOT198 |	Signal to the air conditioning system where
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:21,823	| IOT198 |	This is considered pump no fresh air into that zone
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:25,407	| IOT198 |	So that's just one example of built-in iot
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:26,431	| IOT198 |	And how we might
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:28,735	| IOT198 |	Keep them to keep the house youku
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:29,759	| IOT198 |	For the future
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:32,575	| IOT198 |	So let's say I purchase this home
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:34,879	| IOT198 |	How do I get it set up to work with
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:37,439	| IOT198 |	My family and then who do I call if in
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:39,231	| IOT198 |	Six or seven months
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:41,023	| IOT198 |	I don't know something breaks or I get
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:44,607	| IOT198 |	Confused her I'd like to set up a movie timer
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:47,423	| IOT198 |	More
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:48,959	| IOT198 |	Sophisticated
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:50,495	| IOT198 |	To the extent that
EDL	00:42:50,495	00:42:55,615	| IOT198 |	We would anytime KB Home build a relationship with our customers we always wanted
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:57,407	| IOT198 |	To be a Wonderful World
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:59,711	| IOT198 |	A wonderful experience for our customers
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:02,783	| IOT198 |	10 KB Home has
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:04,063	| IOT198 |	Collaboration
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:06,111	| IOT198 |	Dish smart home services
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:09,183	| IOT198 |	Using the same network that dish satellite
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:14,303	| IOT198 |	TV entertainment have on the country they have teams that are specialized
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:19,423	| IOT198 |	And smart home services and we work with them to give our customers at this time
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:23,007	| IOT198 |	So initially after a homeowner movies in
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:24,031	| IOT198 |	We asked them
EDL	00:43:24,031	00:43:25,311	| IOT198 |	To call
EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:27,359	| IOT198 |	Dish smart home services
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:28,895	| IOT198 |	And ask them to come in
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:30,687	| IOT198 |	At the convenience of the customer
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:32,223	| IOT198 |	They come in to help them
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:32,735	| IOT198 |	Get up there
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:36,319	| IOT198 |	The Nest hello doorbell at the front door
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:37,087	| IOT198 |	The house
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,879	| IOT198 |	And the thermostat from
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:40,671	| IOT198 |	Carrier and mesh
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:42,207	| IOT198 |	Wi-Fi network from goo
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:43,487	| IOT198 |	Panda
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:45,023	| IOT198 |	Speakers that Google home
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:45,791	| IOT198 |	Speakers
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:47,327	| IOT198 |	So they come in
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:50,143	| IOT198 |	And Ben couple hours with the customer
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:52,959	| IOT198 |	In my estimation if the customer was going to do this
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:53,983	| IOT198 |	All on their own
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:56,799	| IOT198 |	Digression the weekend
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:44:02,943	| IOT198 |	Want to do it no and we prefer it based on the kind of relationships we want to have with our customers
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:04,223	| IOT198 |	That it is done
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:09,087	| IOT198 |	At the convenience of the customer and within a couple hours the couple hours are taken
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:10,111	| IOT198 |	2 /
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:14,207	| IOT198 |	Shut off the network and connect all the items to it do
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:16,767	| IOT198 |	Show the customer house
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:18,559	| IOT198 |	And then
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:20,095	| IOT198 |	Leave them with
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:23,167	| IOT198 |	Information where they can call for the next 6 months
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:24,959	| IOT198 |	They can call and get
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:30,591	| IOT198 |	Support either online or by phone on any other device that bring to the home
EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:32,895	| IOT198 |	Say if they going they buy a new
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:37,503	| IOT198 |	TV that has Chromecast built into it and they bring it to him and they want to connect
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:39,551	| IOT198 |	To the network they can get support
EDL	00:44:39,551	00:44:40,831	| IOT198 |	To do any of these
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:42,623	| IOT198 |	Additional iot item
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:43,647	| IOT198 |	Around the house
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:44,415	| IOT198 |	Got it
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:47,743	| IOT198 |	Okay and let's talk about how this fits in with
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:49,791	| IOT198 |	KB Home and it's
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:51,071	| IOT198 |	Plans going forward
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:52,607	| IOT198 |	So there is Ben
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:53,887	| IOT198 |	Probably for the last
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:56,703	| IOT198 |	10 years or so efforts in the Home Building community
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:57,727	| IOT198 |	To provide
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:44:58,751	| IOT198 |	Services
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:44:59,519	| IOT198 |	Is after the sale
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:02,847	| IOT198 |	So this might be warranties this might be
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:03,871	| IOT198 |	Pest detection
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:07,199	| IOT198 |	How is something like this new KB Home Project
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:08,223	| IOT198 |	Fit within that
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:09,503	| IOT198 |	I guess additional Revenue
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:12,063	| IOT198 |	I think the future
EDL	00:45:12,063	00:45:13,087	| IOT198 |	May hold
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:14,111	| IOT198 |	Room for
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:14,623	| IOT198 |	Somebody
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:16,159	| IOT198 |	That can
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:17,695	| IOT198 |	Continue to provide service
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:18,463	| IOT198 |	As for the home
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:19,999	| IOT198 |	It could be in
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:21,279	| IOT198 |	Different areas
EDL	00:45:21,279	00:45:22,303	| IOT198 |	Whether it is
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:23,327	| IOT198 |	The digital
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:25,375	| IOT198 |	Smart home area or in
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:27,679	| IOT198 |	And the Health and Wellness Water
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:30,239	| IOT198 |	Purification air filters
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:32,543	| IOT198 |	There is room for that
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:35,359	| IOT198 |	And I think some business models are evolve
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:39,967	| IOT198 |	So
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:44,319	| IOT198 |	From our perspective at KB for this particular house
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:45,087	| IOT198 |	It does
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:49,183	| IOT198 |	Have health and wellness system with air purification
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:55,583	| IOT198 |	Water purification systems in it as well and these things do need the filters changed over time
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:45:59,679	| IOT198 |	Whether we leave it to the customer if they are very much do it
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:03,519	| IOT198 |	Myself type of person then they can do it themselves
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:07,359	| IOT198 |	Ordering the filters or it can be a service provided
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:11,455	| IOT198 |	To come in and change the filters air and water filters for them
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:12,479	| IOT198 |	Regular base
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:18,111	| IOT198 |	Is that the app will continue to remind them when that mean
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:18,879	| IOT198 |	To happen
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:20,415	| IOT198 |	So if they do it then
EDL	00:46:20,415	00:46:23,743	| IOT198 |	They still have some reminders
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:27,583	| IOT198 |	Got it in the app is the generic Google hours of KB Home
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:35,263	| IOT198 |	Darwin Wellness intelligence application or system and an application related to it
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:36,287	| IOT198 |	It controls
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:42,175	| IOT198 |	Indoor air quality sensors that I mentioned earlier but it's also controls lighting
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:45,503	| IOT198 |	Filtration purification system
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:48,319	| IOT198 |	For the house as well the water and the air
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:49,599	| IOT198 |	And then of course
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:50,623	| IOT198 |	Can allow you to
EDL	00:46:52,927	00:46:55,487	| IOT198 |	The system also can passively
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:56,511	| IOT198 |	Do the lights
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:46:57,279	| IOT198 |	According
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:58,303	| IOT198 |	True that hour of
EDL	00:46:59,071	00:47:00,095	| IOT198 |	And according to
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:01,375	| IOT198 |	Perhaps some precepts
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:04,959	| IOT198 |	So that's how the Darwin
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:05,983	| IOT198 |	System works
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:07,775	| IOT198 |	And it's app is
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:10,847	| IOT198 |	We be a front interface use it if you'd like
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:17,759	| IOT198 |	But if you leave it alone the house will still be maintained in a nice way for a healthy wellness way
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:18,783	| IOT198 |	Because of the
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:20,319	| IOT198 |	Precepts in the system
EDL	00:47:20,319	00:47:22,879	| IOT198 |	Okay so in addition to this home.
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:24,159	| IOT198 |	Prefabricated
EDL	00:47:25,695	00:47:29,023	| IOT198 |	As part of the building materials you also have made it flexible
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:30,559	| IOT198 |	Imus modular inside
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:31,839	| IOT198 |	Can you talk a little bit about that
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:35,679	| IOT198 |	ACS we did that we designed a home that can
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:38,239	| IOT198 |	Flex with the life stages of the homo
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:40,799	| IOT198 |	Trust me it's a two-story home
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:41,567	| IOT198 |	With
EDL	00:47:41,567	00:47:43,359	| IOT198 |	Secondary bedrooms upstairs
EDL	00:47:43,359	00:47:45,407	| IOT198 |	That can be used by the
EDL	00:47:45,407	00:47:49,247	| IOT198 |	Homeowner if they have children or boomeranging
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:51,295	| IOT198 |	Children and Swan however
EDL	00:47:51,295	00:47:54,879	| IOT198 |	At their later life stages where they may not need that
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:57,695	| IOT198 |	They could separate the first floor from second
EDL	00:47:57,695	00:48:04,095	| IOT198 |	Very easily because we already built the entrance to the second floor that too independent and a way to separate
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:05,119	| IOT198 |	2 floors
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:06,655	| IOT198 |	So they can separate them
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:13,055	| IOT198 |	For the rental or for a caregiver to be in the Upper Floor and have full
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:15,359	| IOT198 |	Units of their for their private use
EDL	00:48:15,359	00:48:17,407	| IOT198 |	At the same time we built
EDL	00:48:17,407	00:48:19,711	| IOT198 |	On the first floor flexible wall
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:24,063	| IOT198 |	Moves via electricity and a motor
EDL	00:48:24,063	00:48:24,575	| IOT198 |	It moves
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:29,439	| IOT198 |	Forwards and backwards into a space that were calling a flex space
EDL	00:48:29,951	00:48:35,327	| IOT198 |	When the wall is all the way to the outside of that Flex space
EDL	00:48:35,327	00:48:37,887	| IOT198 |	That room can be a bedroom
EDL	00:48:37,887	00:48:38,655	| IOT198 |	Or an office
EDL	00:48:39,167	00:48:40,191	| IOT198 |	And it
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:43,007	| IOT198 |	Even has wall bed that comes down and
EDL	00:48:43,519	00:48:48,127	| IOT198 |	Certainly becomes a bedroom and it has a built-in desk as well for
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:48,895	| IOT198 |	An office
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:50,431	| IOT198 |	When the wall is
EDL	00:48:50,431	00:48:51,711	| IOT198 |	All the way back
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:52,991	| IOT198 |	Internet speed
EDL	00:48:52,991	00:48:57,599	| IOT198 |	It gives a space over to the great room so if you have
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:49:02,207	| IOT198 |	40 you have family over you are using more of that
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:03,999	| IOT198 |	Room for the open
EDL	00:49:03,999	00:49:07,327	| IOT198 |	Room that makes the great space and is the place to socialize
EDL	00:49:07,839	00:49:10,911	| IOT198 |	Jacob that is a lot I can't wait to see
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:11,679	| IOT198 |	This whole
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:12,191	| IOT198 |	In action
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:14,239	| IOT198 |	This is a project home
EDL	00:49:14,239	00:49:20,639	| IOT198 |	Is this something that will be available for people on the market or how do you plan to use your learnings from this going forward
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:23,711	| IOT198 |	That's certainly this is a contact home we built it to it
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:25,759	| IOT198 |	Store work tomorrow
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:28,575	| IOT198 |	And to the extent that we experience
EDL	00:49:28,575	00:49:29,599	| IOT198 |	Many things in this
EDL	00:49:30,623	00:49:33,183	| IOT198 |	We know there are some items that we would love
EDL	00:49:33,183	00:49:39,583	| IOT198 |	To start bringing into our production home and make it available to our customers very soon Cason
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:41,631	| IOT198 |	Is the Darwin
EDL	00:49:41,631	00:49:42,399	| IOT198 |	Wellness
EDL	00:49:42,399	00:49:43,167	| IOT198 |	Intelligence
EDL	00:49:43,167	00:49:45,727	| IOT198 |	We're going to be a pilot and get
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:48,799	| IOT198 |	10 offering it in certain Market see it through
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:51,615	| IOT198 |	Start building on it from a base package
EDL	00:49:51,615	00:49:52,895	| IOT198 |	Growing get going
EDL	00:49:52,895	00:49:54,431	| IOT198 |	The same with
EDL	00:49:54,431	00:49:59,295	| IOT198 |	Other Technologies in the home many of them are already offered by a bee home
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:50:00,575	| IOT198 |	Smart appliances
EDL	00:50:01,599	00:50:03,391	| IOT198 |	Many others as well
EDL	00:50:03,391	00:50:05,695	| IOT198 |	So there is a lot that we learn from it
EDL	00:50:05,695	00:50:07,487	| IOT198 |	And we hope to be
EDL	00:50:07,487	00:50:13,631	| IOT198 |	Making them more production-oriented and bring them to the Market within months and coming years
EDL	00:50:14,143	00:50:19,775	| IOT198 |	Awesome alright will Jacob thank you so much for sharing with us this vision of the future
