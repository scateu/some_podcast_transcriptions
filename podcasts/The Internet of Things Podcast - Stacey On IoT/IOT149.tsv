EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:58,016	| IOT149 |	Let's get this show on the road
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:01:59,552	| IOT149 |	Let's talk about Strava
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:00,832	| IOT149 |	Let's summarize
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:04,160	| IOT149 |	First for those of you guys who've been living under a rock
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:05,696	| IOT149 |	What happened
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:08,512	| IOT149 |	Let's tell me what Strava is for sex
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:13,888	| IOT149 |	Exercise tracking applications been around for a long time I've used it in the past four foot certain
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:16,448	| IOT149 |	Smart watches and obviously with phones
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:22,848	| IOT149 |	When you run or exercise you can track your location to GPS and I do this kind of thing with a different app called
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:24,896	| IOT149 |	RunKeeper that way I can see where I ran on
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:26,432	| IOT149 |	Elevation salon
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:29,248	| IOT149 |	Oops trouble puts out heat maps of
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:32,320	| IOT149 |	All of the runners data and it's all anonymous
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:35,392	| IOT149 |	Stencil on what it was recently found out that you could
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:40,256	| IOT149 |	C on the heat Maps if you search for say a nuclear facility or
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,280	| IOT149 |	Army base
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:41,792	| IOT149 |	See
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,584	| IOT149 |	Strava users
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,352	| IOT149 |	Around
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:47,168	| IOT149 |	That area which is a obvious privacy
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,936	| IOT149 |	Problem
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:51,264	| IOT149 |	At a very high level and recently had a very lower level
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:57,408	| IOT149 |	Was found out that you could even get the names of people find their heart rate and so on you knew how to do so
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,456	| IOT149 |	That information came out of wired
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,992	| IOT149 |	Just earlier this week so
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:07,648	| IOT149 |	That's a big problem and I know strawberries looking into this they had a post on their company blog from the leadership there
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,696	| IOT149 |	It's an issue
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,720	| IOT149 |	It's a big issue
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:12,256	| IOT149 |	Yes it is
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,024	| IOT149 |	And
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,816	| IOT149 |	We talked about it a little with our guest
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:15,840	| IOT149 |	So that'll happen
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:19,424	| IOT149 |	But the big thing that we got to keep in mind here is
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:20,704	| IOT149 |	1
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:23,008	| IOT149 |	Apart of these people share their data voluntarily
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:29,664	| IOT149 |	Top 10 things in place what they didn't account for is what happened to the data what was combined with other
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:34,784	| IOT149 |	I think what does tells us
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:35,552	| IOT149 |	Is that
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:38,368	| IOT149 |	It is impossible to see what you search
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:38,880	| IOT149 |	Your data is going
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:46,816	| IOT149 |	Really unnerving when we start thinking about how we can combine information and different ways to
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:48,864	| IOT149 |	Help people or two
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,400	| IOT149 |	Discover new things about
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,192	| IOT149 |	It becomes
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,728	| IOT149 |	Searchable online
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:54,496	| IOT149 |	And
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,008	| IOT149 |	It stays there for
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,568	| IOT149 |	Yeah you're absolutely right
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:04:03,968	| IOT149 |	Again I like with Strava does in theory with the heat map is showing people you know it's Community where people are running
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:06,784	| IOT149 |	Exercising like if I travel say to a London
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:11,392	| IOT149 |	And I'll go look for a running route it's very easy to go to Strava and say hey a lot of people run
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:14,208	| IOT149 |	Right here and nice 5 Mile Loop
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,512	| IOT149 |	So it's useful to me as a user
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:17,280	| IOT149 |	But
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:23,167	| IOT149 |	Obviously that data can be used in other ways and like you said you don't know how it's going to be used and
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:27,007	| IOT149 |	It is voluntary to provide that data I actually again I use RunKeeper
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:31,871	| IOT149 |	I share my map dated with my friends on RunKeeper people that I know and trust
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:34,943	| IOT149 |	Crunchy person put out heat Maps or anything but if they did
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:38,015	| IOT149 |	You know what's the policy there because I'm not
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:44,415	| IOT149 |	Sharing my information publicly would they not use it in their heat map I don't know it's a lot of questions here on how the baby is you
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:44,927	| IOT149 |	You said you would said
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,207	| IOT149 |	And
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,231	| IOT149 |	You will learn more
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:48,511	| IOT149 |	This whole conversation
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,279	| IOT149 |	It's not a way for me to
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,839	| IOT149 |	Pumper next guest
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,119	| IOT149 |	Something
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:56,447	| IOT149 |	There was a really good article in the New York Times about data being
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,471	| IOT149 |	Treated as a
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,495	| IOT149 |	Public good
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:01,567	| IOT149 |	Because not only is it my data is at risk but
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:03,359	| IOT149 |	Because of this particular instance
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:05,407	| IOT149 |	It's also National
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:05,919	| IOT149 |	Security data
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:10,271	| IOT149 |	Or if you think about a town that maybe has a lot of pollution
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:12,063	| IOT149 |	Insurance companies
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:14,623	| IOT149 |	Look at that see it Based on data
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:16,415	| IOT149 |	Variety of other sensors
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:18,975	| IOT149 |	And say hey we're going to charge everybody who lives there a lot
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,023	| IOT149 |	So we're going to start
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,839	| IOT149 |	Conversations emerge where
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:24,863	| IOT149 |	It honestly
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:30,751	| IOT149 |	In America because we're such an individualistic society and we put a lot of Burden
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,775	| IOT149 |	Only individual
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:33,823	| IOT149 |	I'm really interested to see how this will
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,591	| IOT149 |	Play out
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,103	| IOT149 |	Because
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:37,663	| IOT149 |	This is kind of a community
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:38,431	| IOT149 |	Good
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,199	| IOT149 |	Evidence
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,479	| IOT149 |	Soar Community problems
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,295	| IOT149 |	Evolution
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:46,367	| IOT149 |	To a new talent that Madam a half
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,159	| IOT149 |	We tested this
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,183	| IOT149 |	Morning
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:51,743	| IOT149 |	From your Android phone you can send
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,511	| IOT149 |	An SMS text
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,303	| IOT149 |	Using
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:57,631	| IOT149 |	Madam so all you have to do is say not Ma
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:58,399	| IOT149 |	Send a text
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:01,215	| IOT149 |	Message to and pick someone in your contacts
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:01,983	| IOT149 |	Next iPad
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:02,751	| IOT149 |	Kevin
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:03,519	| IOT149 |	So I said
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:05,823	| IOT149 |	Send a text message to Kevin tofel
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:06,591	| IOT149 |	And
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,103	| IOT149 |	She said
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,639	| IOT149 |	Kevin tofel right
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:09,919	| IOT149 |	And I said yes
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:10,943	| IOT149 |	And she said
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,223	| IOT149 |	What is the message
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:13,759	| IOT149 |	April the message
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:16,575	| IOT149 |	And lo and behold a moment later
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:17,087	| IOT149 |	Received it
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:20,671	| IOT149 |	I received it and I also got a little link
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:25,023	| IOT149 |	To hear the actual audio of your message as well so what you recorded or
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:27,839	| IOT149 |	What she recorded you saying I got that as well
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:30,655	| IOT149 |	Which is useful because maybe something doesn't transcribe properly
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,959	| IOT149 |	Play so it is only working with
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:38,335	| IOT149 |	Android phones for USA sender as a recipient I got it on my iPhone but I could not
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,615	| IOT149 |	Reply back or send
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:42,687	| IOT149 |	Being mad at me I would have to do that in my messages app
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:43,967	| IOT149 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:44,735	| IOT149 |	So
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:45,503	| IOT149 |	Other music
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:47,551	| IOT149 |	She is not
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,087	| IOT149 |	Getting ads
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:52,159	| IOT149 |	Anytime soon according to a story in the information
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:52,927	| IOT149 |	So
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,951	| IOT149 |	The story ran
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:56,511	| IOT149 |	Earlier this week and basically Sony
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:57,791	| IOT149 |	Apparently was
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,559	| IOT149 |	Complaining to
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:02,655	| IOT149 |	Anime that works really hard on his Jeopardy game and it can't make any money from it
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:03,423	| IOT149 |	In
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:05,471	| IOT149 |	Amazon folks are like well
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:05,983	| IOT149 |	We'll see what we can do
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:09,567	| IOT149 |	And what they're thinking of doing is making basically
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,847	| IOT149 |	Premium type of off
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,615	| IOT149 |	So
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:15,967	| IOT149 |	You can use the Jeopardy skill but maybe you pay extra like a buck 99 a month
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:16,735	| IOT149 |	Extraco
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,039	| IOT149 |	If you're a hardcore Japanese lover
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,575	| IOT149 |	You're running out of questions
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:21,855	| IOT149 |	Get more
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,623	| IOT149 |	Just for tuba
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:26,463	| IOT149 |	Don't know if that's going to work but would you pay for something like that
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:32,607	| IOT149 |	I would I do that I do a lot of in-app purchases for extra features on my phone so I probably would if I really like the skin
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:39,775	| IOT149 |	I don't think I would do it for Jeopardy personally but that's just me but I do like this better than what we thought was going to happen cuz a few weeks back
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,311	| IOT149 |	Backward recording on
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:41,823	| IOT149 |	Pyramid
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:45,151	| IOT149 |	Companies like Procter & Gamble and others were going to
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:46,943	| IOT149 |	Potentially Hadlock sponsored
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:48,479	| IOT149 |	Slots on
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:50,015	| IOT149 |	In search results on a
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:51,039	| IOT149 |	An echo device
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:55,647	| IOT149 |	And it looks like that's not going to happen either now because Amazon's kind of saying look we know
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:59,999	| IOT149 |	The ads are a distracting thing in a conversational user interface so
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,535	| IOT149 |	And we're thinking no ads
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,815	| IOT149 |	And I have to agree with
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,351	| IOT149 |	I do not
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:07,935	| IOT149 |	I did take a picture the other day
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:12,287	| IOT149 |	Because you know how if you cut the Echo Show there's a little thing at the bottoms like ask
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,567	| IOT149 |	Not of age
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:15,359	| IOT149 |	To do this how to say good morning in Japanese
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,895	| IOT149 |	Which was a reason
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,943	| IOT149 |	One that I was like yes how do you say that
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,991	| IOT149 |	So maybe they could run an ad there
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:21,503	| IOT149 |	But that was about it
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:23,551	| IOT149 |	That's not a lot of people have Echo
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,367	| IOT149 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:26,879	| IOT149 |	Next
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,671	| IOT149 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:33,535	| IOT149 |	I'm going to tell you guys right now we're going to do a little update unsolicited update on the Google
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:34,815	| IOT149 |	Assistant experiment
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:37,375	| IOT149 |	It is not going well
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,399	| IOT149 |	But
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:42,239	| IOT149 |	Google only half the time does Google recognize my voice which means
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:44,287	| IOT149 |	Only half the time can I turn on my television
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,311	| IOT149 |	So
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,335	| IOT149 |	Frustrating
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:49,151	| IOT149 |	Cuz that is status through
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,479	| IOT149 |	Next riot
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,015	| IOT149 |	So that's for sure
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:09:01,183	| IOT149 |	Let me ask you this is it just not recognizing the commanders at your voice meaning you've got multi-user
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:01,695	| IOT149 |	Set up
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:05,791	| IOT149 |	I don't actually even have multi-user setup but I do the voice
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,815	| IOT149 |	Taproot like I did
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:07,327	| IOT149 |	I have it recognized my
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:09,119	| IOT149 |	I still want it doesn't it's like
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:10,655	| IOT149 |	I don't know.
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:12,703	| IOT149 |	Right
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,983	| IOT149 |	It's about
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:14,751	| IOT149 |	50/50
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:18,591	| IOT149 |	So what device does that occur is it a home or is it a home Mini
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,359	| IOT149 |	It's a home
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,127	| IOT149 |	It's a home
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,919	| IOT149 |	Straight home
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:22,687	| IOT149 |	And
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,455	| IOT149 |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:25,247	| IOT149 |	Tip not loving it
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,271	| IOT149 |	So far
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:28,831	| IOT149 |	Now I did get some lovely
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,599	| IOT149 |	Lovely
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,879	| IOT149 |	Bubbly recommendations
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:32,671	| IOT149 |	Clairaudience who said Stacy
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:35,231	| IOT149 |	If you don't like Harmony talking to you in the middle and who would
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:36,767	| IOT149 |	Why don't you run it through
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:37,535	| IOT149 |	You know me
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:38,815	| IOT149 |	Or stringify
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:41,119	| IOT149 |	Or any of these other things and so
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:44,191	| IOT149 |	That is a great suggestion I did run it through you know me
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,215	| IOT149 |	And that is helpful
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,775	| IOT149 |	And now I do no longer have to listen
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:48,287	| IOT149 |	Harmony
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:53,407	| IOT149 |	Righty Paisley cut out the middleman Bots
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:59,295	| IOT149 |	But it's less disrupted from a user
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,319	| IOT149 |	Experience because
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:02,623	| IOT149 |	You're not having something else talk to you now
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:03,135	| IOT149 |	It's a better
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,183	| IOT149 |	Right so yes
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,719	| IOT149 |	So that is where that
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:07,999	| IOT149 |	Hole
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,023	| IOT149 |	Experiment stands
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:09,535	| IOT149 |	My family hates
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:13,631	| IOT149 |	And I'm not sure how long it's going to continue
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,703	| IOT149 |	We're still there
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,287	| IOT149 |	That was the unsolicited update
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,055	| IOT149 |	Where is
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,103	| IOT149 |	What we were supposed to be talking about
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:27,455	| IOT149 |	Custom hot or maybe getting custom hot words
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:29,247	| IOT149 |	Dual calling on
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,783	| IOT149 |	Smartscreen switch Kevin Love
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,063	| IOT149 |	How to buy and
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,343	| IOT149 |	I think that's it
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:39,743	| IOT149 |	There's a couple things in here but those are the two main ones as you said an innocent all comes from a teardown
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:42,303	| IOT149 |	Hey Google I'm sorry 95 Google
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,119	| IOT149 |	Went and looked at the latest Google app
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:51,519	| IOT149 |	Paisley model around the code to see what's in there and they can see the strings for creating custom hot words for the Google assist
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,055	| IOT149 |	Stenton and so on
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:55,871	| IOT149 |	You have to train the hotword have to see about that
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:59,967	| IOT149 |	But also in there yes Google Duo for smart displays I do want that
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:04,063	| IOT149 |	Smart display that we saw at CES that was the without Lenovo or LG
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:04,575	| IOT149 |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,135	| IOT149 |	Yes
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:11,487	| IOT149 |	Yes what you can put in portrait or landscape I just really like the design of that
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:16,607	| IOT149 |	I don't think I'd use it for duo and main reason is I don't know anybody using Duo so
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,983	| IOT149 |	Oh absolutely anyone almost always could
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,775	| IOT149 |	IOS Android emulator
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:24,543	| IOT149 |	No no I thought you
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,335	| IOT149 |	What do a without
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:27,871	| IOT149 |	Them having
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,407	| IOT149 |	That could be
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,711	| IOT149 |	I don't see again I don't use because
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,759	| IOT149 |	I don't really know anybody who does
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:35,039	| IOT149 |	But we'll have to try it
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,319	| IOT149 |	See you guys Kevin never
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:37,087	| IOT149 |	Calls me
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:39,391	| IOT149 |	I know but Stacy sends me text messages
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:40,927	| IOT149 |	Compare Echo
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:41,439	| IOT149 |	Exactly
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:49,375	| IOT149 |	And you will have to see if these all come to pass it's very common for Google and any company really to put things in there
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:51,423	| IOT149 |	Software for potential future features
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:53,727	| IOT149 |	But we'll have to see if he's going to pass out
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:57,055	| IOT149 |	It keeps them up with Amazon I mean right now
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,335	| IOT149 |	Jack.
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:03,199	| IOT149 |	The Amazon calling between Echo switch I've never use cuz I don't know anybody else with the show
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:03,711	| IOT149 |	So
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:05,503	| IOT149 |	Right
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:06,783	| IOT149 |	In other news
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,295	| IOT149 |	We've got
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,319	| IOT149 |	Details
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:11,647	| IOT149 |	On how many echos at home devices are out there
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,415	| IOT149 |	And
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,183	| IOT149 |	So far
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:18,047	| IOT149 |	Unsurprisingly Amazon is ahead with 69% of the market share according to
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:22,399	| IOT149 |	Yes they consumer intelligence research partners
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:28,799	| IOT149 |	They put out a new report based on survey data and see us only and basically it's like set
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:31,103	| IOT149 |	Seven out of every ten smart
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:34,431	| IOT149 |	Speakers made by either Amazon or Google is sold by Amazon
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:40,575	| IOT149 |	I kind of question this a little bit only because the numbers they have from the survey they're saying that us installed base
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,367	| IOT149 |	They estimate about
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:43,903	| IOT149 |	31 million
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:47,999	| IOT149 |	Amazon Echo devices vs 14 million Google home devices
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:54,399	| IOT149 |	I get us only it just seems really low to me on the Amazon side just because they've been around much longer and
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:58,495	| IOT149 |	And I realized it took a while for people to understand what an echo is and there was
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:01,823	| IOT149 |	It took time for Amazon to come out with the dot on the top
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,871	| IOT149 |	31 million just seems
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:05,151	| IOT149 |	Loaded me if
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:08,991	| IOT149 |	Assuming the Google home figure is correct at 14 million I just I don't know
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:10,015	| IOT149 |	I just seems like to me
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:13,599	| IOT149 |	I don't know if this is super low or not
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,623	| IOT149 |	I don't have a sense
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,647	| IOT149 |	But we did
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,415	| IOT149 |	See
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,695	| IOT149 |	Earlier this month
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:21,791	| IOT149 |	And survey from NPR that said that there were about 39 million
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:22,815	| IOT149 |	People
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,351	| IOT149 |	In the US
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,375	| IOT149 |	16% of America
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,935	| IOT149 |	So it's about 39 million
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,215	| IOT149 |	So that kind of
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:30,239	| IOT149 |	Funeral
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,079	| IOT149 |	Well
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:37,151	| IOT149 |	Clean out my thought process is how many people just buy one
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:38,431	| IOT149 |	Well that is true
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:39,711	| IOT149 |	So
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:42,015	| IOT149 |	Yes 6
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:42,527	| IOT149 |	Canzona smart
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:46,111	| IOT149 |	There are going to be able to just have one
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:49,951	| IOT149 |	Homeworld one Echo and I get that you want to get started
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:52,767	| IOT149 |	But with the low prices of the dots in the minis
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:59,423	| IOT149 |	And the fact that you might use them in different rooms your house I'm in kind of people are going to put one in every room like we might do
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:01,983	| IOT149 |	I think there's more people that have
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:02,751	| IOT149 |	Multiple
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,543	| IOT149 |	Smart speakers as opposed to
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,823	| IOT149 |	People that have just one
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:08,639	| IOT149 |	Which Casey's numbers would be low
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:12,735	| IOT149 |	The thing is we have to guess at it because these companies don't share these numbers really
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:16,319	| IOT149 |	Frustrating quite honestly from my perspective but logically it seems love
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:19,903	| IOT149 |	And it doesn't even count
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:23,487	| IOT149 |	For what I think is really interesting is putting you know
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:26,047	| IOT149 |	Assistant or Echo into other devices
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:28,095	| IOT149 |	Assistant
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:30,911	| IOT149 |	Is just getting started here but Echo you know you
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:31,935	| IOT149 |	Buy thermostats
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:32,703	| IOT149 |	Bipolar
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:36,031	| IOT149 |	Actually maybe you can buy light bulbs you can buy light switches
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:40,895	| IOT149 |	The fire TVs with the remote
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:41,663	| IOT149 |	They all have
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:44,479	| IOT149 |	Voice
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:48,831	| IOT149 |	Yeah there you go by the keeper make such a great refrigerator
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:50,111	| IOT149 |	Put that next to your cute cat
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,135	| IOT149 |	There we go
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,927	| IOT149 |	Okay so
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:55,743	| IOT149 |	We're still not sure but there's some more information
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:59,071	| IOT149 |	Simorgh estimates on echo.and home devices out in Market
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:00,351	| IOT149 |	And that means there's
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,631	| IOT149 |	Plenty of room to grow
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,655	| IOT149 |	If people want that
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,703	| IOT149 |	So now
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:06,751	| IOT149 |	Move to subdue as pets
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:07,263	| IOT149 |	Starting with
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:08,287	| IOT149 |	Sad news
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:15,455	| IOT149 |	This kind of follows along something we talked about you the last show of the show before because we were mentioning that
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:17,759	| IOT149 |	I can tile had some layoffs recently
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:21,087	| IOT149 |	And this week we heard that tracker
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:24,415	| IOT149 |	Which makes a similar product Bluetooth tracking device has laid off
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:28,511	| IOT149 |	Approximately 42 employees that's according to sources talking to
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,023	| IOT149 |	TechCrunch
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:32,607	| IOT149 |	Yeah they just raised about 15 million dollars in August
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:34,911	| IOT149 |	Tracker did and I know they're trying to get there
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:37,215	| IOT149 |	They're trying to expand their product into
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:39,519	| IOT149 |	A service that will work when you know and
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,543	| IOT149 |	Other small
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:42,847	| IOT149 |	Things like key holders are pens and whatnot but
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:46,431	| IOT149 |	That's what I said last week you know you have to have a broader
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:48,479	| IOT149 |	Product-based adjusting Bluetooth tracker
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:52,831	| IOT149 |	I think I'm not saying that's the cause of this but that's my gut for the long-term
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,599	| IOT149 |	And yes
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:55,647	| IOT149 |	You're probably right
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,671	| IOT149 |	It's going to come down to just
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:59,231	| IOT149 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:15:59,743	| IOT149 |	Davos
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:03,839	| IOT149 |	Otherwise known as the world economic Forum you guys probably
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:05,631	| IOT149 |	Are very familiar with it or at least have
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,655	| IOT149 |	Clocked it
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,423	| IOT149 |	On Twitter
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,447	| IOT149 |	Dallas
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:11,775	| IOT149 |	Big Focus there was the Industrial internet-of-things
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:13,055	| IOT149 |	With the world economic
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:14,847	| IOT149 |	Squirrel adding more centers
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:15,871	| IOT149 |	4
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:19,967	| IOT149 |	The fourth Industrial Revolution or industry 4.0
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:22,015	| IOT149 |	All those are fancy ways of saying
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:22,783	| IOT149 |	Industrial iot
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,063	| IOT149 |	Yes
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:27,903	| IOT149 |	So what they are doing is they had more than 400 sessions
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:30,975	| IOT149 |	And they're really freaking out everyone's freaking out about
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:31,999	| IOT149 |	Sensors everywhere
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:33,791	| IOT149 |	What is going
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:34,815	| IOT149 |	4
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,095	| IOT149 |	Best case
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:42,495	| IOT149 |	I'm less worried about that I think we've got a long way to go before we actually start implementing this stuff at any sort of scary level it's
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:46,591	| IOT149 |	Still very difficult to do that open to Center in Sanford
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:47,871	| IOT149 |	Francisco for
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,639	| IOT149 |	The fourth Industrial Revolution
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,175	| IOT149 |	And now
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:52,223	| IOT149 |	They're opening new centers in India
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:52,991	| IOT149 |	Japan
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,015	| IOT149 |	And the UAE
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,039	| IOT149 |	And the Earth
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:59,903	| IOT149 |	Also are announcing a fellowship for postdocs to work in any of these centers
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:03,487	| IOT149 |	Trying to figure out issues associated with the industrial
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,255	| IOT149 |	Iot
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:06,047	| IOT149 |	And it is created three councils
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:09,375	| IOT149 |	One is called the global artificial intelligence Council
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:13,727	| IOT149 |	The other is global iot
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:15,519	| IOT149 |	The internet
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,847	| IOT149 |	It kind of feels like
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,383	| IOT149 |	All the hot buzzwords
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:26,015	| IOT149 |	The goal is to identify ways to regulate these
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,551	| IOT149 |	Share learnings about
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:30,879	| IOT149 |	Different groups around the world it's the basic
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:31,903	| IOT149 |	World economic
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,975	| IOT149 |	Together we shall probably think
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:37,023	| IOT149 |	He's out because
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:37,535	| IOT149 |	The world
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,583	| IOT149 |	Have a wall built around Chino
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:40,351	| IOT149 |	Where is Countryside
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:41,631	| IOT149 |	Work radiator cap
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,191	| IOT149 |	I thought that was interesting
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:51,871	| IOT149 |	Curious what comes out of it I would like to see what comes out of especially like the postdoc Research into all this
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:53,407	| IOT149 |	Maybe nothing will but you know
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:56,735	| IOT149 |	Smart people are finally thinking about all of this and
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:59,295	| IOT149 |	Government officials are finally thinking about it and
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:01,599	| IOT149 |	Talking about it whether they'll take action
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,367	| IOT149 |	I don't know
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:04,671	| IOT149 |	In other industrial news
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:06,719	| IOT149 |	PTC and Microsoft have
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,743	| IOT149 |	Teamed up
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:10,559	| IOT149 |	At first I was like is this really a thing
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:12,863	| IOT149 |	Actually it is because PTC thingworx
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:15,935	| IOT149 |	Which is a platform for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:17,471	| IOT149 |	So you can basically
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:18,751	| IOT149 |	Implement all kinds of
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:20,287	| IOT149 |	Sensors
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,823	| IOT149 |	Automations on top of it
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:22,847	| IOT149 |	It now will run
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,383	| IOT149 |	On
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:26,687	| IOT149 |	Usher so we offered as a managed service on top
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:30,271	| IOT149 |	This is important because many
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,807	| IOT149 |	Industrial client
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:34,367	| IOT149 |	Anson figure named clients are little leery
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,159	| IOT149 |	About using AWS
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:37,951	| IOT149 |	So azure
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:40,255	| IOT149 |	Is familiar to their it Department
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,023	| IOT149 |	Love it
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:43,071	| IOT149 |	And I'm sure actually has some really strong
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,631	| IOT149 |	Strong iot offerings
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:47,423	| IOT149 |	Both of the SAS and the pass level
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:51,775	| IOT149 |	I remember few shows back when we were talking about where's Google
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:58,175	| IOT149 |	Iot platform we compared it a little bit to Microsoft which has a lot of great tools and ways to implement and manage device
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:00,991	| IOT149 |	Isis in a couple weeks I'll actually be able to tell you something
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:06,879	| IOT149 |	Etsy yes a company that is building out a massive iot Solution on Google Cloud
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,439	| IOT149 |	I know so
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,975	| IOT149 |	Apparently it's there and exist
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:15,327	| IOT149 |	And this person actually told me that one of the reasons why they did it is because
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:16,607	| IOT149 |	Google's really
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:18,399	| IOT149 |	Pushing hard in this area once
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:20,447	| IOT149 |	Good clients so they're really working
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,263	| IOT149 |	Yay
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,799	| IOT149 |	To learn more about that but not for a
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:29,663	| IOT149 |	And let's see what other news item
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:30,943	| IOT149 |	Pulling out here
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:31,967	| IOT149 |	This is
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:34,015	| IOT149 |	Missed it is a company that makes
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:34,783	| IOT149 |	Wireless
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:35,807	| IOT149 |	Access point
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:37,599	| IOT149 |	Spit off of Wi-Fi
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:41,695	| IOT149 |	But they also let you do things like establish virtual Bluetooth beacons
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,999	| IOT149 |	And a bunch of other services on
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,279	| IOT149 |	So
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,815	| IOT149 |	It's a very powerful
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,863	| IOT149 |	You know probably a decade ago
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:51,935	| IOT149 |	Can I go I was really excited when
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:53,471	| IOT149 |	Rocky King
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:56,287	| IOT149 |	It was a whole new way of thinking about Enterprise WiFi
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:59,359	| IOT149 |	Well I feel like missed is kind of like the Moroccan
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:01,151	| IOT149 |	Of what Wi-Fi needs to be
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,455	| IOT149 |	Within the internet of Things
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:05,503	| IOT149 |	So excited to see that they have been out
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:09,599	| IOT149 |	Cathay pacific
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:12,415	| IOT149 |	I'm not so it's like Mavis Beacon
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,183	| IOT149 |	And
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:14,975	| IOT149 |	Jarvis had a baby
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:15,487	| IOT149 |	And
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:18,303	| IOT149 |	But you can
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:23,167	| IOT149 |	Network questions it questions like how many smartphones are on this
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:23,935	| IOT149 |	Explorer
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:25,727	| IOT149 |	How many computers on this floor
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:26,751	| IOT149 |	Linux
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:31,359	| IOT149 |	All of these questions why is Bob smartphone behaving so poorly
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:33,151	| IOT149 |	And apparently Marta switch
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:33,663	| IOT149 |	Be able to
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,223	| IOT149 |	So
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:37,503	| IOT149 |	Free cool
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,551	| IOT149 |	That would be good so I could use that help
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:42,879	| IOT149 |	I'm not going to get into my fiber troubleshooting issue right now but I could use that help
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:45,183	| IOT149 |	Yes Kevin squeezing a battle
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:46,463	| IOT149 |	New gigabit
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:51,583	| IOT149 |	Well it's labeled gigabit but it is so not too bad
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:54,143	| IOT149 |	We won't go there right now
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,423	| IOT149 |	It's not going to spend a lot of time
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:00,287	| IOT149 |	I've spent a lot of time on that
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,567	| IOT149 |	That's true
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:03,615	| IOT149 |	Okay

EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:45,088	| IOT149 |	Hi my name is Doris cast
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:47,648	| IOT149 |	I love the show and I just wanted to ask
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:48,928	| IOT149 |	How do you know if your
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,720	| IOT149 |	Google home
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:52,000	| IOT149 |	Or it could be like
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:54,048	| IOT149 |	If it has been hacked
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,328	| IOT149 |	And
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:56,864	| IOT149 |	If so how do you
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:22:00,192	| IOT149 |	Get rid of all removed the person being are your
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:00,960	| IOT149 |	Device being hacked
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:03,520	| IOT149 |	Bright lights and my name is Isaac in
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:04,032	| IOT149 |	Have a great day
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:08,128	| IOT149 |	So that's a good question from Isaac wondering you know how would you know if
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:10,944	| IOT149 |	Your smart speaker was hacked and what can you do about it
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:16,064	| IOT149 |	I'm not so sure you really ever know that's the one tricky bit here
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:20,416	| IOT149 |	I mean if you wanted to try and like Trace network data and all that it might be able to
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:21,440	| IOT149 |	Find out what
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,464	| IOT149 |	I would say this
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:25,792	| IOT149 |	If you feel that your home or Echo device has been hacked
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:30,400	| IOT149 |	Concerned the thing that I would probably do I would factory reset it because any kind of hacks
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:37,312	| IOT149 |	Are likely things that have altered software somehow or maybe they are capturing Network output from your
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:43,456	| IOT149 |	Device so I would probably just do a factory reset on my speaker just to make sure
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:46,528	| IOT149 |	But again it's so hard to determine if it's truly been hacked
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:54,464	| IOT149 |	Winnacunnet but you know It's Tricky that some of these hacks we don't find out about until somebody who has
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,000	| IOT149 |	Ashley created a hack
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:23:00,096	| IOT149 |	And then told the company manufacture the products hey you got a flaw here
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:01,376	| IOT149 |	And then it's
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,144	| IOT149 |	Hopefully fix
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,680	| IOT149 |	And then publicly announce so
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:07,008	| IOT149 |	That's why I say it's very tricky to find out if one of these things has
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:07,520	| IOT149 |	In hat
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:13,152	| IOT149 |	Chances are though if if that device has been hacked has probably come to your network and you probably have a bigger issue I would say
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:16,224	| IOT149 |	Yes in now that a larger question
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:18,272	| IOT149 |	Which isn't actually your question but I'll tell you about it anyway
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,576	| IOT149 |	You can actually
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,344	| IOT149 |	Is there a
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:24,928	| IOT149 |	Devices you can attach to your network that will monitor your traffic
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:26,208	| IOT149 |	And see if it's behaving up
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:29,792	| IOT149 |	Anime stop stalking to
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,584	| IOT149 |	Amazon and start stalking
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,864	| IOT149 |	Something in Shenzhen
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:33,632	| IOT149 |	Maybe
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:34,400	| IOT149 |	There's an issue
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:35,680	| IOT149 |	And it will flag.
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:40,032	| IOT149 |	So you could even go higher level you could just see if when your device
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:43,360	| IOT149 |	It when you're not using it if a lot of network data is being
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:45,664	| IOT149 |	Sent to work from that device
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,688	| IOT149 |	Yes that is true
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:49,248	| IOT149 |	So those are
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:52,320	| IOT149 |	Those devices Cujo is one think bitdefender has one
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:54,624	| IOT149 |	There's a bunch of router type
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:55,648	| IOT149 |	Products that
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:58,464	| IOT149 |	Attached to your router or there's actually routers that have
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:23:59,232	| IOT149 |	This feature built
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:00,768	| IOT149 |	2 Euro has acid
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:02,304	| IOT149 |	Security offering that you can
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:02,816	| IOT149 |	Pay for
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,608	| IOT149 |	Or if they're going to announce
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:06,144	| IOT149 |	What actually does Google have
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:06,656	| IOT149 |	Something like that
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:10,752	| IOT149 |	I don't believe so
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:17,152	| IOT149 |	Pretty basic I mean may have things going on in the background like just this morning I found out has a built-in firewall which obviously it should
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:20,736	| IOT149 |	But you don't have access to it and you wouldn't know it by looking at the apps
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:23,296	| IOT149 |	In a lot of back and stuff in there
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:29,440	| IOT149 |	So I don't know that anything I don't want to say they don't because I don't know but I haven't seen anything that indicates I do
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,488	| IOT149 |	Okay so
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:32,512	| IOT149 |	That
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:39,424	| IOT149 |	That's all the help we can provide here I also will say that some of these and this is something I've been looking at more in the Enterprise space
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:40,704	| IOT149 |	But I think it's coming to the
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,728	| IOT149 |	Consumer space
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:44,800	| IOT149 |	Actually Comcast showed off something like this at CES
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,336	| IOT149 |	Coming out later this year
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:51,712	| IOT149 |	Is it not only will it warn you it will actually automatically quarantine the device or take it off the network
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:54,528	| IOT149 |	So I thought that was actually pretty cool
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:55,552	| IOT149 |	Cuz then what you'll get it
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:56,832	| IOT149 |	This is notification
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:57,600	| IOT149 |	It says
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:58,880	| IOT149 |	This guy
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:01,952	| IOT149 |	Not only was weird it was weird in a way that was
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,464	| IOT149 |	Approve with
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:04,512	| IOT149 |	Malicious and so we just
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,024	| IOT149 |	Pop-up blocker
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:06,304	| IOT149 |	And I think
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,608	| IOT149 |	That's interesting if something's weird they might
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,656	| IOT149 |	Hey your kids laptop
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,192	| IOT149 |	Is behaving kind of funny
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:12,704	| IOT149 |	You may want to
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:18,592	| IOT149 |	So thanks Isaac for calling in and as a reminder that number is 512
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:19,616	| IOT149 |	6 to 3
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:21,408	| IOT149 |	Temperature to 4
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:23,200	| IOT149 |	As I had a momentary brainlab
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:23,968	| IOT149 |	Boxer

EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:40,096	| IOT149 |	Why gdpr is good even for those of us in the US
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:46,496	| IOT149 |	Taking a break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is point Central
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:49,312	| IOT149 |	And I have Sean Miller president of pointcentral here to talk to her
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:50,592	| IOT149 |	So quick
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:52,640	| IOT149 |	Let's remind our audience what it is
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:53,152	| IOT149 |	The point Central
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:26:00,064	| IOT149 |	So pointcentral is a subsidiary of alarm.com enterprise-grade home automation Solutions
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:01,344	| IOT149 |	As a business tool
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:07,232	| IOT149 |	The short-term and long-term managers of single-family and multi-family properties
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:08,768	| IOT149 |	From the writers point of view
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:10,560	| IOT149 |	What does life in a smart apartment
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,352	| IOT149 |	As we've seen her last
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:16,960	| IOT149 |	Computers and home automation has grown in adoption amongst mostly homeowners
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:19,008	| IOT149 |	Renters have been left a little bit the Dust
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,288	| IOT149 |	Austin place over there
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:24,896	| IOT149 |	Reasons for get left in the dust are common with people who are buying home automation for the home such as
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:25,664	| IOT149 |	Just Coster
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:28,480	| IOT149 |	Install and setup fears develop a problem with
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:29,504	| IOT149 |	How to deal with the landlord
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:33,600	| IOT149 |	Cuz the landlord wanted to install these things what happens after they move out
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:40,000	| IOT149 |	What we've done is make sure that our solution again is not only a tool for the property manager but it's also really an acid in half
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:40,768	| IOT149 |	That's been for that recipe
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:43,840	| IOT149 |	For the resin perspective that really starts when they first
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:49,472	| IOT149 |	CA unit that's on occupied that they're thinking about renting will that be a single-family home or an apartment
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:51,520	| IOT149 |	Building and it really gives him a wow factor
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:57,152	| IOT149 |	If you look at the demographics of a lot of ranchers today Millennials tend to dominate it and Millennials also tend to be some of the biggest
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:27:00,224	| IOT149 |	Enthusiast of home automation tax when they walk into a
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:01,760	| IOT149 |	A unit and see that
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:04,064	| IOT149 |	The thermostat there locks their lights
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:05,856	| IOT149 |	All controllable from an app
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:11,232	| IOT149 |	And from one app that tends to get them excited and then there's opportunities to add a little more wild to it
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:13,024	| IOT149 |	We've had certain partners that will say
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:19,424	| IOT149 |	Add a voice control unit in there so when someone's touring the home they could just see how quick and easy it is for them to use their voice
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,704	| IOT149 |	And control things around their house
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:22,240	| IOT149 |	And once I am in
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:24,032	| IOT149 |	Impressed then I go live there
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:24,544	| IOT149 |	What are the advantages
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:28,896	| IOT149 |	The first benefit residency when they move in is Energy savings
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:31,200	| IOT149 |	Other Heating and Cooling bills from having a Kinect
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:36,576	| IOT149 |	Thermostat what we see is residents typically see a savings of about 10 to 50% off their monthly bills
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,112	| IOT149 |	The next benefit residence
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:39,648	| IOT149 |	She is wearing a sanax
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:42,464	| IOT149 |	And while this may be a little for it first
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:45,024	| IOT149 |	What wasn't really start to love and enjoy his
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:46,048	| IOT149 |	Now that get
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:51,424	| IOT149 |	Download control who has access to the home from the palm of their hand or from a website but also no
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:54,752	| IOT149 |	Just at home when and where the weather be a child
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:56,032	| IOT149 |	A pet Walker
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:58,592	| IOT149 |	Or friend visiting and Couchsurfing for the week
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:01,408	| IOT149 |	You can control and know who came in and when
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:06,272	| IOT149 |	All from right there within the app as I mentioned in the app how to see one big benefit is

EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:51,808	| IOT149 |	A lot of communication coming out to companies
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:57,440	| IOT149 |	Come out of the very nature protection authority for example
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:40:01,024	| IOT149 |	Forget that the sensible information The Regulators
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:06,656	| IOT149 |	Lights

EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:19,200	| IOT149 |	Is it supposed to look good for accountability first and also I need the guide
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:22,528	| IOT149 |	Great to meet you guys and daughter then
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:26,112	| IOT149 |	Vacations
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:33,792	| IOT149 |	One thing that I am looking forward to is actually journalist across the EU looking
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:37,120	| IOT149 |	And requesting their data so what day do you have on me
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:43,008	| IOT149 |	And once people start to see that I'm very curious like we just had this Strava
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:44,544	| IOT149 |	I'm sure you saw the guard
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:49,408	| IOT149 |	Basically showing anyone
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:51,968	| IOT149 |	Where military US military bases
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:53,248	| IOT149 |	Based on
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:56,064	| IOT149 |	Those people's exercise soldiers exercise habits
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:57,856	| IOT149 |	So I looked at that and I was like
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:58,880	| IOT149 |	Actually maybe not
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:01,184	| IOT149 |	What's Travis for you
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:04,000	| IOT149 |	Use it to show people your runs in your routes
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:10,144	| IOT149 |	But you don't mean that context becomes problematic so I'm like oh does the military set rules against that
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:20,384	| IOT149 |	Two-sided nature of the Beast rating Pittacus
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:23,968	| IOT149 |	OMG that's a sharing platform of consent involved
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:33,440	| IOT149 |	The world of data Schlitterbahn intended consequences and so frankly is the date of the world of this regulation
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:34,976	| IOT149 |	2
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:36,000	| IOT149 |	We try to do our best
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:37,280	| IOT149 |	I'm sure
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:39,328	| IOT149 |	People who signed up to
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:40,352	| IOT149 |	The service

EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:44,704	| IOT149 |	What they probably didn't know that
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:51,360	| IOT149 |	Get cross reference without a date
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:52,128	| IOT149 |	Nobody quotes

EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:00,063	| IOT149 |	Can identify
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:01,343	| IOT149 |	You know you're Italian
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:05,695	| IOT149 |	What date does
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:06,719	| IOT149 |	When it sheds
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:15,423	| IOT149 |	Because of manufacturing is because the biggest change now is that by default

EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:23,359	| IOT149 |	Is that you really have to
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:25,151	| IOT149 |	Side
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:26,431	| IOT149 |	How much
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,199	| IOT149 |	Trisha
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:27,967	| IOT149 |	What it means to
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:31,807	| IOT149 |	Deformed granular
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:36,159	| IOT149 |	You never find yourself in a situation where you're over sharing
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:37,695	| IOT149 |	Don't understand
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:42,815	| IOT149 |	Should be set to do not share
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:43,839	| IOT149 |	Presumably
EDL	00:42:43,839	00:42:45,631	| IOT149 |	Military personnel should have been trained
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:46,143	| IOT149 |	Say okay
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:52,287	| IOT149 |	I do not open to the sharing.
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:54,335	| IOT149 |	Kind of information
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:55,871	| IOT149 |	Results from a combined
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:02,271	| IOT149 |	Right and I would say maybe Strava in combining
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:07,135	| IOT149 |	Fitness data from everybody with geolocation to create these beautiful Maps
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:09,695	| IOT149 |	Maybe they put that out as a marketing
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:10,975	| IOT149 |	Effort
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:14,815	| IOT149 |	Primarily encouragement for their user base but also a marketing effort look at
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:16,863	| IOT149 |	What people in Strawberry doing you could be them two
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:20,191	| IOT149 |	So from that standpoint Maybe
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:21,983	| IOT149 |	Be a part of the fault lies in
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:25,823	| IOT149 |	Did you really need to use that to Market you could have just kept all that there and lived
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:26,591	| IOT149 |	People share within the
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:27,871	| IOT149 |	Community
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:29,919	| IOT149 |	That just makes it a little little
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:30,943	| IOT149 |	More difficult
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:31,711	| IOT149 |	To start
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:32,479	| IOT149 |	Creating a struct

EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:39,391	| IOT149 |	What did you mean by that
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:41,695	| IOT149 |	Okay

EDL	00:45:57,119	00:45:59,679	| IOT149 |	Let's talk about the implications for innovation
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:02,495	| IOT149 |	And we touched on this a little bit a lot of
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:06,335	| IOT149 |	Google's efforts when it comes to computer vision in Facebook's efforts there
EDL	00:46:06,335	00:46:08,895	| IOT149 |	Have been because they've been using

EDL	00:46:33,983	00:46:37,055	| IOT149 |	Always like this is what human does Heather likely to behave
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:40,127	| IOT149 |	This becomes really important for like autonomous cars
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:42,687	| IOT149 |	So how do we balance these thing
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:44,735	| IOT149 |	When does the gdpr do a good job
