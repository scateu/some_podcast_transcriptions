EDL	00:00:10,496	00:00:11,264	| IOT075 |	Podcast
EDL	00:00:11,264	00:00:13,568	| IOT075 |	This is your house Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:14,848	00:00:15,360	| IOT075 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:15,872	00:00:19,968	| IOT075 |	On this week's show we're going to be talking about Verizon's new network for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:00:19,968	00:00:22,784	| IOT075 |	We're going to give you an update on last week's Nest story
EDL	00:00:23,296	00:00:25,856	| IOT075 |	And we're also going to talk about some new devices from the
EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:31,744	| IOT075 |	Capri plus we're going to do a review of the wink relay that Kevin has in
EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:36,096	| IOT075 |	Stalled in the middle of all this we're going to have a message from our sponsor macadamia
EDL	00:00:36,096	00:00:38,144	| IOT075 |	And after that we're talking to our guests this week
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:40,704	| IOT075 |	Corey Reed of John Deere about Precision agriculture
EDL	00:00:41,728	00:00:42,752	| IOT075 |	It's going to be a great show
EDL	00:00:43,520	00:00:45,568	| IOT075 |	Alright let's kick it off with
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:47,104	| IOT075 |	A new iot network
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:48,896	| IOT075 |	Verizon has
EDL	00:00:48,896	00:00:49,664	| IOT075 |	Teamed up with
EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:50,176	| IOT075 |	Welcome
EDL	00:00:50,944	00:00:52,736	| IOT075 |	And last week launched
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:54,272	| IOT075 |	Okay here we go Cabin
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:55,808	| IOT075 |	LGE
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:00:57,344	| IOT075 |	Cat M1
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:00:58,112	| IOT075 |	Network
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:01:04,512	| IOT075 |	Cat M1 number and we got
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:05,536	| IOT075 |	So actually
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:06,560	| IOT075 |	It's not that red
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:08,096	| IOT075 |	I figured it wasn't
EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:10,656	| IOT075 |	I was just going to
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:14,240	| IOT075 |	With the Telco standards
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:16,288	| IOT075 |	It's that the GSM organization has its
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:19,616	| IOT075 |	CPT 3 piece
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:20,640	| IOT075 |	3gpp
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:22,944	| IOT075 |	1 G 3 and 3 piece
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:23,712	| IOT075 |	Got it
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:26,016	| IOT075 |	They actually for all their LT
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:26,784	| IOT075 |	Twohey's
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:27,552	| IOT075 |	And other version
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:30,368	| IOT075 |	Stop they have categories
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:31,648	| IOT075 |	So
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:32,160	| IOT075 |	Cat and
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:34,208	| IOT075 |	1 stands for
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:34,976	| IOT075 |	It's the it's the
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:36,000	| IOT075 |	Machine category
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:41,376	| IOT075 |	Unlike those Telco
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:43,424	| IOT075 |	Stages
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:44,448	| IOT075 |	You're so clever
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:46,752	| IOT075 |	Alright so you guys don't have to
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:49,312	| IOT075 |	I care about this what you do need to care about is
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:51,104	| IOT075 |	This is a cellular modem
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:52,128	| IOT075 |	That has
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:52,640	| IOT075 |	10 years
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:53,920	| IOT075 |	Battery life
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:57,760	| IOT075 |	And deliver speeds of
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:02:00,576	| IOT075 |	Between 200 kilobits per second and 400
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,368	| IOT075 |	So
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:04,160	| IOT075 |	Not crazy.
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:05,696	| IOT075 |	You actually do something
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:09,280	| IOT075 |	Especially if you're just sending random bits of data like
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:10,304	| IOT075 |	Temperature in time
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:15,168	| IOT075 |	Probably perfect for a M2M type
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:15,680	| IOT075 |	Transmission
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,472	| IOT075 |	Yes and
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,264	| IOT075 |	Am I thinking
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:22,848	| IOT075 |	Is that this is going to be kind of bad news first
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:23,616	| IOT075 |	Samantha Laura
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,920	| IOT075 |	Boats the Sig foxes of the world
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:27,968	| IOT075 |	Ingenue although
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:30,784	| IOT075 |	And I'm
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,320	| IOT075 |	These are all the folks
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,856	| IOT075 |	We're trying to create their own iot network
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,904	| IOT075 |	Yes there are actually have greater
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:36,928	| IOT075 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:37,952	| IOT075 |	And so
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,256	| IOT075 |	AT&T is testing
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,024	| IOT075 |	Cat
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,048	| IOT075 |	And1 net worth
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:42,560	| IOT075 |	In San Francisco
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:45,120	| IOT075 |	Verizon says there's is going to be out by the
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:46,912	| IOT075 |	Beginning of next year
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:48,192	| IOT075 |	Which is
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:49,472	| IOT075 |	Crazy fast
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,008	| IOT075 |	Basically putting this on their existing
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:52,544	| IOT075 |	Is justice
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,848	| IOT075 |	And I think
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,640	| IOT075 |	We'll see a lot of
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,408	| IOT075 |	Companies that
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,688	| IOT075 |	Leica Fleet Management
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,968	| IOT075 |	Those kind of Apple
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,480	| IOT075 |	Applications
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:01,760	| IOT075 |	Choose
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:04,064	| IOT075 |	A carrier because they're trusted
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:06,624	| IOT075 |	They know what they're doing presumably
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,928	| IOT075 |	Over some of these upstart net
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,464	| IOT075 |	I do think
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:13,536	| IOT075 |	That Laura and maybe sick Fox
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,072	| IOT075 |	Still have an opportunity
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:17,120	| IOT075 |	If you're like
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:19,936	| IOT075 |	Trying to build a service on your own like so if you're like
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:21,984	| IOT075 |	I'm trying to pick up
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:24,544	| IOT075 |	The big mining company whose Name Escapes Me
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:26,592	| IOT075 |	Rio Tinto
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:33,504	| IOT075 |	If you are Rio Tinto if you want to build a low-power wireless area network it may make sense for you just to build your own cuz you've got
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:35,808	| IOT075 |	So much you want to monitor in a limited area
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,088	| IOT075 |	But
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:38,112	| IOT075 |	Brother people
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:38,880	| IOT075 |	I'm thinking they're probably going to
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,720	| IOT075 |	I suspect you are correct
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:45,024	| IOT075 |	So the early first-mover type
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:48,608	| IOT075 |	Networks I mean I applaud what they've done but I I kind of
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,888	| IOT075 |	The same as you on this one
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:55,520	| IOT075 |	It's interesting to me that Verizon is also integrating its thing space
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:58,336	| IOT075 |	Platform-as-a-service within the modem
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:03:59,104	| IOT075 |	So they are
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,384	| IOT075 |	Cut a deal here with Qualcomm
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:03,456	| IOT075 |	Just before the show you and I were talking like this is that
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,992	| IOT075 |	Does that mean this modem looks
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:08,576	| IOT075 |	Exclusively use thingspace platform I don't think so
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,112	| IOT075 |	I think it's just a
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,136	| IOT075 |	Option in there
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,440	| IOT075 |	I think you're probably right it makes sense
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:15,488	| IOT075 |	This is great though because
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,280	| IOT075 |	For people who
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,815	| IOT075 |	Are not going to
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:24,191	| IOT075 |	Like you don't want to spend the time at building their own platform I just want to put a chip in it and have a cigarette sending data
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,983	| IOT075 |	This makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,007	| IOT075 |	That's great for Verizon
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,847	| IOT075 |	And it's good for actually think space
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,127	| IOT075 |	And
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:36,223	| IOT075 |	One of my my favorite little company's bug Labs is actually one of the
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:37,503	| IOT075 |	Core pieces of inertia
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,015	| IOT075 |	Traction things
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:39,295	| IOT075 |	Farm sale
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:40,831	| IOT075 |	Shout out to them
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:41,855	| IOT075 |	Good Vibes
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,623	| IOT075 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:44,927	| IOT075 |	Set Verizon actually already has a
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:47,231	| IOT075 |	Customer for their new cat one
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:48,511	| IOT075 |	Cat M1
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,535	| IOT075 |	Iot solution
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:51,583	| IOT075 |	Because they also announced that
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,375	| IOT075 |	I said what's going on right now the
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:55,679	| IOT075 |	Ctia super Mobility
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:57,471	| IOT075 |	Super Mobility 2016
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:57,983	| IOT075 |	16 show
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:01,567	| IOT075 |	Verizon announced that it is working with a water metering
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,079	| IOT075 |	Company
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:04,127	| IOT075 |	Neptune Technology Group
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:07,967	| IOT075 |	And actually there are two other modems also Qualcomm modem
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,991	| IOT075 |	LTE modems
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,271	| IOT075 |	B
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,039	| IOT075 |	First one is
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:13,343	| IOT075 |	Pacifically for electrical
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,111	| IOT075 |	Utilities
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,903	| IOT075 |	Also has a 10-year battery life
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,695	| IOT075 |	And connectivity
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:19,487	| IOT075 |	10 megabits per second which really
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:22,815	| IOT075 |	It seems like Overkill to me but it is what it is
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:25,887	| IOT075 |	And then for water and gas companies will you get a
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:30,495	| IOT075 |	I guess someone call it a dumb down modem but you get one that goes up to 1 megabits per second
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:35,615	| IOT075 |	More than plenty both of these are I think Carly 2017 as well
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:36,895	| IOT075 |	Yes
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:37,919	| IOT075 |	And
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:44,831	| IOT075 |	The 10 megabits could be interesting for sending video I know that AT&T is also doing some work with Qualcomm
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:47,647	| IOT075 |	On their drone platform to send video from neutrons
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:48,671	| IOT075 |	Excel
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,719	| IOT075 |	Going to be really interesting now that the
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:51,487	| IOT075 |	Carrier
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,255	| IOT075 |	Like oh
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,279	| IOT075 |	We've really got to do this
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,071	| IOT075 |	So let's make it happen
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:57,375	| IOT075 |	Moving on to net
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,679	| IOT075 |	Last week we told you that nests
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,983	| IOT075 |	Are software Developers
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:04,031	| IOT075 |	We're going over to Google
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:07,359	| IOT075 |	And we were asking lots of questions about what that meant
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,151	| IOT075 |	Well I talked to Miss This
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:11,711	| IOT075 |	This weekend they said that it's not all of their software.
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:14,271	| IOT075 |	It is just those working with the work
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:14,783	| IOT075 |	Nest
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,599	| IOT075 |	So
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:20,159	| IOT075 |	The thought here is it there going to be
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:21,183	| IOT075 |	Creating this like
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:25,279	| IOT075 |	Singleplatform
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,047	| IOT075 |	PetSmart
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,583	| IOT075 |	But yes
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:29,631	| IOT075 |	They're going to create a single platform for
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:30,911	| IOT075 |	Nest
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:31,935	| IOT075 |	Google products
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:33,471	| IOT075 |	They work well together
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:36,031	| IOT075 |	I'm not a hundred percent sure
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:39,615	| IOT075 |	What that means for some of the Sanders that we seem like you don't believe that
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,383	| IOT075 |	There are two of them
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:43,711	| IOT075 |	But I think it's a really good sign because Google is clearly
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,759	| IOT075 |	With Google home
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,551	| IOT075 |	That hopefully we'll hear more about on October
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:50,367	| IOT075 |	Is a big play in the Smart Home
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:53,183	| IOT075 |	And it makes sense that they would want to integrate that with nest
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:07:00,095	| IOT075 |	Yeah that's my hope is that if they're both there will be a Google home announcer cuz the product is supposed to launch this year
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:03,167	| IOT075 |	Google set an IO back in May
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:10,079	| IOT075 |	I don't know if I'm stages are going to talk about this aspect of it the whole works with nest and what they're doing with nests and how it
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,871	| IOT075 |	What size in a Google home if it does
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,407	| IOT075 |	But I suspect that follow up
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:15,711	| IOT075 |	Recording will hopefully give us answers
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:17,759	| IOT075 |	Indeed
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:18,527	| IOT075 |	And
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,551	| IOT075 |	We should also say that
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:27,999	| IOT075 |	It was this week or last week right after the show last week with the one-year anniversary of the on
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,023	| IOT075 |	Onhub router baidu
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:30,047	| IOT075 |	Have one about 1
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:32,095	| IOT075 |	As a consumer before I start working for Google
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:34,655	| IOT075 |	The one-year anniversary celebration
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,447	| IOT075 |	Added support for
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,215	| IOT075 |	Phillips
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:38,495	| IOT075 |	Hue light controls
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,287	| IOT075 |	Through your onhub witches
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:44,383	| IOT075 |	Sort of misleading in a sense because you still need the
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:45,919	| IOT075 |	Hue Bridge
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:51,039	| IOT075 |	And you access your lighting through the web
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,319	| IOT075 |	Can you go to
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:55,391	| IOT075 |	Oh shoot is it on me let me get it right
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,671	| IOT075 |	Let me get right
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:58,463	| IOT075 |	On. Here
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:59,743	| IOT075 |	In a browser
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,511	| IOT075 |	And once you
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,791	| IOT075 |	Go to on. Here
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:04,351	| IOT075 |	On your local network free web page will show you
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:07,679	| IOT075 |	The Philips Hue devices as well as any Chromecast
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,447	| IOT075 |	So that's
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:09,983	| IOT075 |	That's not exactly new their butt
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,495	| IOT075 |	So
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,543	| IOT075 |	It's kind of just taking the place of the
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,079	| IOT075 |	Hue app I guess
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:16,639	| IOT075 |	Really awkward way
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,455	| IOT075 |	What I would imagine is
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:22,271	| IOT075 |	Once you start building these Integrations
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,551	| IOT075 |	Between these two devices
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,575	| IOT075 |	For example
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:27,903	| IOT075 |	Maybe we're going to see more war Integrations on Beyond
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:30,207	| IOT075 |	I don't know again this Miss
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:35,839	| IOT075 |	This ties into like oh Google and Nest coming together and maybe works with Nest becomes the Google platform
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,863	| IOT075 |	Integrated Smart Home
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,143	| IOT075 |	Much like
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,191	| IOT075 |	Homekit is for apple
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:43,263	| IOT075 |	Speaking of homekit we should acknowledge that
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,567	| IOT075 |	Apple event
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,847	| IOT075 |	Set to happen this afternoon
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,127	| IOT075 |	Sarah
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:50,943	| IOT075 |	We're not talking about anything you have to wait till next week
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,735	| IOT075 |	To get our Impressions thoughts
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,783	| IOT075 |	If their impression / thoughts
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,319	| IOT075 |	Oh I'm sure there
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:01,695	| IOT075 |	We were never short of an opinion
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,463	| IOT075 |	True
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:03,743	| IOT075 |	Okay so
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,511	| IOT075 |	The other thing
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,279	| IOT075 |	Nest has
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,559	| IOT075 |	Hangout
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,327	| IOT075 |	I just
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:07,839	| IOT075 |	I can't
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:10,143	| IOT075 |	Having
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,935	| IOT075 |	That's just in the middle of
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,471	| IOT075 |	Let's just call it a crime
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:19,359	| IOT075 |	It's like the media is just beating up on it at lost its founder co-founding CEO after but
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,639	| IOT075 |	How much people like this guy is
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:21,919	| IOT075 |	Really micromanaging and kind of
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:25,503	| IOT075 |	There's a lot of questions like Google you spent
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:27,295	| IOT075 |	3.2 billion on this thing
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,319	| IOT075 |	And
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,599	| IOT075 |	Basically
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,391	| IOT075 |	No new hardware
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,183	| IOT075 |	So
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,975	| IOT075 |	Nest has
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:35,743	| IOT075 |	Decided to
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:37,535	| IOT075 |	Release new hardware
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:42,655	| IOT075 |	Actually there is actual physical Hardware
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:43,935	| IOT075 |	Today
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,703	| IOT075 |	Basically
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:46,495	| IOT075 |	It is launching the outdoor camera
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:47,775	| IOT075 |	You guys about
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,567	| IOT075 |	So that is happening and you
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,079	| IOT075 |	You can buy that
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,615	| IOT075 |	It is adding
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,151	| IOT075 |	3DO colors
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,943	| IOT075 |	To The Nest Thermostat
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:58,783	| IOT075 |	Which I kind of like wow you're in a lot of drama
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,295	| IOT075 |	A lot of pain
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:02,367	| IOT075 |	And you updated your thermostat
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,135	| IOT075 |	3D colors
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:04,927	| IOT075 |	Those colors are copper White
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:06,463	| IOT075 |	In a carbon steel
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:06,975	| IOT075 |	Black
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:11,583	| IOT075 |	That already has
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,655	| IOT075 |	That already exist everything will be available starting
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,191	| IOT075 |	For September 8th
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:18,239	| IOT075 |	With the exception of the white thermostat
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,263	| IOT075 |	Which will be available set
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,287	| IOT075 |	20
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,567	| IOT075 |	And
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:24,639	| IOT075 |	Then is also launching a new service
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,687	| IOT075 |	Called sightline
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:30,271	| IOT075 |	This is actually really interesting this is for the outdoor camera
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,063	| IOT075 |	Internet scams
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:35,903	| IOT075 |	And it's basically a way to comb through the
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:37,951	| IOT075 |	Hours of video that you guys are going
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:41,791	| IOT075 |	Cameras always on always recording
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:45,119	| IOT075 |	Basically recognize this when something significant happens
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:47,167	| IOT075 |	And then creates a thumbnail
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:47,935	| IOT075 |	Around that
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:50,495	| IOT075 |	I can send you that from now is it
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,007	| IOT075 |	Acacia
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,543	| IOT075 |	So
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,335	| IOT075 |	It's actually a really nice
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,383	| IOT075 |	So that's
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:11:00,223	| IOT075 |	Interesting to me because I'm seeing a big push for
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:03,295	| IOT075 |	The application of machine learning in Google products
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:06,367	| IOT075 |	Example would be if he's the inbox app
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,647	| IOT075 |	The smart replies
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:10,207	| IOT075 |	Machine learning is used to generate a smart replies and
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:12,767	| IOT075 |	That's kind of interesting so
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:17,119	| IOT075 |	That sounds like that's what they're doing cuz I also know that machine learning is what they've used
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:17,887	| IOT075 |	Photos
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,655	| IOT075 |	2
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:21,983	| IOT075 |	Help with identification of things and searches and so on.
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:24,799	| IOT075 |	Good I know I sent a lot of pictures of
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:25,567	| IOT075 |	My dog Norman
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:31,199	| IOT075 |	I was just showing somebody in photos like a let me show you know when I just type dog and boom every single dog picture showed up
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,479	| IOT075 |	It's not just search
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,247	| IOT075 |	It's also
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:35,039	| IOT075 |	Machine learning from what I understand
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:37,087	| IOT075 |	It sounds like that's what they're doing here
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:37,855	| IOT075 |	It is
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:40,415	| IOT075 |	I'm in it's important to note that the Dropcam
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:40,927	| IOT075 |	19 habits
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:44,511	| IOT075 |	Mission and vision as well
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:46,047	| IOT075 |	Write before Google bought them
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:49,631	| IOT075 |	And I assume that were continued when they got the influx
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,655	| IOT075 |	Scrum
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:53,727	| IOT075 |	Yeah so what this does is
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:56,287	| IOT075 |	Like what's a the UPS man is coming up to your door
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:58,079	| IOT075 |	The outdoor camera
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,615	| IOT075 |	Will just be like
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:02,175	| IOT075 |	I saw it in action like
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,735	| IOT075 |	Leaves blowing did not register ism
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:05,759	| IOT075 |	Bread at all
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,319	| IOT075 |	But a squirrel passing
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:08,831	| IOT075 |	See through
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,367	| IOT075 |	I'm passing through
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,391	| IOT075 |	Did
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:14,207	| IOT075 |	And you basically get this cool
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,023	| IOT075 |	Timeline view that has like
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:18,303	| IOT075 |	Thumbnails where something
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,095	| IOT075 |	Interesting changed
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,631	| IOT075 |	That I love because
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:25,215	| IOT075 |	Separates the signal of under noise really adds a lot of value
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:28,031	| IOT075 |	I like that
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,799	| IOT075 |	Who is the fastest
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:31,359	| IOT075 |	When it sends notification it will
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:33,919	| IOT075 |	Not it will say we think we saw a person
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,199	| IOT075 |	Or
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:36,223	| IOT075 |	We saw a person
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:37,759	| IOT075 |	Or
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,271	| IOT075 |	There is act
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:41,087	| IOT075 |	So there is activity is the lowest level
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,111	| IOT075 |	And that you get when
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,903	| IOT075 |	You don't like the Squirrel Run
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,183	| IOT075 |	Crossword
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,463	| IOT075 |	A car passes by
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:48,767	| IOT075 |	And then you'll get a thumbnail
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:50,303	| IOT075 |	When you click on that notification
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,071	| IOT075 |	That shows you the
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,631	| IOT075 |	So you can see
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,143	| IOT075 |	It's a raccoon
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,935	| IOT075 |	It'd be nice if you could
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:58,239	| IOT075 |	Kind of sum up or thumb down this
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:13:00,543	| IOT075 |	Can you teach it was important to you in a few
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,335	| IOT075 |	So you can't do that
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,359	| IOT075 |	I did ask about facial
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:06,431	| IOT075 |	Position in Africa
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,991	| IOT075 |	That doesn't seem to be
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:10,015	| IOT075 |	Priority
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,551	| IOT075 |	For them
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:12,319	| IOT075 |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,087	| IOT075 |	Maybe it will be
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,367	| IOT075 |	Overtime
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:17,183	| IOT075 |	It seems really good
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,231	| IOT075 |	And you can ignore
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:21,279	| IOT075 |	A lot of the notifications if you're like a
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:24,351	| IOT075 |	I don't really care if the car pass by I only lyrics
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:26,399	| IOT075 |	There is definitively a person here
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,447	| IOT075 |	So
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:33,055	| IOT075 |	That isn't that also helps at work and say it has a doorbell camera
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:33,823	| IOT075 |	To be honest
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:35,615	| IOT075 |	Schedule you should get your notification.
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,407	| IOT075 |	And then you can talk to the person
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:37,919	| IOT075 |	Outside your door
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,199	| IOT075 |	Sounds good
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:41,503	| IOT075 |	Sounds good we'll see
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:47,135	| IOT075 |	Daddy's out of trees how that works on the battery life and how many notifications you get depending on how many cameras you have
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:48,927	| IOT075 |	The Killer
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:52,255	| IOT075 |	But having had a camera facing outdoors I have
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:55,839	| IOT075 |	Welcome Cameron I had a facing outdoors and I was getting notifications

EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:57,631	| IOT075 |	Because like
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:08,127	| IOT075 |	I was just going to say at some point it becomes so annoying that you stopped using the product you might as well just sit on the front doorstep and just watch for yourself
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:09,407	| IOT075 |	Exactly
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,687	| IOT075 |	Yeah so

EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:11,615	| IOT075 |	He shot me an email this morning said hey you might want to take a look at this on Reddit and sure enough
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:15,199	| IOT075 |	Somebody went to a Home Depot and was using a
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:17,759	| IOT075 |	Computer inventory system which
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,807	| IOT075 |	Why the ban on Reddit if that's
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,831	| IOT075 |	Publicly available.
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:24,159	| IOT075 |	People like I use it all the time I go and only one disease that I've never done that
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:26,975	| IOT075 |	But in case somebody did it they found
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:31,583	| IOT075 |	For $99 in the Home Depot inventory
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,863	| IOT075 |	Coming soon
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,887	| IOT075 |	Wink hub
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,423	| IOT075 |	2 499
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,703	| IOT075 |	Lux and then
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:39,263	| IOT075 |	There's also a link to Amazon
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:42,591	| IOT075 |	And if you go to Amazon you can find the wink Hub 2
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:45,151	| IOT075 |	Temporarily out of stock of course cuz I haven't been announced yet
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:48,223	| IOT075 |	I also she has a price of $99 so
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:50,271	| IOT075 |	We don't have much
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:55,135	| IOT075 |	Information on this because it's like I love my when Colin like what else would I want with it but
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:57,695	| IOT075 |	According to Amazon it says that they have a
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:00,511	| IOT075 |	More powerful wifi radio in the wink Hub 2
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:03,583	| IOT075 |	And many people will be happy in Ethernet port
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,631	| IOT075 |	I don't want to
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:09,215	| IOT075 |	That's just me
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,007	| IOT075 |	I also a stronger processor
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:13,055	| IOT075 |	Not faster stronger
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:15,615	| IOT075 |	And more memory to make your smartphone faster
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:17,151	| IOT075 |	As if your smart home move switch it doesn't
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,199	| IOT075 |	They say that on Amazon that
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:21,247	| IOT075 |	Original wink Hub owners
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:24,831	| IOT075 |	Upgrading can easily transfer your ecosystem connected products in under a minute
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:26,623	| IOT075 |	And it's sleek
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:31,487	| IOT075 |	Modern industrial design makes it worthy of standing alone on your coffee table or bookshelf
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:34,303	| IOT075 |	Which you better hook your router is nearby if it hasn't even at ports
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:37,375	| IOT075 |	I'm still happy with the wink Hub so
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,935	| IOT075 |	There wasn't much missing but I think people will be happy with
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,239	| IOT075 |	You don't have to
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:45,311	| IOT075 |	No one's going to try your way no one's going to make you sweat
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:47,615	| IOT075 |	Having stronger
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:52,479	| IOT075 |	Given the timing.
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:55,807	| IOT075 |	And it clearly has a new Wi-Fi
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:17:00,415	| IOT075 |	And I just saw this buried in the product
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:04,255	| IOT075 |	Prescription not in the bullet points it says hubba 2 is compatible
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:06,047	| IOT075 |	With more smart home technology
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:11,167	| IOT075 |	That lends a little Credence to your thought they're on homekit
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:11,679	| IOT075 |	It's possible
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:12,959	| IOT075 |	So
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:13,471	| IOT075 |	Maybe
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,775	| IOT075 |	We don't know when we're going to see
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,591	| IOT075 |	It is exciting
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:20,127	| IOT075 |	I would probably switch
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:20,895	| IOT075 |	Because
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:21,919	| IOT075 |	I actually
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,711	| IOT075 |	Want to put my wink hub
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:26,527	| IOT075 |	Not in the middle of my house
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:28,319	| IOT075 |	Would like to be hanging off my router
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,623	| IOT075 |	Cuz I have a lovely Little Shelter
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:35,487	| IOT075 |	On the floor in the hallway so I can point well taken
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:42,399	| IOT075 |	So I love this idea
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:43,679	| IOT075 |	I love
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,215	| IOT075 |	The idea that they're going to Knicks
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,495	| IOT075 |	The transition easy
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:48,287	| IOT075 |	This is kind of become
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:50,079	| IOT075 |	Table Stakes for
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:51,615	| IOT075 |	Upgrading your hub
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:56,223	| IOT075 |	SmartThings had an easy kind of upgrade pattern so did the Staples
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:57,503	| IOT075 |	Hub when it existed
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:00,319	| IOT075 |	And the Philips Hue also
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,343	| IOT075 |	What software
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,367	| IOT075 |	That's hard stuff
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:04,415	| IOT075 |	To transition your step
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:04,927	| IOT075 |	Easily
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,463	| IOT075 |	And best of all
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,487	| IOT075 |	We have to share this
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,023	| IOT075 |	It's a footswitch
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:12,607	| IOT075 |	Amazon list
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:15,167	| IOT075 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:20,287	| IOT075 |	Yeah you this will be hard to find if you didn't know you were looking for a look inside
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,823	| IOT075 |	Industrial electrical
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:24,127	| IOT075 |	Devices controls and indicators
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:27,455	| IOT075 |	Then industrial switches and finally the last subcategory
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,223	| IOT075 |	Foot switches
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,503	| IOT075 |	That's just
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:32,063	| IOT075 |	Things like I have a foot pedal for operating a sewing machine
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:36,927	| IOT075 |	So want to turn your lights on just kick the Hub 2
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:37,439	| IOT075 |	There you go
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,719	| IOT075 |	So yeah
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,743	| IOT075 |	And the price
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:41,535	| IOT075 |	Is a little bit more than the kuragin
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,559	| IOT075 |	Wink
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,095	| IOT075 |	Which I believe is going
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,887	| IOT075 |	At a high-end for like about a TB
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:49,983	| IOT075 |	But it's in line with the SmartThings second gen product
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:50,751	| IOT075 |	Rich
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:53,311	| IOT075 |	Okay and it's cheaper than Amazon Echo
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:54,847	| IOT075 |	Which insect has to make some money
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:59,199	| IOT075 |	Yeah I think they make money at all the other devices they make
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,551	| IOT075 |	Wheel of the wink hub
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,599	| IOT075 |	Well wait until you what
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,879	| IOT075 |	Think about this version
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,415	| IOT075 |	And this
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:11,743	| IOT075 |	Talk about perfect able to talk about the wink relay
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:16,607	| IOT075 |	Yes I only have one I don't know if you said earlier in the show relays but I only have one
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,143	| IOT075 |	Review unit
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,167	| IOT075 |	And it is installed
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:23,519	| IOT075 |	Kind of wish I had to because I could have tested that cool intercom feature
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:27,359	| IOT075 |	Where you just press a button and talk from one wink relay in your house to another
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:29,407	| IOT075 |	But that's okay I will just shouting
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:34,271	| IOT075 |	I guess I've had it installed for about a week and a half now
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:35,807	| IOT075 |	Generally pretty happy
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:37,599	| IOT075 |	It's larger than I expected
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:40,415	| IOT075 |	It's it's at least 6 inch by 6 inch I would say
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:43,487	| IOT075 |	So it's it's pretty big I mean
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:45,535	| IOT075 |	In my house and took the place of one rocker switch
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,583	| IOT075 |	So it's a big difference
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,351	| IOT075 |	To have
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,119	| IOT075 |	A larger
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:50,143	| IOT075 |	Device there on the wall but
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,679	| IOT075 |	Put in the bedroom
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,215	| IOT075 |	Liquid took me 20 minutes
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:59,359	| IOT075 |	Install not difficult very good instructions include all the tools little screwdriver with both Phillips head and
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,639	| IOT075 |	Flathead so
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:04,223	| IOT075 |	Literally simple to install just make sure you turn off your breaker first
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:06,527	| IOT075 |	It's very important for any installation
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:10,623	| IOT075 |	It's neat meaning for people who have not seen it is a
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:12,159	| IOT075 |	Small touch screen
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:16,511	| IOT075 |	Along with two buttons on the right hand side of it and those buttons
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:17,791	| IOT075 |	One takes the place
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:20,863	| IOT075 |	Can take the place of the switch that you replacing so to speak
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:21,375	| IOT075 |	So
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,679	| IOT075 |	This is Eric our closet
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,215	| IOT075 |	Switch and I just
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:26,239	| IOT075 |	Press the hardware button
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:29,311	| IOT075 |	It's just like I used to have the talk about in there now just
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:34,943	| IOT075 |	And then you can assign the other button to anything you'd like I would
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,479	| IOT075 |	To turn on the air-conditioning for sale
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,271	| IOT075 |	Touchscreen itself
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:43,903	| IOT075 |	It's interesting and I didn't know this and maybe you did I don't know if you did did you know this thing runs Android o
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:44,927	| IOT075 |	I think I did
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,463	| IOT075 |	I didn't say it because
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,231	| IOT075 |	Cuz I didn't think it was that big
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:51,327	| IOT075 |	Will know it was just interesting to me and and what what clued me
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:54,143	| IOT075 |	Into this was the first time after I installed it
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:59,519	| IOT075 |	It said upgrading applications one of 43. Just like an Android phone would after an Android update
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,543	| IOT075 |	Sorry I actually asked that
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:02,847	| IOT075 |	Wink.
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:07,199	| IOT075 |	When was the touchscreen replicates The Wing Cap to a large
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,479	| IOT075 |	Degree that you would put on your
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,759	| IOT075 |	IPhone your Android device
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:13,855	| IOT075 |	All of your shortcuts that you previously set up for your wink hub
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:15,391	| IOT075 |	Just automatically appear
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:17,952	| IOT075 |	Only shows 2 shortcuts at a time that you can just
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:20,000	| IOT075 |	Swipe over and see the rest of them so
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:22,560	| IOT075 |	You can reorder them and so on so it's kind of nice
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:25,632	| IOT075 |	And then have witches as well and has widgets that show
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:30,496	| IOT075 |	Whatever you like such as the time temperature the weather and so on so
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,288	| IOT075 |	How do you put your Fitbit on there
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:38,432	| IOT075 |	You you could connect and Link a Fitbit and then therefore see your steps and Daily Progress and such
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:42,016	| IOT075 |	I did not and the only reason I did not is because
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:43,552	| IOT075 |	Bad timing
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:46,368	| IOT075 |	I literally just left the Fitbit ecosystem
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:49,696	| IOT075 |	Because I'm using the polar m600 Android Wear watch
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,208	| IOT075 |	Which
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:51,488	| IOT075 |	Is
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:55,840	| IOT075 |	Exercise activity focus and has Android Wear so it's kind of The Best of Both Worlds tomato
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,632	| IOT075 |	I stopped using Fitbit right at the time
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:58,656	| IOT075 |	That I got to read
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,960	| IOT075 |	Kevin ru
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:05,824	| IOT075 |	I'm so so sorry and besides I don't think I want like my weight showing up on the wall
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,592	| IOT075 |	Everyday
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:12,224	| IOT075 |	Yes they'll be motivated for the kids make fun of their dad
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:16,320	| IOT075 |	It's an interesting product not to use a pun here but
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,600	| IOT075 |	There's been one little quirk
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:18,880	| IOT075 |	For some reason
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:24,000	| IOT075 |	The touchscreen you can set it too hot to go on automatically with the proximity sensor
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,024	| IOT075 |	Or you can
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:28,096	| IOT075 |	Disable the proximity sensor and tap the screen to wake it up
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:31,936	| IOT075 |	What a headset for the proximity sensor for some reason in the middle of the night
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:32,704	| IOT075 |	The screen keep coming on
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:33,984	| IOT075 |	Anna
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:36,032	| IOT075 |	And on and we're just sleeping just laying around
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,824	| IOT075 |	Any kind of brighten the room
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:38,848	| IOT075 |	Psycho that's got to stop
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:41,408	| IOT075 |	My wife complains about it so I went to the touch
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:43,456	| IOT075 |	Based only and when you have the touch option
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:45,760	| IOT075 |	Obviously touch the screen comes on for
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,552	| IOT075 |	Set amount of time but there's also wait
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:49,088	| IOT075 |	Tap to turn off so you
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,368	| IOT075 |	You can turn it off so it's not on
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:53,184	| IOT075 |	Too long the strange thing is at least twice now
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:56,000	| IOT075 |	In that mode when I tap the screen nothing is happening
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,280	| IOT075 |	And
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:23:02,400	| IOT075 |	Frustrated and finally there's a very small hidden button at the bottom of the wink relay
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:06,496	| IOT075 |	To reboot it and I've done that and that seems to get it working again for a couple days so
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:11,360	| IOT075 |	I don't know if my wiring I don't know what it is but every once in awhile it just doesn't respond
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:14,944	| IOT075 |	Does it not respond for a while
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:18,272	| IOT075 |	No it just does not respond for a while
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:29,280	| IOT075 |	Weird thing is not so weird but the annoying thing is when you're rebooting or when the touch screen isn't working
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:32,608	| IOT075 |	Even that Hardware button to turn the actual light on the physical button
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,120	| IOT075 |	Doesn't work
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,936	| IOT075 |	Yeah so that's where it gets really
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:37,472	| IOT075 |	You like all I can't see my closet
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:39,264	| IOT075 |	You're like I'm standing in the dark
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:41,056	| IOT075 |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:45,664	| IOT075 |	Could be again could be a corker
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:48,736	| IOT075 |	You're my wiring or something like that I don't know
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:50,016	| IOT075 |	I thought I mentioned
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:51,040	| IOT075 |	No that's good
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,088	| IOT075 |	Right on
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:55,904	| IOT075 |	Until I wish two things I wish
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:24:00,256	| IOT075 |	It could act as a remote sensor for my ecobee3 because it really
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:03,584	| IOT075 |	Is gathering information to sensors are there
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:05,376	| IOT075 |	Or temperature and humidity inside
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:09,472	| IOT075 |	But I can't and that's fine that's that's an integration bit it's not a problem with the product itself
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:11,008	| IOT075 |	Elsa related
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:13,056	| IOT075 |	I can't really use it
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:15,104	| IOT075 |	With my ecobee that much because
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:18,176	| IOT075 |	You can't set a wink shortcut for
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,480	| IOT075 |	Temperature setting
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:20,992	| IOT075 |	With the ecobee
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,784	| IOT075 |	Like you could I
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:23,808	| IOT075 |	I thought you could wait
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,344	| IOT075 |	I don't recall it's been awhile
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:27,392	| IOT075 |	So really I can't do anything with my
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:28,160	| IOT075 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:28,928	| IOT075 |	This
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:29,696	| IOT075 |	Palmer
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,464	| IOT075 |	Okay
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:34,304	| IOT075 |	Create like a robot in the actual app
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:34,816	| IOT075 |	And then have it
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:36,096	| IOT075 |	From there
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,376	| IOT075 |	Haven't found a way to do it
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:38,912	| IOT075 |	Perhaps there's a way and I
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,936	| IOT075 |	Just didn't find it yet
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:41,472	| IOT075 |	No one
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:45,824	| IOT075 |	Yeah like what in the Wink app you can actually set your
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:48,896	| IOT075 |	Your temperature because you have a little rotary-dial
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:50,688	| IOT075 |	You know and you just type whatever you want
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:52,992	| IOT075 |	I haven't seen where to do a shortcut reset
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:53,504	| IOT075 |	Temperature
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:54,784	| IOT075 |	Got it
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:58,112	| IOT075 |	Yeah so if you can't do in the Wing Cap you can't do it on wink realize what I'm gathering
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,648	| IOT075 |	You can do it
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:00,672	| IOT075 |	With the echo
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,560	| IOT075 |	Stop
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:11,168	| IOT075 |	Although when you do that
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,192	| IOT075 |	I've noticed that
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,216	| IOT075 |	It doesn't resume
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:16,544	| IOT075 |	Like your schedule it keeps that temp
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:20,384	| IOT075 |	I'm sure the settler ever forever so you have to be careful when you do that
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,152	| IOT075 |	Yeah
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:23,456	| IOT075 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:24,736	| IOT075 |	So we
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,016	| IOT075 |	Are pretty much out of time
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:27,552	| IOT075 |	History
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:28,064	| IOT075 |	What about next week
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:33,952	| IOT075 |	Stay tuned for
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:36,000	| IOT075 |	A message from our sponsor
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:36,768	| IOT075 |	And then
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:37,536	| IOT075 |	After that
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:38,560	| IOT075 |	Argos
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:41,632	| IOT075 |	Text Corey read a John Deere used
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:43,936	| IOT075 |	Culture and how to build a business
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:46,752	| IOT075 |	Based on connected services
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:53,152	| IOT075 |	Hey everyone this is Stacy I am breaking into the Internet of Things podcast with a quick word from our sponsor this week Spa
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:57,248	| IOT075 |	Cancer is macadamia and they are an iot user experience
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,016	| IOT075 |	Zen design firm
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:01,088	| IOT075 |	And this week's product that we're going to talk about is a Kinect
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:01,600	| IOT075 |	Conference room
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,392	| IOT075 |	So first we have
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:05,696	| IOT075 |	Scott Lewis here to talk about
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:07,744	| IOT075 |	Their work with a company called built IO
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:10,304	| IOT075 |	Scott what exactly did you guys built
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:13,376	| IOT075 |	What does in general is just allow
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:14,400	| IOT075 |	Organizations
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:14,912	| IOT075 |	To manage them
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:17,216	| IOT075 |	For a user
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:19,520	| IOT075 |	What you see depends on
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,312	| IOT075 |	The different scenarios
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:23,104	| IOT075 |	So I might want to
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:26,688	| IOT075 |	You know all the sudden just have an impromptu meeting I look up
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:30,016	| IOT075 |	And see the green light outside my meeting room
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:33,088	| IOT075 |	I know now is open I can go in
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,392	| IOT075 |	Another scenario that
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:37,440	| IOT075 |	Perhaps Love got a meeting running long
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,512	| IOT075 |	Can I stay in there or do I need
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:42,560	| IOT075 |	The late again tells me
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:43,584	| IOT075 |	So
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,120	| IOT075 |	That type
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:46,912	| IOT075 |	Love scenario is what makes
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:47,424	| IOT075 |	Super youth
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:49,472	| IOT075 |	And I can do that be
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:51,520	| IOT075 |	Because it understands underlined
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:54,592	| IOT075 |	Technology understand how people book things on the calendar
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:56,640	| IOT075 |	And it will even tell people friends
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:57,920	| IOT075 |	Hey
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:59,456	| IOT075 |	Looks like you're not using the meeting
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:04,064	| IOT075 |	Cuz it can sense other people are in there is it okay if I just freeze it up
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:05,600	| IOT075 |	It's really about the
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:07,648	| IOT075 |	Solution being non-intrusive
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:11,232	| IOT075 |	So rather than you have the technology yelling at you that you need to
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,256	| IOT075 |	Cynosure
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,024	| IOT075 |	Conference
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:15,328	| IOT075 |	Instead of kind of gives you a gentle nudge
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:17,888	| IOT075 |	You're not there for the technology you're there for the meeting
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:19,680	| IOT075 |	Are the Technologies actually helping
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,472	| IOT075 |	I'd love to under
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:22,240	| IOT075 |	1st and
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:23,264	| IOT075 |	Why you picked that for
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:24,544	| IOT075 |	Killer problems
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:25,312	| IOT075 |	Mount Scott
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:29,664	| IOT075 |	So what coyotes really about is solving practical
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,432	| IOT075 |	Problems
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:36,832	| IOT075 |	The distances are people have day today using technology and simple elegant way and this was a perfect exam
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:38,880	| IOT075 |	Clojure problems that come up all the time
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:41,184	| IOT075 |	Meeting room scheduling is a nightmare
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:41,952	| IOT075 |	And
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,976	| IOT075 |	If you can
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:44,000	| IOT075 |	Solve that problem
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,024	| IOT075 |	Simple technology
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:46,048	| IOT075 |	Why not
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:48,864	| IOT075 |	Is there anything you
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:52,192	| IOT075 |	Thomas The Internet of Things
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:54,496	| IOT075 |	The thing that we've been looking for in technology ever since
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:55,776	| IOT075 |	Started
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,544	| IOT075 |	Building spaceship
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,616	| IOT075 |	We want to move towards
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:03,200	| IOT075 |	The future but we want to do it in such a way where technology enables Our Lives
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:05,248	| IOT075 |	But it's not in your face
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:07,040	| IOT075 |	And today
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:10,112	| IOT075 |	Starting with iot we actually finally have something
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:11,136	| IOT075 |	Platform
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:11,904	| IOT075 |	Several
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:14,976	| IOT075 |	That allows technology of Truliant
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,280	| IOT075 |	And Scott
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,560	| IOT075 |	How can we find you
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:21,120	| IOT075 |	You can find us at
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:22,400	| IOT075 |	Macadamia

EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:24,448	| IOT075 |	Flash built
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:31,104	| IOT075 |	Now back to the show
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:33,408	| IOT075 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the internet
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:34,944	| IOT075 |	This is your house
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:41,856	| IOT075 |	And this week's guest is Corey read a senior vice president of the intelligent solutions group at John Deere
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:44,416	| IOT075 |	Corey thanks for coming on the show today
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:47,488	| IOT075 |	Hey Stacy it's good to be here
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:48,768	| IOT075 |	You guys started your Journey 2
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:50,560	| IOT075 |	Businesses and products
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:53,888	| IOT075 |	A long time ago I feel like I've been reading about your Kinect
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:54,912	| IOT075 |	Contractors for
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:56,448	| IOT075 |	With five or six years at least
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:58,240	| IOT075 |	So can you let a talk about
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:00,544	| IOT075 |	How John Deere started
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:01,824	| IOT075 |	The king about connectivity in there
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:04,384	| IOT075 |	Yeah absolutely soaked
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:07,968	| IOT075 |	You're really the Precision AG business started for us nearly 20 years ago
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:14,880	| IOT075 |	Started in the precise positioning business the guidance based business and we acquire small company to do that and
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:16,672	| IOT075 |	We've been building on it ever since
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:17,696	| IOT075 |	And what are those
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:19,744	| IOT075 |	Precision-guided
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:20,768	| IOT075 |	Is that
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:22,048	| IOT075 |	Your Corrin
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:23,072	| IOT075 |	Primary product
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:25,888	| IOT075 |	Or how should I think of that is that just an enabler for all your
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:32,032	| IOT075 |	It's one of the critical enablers of precision agriculture overall so
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:38,176	| IOT075 |	Technically it's about bouncing low-watt signals off of satellites that are moving through space at
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,200	| IOT075 |	Very rapid
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:40,480	| IOT075 |	Speed and being able to
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:45,600	| IOT075 |	Use a position receiver so an antenna that sits on a a tractor
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:51,488	| IOT075 |	Understand exactly where that tractor is and then being able to use correction signals to help
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:56,352	| IOT075 |	Automated drive those vehicles to really tied accuracy on the ground so within an inch
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:30:01,728	| IOT075 |	Of actress in many cases that allows those machines to position themselves appropriately
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:05,824	| IOT075 |	Know where they are and then know what seeds chemicals in products they put in the ground
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:09,152	| IOT075 |	Okay and what has changed in the last
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:10,176	| IOT075 |	5 years
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:12,224	| IOT075 |	We're all talking about the internet
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,016	| IOT075 |	What did you guys
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:18,368	| IOT075 |	From your position of having had this system in place and then building it
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:19,136	| IOT075 |	Two decades
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,672	| IOT075 |	What are you thinking of adding her
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:29,376	| IOT075 |	Yeah I can tell you what's changed as you add on top of that precise positioning so the ability to know where you are
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,400	| IOT075 |	Lauren guided vehicle
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:35,008	| IOT075 |	To real-time communication so our vehicles are going out the door
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:36,544	| IOT075 |	At the end of this year with
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:41,408	| IOT075 |	4G LTE Wi-Fi Bluetooth enabled communication devices
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:43,456	| IOT075 |	Take the combination
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:48,576	| IOT075 |	A precise positioning in the ability for real-time communication on and off those vehicles
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:54,720	| IOT075 |	They become a real platform for unlocking the next generation of products and services in Precision AG
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,000	| IOT075 |	And
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:57,536	| IOT075 |	What about the role of artificial
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:30:59,584	| IOT075 |	Because
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:00,864	| IOT075 |	When I look at the Internet of Things
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:05,984	| IOT075 |	The next big thing is
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:08,288	| IOT075 |	Actually having computers help me
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:10,080	| IOT075 |	Decision so I'm curious where
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:11,872	| IOT075 |	You guys think that might go and precision
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:18,784	| IOT075 |	Absolutely if you take automated driving a vehicle she had to that on and off board Communications
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:21,600	| IOT075 |	You can start to think about how
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:22,624	| IOT075 |	Whether it's
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:26,720	| IOT075 |	Intelligence that sits off border machine is data is being communicated
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:31,328	| IOT075 |	Into service providers like a John Deere dealer who may be able to provide
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:35,680	| IOT075 |	Uptime services or to an input provider or egg retailer
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:39,264	| IOT075 |	Who can make a recommendation on the type of seed or the type of
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:41,568	| IOT075 |	Crop protection product to be used
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:43,616	| IOT075 |	On a sealed now all of a sudden that
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:46,944	| IOT075 |	Connectivity enables the best intelligence the best
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:51,040	| IOT075 |	Processing that can be done anywhere to be moved quickly on and off of a vehicle
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:53,600	| IOT075 |	A lot of people think of farmers is not being
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,136	| IOT075 |	TekSavvy
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:57,952	| IOT075 |	And I wash Eternal actually tested a story
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:58,720	| IOT075 |	On this
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:31:59,744	| IOT075 |	Talking about a
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,768	| IOT075 |	Case IH
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:03,840	| IOT075 |	Cabless tractor that basically is a self-driving tractor
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:05,120	| IOT075 |	Ashanti the farm show
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:08,448	| IOT075 |	And their headline was Farm Show visitors marble
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:09,728	| IOT075 |	Scott
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:11,776	| IOT075 |	Contractor and I thought it was kind of funny
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:18,432	| IOT075 |	Because this is very much what it feels like Precision agriculture is moving towards this idea of machines doing
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:21,760	| IOT075 |	So I'm curious in your
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:23,808	| IOT075 |	Experience with your customers
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:26,880	| IOT075 |	Are they tech-savvy are they worried about
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:33,792	| IOT075 |	Are they stopping at self driving tractors probably one of the most
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:40,192	| IOT075 |	Analogically Savvy groups of of most of of industrial Industries if you will if you think about
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:41,216	| IOT075 |	Farming it is
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:46,592	| IOT075 |	The production of a crop in an open biological system so you have weather
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:49,408	| IOT075 |	Do you have a lot of things that can happen with pests
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:50,176	| IOT075 |	She have a lot of
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:52,480	| IOT075 |	Characteristics of soil
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:54,528	| IOT075 |	Nutrients that all come out
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:58,368	| IOT075 |	At the same time to help either produce a crop for profit or not
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:05,024	| IOT075 |	What a lot of producers have done is they've invested a lot in technologies that help them understand how to get the most
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:09,376	| IOT075 |	Out of the primary tools that use their operation starts with their land
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:16,288	| IOT075 |	Every piece of land is different across North America the characteristics of it is different they've had to invest in a lot of Technology
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:19,104	| IOT075 |	Jesus help them understand what is the potential of that land
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:22,688	| IOT075 |	And then this Technologies helping them understand how do I unlock
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:24,480	| IOT075 |	How do I select the right
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:26,784	| IOT075 |	Seed chemical fertilizer
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:30,368	| IOT075 |	But in addition what can I use in terms of the best
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:32,160	| IOT075 |	Agricultural Equipment Technology
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:38,816	| IOT075 |	Be able to ensure that everything I do is done consistently with maximizing the profitability
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:40,352	| IOT075 |	On that land so
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:43,424	| IOT075 |	Able to grow more and in many cases do it with less
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:47,264	| IOT075 |	How long is it good for the bottom line it's also good for the environment so
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:51,872	| IOT075 |	Technology has been a big part of the generational change in their culture in the last
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:52,640	| IOT075 |	20 years
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:55,712	| IOT075 |	The automation silent one of the things that's happened
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:34:02,624	| IOT075 |	Agriculture largely the labor required to produce a crop has been reduced dramatically over the last
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:04,672	| IOT075 |	50 here so automation is interesting
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:06,976	| IOT075 |	It's more interesting in terms of
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:07,744	| IOT075 |	Troll
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,536	| IOT075 |	How do you actually plant better
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,072	| IOT075 |	Spray better
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:13,376	| IOT075 |	Harvest better not
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:19,264	| IOT075 |	How do you reduce labor most of the laborers already out of the crop now certainly labor variability is important
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:24,128	| IOT075 |	And producers are interested in how you control for the variable of different operators in the field
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:26,688	| IOT075 |	That's why I'm automation is exciting so
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:29,504	| IOT075 |	I don't think they scoff it automation
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:32,064	| IOT075 |	So to speak but how it's used I think it's most important
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:34,624	| IOT075 |	Do you guys have plans for a self-driving tractor
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:39,488	| IOT075 |	We've actually introduced a self-driving tractor over 10 years ago we had them running
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:46,400	| IOT075 |	In fields in the Southeast running in areas like Orchards and Vineyards where there's they're spraying chemicals and fertile
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:47,168	| IOT075 |	Weiser stats
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:49,728	| IOT075 |	That you don't want people exposed to in the environment so it's
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:56,640	| IOT075 |	It's not about the availability of the technology it's about what's the highest value use of the technology certainly one
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:59,456	| IOT075 |	One of the things we can do with that and have done in the past
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:02,528	| IOT075 |	Is creative fully autonomous systems
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:09,440	| IOT075 |	A lot of producers actually like to be involved in the system they like to be in the seat they like to be able to maybe to do other things
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:15,840	| IOT075 |	Thanks from the cab so use that communication technology to communicate on and off to their technical advisers or maybe Market there
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:20,960	| IOT075 |	I think a lot of the commentary here is when our people ready for that system to be the predominant system
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:22,240	| IOT075 |	When do you think that might be
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:29,152	| IOT075 |	I'm not sure I think we're prepared for it if they wanted to go there in a couple years we would be there right now
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:32,480	| IOT075 |	If you think about what's happening I'll use an example for you
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:33,760	| IOT075 |	In the last
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:36,576	| IOT075 |	50 years and certainly in the last
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:37,600	| IOT075 |	100 years
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:44,512	| IOT075 |	There's less than 1% of the labor required than what they're used to be to create a ton of wheat or a hundred
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:45,280	| IOT075 |	Bushels of corn
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:51,424	| IOT075 |	Actually a lot of the labor is out of the production of the crop what's change though
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:57,824	| IOT075 |	Is the value of the inputs that flow through the hour in the field that someone has with a p
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:36:00,128	| IOT075 |	Equipment weather to tractor combine
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:04,992	| IOT075 |	A springer is increased by a hundredfold over that same period of time
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,016	| IOT075 |	Actually
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:11,392	| IOT075 |	The use of technology for Automation and control over the execution in the field
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:13,184	| IOT075 |	Of the jobs that are getting done
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:16,000	| IOT075 |	Is far more valuable to a producer
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:18,816	| IOT075 |	Then to be able to take that last one percent of Labor
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:19,840	| IOT075 |	Out of the equation
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:20,608	| IOT075 |	Got it
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:22,400	| IOT075 |	So later is not the issue
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:23,424	| IOT075 |	Making them
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:24,960	| IOT075 |	Biggest best bang for your buck
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:27,264	| IOT075 |	For your fertilizer for your water
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:34,176	| IOT075 |	Absolutely in labor isn't where I don't want to leave you with the impression that labor is not important it certainly is because
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:36,736	| IOT075 |	Variability of Labor from one operator to the next
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:43,648	| IOT075 |	It doesn't necessarily take so long Tommy to do that it takes control systems to be able to do that Metairie see a lot of
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:45,184	| IOT075 |	In the industry going
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:48,768	| IOT075 |	Is in two control systems that help manage the variability
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:53,376	| IOT075 |	The ultimate in that is to reduce the variable of Labor altogether and reduce the person
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:55,424	| IOT075 |	We see that as an opportunity
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:56,960	| IOT075 |	Potentially but not as the priority
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:58,752	| IOT075 |	Okay
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:37:01,056	| IOT075 |	So let's talk about how this plays out in your business
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:02,336	| IOT075 |	Because
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:03,104	| IOT075 |	You guys
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:04,128	| IOT075 |	Spell actual
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:05,408	| IOT075 |	Trackers
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:06,176	| IOT075 |	And combines
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:08,224	| IOT075 |	You are so
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:10,528	| IOT075 |	Data and then I believe you sell
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:12,320	| IOT075 |	Advisorservices to Armour
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:13,088	| IOT075 |	As well so
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:14,624	| IOT075 |	Walk me through
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:16,672	| IOT075 |	Kind of the role that connect
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:19,488	| IOT075 |	Activity the dimensions that is added to John Deere
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:24,096	| IOT075 |	Can certainly Precision AG technology overall
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:28,192	| IOT075 |	The role is to both help differentiate the underlined product the track
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:28,960	| IOT075 |	Combine
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:29,728	| IOT075 |	Sprayer
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:30,496	| IOT075 |	Planter
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,520	| IOT075 |	That we sell
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:33,568	| IOT075 |	And it does to that it helps those products
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:35,104	| IOT075 |	Work even better and helps
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:39,200	| IOT075 |	Them execute in a way that maximizes yield manage cost
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:42,272	| IOT075 |	It's also expected to be a good business
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:47,392	| IOT075 |	Like any other business within John Deere in for our shareholders and for a customers
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:50,464	| IOT075 |	Obviously we sell products like tractors and combines
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:51,488	| IOT075 |	We sell
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:53,792	| IOT075 |	Hardware in the position hbase like
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:57,376	| IOT075 |	Position receivers telematics devices displays
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:38:04,032	| IOT075 |	Who sells software things like activations for autotrakk or correction signals for guidance systems
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:06,336	| IOT075 |	Sell software that helps
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:12,736	| IOT075 |	Turn automatically machines on and off when they come to a point row if you think about control systems for sprayer nozzle
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:14,016	| IOT075 |	Score for planners
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:16,832	| IOT075 |	We also work with our dealers to sell services
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,112	| IOT075 |	Uptime services
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:19,904	| IOT075 |	Proactive maintenance
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,672	| IOT075 |	Services
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:23,744	| IOT075 |	And then we connect a lot of economic advisers
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:26,304	| IOT075 |	A lot of people who have core expertise in
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:28,352	| IOT075 |	Putting the right seat on the right
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:31,680	| IOT075 |	Acre putting the right nutrient at the right time in the ground
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:38,080	| IOT075 |	And we connect them through this Precision AG system to give Growers access to the best in the industry
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:40,128	| IOT075 |	So each of those represents
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:44,224	| IOT075 |	Not only profit opportunity for the the grower the producer
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:48,576	| IOT075 |	But also up a place where were John Deere can deliver value and
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:49,600	| IOT075 |	And collect value
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:52,160	| IOT075 |	What have you learned about pricing based on the diff
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:53,696	| IOT075 |	Products that you sell
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:57,024	| IOT075 |	One of the things that I think is really fascinating about
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:38:58,304	| IOT075 |	The products is
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:01,376	| IOT075 |	You have to account somewhere
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:03,168	| IOT075 |	For the cost of
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:04,704	| IOT075 |	Supporting a product in the long term
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:07,776	| IOT075 |	I'm so you guys might have rental fees for the Precision tracking
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:10,592	| IOT075 |	There's a cloud back-end fees for
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:11,616	| IOT075 |	Various things so
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:14,176	| IOT075 |	What if you guys kind of thought about
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:15,200	| IOT075 |	But how have you come to manage that
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:17,760	| IOT075 |	Obviously
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:22,624	| IOT075 |	Any pricing strategy starts with a firm understanding of how you're creating value
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:24,416	| IOT075 |	We look first
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:25,696	| IOT075 |	For which of the
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:27,744	| IOT075 |	Products whether it's a heart I am product
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:30,048	| IOT075 |	Software-as-a-service we can deliver
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:35,936	| IOT075 |	What are the things that we can do that point of the value being created in that space that's the starting point
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:39,008	| IOT075 |	And then we at we look across the
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:43,872	| IOT075 |	The chain of people involved in delivering it so if it's with us and our dealer and a customer
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:45,152	| IOT075 |	Shasta Creek
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:50,016	| IOT075 |	Value for the customer first and then there has to be enough margin that can be shared
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:53,856	| IOT075 |	Between those three components us are dealer in the producer
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:40:00,000	| IOT075 |	Ultimately that's a primary sort for how we think about which products actually make it to our portfolio process
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:02,304	| IOT075 |	If they create enough value
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:05,120	| IOT075 |	The available margin associated with the product
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:05,888	| IOT075 |	Can be shared
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:09,984	| IOT075 |	Across those in the still good marching in it for the customer
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:11,776	| IOT075 |	Value received versus what it cost
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:14,336	| IOT075 |	Then we'll move the clock forward
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:16,384	| IOT075 |	NM price it appropriately
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:17,408	| IOT075 |	If there isn't
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:21,248	| IOT075 |	Then it off and won't be at the front of our portfolio process to be worked on
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:24,064	| IOT075 |	Do you have any examples you can give us things
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:24,576	| IOT075 |	Maybe didn't
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:27,136	| IOT075 |	Give enough value caffe
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:28,672	| IOT075 |	I look at a lot of companies
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:29,696	| IOT075 |	I feel like they are
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:32,768	| IOT075 |	If this mentality of a put a chip in it
EDL	00:40:32,768	00:40:33,792	| IOT075 |	Put some analytics on it
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:36,864	| IOT075 |	And I don't know how far ahead they're thinking
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:38,144	| IOT075 |	4
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:43,008	| IOT075 |	Thought their pricing strategies and like the number of people who might have dropped it that they have to support over
EDL	00:40:44,032	00:40:44,544	| IOT075 |	So
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:46,336	| IOT075 |	Any more color you have there
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:46,848	| IOT075 |	Would be wonderful
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:52,992	| IOT075 |	We've done some of the automation space I use one itec pro as an automated turn back to the automation
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:54,528	| IOT075 |	Conversation
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:57,600	| IOT075 |	Some producers really like it either say hey
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:41:01,952	| IOT075 |	I'm willing to actually turn on the End of the Roll myself so we can almost fully
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:02,976	| IOT075 |	Automate
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:05,536	| IOT075 |	In field operations of a tractor today
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:07,072	| IOT075 |	For some producers
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:12,960	| IOT075 |	They just rather turn on the end I know my operators involved in responding and being aware
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:17,824	| IOT075 |	I would rather have them do that on their own so that's product while we're offering it today
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:20,896	| IOT075 |	It doesn't have the same kind of take rate to some of the high value products
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:27,808	| IOT075 |	I like section control or the ability from a row by row perspective to turn your planner on and off or you
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:29,088	| IOT075 |	Your nozzles on your sprayer
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:32,160	| IOT075 |	Specialty Products it at both ends of that Spectrum
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:36,000	| IOT075 |	We'll just wait till in a couple years when nobody else knows how to drive because
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:38,304	| IOT075 |	Autonomous cars are all the rage in the
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:44,960	| IOT075 |	No one knows how to turn at the end of his rope
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:51,872	| IOT075 |	Seeing and understanding the developments in the autonomous car industry in the fact that we kind of chuckled early because we've been
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:55,199	| IOT075 |	Drive down i80 between our headquarters in moline and des moines
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:59,807	| IOT075 |	Probably 70-plus percent of the tractors running on either side of Interstate 80
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:04,159	| IOT075 |	Already driving themselves and then we're talking about when will the day come when a car does that
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:05,439	| IOT075 |	Ultimately it's
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:06,463	| IOT075 |	It's an interesting
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:08,255	| IOT075 |	Challenge though because
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:11,839	| IOT075 |	While you can drive down I-80 or if you drive down I-75 I'll use
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:15,679	| IOT075 |	I use the Auto industry is a good example from Detroit to Miami
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:22,591	| IOT075 |	I will that highways fairly similar in the Technologies can be fairly consistent the farming that goes on either side of that Highway North
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:24,127	| IOT075 |	South is incredibly
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:26,943	| IOT075 |	Every Farm is different every field every crop
EDL	00:42:26,943	00:42:29,759	| IOT075 |	The complexity hbase is actually much higher
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:36,415	| IOT075 |	In the complexity in the automotive space now this steaks can be higher in the on-road environment have people's lives in
EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:39,231	| IOT075 |	Obstacles in in those things involved in
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:41,023	| IOT075 |	That has a different dynamic
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:42,815	| IOT075 |	But actually the complexity of growing
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:49,727	| IOT075 |	Dozens of different crops and dozens of different soil types in different environments create a very complex
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:52,031	| IOT075 |	World and one that the egg industry has been out
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:54,335	| IOT075 |	Son of most other Industries in the area of automation
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:59,711	| IOT075 |	It has do you have anything you guys can teach your offer to the self-driving car manufacturer
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:07,135	| IOT075 |	I don't know how we can teach him we spent a lot of time talking to him allowed to Precision Technologies what we've learned is there's no
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:10,207	| IOT075 |	Single technology rely on exclusively
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:13,279	| IOT075 |	If you're going to be in the space you need to think about how to use
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:17,375	| IOT075 |	The best of all of the Technologies one of the areas we focused on
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,143	| IOT075 |	Isn't
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:19,935	| IOT075 |	And being able to merge
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:22,751	| IOT075 |	The different sensing type Technologies from
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:25,823	| IOT075 |	Visual to tactile to GPS
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:27,871	| IOT075 |	You get better Solutions
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:30,943	| IOT075 |	The more solutions you can pull together so what
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:36,063	| IOT075 |	Technology are you most looking forward to or what technology do you look at right now and you're like
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:38,623	| IOT075 |	Oh we in a Precision Adventist
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:39,903	| IOT075 |	Space we gotta get some of that
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:40,415	| IOT075 |	The awesome
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:44,255	| IOT075 |	We spent a lot of time in the
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:47,071	| IOT075 |	In the positioning area and and that's exciting
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:51,935	| IOT075 |	I think we're learning is how a lot of the technologies that have been around can be used
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:52,959	| IOT075 |	To do even more
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:55,775	| IOT075 |	Once you know where you are an example
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:44:00,127	| IOT075 |	We initially said the hey that was about yield then we said it's about driving a vehicle
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:04,223	| IOT075 |	Now the interplay between different Vehicles what are you using
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:09,343	| IOT075 |	GPS is your primary input or visual or a feeler system a tactile system
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:15,743	| IOT075 |	The ability to now manage between primary applications in a field
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:18,815	| IOT075 |	The ability to think about positioning of
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:19,327	| IOT075 |	Fleets
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:21,375	| IOT075 |	Differently and
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:23,935	| IOT075 |	Processing that goes along with that what's happened is
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:29,823	| IOT075 |	The ability to both process massive amounts of data in this is one thing Rado is helping us a lot
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:35,967	| IOT075 |	Because a lot of the processing power required is bringing down the cost of processing any of the use of cloud-based
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:41,599	| IOT075 |	System that allows to move data to where it's needed to be processed and then move it cleanly back on
EDL	00:44:42,111	00:44:45,695	| IOT075 |	Actually there's a limitless potential as to what you can do in the field
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:49,791	| IOT075 |	Strip challenge for industry not just of John Deere but our industry
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:53,631	| IOT075 |	Taking all those capabilities and boil it into products and services
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:58,239	| IOT075 |	That's fit the needs and the evolution of where customers are
EDL	00:44:58,239	00:44:59,263	| IOT075 |	Wanting to go
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:00,031	| IOT075 |	Today
