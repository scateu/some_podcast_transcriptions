EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:23,360	| IOT133 |	Skip this week we'll talk about Dell
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:24,128	| IOT133 |	Which is it
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:26,688	| IOT133 |	Best billion dollars in iot
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:28,992	| IOT133 |	R&D over the next 3 years
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:31,296	| IOT133 |	Around a couple different projects
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:34,880	| IOT133 |	It's also really trying hard to integrate all of its
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:36,160	| IOT133 |	Business units into
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,464	| IOT133 |	1iota option
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,488	| IOT133 |	10 / customers
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:41,536	| IOT133 |	Prior to this gel was really involved
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,816	| IOT133 |	Selling gateways
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:46,144	| IOT133 |	And it did work with a lot of customers individually to set of solutions
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,936	| IOT133 |	But now it's got this
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,984	| IOT133 |	Unified approach to Route it
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:52,032	| IOT133 |	Many many products so we're talkin
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:53,824	| IOT133 |	Dell EMC stock
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,592	| IOT133 |	VMware
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:55,872	| IOT133 |	Pivotal
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:56,640	| IOT133 |	All of that
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:59,968	| IOT133 |	It's also made some investments into a bunch of IO
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,992	| IOT133 |	40 startups
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:05,600	| IOT133 |	So when I talked to Del
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,624	| IOT133 |	Last week
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:09,440	| IOT133 |	About the snooze Leon
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,208	| IOT133 |	Green
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,744	| IOT133 |	Distributed back into the
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,560	| IOT133 |	So they really wanted to focus
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:17,376	| IOT133 |	At the edge not necessarily the sensors
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:20,704	| IOT133 |	At the gateways and then in the
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:23,520	| IOT133 |	Concept in some places you're going to have data centers
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,800	| IOT133 |	You're not actually
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:26,848	| IOT133 |	Data centers on site
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:29,664	| IOT133 |	So that's kind of their focus and then some of it goes bad
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:34,784	| IOT133 |	Obviously
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:37,088	| IOT133 |	Companies in Inwood VMware
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:38,112	| IOT133 |	AMC
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:46,304	| IOT133 |	Docker project Nautilus
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:49,120	| IOT133 |	Which I think is in beta right now just ingested
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:51,680	| IOT133 |	Queries data from the iot gateways
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:55,264	| IOT133 |	So you're taking that edge data and mash it up and see what they can find out
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,568	| IOT133 |	And that's really important because obviously
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,872	| IOT133 |	There are so many situations of
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:00,384	| IOT133 |	People are realizing
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:02,432	| IOT133 |	Coyote
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:03,200	| IOT133 |	Dealt with
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:03,968	| IOT133 |	In real time
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,040	| IOT133 |	To be like you
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,064	| IOT133 |	Admittedly
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,112	| IOT133 |	Actually
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:13,184	| IOT133 |	Real-time because of someone's operating like a smelt
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,720	| IOT133 |	Machine and the temperature gets too
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,000	| IOT133 |	The high that needs to be
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:24,447	| IOT133 |	So I think the IT world is kind of waking up to the fact that when they started selling the stuff into some of the many
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:24,959	| IOT133 |	Passion planner
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:33,407	| IOT133 |	Do you not understand what we do all the time and how dangerous that can be so that's why the other is data
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:35,199	| IOT133 |	So much data center
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:37,503	| IOT133 |	Doesn't make sense manufacturing Park
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:40,063	| IOT133 |	Generate like a petabyte of data a day
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:43,135	| IOT133 |	Nobody needs all of that nobody needs all of us
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:46,975	| IOT133 |	To spend it the money to send that up to the cloud storage
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:48,255	| IOT133 |	Do stuff there
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:50,047	| IOT133 |	So finally there's a
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:50,815	| IOT133 |	Security company
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:53,119	| IOT133 |	It's a lot of this is very critical data
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,143	| IOT133 |	And
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:58,495	| IOT133 |	So that's what those doing here it's a smart
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,031	| IOT133 |	Makes sense
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:02,847	| IOT133 |	I don't have a lot more to say
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:08,991	| IOT133 |	Well I'm glad you mentioned security bit because it's a common theme in our shows
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:15,647	| IOT133 |	And they actually is part of this initiative project Iris under the ribs
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:21,279	| IOT133 |	So they are working to provide certain disabilities in Monterey out to the edges what they're saying so that's good to say
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:25,119	| IOT133 |	Yes yes
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,471	| IOT133 |	It's a hyper-converged platform
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,775	| IOT133 |	Part of the VMware family
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:34,079	| IOT133 |	And it's basically going to let you do
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,615	| IOT133 |	Software
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:36,383	| IOT133 |	Consistent
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,407	| IOT133 |	All the way from
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:38,943	| IOT133 |	Not the sensors
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:40,223	| IOT133 |	Probably the Gateway
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:43,551	| IOT133 |	To the core area which is to be that little mini Datacenter all the way to the
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,063	| IOT133 |	Cloud
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:49,183	| IOT133 |	So it's just going to make life easier I know we're talking very much in generalities
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,975	| IOT133 |	And the devil is in the details on these
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:53,023	| IOT133 |	I don't want to
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:56,351	| IOT133 |	It is
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:58,655	| IOT133 |	High-level framework
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:05,311	| IOT133 |	So here are the devil's in the details will see what happens if I was playing buzzword bingo hyper-converged
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:06,591	| IOT133 |	Yes
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,615	| IOT133 |	I should have Piper
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:10,687	| IOT133 |	Basically your storage your networking
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:12,223	| IOT133 |	Computing it's all kind of in the same
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:12,735	| IOT133 |	Please possible
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:16,063	| IOT133 |	Allocate resources on the flights Ferry
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:17,599	| IOT133 |	I'm going to stop
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:19,903	| IOT133 |	Because
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,439	| IOT133 |	Salesforce
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,487	| IOT133 |	Another kind of industrial iot
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,791	| IOT133 |	Salesforce
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:26,815	| IOT133 |	They came in
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:27,327	| IOT133 |	Big
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,887	| IOT133 |	2015
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:33,983	| IOT133 |	And then we didn't really hear
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:41,151	| IOT133 |	So what they did at dreamforce this week they basically said they've created
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:42,943	| IOT133 |	Summon call the IMT Expo
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:43,711	| IOT133 |	Explorer Edition
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:46,527	| IOT133 |	And this is just to help people deal with data
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,295	| IOT133 |	Better
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,599	| IOT133 |	And it's doing it in a way that doesn't it
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,623	| IOT133 |	Kodi
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:51,903	| IOT133 |	So
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:52,671	| IOT133 |	You guys maybe
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,207	| IOT133 |	Salesforce what the heck
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:57,535	| IOT133 |	Important thing because
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:59,071	| IOT133 |	WeChat
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,863	| IOT133 |	Overseeing staff
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:03,167	| IOT133 |	But you have to eventually evolve
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:06,239	| IOT133 |	So that's what Salesforce is Hope
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:08,287	| IOT133 |	So all of that
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:10,591	| IOT133 |	To be analyzed
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:17,503	| IOT133 |	Anixter like think of service calls examples
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:19,551	| IOT133 |	Disturbing company
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:21,855	| IOT133 |	It service call
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:23,391	| IOT133 |	There's going to be service required
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:25,183	| IOT133 |	Potato
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:28,255	| IOT133 |	From the turbine to figure out what's going on
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,791	| IOT133 |	What happened what went wrong
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:33,119	| IOT133 |	Rather than go after it after the fact that you're getting real time reading
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:36,959	| IOT133 |	As a service calls coming in it really cuts down on the time it takes
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:37,727	| IOT133 |	Solve the problem
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,263	| IOT133 |	Exactly
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:41,055	| IOT133 |	If you don't believe that this is a thing
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:44,127	| IOT133 |	Go back in time to November
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:44,639	| IOT133 |	2016
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:46,175	| IOT133 |	GE
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,967	| IOT133 |	Bought servicemax
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,247	| IOT133 |	Or 900 in
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:50,271	| IOT133 |	And I think it's 950
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,063	| IOT133 |	Million dollars
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,111	| IOT133 |	And that was a deal
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:58,975	| IOT133 |	Basically to bring people into the predix GE predix infrastructure
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,999	| IOT133 |	Service calls me
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:02,559	| IOT133 |	Managing all of that Salesforce obviously wants to get in
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,887	| IOT133 |	And it'll do it
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:08,959	| IOT133 |	I want to say this cuz I haven't looked at servicemax to my
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,751	| IOT133 |	Might do it like a
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:14,079	| IOT133 |	Comfortable for the Enterprise way so maybe we'll see
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:19,199	| IOT133 |	It is the more OT side of the GE way and for the it side
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:21,247	| IOT133 |	Enterprise spokes go
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,271	| IOT133 |	More Salesforce
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:23,551	| IOT133 |	All right
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:24,831	| IOT133 |	Let's talk about Amazon
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:27,391	| IOT133 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:32,511	| IOT133 |	So I think we talked about
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,535	| IOT133 |	What's good weather
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:34,815	| IOT133 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:36,863	| IOT133 |	Walmart was work
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,143	| IOT133 |	Google for
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,167	| IOT133 |	Rihanna
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:43,775	| IOT133 |	That was that yes yes yes I forgot it was a Google home or Amazon
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,591	| IOT133 |	Certainly don't want to be shut out of this concern Adra
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:51,967	| IOT133 |	Shoots Walmart competitor
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:56,063	| IOT133 |	Can you use a Smart locks in your home to get your stuff in your house also
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:04,255	| IOT133 |	Smart license plate Josh and deliver things to your car just put in your trunk for you
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:06,559	| IOT133 |	Frame is the name of the smart license plate maker
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:10,399	| IOT133 |	Part of frame is a license plate frame
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,423	| IOT133 |	There's a little
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:14,239	| IOT133 |	Space to store a key for the trunk of your car in there
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:15,775	| IOT133 |	You can remotely open now
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,055	| IOT133 |	Provide access to your trunk
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:21,151	| IOT133 |	It's kind of interesting cuz there's such a focus on home delivery
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:26,527	| IOT133 |	Guess what you're not always at home
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:29,343	| IOT133 |	So if you were at work and you want something over there
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:32,415	| IOT133 |	Actually just drop it off in your car trunk
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,183	| IOT133 |	You don't
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:35,487	| IOT133 |	I feel like they were talking about that earlier
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:38,559	| IOT133 |	I filed a patent for the info is it now real
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,119	| IOT133 |	Or is there a box with frame
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:47,263	| IOT133 |	Anything yet but that's the reporting is that they were talking with frame to make us a delivery service
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:48,799	| IOT133 |	Okay cool
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:49,823	| IOT133 |	I'm all for it
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:50,591	| IOT133 |	Make my life
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,895	| IOT133 |	Okay now
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,687	| IOT133 |	Speaking of Google home
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,455	| IOT133 |	Google home Mini
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:56,991	| IOT133 |	Sao Paulo
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:01,599	| IOT133 |	It was last week
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:02,879	| IOT133 |	Yes
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,391	| IOT133 |	Yes
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,439	| IOT133 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:08,767	| IOT133 |	Of course some of it was
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,559	| IOT133 |	Google home
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:17,471	| IOT133 |	Product family
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:20,543	| IOT133 |	The reviewers actually
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:30,015	| IOT133 |	And found out some trial-and-error and some wacky
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:36,159	| IOT133 |	That it was listening and recording and sending everything up to the cloud which we know
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:42,815	| IOT133 |	But it only supposed to happen when you actually trigger the keyword this is happening 7 by 20
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,887	| IOT133 |	4 and that is a very very bad and so
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:50,495	| IOT133 |	And replace it exactly what they should do as a response to review really reached out to Google
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:57,151	| IOT133 |	Record the issue Google and they have already
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:01,247	| IOT133 |	Exit this problems if you ordered one on don't worry this is not
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:08,159	| IOT133 |	I don't understand how this happened
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:12,511	| IOT133 |	The Google home mini has to be sharing and reusing tons of the code
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:15,327	| IOT133 |	It's already in Google home and ordering Google assist
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:18,655	| IOT133 |	So what happened somebody
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,471	| IOT133 |	I just understand
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,007	| IOT133 |	Well and
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:26,591	| IOT133 |	This is like everybody's worst fear about bringing these in
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,919	| IOT133 |	So you would think that
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,431	| IOT133 |	Google would be like
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,967	| IOT133 |	Hey guys
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,479	| IOT133 |	What's me
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:35,295	| IOT133 |	For real sure that this doesn't
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:35,807	| IOT133 |	Happen
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:37,343	| IOT133 |	Apparently that didn't
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:40,927	| IOT133 |	QA test manager
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:45,023	| IOT133 |	This would certainly be one of the use cases I be testing that's all I mean
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:47,071	| IOT133 |	All right
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,863	| IOT133 |	All right
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:50,655	| IOT133 |	Option
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,935	| IOT133 |	We don't actually have an official thing
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:59,359	| IOT133 |	Call game
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:00,383	| IOT133 |	No no no
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:02,943	| IOT133 |	No you can go in and erase this stuff
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:05,503	| IOT133 |	That's doable you just go in
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,039	| IOT133 |	Your privacy settings
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:11,135	| IOT133 |	You should be able to see you can hear everything that it's hard
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:13,951	| IOT133 |	Do you want to get rid of it now when you get rid of it
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,487	| IOT133 |	Will tell you this
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,511	| IOT133 |	You are
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,791	| IOT133 |	Messing with this effective
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,887	| IOT133 |	Everything is learned
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,935	| IOT133 |	Is Tatiana starting from scratch
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:29,055	| IOT133 |	Okay let's talk about
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:32,639	| IOT133 |	GM
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:34,175	| IOT133 |	Company called stroke
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:35,199	| IOT133 |	Make it slime
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,247	| IOT133 |	Better
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:39,039	| IOT133 |	I don't know what else to say about that
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:41,343	| IOT133 |	I can tell you what else
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:46,463	| IOT133 |	I think this is awesome and I'll tell you why let me give you a very quick little backstory
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,999	| IOT133 |	When I was working at Google
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:50,303	| IOT133 |	Spaces group
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,071	| IOT133 |	And we
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:53,631	| IOT133 |	Set up a booth at the Google Cloud event
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:57,727	| IOT133 |	And we got a $25,000 lidar sensor
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,263	| IOT133 |	We were showing
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:01,567	| IOT133 |	People who may be on retail stores
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:02,591	| IOT133 |	How you can track
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:06,175	| IOT133 |	Motion movement Etc
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:09,247	| IOT133 |	Amazing
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,527	| IOT133 |	It's basically sending
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:13,599	| IOT133 |	From top to bottom 30 thousand lines of
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:18,975	| IOT133 |	Weezer's and that way you can get the depth and width of everything so I'm support does that every second
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:19,487	| IOT133 |	But again
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,791	| IOT133 |	$25,000
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:27,167	| IOT133 |	The report is by GM buying strobe
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:31,519	| IOT133 |	They will reduce the cost of lidar by 99%
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:33,567	| IOT133 |	Actually do that
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,615	| IOT133 |	Scale
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:38,175	| IOT133 |	And you can start putting the cost out of these things
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,967	| IOT133 |	That's when it's going to be
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:43,807	| IOT133 |	Attractive in London market and become more useful
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:48,671	| IOT133 |	So that means the big think reducing the cost of lidar
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,463	| IOT133 |	Computer vision
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:55,071	| IOT133 |	3D depth sensing which I've written about we're all very excited about
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,863	| IOT133 |	Computer vision right now
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,655	| IOT133 |	It's weird because we see one way
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,423	| IOT133 |	Everything everything
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,471	| IOT133 |	That is not true
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,519	| IOT133 |	Computer vision is
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,847	| IOT133 |	It is flat in doboj to contacts
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:07,871	| IOT133 |	Except
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:08,895	| IOT133 |	We can figure out
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,687	| IOT133 |	Oh I see these things
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:12,223	| IOT133 |	Pixels in when I get this arranged
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:13,759	| IOT133 |	Pixels it is a cat
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:14,783	| IOT133 |	What is
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,807	| IOT133 |	Cool about text
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:21,695	| IOT133 |	3D 3D
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,463	| IOT133 |	Until things like
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:25,279	| IOT133 |	If you put a white box against the white wall it can actually say
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:26,815	| IOT133 |	Not This Is Us
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,863	| IOT133 |	White Walls
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:32,447	| IOT133 |	It can actually sit here
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,471	| IOT133 |	This is really
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:35,263	| IOT133 |	Cool stuff
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:35,775	| IOT133 |	Because
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,055	| IOT133 |	I can put that
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:37,567	| IOT133 |	Places
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:38,591	| IOT133 |	Computer skin
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:43,711	| IOT133 |	Well they can analyze more information see more of us in oh my God our privacy is dead
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:48,063	| IOT133 |	Okay and you should see how much data that creates these letters
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:50,623	| IOT133 |	Lee County Jail space Weaver doing
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,487	| IOT133 |	In a car
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:58,047	| IOT133 |	It's going to be the same thing you're going to need that though for
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,583	| IOT133 |	Seeing all around me
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,119	| IOT133 |	Turn 60 degrees
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:02,655	| IOT133 |	It's going to be awesome
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:04,703	| IOT133 |	You're going to need a lot of gpus
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:08,799	| IOT133 |	Just so happen space
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:11,615	| IOT133 |	Step somebody Makes You music video
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:13,151	| IOT133 |	Says it's got a chip
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:18,271	| IOT133 |	That can take all that data and bring what they call level 5 autonomous driving
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:20,575	| IOT133 |	This is the new Drive PX
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,855	| IOT133 |	Xbox One hunting video
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:25,439	| IOT133 |	That will deliver 320 trillion operations
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:29,535	| IOT133 |	And it's going towards Autumn Acres of course
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,071	| IOT133 |	In the second half of the year
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,887	| IOT133 |	Nice and level 5 Nvidia mean
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,423	| IOT133 |	There will be no need
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,447	| IOT133 |	Gray steering wheel
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:38,495	| IOT133 |	Petal or pedal
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,519	| IOT133 |	Or mirrors
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:42,591	| IOT133 |	In your self driving car if you choose to implement this
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,383	| IOT133 |	Holy crap
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,431	| IOT133 |	I need a mirror in my car
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:47,711	| IOT133 |	How to put makeup on
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:50,271	| IOT133 |	That's what your phone is for selfie mode
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:59,999	| IOT133 |	Can you be able to do that in this car because you won't have your hands on the wheel or anything just hold the phone up and put your makeup on
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:02,559	| IOT133 |	Give me an extra five minutes
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:05,631	| IOT133 |	How far away
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:09,215	| IOT133 |	They're saying second half of 2018
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,567	| IOT133 |	Here's what it says
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:23,551	| IOT133 |	Starting the second half of 2018
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:26,623	| IOT133 |	2019
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:31,487	| IOT133 |	The chip is just the beginning
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,047	| IOT133 |	Testing
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:36,095	| IOT133 |	But
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,911	| IOT133 |	Alright listening from excitement
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:40,703	| IOT133 |	Clarification
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,519	| IOT133 |	Weeks ago
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,543	| IOT133 |	We were talking about
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:45,055	| IOT133 |	Vehicle
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:48,639	| IOT133 |	Two vehicle vehicle infrastructure AKA
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:49,919	| IOT133 |	Vehicle to
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:51,967	| IOT133 |	And
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:54,271	| IOT133 |	We're talking about it
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,063	| IOT133 |	I don't remember why but you
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:57,599	| IOT133 |	Sunset Ford
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:04,255	| IOT133 |	Come on I got it I got an email from one of our
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,279	| IOT133 |	Smart
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:07,839	| IOT133 |	Conservators but you're actually all listening
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:10,399	| IOT133 |	That will call you listeners and
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,935	| IOT133 |	He pointed out
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:12,703	| IOT133 |	That
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:15,007	| IOT133 |	We were a little unclear so let's clear things up
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:16,031	| IOT133 |	He says there are two
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:18,335	| IOT133 |	Competing standards for v2ex
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,103	| IOT133 |	That is
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,639	| IOT133 |	802. 11p
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,431	| IOT133 |	Standard
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,711	| IOT133 |	Dedicated short-range
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:24,223	| IOT133 |	Communications
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:27,039	| IOT133 |	And that uses the attitude at 11 radio that we
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:28,831	| IOT133 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:30,879	| IOT133 |	An acellular
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,439	| IOT133 |	Cv2x
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:34,975	| IOT133 |	So
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:36,255	| IOT133 |	The cellular one is it
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:36,767	| IOT133 |	Variant of a
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:40,095	| IOT133 |	P
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:43,679	| IOT133 |	Wi-Fi and both of them are going to work in
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,191	| IOT133 |	Inseam
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,727	| IOT133 |	Spectrum
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,495	| IOT133 |	It's the five point
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,263	| IOT133 |	Gigahertz
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:48,031	| IOT133 |	So
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:49,823	| IOT133 |	Basically we're trying to figure out which one
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:51,615	| IOT133 |	And
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,639	| IOT133 |	Ideas
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:55,967	| IOT133 |	How are we going to do the infrastructure the cellular structures are
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:58,015	| IOT133 |	They're so maybe that makes sense
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,295	| IOT133 |	But WiFi
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:01,599	| IOT133 |	Paper license
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:03,647	| IOT133 |	You have to build infrastructure but then you could do it
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,415	| IOT133 |	If you want with it
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,951	| IOT133 |	So I want to say
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:09,023	| IOT133 |	Thank you I don't have permission to say who sent this to me
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,303	| IOT133 |	But thank you
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:12,351	| IOT133 |	Wonderful person who sent this to us in
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,119	| IOT133 |	Clarify this
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:15,167	| IOT133 |	We all know
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:16,703	| IOT133 |	Yeah I have no idea
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:22,847	| IOT133 |	Cv2x
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:25,663	| IOT133 |	Cars are coming with LTE
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:27,967	| IOT133 |	You can make them Wi-Fi hotspots as a result
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:29,759	| IOT133 |	Horsetails have Wi-Fi for that
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:38,975	| IOT133 |	Pick and choose my car based on a stereo
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:41,023	| IOT133 |	Yeah they're going to have to
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:41,535	| IOT133 |	Figure something
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:43,071	| IOT133 |	Cuz I don't
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:43,839	| IOT133 |	Drivers are not going to
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:48,703	| IOT133 |	Alright let's move on to my thoughts on
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:50,751	| IOT133 |	August Smart Lock
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:51,263	| IOT133 |	That has
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,055	| IOT133 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,103	| IOT133 |	Doorbell
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:58,175	| IOT133 |	IXL. August Smart Lock with Z-Wave
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,711	| IOT133 |	I've been traveling
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:01,247	| IOT133 |	Forever I'm traveling right now
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:02,271	| IOT133 |	It is hard to
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,295	| IOT133 |	Best home devices
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:06,367	| IOT133 |	Actually when you're traveling so it took me awhile to get the August Smart Lock
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,391	| IOT133 |	Installed
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,183	| IOT133 |	But
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:10,207	| IOT133 |	I'm happy to say
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:11,487	| IOT133 |	But if you like
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:12,767	| IOT133 |	The book of the August
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:15,327	| IOT133 |	This lock
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:16,095	| IOT133 |	0
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,119	| IOT133 |	Madeline
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,143	| IOT133 |	Yente
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:23,519	| IOT133 |	So I tested and all those things and it works and it's exciting
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:25,823	| IOT133 |	I don't know what else to say other than
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:26,847	| IOT133 |	Hey
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,383	| IOT133 |	Connect to locked it does a lot of cool
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:30,687	| IOT133 |	Now it is
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:32,479	| IOT133 |	Technically not a lot
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:36,575	| IOT133 |	It turns the deadbolt door lock stays the same so the install is super easy
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:37,855	| IOT133 |	I have some
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:38,623	| IOT133 |	Some glitches with the sauce
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,671	| IOT133 |	Are partly because I have
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:41,439	| IOT133 |	Tested song
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,719	| IOT133 |	August devices
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:44,511	| IOT133 |	It is hard for me to figure out
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:47,583	| IOT133 |	What account to put it under I apparently have 15
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,863	| IOT133 |	416 Augustine
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,399	| IOT133 |	Mount switches
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,679	| IOT133 |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,959	| IOT133 |	Hopefully you will not have that
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,263	| IOT133 |	I would think not
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:59,103	| IOT133 |	So how much is this one because it's the new August Smart Lock Pro + connect
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,407	| IOT133 |	Yes this is
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:02,943	| IOT133 |	279
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:03,711	| IOT133 |	But it also
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,015	| IOT133 |	A little
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:07,039	| IOT133 |	Bridge
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:09,087	| IOT133 |	That you plug in that gives you WiFi
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:14,207	| IOT133 |	It is a Bluetooth lock so if you want to do anything
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,231	| IOT133 |	You're going to be
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:18,047	| IOT133 |	I need the bridge to talk to the
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:20,607	| IOT133 |	A home can't work without the
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,887	| IOT133 |	But if you're buying is like you're getting a
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,423	| IOT133 |	Just don't even want
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:24,959	| IOT133 |	Now
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:27,263	| IOT133 |	They have a lot that is cheaper it is 149
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:30,847	| IOT133 |	I tell you this locked works very well it's Bluetooth and then
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:31,871	| IOT133 |	If you buy the
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,151	| IOT133 |	Connect Bridge
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,943	| IOT133 |	You can add the wifi to it
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,967	| IOT133 |	And what it is
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,015	| IOT133 |	Very substantial
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:39,551	| IOT133 |	Good lord it's so heavy
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:42,111	| IOT133 |	And boxes to the batteries is real
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:43,391	| IOT133 |	Easy
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,439	| IOT133 |	Doorsense which is
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:51,071	| IOT133 |	Basically the ability to censor that you stick on the side of the door and then it
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,607	| IOT133 |	Knows if the door
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:54,143	| IOT133 |	Close all the way
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,423	| IOT133 |	And so
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,447	| IOT133 |	Sometimes if you lock it
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:57,983	| IOT133 |	Door and you're gone
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:00,287	| IOT133 |	It can be locked
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,079	| IOT133 |	Not right
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:03,359	| IOT133 |	So this is how
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:05,919	| IOT133 |	Someone asked me if you could see
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:07,967	| IOT133 |	Dorset
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:13,599	| IOT133 |	I do not see it separately
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:17,440	| IOT133 |	S*** I'm curious though if you installed something like
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:19,232	| IOT133 |	Homebridge which is a little bit more
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:20,512	| IOT133 |	Simple
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:23,584	| IOT133 |	So I don't have her
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:24,608	| IOT133 |	Homebridge install
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:27,680	| IOT133 |	But I did not see it now
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,192	| IOT133 |	I could not use
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:29,728	| IOT133 |	Motion sensor
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,312	| IOT133 |	And this
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:39,456	| IOT133 |	Smart Lock the $149 one is not something you put over your existing deadbolt practices natural replacement
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:44,576	| IOT133 |	Really interesting I only say that because it looks
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:46,112	| IOT133 |	Bigger it has a bigger faceplate
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,160	| IOT133 |	I don't know why it
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:50,464	| IOT133 |	It's the same it doesn't have a deadbolt
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:52,256	| IOT133 |	Just
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,792	| IOT133 |	Mounts over your existing
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,072	| IOT133 |	Watch
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,632	| IOT133 |	It's
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:58,912	| IOT133 |	And it's not that
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,424	| IOT133 |	Traditional
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:01,728	| IOT133 |	August
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:04,032	| IOT133 |	And then if you like that circle look
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,824	| IOT133 |	You can still have it
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:07,872	| IOT133 |	And that will be there
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:10,176	| IOT133 |	The whole cat version / $200
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:11,200	| IOT133 |	You're like
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:12,992	| IOT133 |	I needed to talk to the echo
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:16,832	| IOT133 |	Keewaydin there
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:18,368	| IOT133 |	Lock that is Bluetooth
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:21,440	| IOT133 |	Wi-Fi ready so you still have to buy the bridge remote access
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,256	| IOT133 |	At that point you basically should just
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:28,608	| IOT133 |	That's
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:29,120	| IOT133 |	.
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:31,168	| IOT133 |	Now August also in
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:32,704	| IOT133 |	Doorbell
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:35,776	| IOT133 |	I bought the August doorbell
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:36,288	| IOT133 |	I hated it
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:38,336	| IOT133 |	It was the worst purchase I think I've ever
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:40,896	| IOT133 |	Cuz I have
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:43,200	| IOT133 |	After first and second worst
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,064	| IOT133 |	Bro
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:49,088	| IOT133 |	Couple Improvement
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,880	| IOT133 |	It now has
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,160	| IOT133 |	A light on it
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:56,000	| IOT133 |	Prior to this they actually did not have a light that you best in low light
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:56,768	| IOT133 |	Gamer setup
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:57,792	| IOT133 |	What if there was no light
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,840	| IOT133 |	You can see who is at your door
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:01,376	| IOT133 |	Which my husband would like
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:01,888	| IOT133 |	Dear killer
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,680	| IOT133 |	It wouldn't affect
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,448	| IOT133 |	Street lights
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:05,472	| IOT133 |	Your house you probably
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:09,824	| IOT133 |	But this has a flood light
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:12,896	| IOT133 |	It's very bright color HD video
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:13,664	| IOT133 |	In the dark
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:14,176	| IOT133 |	Yay
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,968	| IOT133 |	Here's where we get to the park
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:18,272	| IOT133 |	I have installed
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,576	| IOT133 |	Actually a dozen doorbells
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:22,112	| IOT133 |	House and I was
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:22,880	| IOT133 |	Because
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:24,928	| IOT133 |	The original August so terrible
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:27,744	| IOT133 |	And then I open this and I was hoping just to kind of
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:29,024	| IOT133 |	Slip it back on
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:30,048	| IOT133 |	Mounting plate
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:33,376	| IOT133 |	Different
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,400	| IOT133 |	Make it more reliable
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:35,168	| IOT133 |	And
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:37,984	| IOT133 |	So I was like okay so I took it off and then I realized
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:38,752	| IOT133 |	Schools on the mount
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,288	| IOT133 |	We're different
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:43,616	| IOT133 |	So I had to drill two new holes to install this thing
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:44,896	| IOT133 |	My house
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:45,920	| IOT133 |	And at that point
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:46,944	| IOT133 |	I was just build with
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:50,784	| IOT133 |	Wish I could I get I get the most people
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:51,552	| IOT133 |	Probably
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,576	| IOT133 |	What would be the first
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,600	| IOT133 |	Doorbell
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:54,368	| IOT133 |	Camera
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,904	| IOT133 |	So this is your fruit so
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:58,464	| IOT133 |	If you want to upgrade from the original August
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:01,024	| IOT133 |	I'm just warning you that you're just going to have to
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,048	| IOT133 |	Bust out your drill again
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:03,584	| IOT133 |	Put the holes in it
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,352	| IOT133 |	Difference
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:06,656	| IOT133 |	Existing holes are hidden
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:08,704	| IOT133 |	But I still hate the fact that my
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,496	| IOT133 |	Looks like Swiss cheese
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:13,312	| IOT133 |	Can I have two dispatching
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,592	| IOT133 |	But that's me
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:15,360	| IOT133 |	That's not everybody
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:17,408	| IOT133 |	Unless you try out a lot of doorbells
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:22,784	| IOT133 |	So the doorbell works much better
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:23,552	| IOT133 |	It is
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:24,320	| IOT133 |	Probably
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:27,648	| IOT133 |	I only tested it a little bit before I left so I want to do some more
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:29,952	| IOT133 |	Is way more responsive
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,232	| IOT133 |	Faster
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,024	| IOT133 |	Quite a bit of
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:35,840	| IOT133 |	So sometimes there was a little
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:39,424	| IOT133 |	Consistency it was about the same as what I felt with the original ring
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:41,216	| IOT133 |	The ring Pro is actually better
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:43,776	| IOT133 |	And I think the ring Pro is probably a better
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,056	| IOT133 |	Doorbell to this
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:47,872	| IOT133 |	And both of them have a subscription fee
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:49,408	| IOT133 |	So I kind of wood error
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:50,688	| IOT133 |	Preside
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:52,992	| IOT133 |	Unless you just like the look
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:53,504	| IOT133 |	This one
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:56,064	| IOT133 |	Go for it cuz it is so unique looking
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:57,344	| IOT133 |	College Square
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,952	| IOT133 |	That is my
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,464	| IOT133 |	August
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:05,024	| IOT133 |	I'm still very bitter about it
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:12,192	| IOT133 |	Yes they say there's one in her door just like I don't want Bridges and hubs in my house
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:12,704	| IOT133 |	There we go
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:13,984	| IOT133 |	So

EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:37,792	| IOT133 |	This week's question
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:38,304	| IOT133 |	Comes from
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:39,584	| IOT133 |	Sally
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:44,192	| IOT133 |	Hi my name is Sally and I have a question about using my Sonos Play 1
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:47,520	| IOT133 |	With If This Then That app and wondering if there's a way to
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:48,544	| IOT133 |	Connect with you
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:53,152	| IOT133 |	So that when my August Smart Lock unlock my home my Sonos to turn onto my purse
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:58,016	| IOT133 |	I'd love to find out if there's a way that I can link this last piece of technology and with
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:00,576	| IOT133 |	If this then that internet thing but I have happen
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,088	| IOT133 |	Thank you
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:03,648	| IOT133 |	Okay Sally I have
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:08,000	| IOT133 |	The bad news is we can't do it
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,280	| IOT133 |	What's he want us to do
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,304	| IOT133 |	So
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:10,816	| IOT133 |	List
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,096	| IOT133 |	Doesn't work
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:12,864	| IOT133 |	Directly with some
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:14,912	| IOT133 |	That's okay that's okay
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:16,192	| IOT133 |	Cuz we found two
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:18,496	| IOT133 |	Alternatives What alternative
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:20,800	| IOT133 |	It's going to SmartThings that requires a hub
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:21,568	| IOT133 |	So we were like
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:24,896	| IOT133 |	And SmartThings also requires you to have the August lock with Z-Wave
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:27,200	| IOT133 |	So we kind of just automatically cut that out
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:28,224	| IOT133 |	Cuz we're not sure if you have
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:29,760	| IOT133 |	Latest August lock
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,296	| IOT133 |	But
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:32,832	| IOT133 |	You don't have to do any of that because
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:35,136	| IOT133 |	You can download a free software app called
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:35,904	| IOT133 |	Do you know me
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,928	| IOT133 |	That's why I O
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,208	| IOT133 |	Am I
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:39,744	| IOT133 |	And that work
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,280	| IOT133 |	With August locks
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:42,560	| IOT133 |	And it works
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:43,328	| IOT133 |	Solosis
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:46,400	| IOT133 |	Especially very similar to
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:49,472	| IOT133 |	Create routine
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:52,800	| IOT133 |	So the same thing just using a different tool
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:55,104	| IOT133 |	And my favorite part about it is
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:57,152	| IOT133 |	You can actually set
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:57,920	| IOT133 |	Limits
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:58,944	| IOT133 |	So I went in
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:26:59,968	| IOT133 |	Do you know me
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:03,040	| IOT133 |	Started doing this because I was like
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:04,576	| IOT133 |	Me at every time you unlock
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:06,368	| IOT133 |	Your tour if your Sonos plays
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,392	| IOT133 |	Your favorite
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:09,696	| IOT133 |	You're going to suddenly like the time you come
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,720	| IOT133 |	I'm home at midnight
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:13,024	| IOT133 |	And your I don't know if you live with people you live with people
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:16,864	| IOT133 |	The time you coming home at midnight it starts Blair and you know Joan Jett or something
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:18,656	| IOT133 |	Your phone is going to be mad at you
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:19,424	| IOT133 |	I know
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,192	| IOT133 |	Because this has happened
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:23,008	| IOT133 |	So what you basically can do is
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:25,824	| IOT133 |	You can say when something happens
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:27,616	| IOT133 |	The August door unlocks
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:31,456	| IOT133 |	Run this action so I had mind saying the kitchen Sonos
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:33,760	| IOT133 |	Take a couple option
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:35,296	| IOT133 |	And I had to play throwback Thursday
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:40,160	| IOT133 |	So I said only if it's before 10
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:40,928	| IOT133 |	10 p.m.
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:43,488	| IOT133 |	And then you could even also say and only if
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,256	| IOT133 |	I'm there
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,280	| IOT133 |	In the important
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:46,048	| IOT133 |	Part about that
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:49,120	| IOT133 |	It will only do it for you based on
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:49,888	| IOT133 |	Can your phone be
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:51,424	| IOT133 |	They're so
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,704	| IOT133 |	Your husband comes home
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,472	| IOT133 |	When you're not home
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:53,984	| IOT133 |	It's not
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:55,264	| IOT133 |	And I don't know
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:57,312	| IOT133 |	Is someone else
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:59,616	| IOT133 |	Sometime I realized
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:06,272	| IOT133 |	And
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:06,784	| IOT133 |	You're not home
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:08,832	| IOT133 |	Which I think is
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:14,464	| IOT133 |	Customizable
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:15,744	| IOT133 |	If you live alone
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:18,304	| IOT133 |	Fine but I always find it
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,608	| IOT133 |	Really fails
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:22,144	| IOT133 |	When you start adding other people in
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:24,448	| IOT133 |	So I'm always looking
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:28,032	| IOT133 |	Welcome to my world
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,800	| IOT133 |	Is it
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:29,824	| IOT133 |	Goalie challenge
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,384	| IOT133 |	It's just me

EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:32,800	| IOT133 |	Breaking into the Internet of Things podcast with a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:39,200	| IOT133 |	This week sponsor is Qualcomm and once again I have Raj talluri here he is the SVP
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:40,480	| IOT133 |	And GM of iot
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:44,832	| IOT133 |	We talked a lot about cameras when we talk about the internet
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:46,880	| IOT133 |	Why is it so important
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:48,928	| IOT133 |	Or such a good opportune
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:53,280	| IOT133 |	The cameras are becoming an increasingly important part of
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,048	| IOT133 |	Different diets
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:56,352	| IOT133 |	Because now the camera
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:30:01,472	| IOT133 |	To do a lot of interesting features that help consumers like facial recognition objective
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:02,496	| IOT133 |	Malaysian people
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:05,568	| IOT133 |	So you are not going to be seeing cameras
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:07,104	| IOT133 |	Things like
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:10,944	| IOT133 |	Spend a tell you your pie is baked or not end security cable TV
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:11,968	| IOT133 |	Cameras that I
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:14,528	| IOT133 |	Actually you can take out your house and some strangers come
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:16,320	| IOT133 |	And also 360 degree cameras
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:18,368	| IOT133 |	Where are you now able to record a concert
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:22,208	| IOT133 |	And send it back though someone was not in the concert
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:22,976	| IOT133 |	Can watch
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:24,256	| IOT133 |	Aviara
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:27,840	| IOT133 |	Awesome cool, is well-known for smartphone
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:31,424	| IOT133 |	So how applicable is the phone camera
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:31,936	| IOT133 |	Back in the intern
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:39,104	| IOT133 |	Smartphone cameras really fantastic now they've done a lot of work in making these cameras better and better
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:41,408	| IOT133 |	Most people now just take the
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:42,432	| IOT133 |	Pictures of this month
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:46,272	| IOT133 |	And I really a great source of camera animation
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:47,808	| IOT133 |	Dab dab sensing
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:49,088	| IOT133 |	Multiple cameras
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:50,880	| IOT133 |	Ultra HD recording and so on
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:54,208	| IOT133 |	Sadistic Knology is actually very applicable to iot
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:55,744	| IOT133 |	Because we're not able to
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:57,792	| IOT133 |	Use the smartphone camera gorgeous
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:31:00,096	| IOT133 |	You actually got to work this kind of
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:00,864	| IOT133 |	Innovations
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:01,888	| IOT133 |	Into lots of other cameras
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:04,704	| IOT133 |	Example into home monitor
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:05,728	| IOT133 |	Security cameras
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:06,752	| IOT133 |	Action camera
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,520	| IOT133 |	Wearable camera
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:09,568	| IOT133 |	The beijinger technology applies
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:14,432	| IOT133 |	Sue Qualcomm customers they're just putting smartphone as Oh Sees into these cameras
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:17,248	| IOT133 |	What is one more than that what we do now is
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:19,040	| IOT133 |	To take the technology that we have developed
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:21,600	| IOT133 |	Smartphone camera button customized
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:23,136	| IOT133 |	For the various iot applique
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,416	| IOT133 |	So for example
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:26,208	| IOT133 |	The security cameras require
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:32,608	| IOT133 |	Start the amount of low light performance because these cameras installed where you know the light can go down to like one lumen
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:34,400	| IOT133 |	Until then you'll have to use things like infrared
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:37,216	| IOT133 |	So we are doing a lot of modifications
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:38,496	| IOT133 |	And a lot of innovation
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:44,384	| IOT133 |	Top of a camera technology that we built in phone space to make them more applicable to this kind of tired
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:46,944	| IOT133 |	So what's out there that
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:47,968	| IOT133 |	Currently using
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:48,480	| IOT133 |	Call contact
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:52,576	| IOT133 |	So the new nest camera you just said welcome technology
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:57,184	| IOT133 |	In that has built-in smartphone camera adapter to home security cameras
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:58,464	| IOT133 |	Rico recently
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:00,512	| IOT133 |	Introduce a typha a newt
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:01,280	| IOT133 |	Eataly
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,816	| IOT133 |	360 degree camera
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:04,352	| IOT133 |	The fuses are snapdragons
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,632	| IOT133 |	625 processor
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,912	| IOT133 |	But this is actually at 3
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:07,936	| IOT133 |	60 degree camera
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:09,216	| IOT133 |	Peacocks in 4k
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:13,056	| IOT133 |	Another example of how we were able to adapt and modify the Snapdragon
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,616	| IOT133 |	Camera technology for the consumer 360
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:17,920	| IOT133 |	That is an awesome camera
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:22,016	| IOT133 |	So we're can listeners learn more and get started using Qualcomm
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:22,528	| IOT133 |	Products for camera
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:26,112	| IOT133 |	Ulysses can go to qualcomm.com iot
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:27,648	| IOT133 |	And look for the camera section
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:28,416	| IOT133 |	It's a lot of
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,184	| IOT133 |	Information
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:35,328	| IOT133 |	About technology and diet
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:45,568	| IOT133 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Tony
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:48,128	| IOT133 |	CPL who is the CEO of vitamin
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:50,432	| IOT133 |	Hi Tony how are you doing today
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:52,480	| IOT133 |	I'm doing great Stacy nice to be here with you
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:56,320	| IOT133 |	Man I am super excited one because I love my Vitamix
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:58,112	| IOT133 |	Everyday I use it into
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:32:59,648	| IOT133 |	Because if I can make it smarter
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:04,000	| IOT133 |	I feel like I might be a healthier better person so let's talk about what you guys are doing to make Vitamix
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:09,376	| IOT133 |	Grout Stacy we're very excited because the first of the year we launched a new
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:11,936	| IOT133 |	Platform of products called the ascent series
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:16,800	| IOT133 |	And this new Ascent series really redefines hype
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:17,568	| IOT133 |	Performance blending
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:19,360	| IOT133 |	Form and Function
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:22,688	| IOT133 |	So for a long time the Aesthetics of our blender
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:24,736	| IOT133 |	People would say it's not that aesthetic
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:26,272	| IOT133 |	Replacing so we did it
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:29,344	| IOT133 |	Total redesign of the product and it has new
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:31,904	| IOT133 |	Euro curvilinear lines
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:34,208	| IOT133 |	And very high-tech
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:36,512	| IOT133 |	Aesthetics that people would be very proud to
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:39,840	| IOT133 |	Kitchen counter think of it as kitchen candy if you
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:45,216	| IOT133 |	The more exciting to that is the way this new technology integrates not just the
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:47,008	| IOT133 |	The form but with the new function
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:48,544	| IOT133 |	And it's a query
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:50,848	| IOT133 |	Invented our whole Vitamix platformer
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:55,712	| IOT133 |	Historic operating system within our blunder was a singular operating system
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:57,760	| IOT133 |	And now the new system has five different
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:01,344	| IOT133 |	Operating systems like
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:03,136	| IOT133 |	Actual software or like things
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:03,648	| IOT133 |	It does help me
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:10,560	| IOT133 |	Yes it actual software that's system that's kind of controlling how the motor runs a system that is controlling
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:13,120	| IOT133 |	Doing the program's system that stalking
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:14,400	| IOT133 |	From the base to the
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:14,912	| IOT133 |	The container
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:17,472	| IOT133 |	Assistant it stalking for the unit
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:18,496	| IOT133 |	2 apps
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:20,032	| IOT133 |	In a system around security
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:22,080	| IOT133 |	Because we wouldn't want anyone to hack our blender
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:22,592	| IOT133 |	By the way
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:25,408	| IOT133 |	That's true cuz sometimes I reach in there and that would be
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:29,504	| IOT133 |	Okay so the blender is connected
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:30,784	| IOT133 |	To the internet and to your
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:37,696	| IOT133 |	Just let me clarify little bit so we have a number of new technological advances that are part of the redefinition of the
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:38,976	| IOT133 |	The function of the unit
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:43,584	| IOT133 |	The first one that I'll highlight is the use of near field communication
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:44,608	| IOT133 |	Can NFC
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:48,192	| IOT133 |	Which is all around detecting the container
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:50,496	| IOT133 |	And so the new line of products
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:52,032	| IOT133 |	You can run an 8 oz
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:52,800	| IOT133 |	A 20 oz
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:59,200	| IOT133 |	48 oz a 64 Oz and even some new things in the future and the unit will automatically sense
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:03,040	| IOT133 |	Do near field communication the blender base what is on it
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,832	| IOT133 |	8 oz 20 oz 40 an ounce
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:06,368	| IOT133 |	And it will reprogram
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,904	| IOT133 |	It's also all the programs
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:10,720	| IOT133 |	Operate with that appropriate size container
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:13,024	| IOT133 |	Got it okay so the recipes and everything
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:13,792	| IOT133 |	Can then be adapt
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:17,376	| IOT133 |	That's exactly right so for example you wouldn't
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:20,192	| IOT133 |	Want to make soup in an 8 oz container might
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:21,728	| IOT133 |	Not be a safe thing to do so
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:24,288	| IOT133 |	Will limit the recipes that can be done in the 8 oz
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:27,616	| IOT133 |	Sounds like wise if you're doing a 40 an ounce or 64 Oz
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:28,896	| IOT133 |	The way that programmed
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:29,920	| IOT133 |	Develops in terms of it
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:31,200	| IOT133 |	It's ramp and speed
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:32,224	| IOT133 |	Induration
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:33,504	| IOT133 |	Will be different than it is
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:34,016	| IOT133 |	It is 60
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:38,624	| IOT133 |	All right so let's talk about what connectivity enables you to do
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:39,392	| IOT133 |	As a company both
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:43,232	| IOT133 |	Consumer services and then also as somebody who makes
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:44,256	| IOT133 |	Really high powered
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:47,584	| IOT133 |	Crazy blenders so just to talk a little more about that connectivity
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:53,216	| IOT133 |	Each of our units in addition to having NFC or near field communication on board
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:54,240	| IOT133 |	They also have Bluetooth
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:57,568	| IOT133 |	And this enables the blender to work in conjunction with the
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:36:04,480	| IOT133 |	So currently we have an app called the Vitamix perfect scale which is a scale that can detect which container
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:07,040	| IOT133 |	It comes with an app that has over 500 recipe
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:09,600	| IOT133 |	And once you put the container on the scale
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:10,880	| IOT133 |	Zero's out
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:12,928	| IOT133 |	The container and now you can build a recipe
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:13,952	| IOT133 |	With no measuring tool
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:16,768	| IOT133 |	And it will automatically take
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:18,560	| IOT133 |	That recipe and
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:21,888	| IOT133 |	Send a program to the blender that's appropriate for that recipe
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:23,168	| IOT133 |	That's what we've been doing since
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:25,984	| IOT133 |	The first of the year we're about to launch our new app
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:28,544	| IOT133 |	It's going to be with our new platform
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,056	| IOT133 |	The sensor
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:32,128	| IOT133 |	And this new app comes with 17
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:32,640	| IOT133 |	Program
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:35,456	| IOT133 |	So if you have any unit that has no programs like
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:39,296	| IOT133 |	Peanut butter or frozen dessert or soup or one of the big favorites
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:42,880	| IOT133 |	That everyone has self cleaning it will automatically take that you
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:44,416	| IOT133 |	And send that program
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:45,696	| IOT133 |	To the blender this is
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:48,256	| IOT133 |	What will help people be much more successful
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:49,792	| IOT133 |	The app also includes
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:51,584	| IOT133 |	500 recipes
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:53,120	| IOT133 |	And you can scale the rest
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:56,192	| IOT133 |	Recipes either by volume or by calories
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:37:02,336	| IOT133 |	Show picture of your finger going up and down kind of scaling recipe Sally 120 ounces I really don't want 32
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:08,736	| IOT133 |	It will on the Fly we can't calculate all the nutritional information and display it for you or send it to your nutrition
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:10,528	| IOT133 |	No app and then it will recalculate
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:12,320	| IOT133 |	The program to blend
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:13,600	| IOT133 |	Tencent
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:14,624	| IOT133 |	The unique
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:16,160	| IOT133 |	Program for what you just caliber
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:18,208	| IOT133 |	To the blender and blend it
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:23,584	| IOT133 |	Awesome so it also sends that you mentioned something that was really exciting to me that it sent it to the lake my nutritional accounting
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:25,888	| IOT133 |	Is that so you guys are working
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:28,192	| IOT133 |	With everyone or is that like an open standard Zephyr
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:33,824	| IOT133 |	Yes we have an Open Standards effort that connects to a number of different apps right now but we're open to connect with anyone
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:40,736	| IOT133 |	And we are doing that now in addition the app includes meal plans so you can create meal plans for yourself it'll create
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:46,368	| IOT133 |	Create shopping list and probably in the not too near future will generate your grocery order and maybe even placed
EDL	00:37:47,136	00:37:51,232	| IOT133 |	Very exciting and ambitious so how does all of this connectivity
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,536	| IOT133 |	And Technology bit into the Vitamix
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:56,096	| IOT133 |	Vitamix is purple
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:57,376	| IOT133 |	Is 2
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:37:58,144	| IOT133 |	Liberate
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:37:59,168	| IOT133 |	And nourish
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:38:00,704	| IOT133 |	Your zest for life
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:05,312	| IOT133 |	So the liberate part is really to reinvent the way you currently prepare food and beverage
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:08,640	| IOT133 |	And change the way you do it make it much easier and faster
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:11,712	| IOT133 |	The nearest part is really we're interested in making you high
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:13,504	| IOT133 |	And your zest
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:19,904	| IOT133 |	Your life is our customers they live with gusto and with that what we want to do is help them achieve
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,672	| IOT133 |	Their goals
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:22,208	| IOT133 |	If you won't think about their in the process
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:24,000	| IOT133 |	Exploration in
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:25,024	| IOT133 |	Transformation
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:27,584	| IOT133 |	And so we consider ourselves a transformational
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:30,912	| IOT133 |	We want to help people get to where they want to go
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:31,936	| IOT133 |	We want to make them
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:32,960	| IOT133 |	A better me if you
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:39,616	| IOT133 |	Whatever that might be for some it might be a mom who really wants to give her children the most nutritional diet that Sheikh
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:40,640	| IOT133 |	A healthy snack
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:46,272	| IOT133 |	For others it might be a high-performance athlete that wants to reach his Peak Performance or her Peak
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:49,088	| IOT133 |	Performance Brothers they might be a foodie and they want to
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:49,856	| IOT133 |	Create
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:50,624	| IOT133 |	Dish
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:54,720	| IOT133 |	That will really impress their friends when they entertain on a Friday or Saturday night
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:56,256	| IOT133 |	And so we build track
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:58,816	| IOT133 |	Within our app within
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:39:01,632	| IOT133 |	The way we map the customer Journey
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:03,424	| IOT133 |	To help people be successful
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:07,008	| IOT133 |	And as we go forward as a company it's all about being intuitive
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:09,056	| IOT133 |	What do we need to do
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:10,592	| IOT133 |	Help people reach their goal
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:13,664	| IOT133 |	We don't have to be intuitive cuz you're going to get a lot of
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:20,064	| IOT133 |	Data so let's talk about how you guys want to use that data to build better products but also maybe I don't know this
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:23,136	| IOT133 |	I had my blender forever and it's never broken down knock on something
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:25,184	| IOT133 |	So what else does that do for
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:27,488	| IOT133 |	So is it company
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:30,048	| IOT133 |	We pay a lot of attention to what
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:35,168	| IOT133 |	Our customers do both here and around the world we sell our products and 140 different countries
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:37,216	| IOT133 |	For example we track
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:40,032	| IOT133 |	Blender usage in 9 countries every month
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:44,640	| IOT133 |	Both what people make in home away from and what ingredients they use how often
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:45,920	| IOT133 |	And what they buy away from
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:47,712	| IOT133 |	And where they buy it
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:48,736	| IOT133 |	And what do they buy what
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:52,576	| IOT133 |	The commercial side wework the largest chains in the world
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:53,344	| IOT133 |	And so
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:56,672	| IOT133 |	We're constantly bringing them ideas on menu creation
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:57,440	| IOT133 |	So
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:58,464	| IOT133 |	When we know that
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:00,256	| IOT133 |	New ingredients are popping up
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:01,280	| IOT133 |	Buy turmeric
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:03,072	| IOT133 |	Caffeine
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:05,120	| IOT133 |	Our customers are typically early adapter
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:07,680	| IOT133 |	And so when they start putting these things in
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:09,216	| IOT133 |	And we can bring these ideas
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:11,520	| IOT133 |	To the major chains and say look this is where
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:12,800	| IOT133 |	Menus are going
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:19,200	| IOT133 |	Likewise for recipe development for the household we start developing recipes around what we are seeing people use
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:20,224	| IOT133 |	With regard to Ingrid
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:23,040	| IOT133 |	We're garnering a lot of information
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:24,320	| IOT133 |	2 hour Vitamix
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:30,720	| IOT133 |	Perfect Scale app where we Now understand what's actually happening during the day how often people are
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:31,488	| IOT133 |	Making a smoothie
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:32,512	| IOT133 |	What day park
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:34,048	| IOT133 |	Soups
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:35,328	| IOT133 |	Frozen desserts
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,864	| IOT133 |	And it's very insightful
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:39,680	| IOT133 |	How to know what people are making what ingredients are using
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:42,752	| IOT133 |	What day Parts they're doing and we use that to influence
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:44,032	| IOT133 |	What we created
EDL	00:40:44,032	00:40:45,824	| IOT133 |	In terms of the experience within the app
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:47,104	| IOT133 |	And the recipes.
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:49,408	| IOT133 |	Could you sell that data I would
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:52,480	| IOT133 |	Like if I were like Campbell's I would be really interested in like
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:54,528	| IOT133 |	What's the trend in healthy soups
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:55,552	| IOT133 |	So I can make some
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:41:00,160	| IOT133 |	I suppose that's possible that's not really our aspiration we do it primarily just
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:04,256	| IOT133 |	Insights in terms of the macro Trends and where things are going
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:10,400	| IOT133 |	We don't even have the ability to look at it on an individual basis we look at it in macro terms
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:12,960	| IOT133 |	And we look at the trends and then we use those
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:14,752	| IOT133 |	To direct kind of where we go.
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:21,152	| IOT133 |	Directions a lot of people talk about the monetization of data I'm not sure anybody is actually doing it and it's
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:22,688	| IOT133 |	It's not something that's a high priority for
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:24,992	| IOT133 |	Building a connected product
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:26,016	| IOT133 |	Can be super dangerous
EDL	00:41:26,016	00:41:26,784	| IOT133 |	Because there's a
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:28,064	| IOT133 |	Security risk
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:29,600	| IOT133 |	But there's also this
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:31,648	| IOT133 |	Does the customer really want
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:34,464	| IOT133 |	That's so how did you guys approach the idea of bringing
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:36,000	| IOT133 |	Intelligence into
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:36,768	| IOT133 |	Something that work really well
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:40,352	| IOT133 |	We have a very robust business insights team
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:46,240	| IOT133 |	And they do various types of qualitative and quantitative research as well as ethnography
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:49,568	| IOT133 |	Epic research so we spent a lot of time in people's homes
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:53,407	| IOT133 |	We spent a lot of times with shafts both in fine restaurants in large chain
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:56,479	| IOT133 |	And we really understand how they use the prop
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:42:00,319	| IOT133 |	And then we create our controls we can
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:05,695	| IOT133 |	Create are apps the whole experience around the way people really use the product and what's most of
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:07,743	| IOT133 |	All right and
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:09,023	| IOT133 |	One of the challenges of building a
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:10,303	| IOT133 |	Product is
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:12,863	| IOT133 |	Suddenly you got this thing that might last for
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:16,447	| IOT133 |	7 years or 10 years out on someone's counter that's going to constantly need to be
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:17,471	| IOT133 |	Updated
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:18,495	| IOT133 |	Costs associated with
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:20,287	| IOT133 |	How did you guys think about
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:24,127	| IOT133 |	How to price it and how to think about that bring that aspect into your business
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:30,527	| IOT133 |	I'm glad you asked that because Vitamix typically Vitamix owners consider their blender Vitamix blender is
EDL	00:42:30,527	00:42:36,927	| IOT133 |	Asian heirloom that they're going to pass on from generation to generation and so we spent a lot of time thinking about that and that was one of them
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:40,511	| IOT133 |	Main reasons why we put Bluetooth technology into are Prada
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:42,303	| IOT133 |	So that in the future
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:46,399	| IOT133 |	I downloaded Vitamix app that the most current APP can actually update
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:48,447	| IOT133 |	Your blender just like a Tesla can be
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:55,615	| IOT133 |	And so that's the infrastructure that we put in place is one of the operating systems that I talked about earlier and one that we're copping
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:43:00,479	| IOT133 |	Didn't that are Vitamix owners you know will well into the future still have that heirloom quality
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:04,319	| IOT133 |	An heirloom type of perspective about a product and it will be able to be up to
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:09,951	| IOT133 |	Awesome alright Tony thanks so much was really nice having this opportunity to chat with you
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:16,863	| IOT133 |	That's all for this week's Internet of Things podcast remember if you want more iot news
