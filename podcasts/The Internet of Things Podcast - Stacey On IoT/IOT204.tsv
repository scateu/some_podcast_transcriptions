EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:53,664	| IOT204 |	Kevin
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:55,456	| IOT204 |	Let's get this started with
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:56,736	| IOT204 |	Apple
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,272	| IOT204 |	Yay
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:00,576	| IOT204 |	Some exciting news that's been coming dribbling out
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:02,880	| IOT204 |	The last well feet look like
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:05,440	| IOT204 |	For a while but in the last week
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:07,744	| IOT204 |	Week or so we saw a couple of news announcer
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:09,536	| IOT204 |	It's one was that Sam
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:11,840	| IOT204 |	Jadallah who was actually the founder of
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,376	| IOT204 |	Be Auto Smart
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,144	| IOT204 |	I don't know if
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,680	| IOT204 |	You guys remember I definitely talk
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:18,240	| IOT204 |	It was a $700
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:19,520	| IOT204 |	Connected locks
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:20,288	| IOT204 |	It came out
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,568	| IOT204 |	All maybe a year
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:24,640	| IOT204 |	2 years ago is hugely expensive very pretty
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:26,432	| IOT204 |	Very substantial but Doom
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:27,456	| IOT204 |	And then
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:29,504	| IOT204 |	So he's going to work it out
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:30,528	| IOT204 |	Apple now in there
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,296	| IOT204 |	Home division
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:33,088	| IOT204 |	What also is ham
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,392	| IOT204 |	John giannandrea
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:37,184	| IOT204 |	Has been promoted to the execu
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:38,720	| IOT204 |	And
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:41,280	| IOT204 |	They also pushed out series voices
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,584	| IOT204 |	Jan Andreas
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:44,864	| IOT204 |	Come to Apple
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:45,888	| IOT204 |	Calls from Google
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,424	| IOT204 |	And he was in charge of some of their AI
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:48,960	| IOT204 |	People
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:49,472	| IOT204 |	Believe
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,008	| IOT204 |	Help AppleCare
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:51,776	| IOT204 |	Gain some ground
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,056	| IOT204 |	Because for a while
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:54,336	| IOT204 |	If not been awesome
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,152	| IOT204 |	Jean Andrea was
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,432	| IOT204 |	Google Drive machine learning
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,968	| IOT204 |	Now he's apples SBP
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:02,016	| IOT204 |	Key of machine learning and AI strategy
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,296	| IOT204 |	He reports directly to 10
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:05,344	| IOT204 |	Tim Cook that was a change that happened
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:08,160	| IOT204 |	And so basically what we're seeing is the elevation at app
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:09,952	| IOT204 |	Of AI and machine
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,744	| IOT204 |	To be a more critic
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:15,584	| IOT204 |	Which is much later than its competitors I would say
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,376	| IOT204 |	Yes so
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,144	| IOT204 |	Also
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:18,656	| IOT204 |	Apple just
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:20,960	| IOT204 |	Pull string technology
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:21,984	| IOT204 |	Which
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,264	| IOT204 |	Used to be a company called
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:24,288	| IOT204 |	Boy talk
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,568	| IOT204 |	Wispies for her
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:27,360	| IOT204 |	Pixar Executives whenever I think
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:27,872	| IOT204 |	Pixar I have
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,968	| IOT204 |	There's synergies there there
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,992	| IOT204 |	Executive back
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:35,040	| IOT204 |	Fourth I think Toy Story but okay
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,320	| IOT204 |	Yes okay
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,600	| IOT204 |	But
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:39,136	| IOT204 |	Toytalk what they did
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:41,184	| IOT204 |	And what pull string does is
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:44,256	| IOT204 |	The idea was to create a compelling narrative
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,792	| IOT204 |	A voice generated narrative
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,840	| IOT204 |	Around in a relationship
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,144	| IOT204 |	So it was designed
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:51,680	| IOT204 |	Orchids initially
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:54,496	| IOT204 |	And they were going to build basically toys
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,264	| IOT204 |	License search
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,288	| IOT204 |	Technology to Twin maker
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:58,848	| IOT204 |	So kids could create a relationship
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,384	| IOT204 |	Around
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,152	| IOT204 |	Barbie
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:03,200	| IOT204 |	Aurora Disney character toy or whatever
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:04,224	| IOT204 |	And they did do that
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:07,040	| IOT204 |	That is true
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:10,880	| IOT204 |	Write that hello Barbie doll is you know power bi
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,416	| IOT204 |	Clustering technology
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:14,720	| IOT204 |	So with all this everyone's like
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:15,744	| IOT204 |	Apples moving beyond the knife
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:16,768	| IOT204 |	Which makes sense
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,047	| IOT204 |	Here's what I think is
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,583	| IOT204 |	I think Apple
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:20,607	| IOT204 |	Pause moving beyond the eye
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,631	| IOT204 |	IPhone into
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:23,935	| IOT204 |	And there's a couple reasons I thing
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,727	| IOT204 |	One apple has said
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,263	| IOT204 |	Hookah said that health
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,287	| IOT204 |	Where will be the biggest thing
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:30,335	| IOT204 |	Apple has to offer Humanity
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:33,151	| IOT204 |	What Apple has bought a succession of companies
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,431	| IOT204 |	Give medical quality
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:37,503	| IOT204 |	You see it with the Apple watch
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,015	| IOT204 |	And
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:41,087	| IOT204 |	Since Apple was never really awesome at the
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:41,855	| IOT204 |	Cloud
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:43,391	| IOT204 |	And critic services
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:47,743	| IOT204 |	I think this is an area where it can take things that were a weakness and turn them into a straw
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,791	| IOT204 |	Apple's data privacy
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:51,327	| IOT204 |	That is basically it hurting
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,631	| IOT204 |	It's bugs into a feature that
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,935	| IOT204 |	But it's actually really good feature
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,983	| IOT204 |	And I have talked about this
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,031	| IOT204 |	So there's that ass
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:02,591	| IOT204 |	But there's a lot of pets showing Apple doing so cool
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:04,127	| IOT204 |	Eggs and I think
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:06,175	| IOT204 |	If you pull all of that together
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,223	| IOT204 |	When I talk to doctors
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:10,271	| IOT204 |	About telemedicine and
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,039	| IOT204 |	And home health monitor
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:12,319	| IOT204 |	Coyote
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:12,831	| IOT204 |	Etsy need a couple
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:18,207	| IOT204 |	You need reproducibility and Trust in the actual data underlying
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:18,719	| IOT204 |	This device
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,511	| IOT204 |	So you have to know the
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,279	| IOT204 |	This is not
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,047	| IOT204 |	Digital snake
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:24,095	| IOT204 |	Right you have to know this is a real
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:26,399	| IOT204 |	Possible benefit in this has to be proven and tested
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,191	| IOT204 |	Apple will take
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:31,007	| IOT204 |	We seen it already with their efforts
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:33,311	| IOT204 |	For the Apple watch and afib it's things like
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,079	| IOT204 |	Like that
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:34,847	| IOT204 |	2
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:38,175	| IOT204 |	The products have to be easy to use doctors cannot
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:38,943	| IOT204 |	Tell
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:40,735	| IOT204 |	A 60 year old
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:41,503	| IOT204 |	Percent
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,271	| IOT204 |	Go home
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:44,063	| IOT204 |	And by this connected to Bluetooth
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,343	| IOT204 |	Like it is hard
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,879	| IOT204 |	For someone to get like
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:47,647	| IOT204 |	A connected blood
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,975	| IOT204 |	Okay that is actually for many of our listeners
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,255	| IOT204 |	It's pretty easy to set up
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:53,535	| IOT204 |	That's actually not easy
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:56,095	| IOT204 |	Is there any product in the medical
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,631	| IOT204 |	Well has to be easy to
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,167	| IOT204 |	Use apple is wonderful
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:00,959	| IOT204 |	3
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:04,031	| IOT204 |	Medical technology has historically been scared
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,311	| IOT204 |	It's felt like
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:06,591	| IOT204 |	Analogy but if you
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,127	| IOT204 |	Apple's history
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:08,895	| IOT204 |	With
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:12,991	| IOT204 |	The iPhone and making technology approachable and you think about things like
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:13,503	| IOT204 |	Buying
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:14,783	| IOT204 |	Pull string
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:15,807	| IOT204 |	And some of their other
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,087	| IOT204 |	Positions
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:19,647	| IOT204 |	Baked make technology very warm
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,415	| IOT204 |	And friendly
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:22,463	| IOT204 |	In their medical devices which will make
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,487	| IOT204 |	People want to use it
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,791	| IOT204 |	I think of Apple in medical
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,583	| IOT204 |	I think it's something like I don't know if you
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:29,631	| IOT204 |	Remember I saw the master of none
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,143	| IOT204 |	Episode
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,447	| IOT204 |	Japanese robotic seal
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,983	| IOT204 |	Do you know what I'm talking about Kevin
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,519	| IOT204 |	I didn't say it
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,543	| IOT204 |	Sorry
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,103	| IOT204 |	The sea was called
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:39,871	| IOT204 |	Pero it's
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:40,895	| IOT204 |	Therapeutic
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:41,919	| IOT204 |	Baby robot
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:42,431	| IOT204 |	Seal for old
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,991	| IOT204 |	It was so funny because
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,039	| IOT204 |	In the show is like
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:48,063	| IOT204 |	What the heck is this
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,087	| IOT204 |	And then by the end
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:50,623	| IOT204 |	I love it
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,391	| IOT204 |	I love it
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,439	| IOT204 |	Ico
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:53,951	| IOT204 |	Applebee near
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,743	| IOT204 |	To do something
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:58,559	| IOT204 |	Not necessarily a robotic baby seal that old people
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,607	| IOT204 |	Love being able to create a product
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,655	| IOT204 |	It is imbued with technology
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:03,679	| IOT204 |	The people want to
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:04,447	| IOT204 |	Hold
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,727	| IOT204 |	Want to sleep with
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:08,031	| IOT204 |	Want to bring into their everyday lives
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:09,311	| IOT204 |	It haven't
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:11,103	| IOT204 |	Gather this data
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,151	| IOT204 |	Make sense of it
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:15,967	| IOT204 |	Forest actually invisible to the user meaning
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:21,599	| IOT204 |	ECG in the watch that you never see or in airpod 2
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:24,159	| IOT204 |	Headphones that we expect later this year to have
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,695	| IOT204 |	Health sensors and such that
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,463	| IOT204 |	You never know
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:28,511	| IOT204 |	Exactly so I think
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,279	| IOT204 |	And
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,047	| IOT204 |	Here's the other reason
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,351	| IOT204 |	This is a good place for
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,911	| IOT204 |	Medical technology
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:36,191	| IOT204 |	Not just stupid Wellness
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:38,751	| IOT204 |	Pieology like me and my Fitbit which I love
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,031	| IOT204 |	But that's not a sin
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:40,799	| IOT204 |	Right
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:41,567	| IOT204 |	Apple goes after
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,079	| IOT204 |	Essential
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,663	| IOT204 |	Munchies and if you think about music
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,943	| IOT204 |	Music was an essential
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:47,967	| IOT204 |	Technology that drove
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:49,759	| IOT204 |	Creation of iPod
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:50,527	| IOT204 |	And then
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:51,807	| IOT204 |	Was filtered into the eye
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,599	| IOT204 |	ITunes was a
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:54,879	| IOT204 |	Huge moneymaker for Apple
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,671	| IOT204 |	They recognized
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:08:00,255	| IOT204 |	What's essential in honestly the way that
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,535	| IOT204 |	I love them but
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:04,863	| IOT204 |	The way that voice services in the home that digital speakers are playing out
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,143	| IOT204 |	If you'll still more like a
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,679	| IOT204 |	Send something essential
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,959	| IOT204 |	So I understand why Apple
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,751	| IOT204 |	Feel like almost like
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:14,591	| IOT204 |	Ask the homepod out there as part of their music app
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:18,687	| IOT204 |	Throw that out there to make Wall Street happy
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:21,759	| IOT204 |	We got a digital speaker I don't care while they focus on something
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:23,295	| IOT204 |	This real
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,319	| IOT204 |	It is actually going to be
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,623	| IOT204 |	Healthcare is a huge industry
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:31,999	| IOT204 |	So I agree with everything you said but I actually want to expand the pond one early point
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:35,071	| IOT204 |	Where you said they were turning a weakness into a strength
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:37,631	| IOT204 |	Which I agree with that there's another weakness here
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:39,167	| IOT204 |	That they're leveraging even more
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:44,287	| IOT204 |	We know they're terrible at Cloud by comparison to a Google a Microsoft
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,823	| IOT204 |	A Amazon
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,615	| IOT204 |	So they can't get data
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:53,503	| IOT204 |	They get their data from devices and apps in their ecosystem and that's it where is others
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:56,575	| IOT204 |	Get data from the web which everybody uses
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,855	| IOT204 |	Apple doesn't have that
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:01,951	| IOT204 |	A safari a search engine that is
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:03,487	| IOT204 |	Huge huge gap
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:08,863	| IOT204 |	So what do they do they go out to their Edge devices the People by gather useful information
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:15,007	| IOT204 |	In your case you're making a case out of health information and I wholeheartedly agree because I have not yet found a better
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:15,775	| IOT204 |	Health
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:18,079	| IOT204 |	Wearable ecosystem then
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:20,895	| IOT204 |	Apple health and my Apple watch quite honestly
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,919	| IOT204 |	So
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:22,943	| IOT204 |	That is another
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:25,247	| IOT204 |	Weakness that are like unicorn
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,551	| IOT204 |	Competing with these guys in the cloud
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:29,855	| IOT204 |	So how do we get data at the user level
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,647	| IOT204 |	Some other way and what day do we
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,671	| IOT204 |	Specifically
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,439	| IOT204 |	And it's help
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:37,279	| IOT204 |	So I agree with you 100% so that's where I think
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:38,559	| IOT204 |	If we look at like
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,095	| IOT204 |	Hey what's Apple doing after the iPhone
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:42,143	| IOT204 |	I think it will be some sort of
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,167	| IOT204 |	Consumer
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,191	| IOT204 |	Oriented
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,215	| IOT204 |	Medical grade
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,007	| IOT204 |	Device
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,031	| IOT204 |	That helps
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:48,799	| IOT204 |	Doctors
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:50,079	| IOT204 |	And loved one
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,871	| IOT204 |	Take care of people in the home
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,663	| IOT204 |	Water enhancer health
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,687	| IOT204 |	And I say that because
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:10:01,599	| IOT204 |	There's every possibility that Apple could come out with its own quote unquote hearing aid with airpods wireless hearing
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:07,487	| IOT204 |	Maybe it's a true hearing aid or maybe it's a personal sound amplifier system which is 9 ft
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:08,255	| IOT204 |	Approved
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:11,839	| IOT204 |	And it's affordable it works its cortical magical and
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:13,375	| IOT204 |	They enhance somebody's life
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,447	| IOT204 |	So that's where
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:16,959	| IOT204 |	That's where that's at
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:17,983	| IOT204 |	Isaac
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,287	| IOT204 |	Feel free to argue
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:24,895	| IOT204 |	West Freeway alright so moving on to something
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,687	| IOT204 |	We'll see where this goes
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:30,783	| IOT204 |	Linden Tibbets who is the CEO and co-founder of if
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,319	| IOT204 |	I talked to him
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:33,855	| IOT204 |	A decade ago
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,903	| IOT204 |	About what he was trying to do here so
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:36,927	| IOT204 |	You step down
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,695	| IOT204 |	And
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:39,231	| IOT204 |	They brought in Chris
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:42,559	| IOT204 |	Kabardian who is most recently the CEO of monster.com
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,607	| IOT204 |	To take over the sea
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:47,423	| IOT204 |	So Tibbetts will stay on as if
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:48,447	| IOT204 |	Chief designer
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,727	| IOT204 |	Officer in
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:52,031	| IOT204 |	Oriana is described as a turnaround special
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:54,847	| IOT204 |	This isn't
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:55,615	| IOT204 |	Surprising
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:58,687	| IOT204 |	It is been really like when it started if
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,455	| IOT204 |	With
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,223	| IOT204 |	A wonderful
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:03,039	| IOT204 |	Vision his vision was to basically
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:03,807	| IOT204 |	Create
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:05,343	| IOT204 |	A way to interact with
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:06,879	| IOT204 |	With digital objects
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,159	| IOT204 |	The same way
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:08,927	| IOT204 |	We would interact
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,231	| IOT204 |	So
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:14,303	| IOT204 |	His example to me was you know if you have a coffee
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,327	| IOT204 |	Upon your
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:16,607	| IOT204 |	Desk
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,375	| IOT204 |	You can use it as a
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,679	| IOT204 |	You can use it as a pencil holder
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:21,727	| IOT204 |	You can use it as a paperweight but
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:25,823	| IOT204 |	In the physical world you see something and you have all these ideas for how you
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:26,591	| IOT204 |	Manipulate
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,359	| IOT204 |	Use it
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,895	| IOT204 |	Whose idea was to create a plateau
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,431	| IOT204 |	That allowed you to do that
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:30,943	| IOT204 |	Digital
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,223	| IOT204 |	So you can
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,503	| IOT204 |	Take something that was intended
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:34,783	| IOT204 |	Something else
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,295	| IOT204 |	Adapter to
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,575	| IOT204 |	Beach
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,087	| IOT204 |	I love
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:44,511	| IOT204 |	No it's a great idea and what they've done is they've gathered up all these API some of these device makers
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:48,607	| IOT204 |	And made it simple to you so that you want to be a programmer
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:52,703	| IOT204 |	Create a different program for every little thing you want to do
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:58,335	| IOT204 |	Do very simple trigger events and action on everything happens in the back in the cloud
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,103	| IOT204 |	I love it
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:05,503	| IOT204 |	I'm just wondering I was nothing anybody could see this but when you mentioned that kabardian is a turnaround specialist I had my eye
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:06,783	| IOT204 |	Eyebrow raise because
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,319	| IOT204 |	I just wonder
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,623	| IOT204 |	Passion
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,903	| IOT204 |	Financial standpoint
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:12,927	| IOT204 |	How does
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:17,791	| IOT204 |	If really continue on is it making its money
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:18,559	| IOT204 |	So if two makes
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:20,607	| IOT204 |	It's money from companies
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,375	| IOT204 |	Like
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:21,887	| IOT204 |	Apple
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:23,935	| IOT204 |	Amazon
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,215	| IOT204 |	More Samsung or
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:26,239	| IOT204 |	Whirlpool
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:27,263	| IOT204 |	Those companies
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,287	| IOT204 |	Can create
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:30,335	| IOT204 |	Supported apis basically
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:34,431	| IOT204 |	And they put them on the platform if charges them to
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:37,759	| IOT204 |	Manage that and then they can also get data about
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,527	| IOT204 |	Like what people are using
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:39,551	| IOT204 |	But
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:43,647	| IOT204 |	It's been pretty hard and like I don't know if he'll remember this but when
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,671	| IOT204 |	Chamberlain
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,463	| IOT204 |	The creator of the MyQ garage door open
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:49,279	| IOT204 |	Pronounce there if Channel they actually said they would charge
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:49,791	| IOT204 |	People a dollar
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:54,655	| IOT204 |	And what are the reasons was
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,935	| IOT204 |	You know it's charging them
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,983	| IOT204 |	They want people to really want to use it
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,031	| IOT204 |	People were upset but
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:04,383	| IOT204 |	Yeah understandably so cuz they're so used to just using it for
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,407	| IOT204 |	Free
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:08,479	| IOT204 |	Number to so it seems like a
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:09,503	| IOT204 |	Pei Wei
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,551	| IOT204 |	Kind of service
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,855	| IOT204 |	Taipei I mean the hardware makers
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:14,623	| IOT204 |	No
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:17,951	| IOT204 |	At some point what if they start pulling out in providing their own
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,719	| IOT204 |	No
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:22,815	| IOT204 |	Apps and services in so long I just worry I just don't
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:23,839	| IOT204 |	I love if
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:25,887	| IOT204 |	Business perspective I just
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,655	| IOT204 |	Question
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,679	| IOT204 |	How They Roll
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,959	| IOT204 |	Make money I just
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:29,471	| IOT204 |	?
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,263	| IOT204 |	Yeah well in
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:33,055	| IOT204 |	I think they have
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:34,079	| IOT204 |	A decent
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:34,591	| IOT204 |	Revenue strata
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:35,615	| IOT204 |	I just think
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,151	| IOT204 |	It's hard to get
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:38,175	| IOT204 |	Users in
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:38,943	| IOT204 |	People to pay
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:44,831	| IOT204 |	Pay for it and it may be a mismatch between the Venture model and what it can actually legit
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,111	| IOT204 |	So
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,903	| IOT204 |	Will also see there
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:50,463	| IOT204 |	So they do just raise money last year
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:53,023	| IOT204 |	There is 24 million yes
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:55,071	| IOT204 |	A little higher so gay
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:56,095	| IOT204 |	According to TechCrunch
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:58,655	| IOT204 |	Yeah this is one of those areas where I'm not going to
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:01,727	| IOT204 |	Wholesale freaked out like I know it's going away but
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:04,543	| IOT204 |	I could see you like in six months if
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,335	| IOT204 |	This guy is not gaining more traction week
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:06,847	| IOT204 |	I could see if
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:07,871	| IOT204 |	Put on the market
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,431	| IOT204 |	And it'll be
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,455	| IOT204 |	It's a great plan
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,735	| IOT204 |	A lots of come
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:15,295	| IOT204 |	Company so it would be interesting to see who might buy it
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:18,367	| IOT204 |	How that would change that mean one of the advantages of
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,671	| IOT204 |	Left is that it is not owned
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:24,255	| IOT204 |	Right right
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:28,607	| IOT204 |	If I had to place a gas and we'll talk about this whole bit more but I would say
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:30,143	| IOT204 |	Google would be my number one
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:31,935	| IOT204 |	To pick it up if it weren't for sale
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:36,543	| IOT204 |	There's a reason I'm saying
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,615	| IOT204 |	Spoiler alert you guys
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:40,895	| IOT204 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:43,199	| IOT204 |	So let's talk about somebody else that's
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:44,735	| IOT204 |	Osram
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,527	| IOT204 |	Which you guys
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,063	| IOT204 |	I mean I know but they are a lie
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:48,575	| IOT204 |	Lightning
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:50,367	| IOT204 |	LEDs
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:54,719	| IOT204 |	Yes they have the lightify play
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:56,767	| IOT204 |	Apartments with their platform was
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:59,327	| IOT204 |	This is been you know in the lightbulb world
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,351	| IOT204 |	The lightbulb world
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:02,911	| IOT204 |	Spin-outs
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,935	| IOT204 |	A positions
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:05,215	| IOT204 |	It's a tough Market
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:06,495	| IOT204 |	Because
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,519	| IOT204 |	LED shift suddenly
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:08,799	| IOT204 |	Something that you
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,823	| IOT204 |	You might buy
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:12,895	| IOT204 |	Multiple light bulbs per year and now you're going to replace them with LEDs and
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:13,919	| IOT204 |	Not buy anymore
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:17,503	| IOT204 |	Technology
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:19,039	| IOT204 |	Needs us to switch our business model
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,319	| IOT204 |	Also everyone was like services
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,343	| IOT204 |	Gnarly
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,671	| IOT204 |	So
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:27,487	| IOT204 |	Has confirmed that is it acquisition candidate
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:27,999	| IOT204 |	And
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:30,303	| IOT204 |	They're talking to Bain Capital and
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:30,815	| IOT204 |	Carlyle Group
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:33,887	| IOT204 |	This is really tough for letting folks
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:34,911	| IOT204 |	That's the story about Ozzy
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:37,727	| IOT204 |	Maybe it'll go the way of signify
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,495	| IOT204 |	Jennifer Phillips
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,519	| IOT204 |	Which Phillip spun out at
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,287	| IOT204 |	Light bulb
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:42,591	| IOT204 |	What division including the Philips Hue bulbs into a compass
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,615	| IOT204 |	Call signify
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,383	| IOT204 |	GE
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:45,919	| IOT204 |	It's been out there like
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,687	| IOT204 |	Lighting division
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,967	| IOT204 |	So who knows
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,479	| IOT204 |	We'll see what happens
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:50,271	| IOT204 |	And oh yeah
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,039	| IOT204 |	Lifx
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,319	| IOT204 |	Was just acquired by
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,087	| IOT204 |	Buddy platform
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,367	| IOT204 |	Which is a smart phone says
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,695	| IOT204 |	Crazy times for lighting
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:15:59,743	| IOT204 |	Already
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,535	| IOT204 |	Let's talk about this story
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,839	| IOT204 |	Couple weeks ago nest
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:04,863	| IOT204 |	Basically said hey
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:07,935	| IOT204 |	You can now use Google assistant on your nest secure system
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:10,495	| IOT204 |	And specifically The Nest guard
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:14,591	| IOT204 |	You have to opt-in because of your going to activate a microphone on this particular.
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,639	| IOT204 |	Weight has a microphone
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:17,919	| IOT204 |	What I know
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:20,479	| IOT204 |	So that's kind of how the world felt about this
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,015	| IOT204 |	They're like
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,039	| IOT204 |	Didn't talk about that
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:23,807	| IOT204 |	And
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:25,087	| IOT204 |	We talked about that on that beat
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:27,135	| IOT204 |	Regular Show and then last week we talked about it
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:30,207	| IOT204 |	With regards to smart televisions because we went looking for
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,487	| IOT204 |	Privacy-related
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:33,023	| IOT204 |	Hunt around smart televisions
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:34,559	| IOT204 |	And we discovered that
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:37,887	| IOT204 |	It was unclear if certain TVs have microphones in the mirror.
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,167	| IOT204 |	Which we thought was kind of like
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:40,959	| IOT204 |	Not great
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:47,359	| IOT204 |	List the stuff in the specs before customers even purchases are they don't want to find out afterwards
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,895	| IOT204 |	Exactly and so
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:50,175	| IOT204 |	Business Insider
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:50,687	| IOT204 |	Kudos to them
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:52,479	| IOT204 |	Calling them out
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:54,015	| IOT204 |	They sent a media request to
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,295	| IOT204 |	Google
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,575	| IOT204 |	And basically was like
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:58,623	| IOT204 |	How come you never told anybody that the resume
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,159	| IOT204 |	And
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:05,535	| IOT204 |	The response I got back was beyond device microphone was never intended to be a secret and should have been listed in the text
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:07,839	| IOT204 |	That was an error
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:09,887	| IOT204 |	Yes Bank
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:10,911	| IOT204 |	So
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:15,775	| IOT204 |	It's just like the conversation we had about Smart TVs if you're going to have microphones cameras Etc
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:17,567	| IOT204 |	It's all good
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,335	| IOT204 |	Upfront
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:21,151	| IOT204 |	Fun Center so that people know what they're buying before they buy it
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,967	| IOT204 |	Which leads me to this week's newsletter
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:28,319	| IOT204 |	I am going to write about what I feel like the ideal truth in labeling laws

EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,367	| IOT204 |	Iot devices
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,159	| IOT204 |	In what sort of things should be
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,439	| IOT204 |	Be covered in
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,463	| IOT204 |	A company who selling a
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,511	| IOT204 |	What sort of
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,535	| IOT204 |	Things that
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,303	| IOT204 |	Include as part of that
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:44,703	| IOT204 |	We've talked about some of those things but it seems like every several months end up adding something new to the list
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:46,239	| IOT204 |	Yeah we're like oh
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,775	| IOT204 |	Obvious but I guess it wasn't
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,823	| IOT204 |	All right and as we learn
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,383	| IOT204 |	Think so
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:54,175	| IOT204 |	I'm sure this will change gilfry
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:55,455	| IOT204 |	If you hear this before
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:57,247	| IOT204 |	You know the end of the day Thursday UK
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:01,343	| IOT204 |	Tweet at me your suggestions of things that should be in there maybe
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,367	| IOT204 |	Maybe they'll make it Millis
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:03,903	| IOT204 |	So let's talk about
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,183	| IOT204 |	Smart circuit breaker
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,791	| IOT204 |	Leviton has announced
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,071	| IOT204 |	At the international
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,095	| IOT204 |	Builder show a
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,887	| IOT204 |	Connected smart circuit breaker
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,167	| IOT204 |	The ties back to their device
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,447	| IOT204 |	This is
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:18,239	| IOT204 |	A really cool device
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:19,263	| IOT204 |	People are very
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:20,031	| IOT204 |	Excited about it
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:21,823	| IOT204 |	I just want to say
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:23,103	| IOT204 |	But this is not the first one at the
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,895	| IOT204 |	Schneider Electric india
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:28,479	| IOT204 |	Both big makers of those panel boxes outside your home
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:28,991	| IOT204 |	Both have
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,527	| IOT204 |	Is most of them
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:32,319	| IOT204 |	They're targeted at the industrial space
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:33,599	| IOT204 |	So this is at the home
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:36,671	| IOT204 |	In the whole Market there's actually a large number of
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:39,231	| IOT204 |	Products the try to do energy monitoring
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:39,999	| IOT204 |	For you
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,791	| IOT204 |	Either at the circuit box
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:43,071	| IOT204 |	Which is complex and
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:45,631	| IOT204 |	A pain in the butt to install or maybe at
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,399	| IOT204 |	The plug level
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:48,703	| IOT204 |	And some of them just clip onto wires in light
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:50,495	| IOT204 |	Like say that they can manage all of this stuff
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:51,775	| IOT204 |	Distinguish different
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:54,079	| IOT204 |	Devices based on their electrical signature
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:55,359	| IOT204 |	So
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,383	| IOT204 |	Is a rich history
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,175	| IOT204 |	But
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,199	| IOT204 |	Historically this hasn't
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:03,807	| IOT204 |	Yeah that there is a rich history of this but I think it's been very
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:09,695	| IOT204 |	It's been focused xiao-nan consumer applications and the consumer applications
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:10,719	| IOT204 |	Where products have
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:11,743	| IOT204 |	Come out for this
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:14,815	| IOT204 |	Have been from startup since I should I think this is probably the first
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:17,119	| IOT204 |	Big name that I can think of
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,655	| IOT204 |	Going after the consumer here
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,959	| IOT204 |	I think that's going to be a huge
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:22,751	| IOT204 |	Benefit I also think
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:26,335	| IOT204 |	You can't just have a smart circuit breaker be expect to
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:32,479	| IOT204 |	Everything go hunky-dory you need a platform that works with a Leviton has that well over the range for the product
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:35,551	| IOT204 |	So I got the shot
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:37,855	| IOT204 |	To succeed where others have not been so successful
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,927	| IOT204 |	My question is how much does it cost
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,975	| IOT204 |	Don't know yet we don't know
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:44,767	| IOT204 |	It'll be available in the second quarter of
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,535	| IOT204 |	2019
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,303	| IOT204 |	So
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,839	| IOT204 |	Well presumably find out then
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:50,655	| IOT204 |	Historically when I have tried these devices out
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,447	| IOT204 |	I have come to
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,215	| IOT204 |	To the realization
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:53,983	| IOT204 |	That
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:54,751	| IOT204 |	They don't help
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:58,591	| IOT204 |	I was going to say what you really get out of it other than some cool data
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,639	| IOT204 |	So you get this awesome data and you're like
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:01,663	| IOT204 |	Hot diggity
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:02,943	| IOT204 |	And there are some Lo hang
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:07,039	| IOT204 |	Rate so you may see a space heater that you like
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:09,855	| IOT204 |	Wrap it is way cheaper to
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:13,183	| IOT204 |	Keep my entire house did using this energy does a space heater
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:14,975	| IOT204 |	So there may be things like
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:16,255	| IOT204 |	After you switch all your light bill
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:18,303	| IOT204 |	Is after you eliminate the
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,071	| IOT204 |	Space heater
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:20,607	| IOT204 |	You're left with things that
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,167	| IOT204 |	Yeah like they're hot
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:24,447	| IOT204 |	So
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:28,031	| IOT204 |	One of the advantages his you know what I'd like to see
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,567	| IOT204 |	Is more integration but
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:30,591	| IOT204 |	Between some of the
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:31,359	| IOT204 |	These
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:32,639	| IOT204 |	Companies that produce like
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:35,199	| IOT204 |	Meme for example which makes hot water heater
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,479	| IOT204 |	If they can make
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,015	| IOT204 |	Come up with an app that takes a
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:39,551	| IOT204 |	Advantage of levittown's
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,319	| IOT204 |	In a circuit
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:41,599	| IOT204 |	Breaker
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:43,135	| IOT204 |	An automatically like
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:45,183	| IOT204 |	Lower the temperature when it seems likely
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:46,207	| IOT204 |	Not be needed
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,487	| IOT204 |	There are companies that actually do
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:48,767	| IOT204 |	Right now
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:51,071	| IOT204 |	Or Whirlpool takes advantage to say
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,351	| IOT204 |	Like when I want to start
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,119	| IOT204 |	My dryer it's
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,887	| IOT204 |	Says hey by the way
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:57,215	| IOT204 |	We're in this kind of demand response situation don't
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,519	| IOT204 |	Yeah can you wait 30 minutes
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,311	| IOT204 |	There's some
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:03,359	| IOT204 |	Options but those options for lion
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,127	| IOT204 |	A lot of integration
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:06,175	| IOT204 |	They rely on
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:07,455	| IOT204 |	The idea that the consumer is
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,223	| IOT204 |	Is going to watch
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:08,735	| IOT204 |	Want some sort of
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:11,295	| IOT204 |	Demand response
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:12,575	| IOT204 |	I don't know if we're there yet
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:14,879	| IOT204 |	I agree that don't bother for there yet
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:21,024	| IOT204 |	I was just going to go there cuz you talk about it like at the micro-level at the macro-level this could fit in nicely with
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:22,816	| IOT204 |	Can we talk about 3 weeks ago about
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:26,656	| IOT204 |	You know the possibility of Amazon indoor Google sort of the kitty more to the
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:32,800	| IOT204 |	Energy utility Space by capturing all the data and suggesting the people Your Nest right now
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:35,360	| IOT204 |	You can save on energy because we're at
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:41,504	| IOT204 |	Stoller
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:42,528	| IOT204 |	Clips
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:50,976	| IOT204 |	Right right a tree cool and therefore they can spend as much in overtime and it's a bike 700
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:52,256	| IOT204 |	Megawatts of Power by the
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,792	| IOT204 |	Several thousand people that were
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:55,584	| IOT204 |	No pulled into this test
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:58,656	| IOT204 |	So I think it's more of a macro benefit
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,936	| IOT204 |	None of micro benefit butt
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:03,776	| IOT204 |	And I do think this is
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,312	| IOT204 |	Where the industry is going
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:07,360	| IOT204 |	I just don't know there's always the
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:07,872	| IOT204 |	The problem
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:11,712	| IOT204 |	You may have the right idea but you just have it too early
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:14,528	| IOT204 |	So it may be the start us were all too early in
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:17,600	| IOT204 |	The ecosystem is now going to come together around this but
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:18,368	| IOT204 |	I will say
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:21,440	| IOT204 |	Beecosystem does still need to come together around this for this product
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,256	| IOT204 |	Yep all right
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,048	| IOT204 |	So what's up
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:26,816	| IOT204 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:28,096	| IOT204 |	Libelium which is what
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,120	| IOT204 |	The first iot
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:29,888	| IOT204 |	Companies I think I've
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:30,656	| IOT204 |	Ever
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,168	| IOT204 |	Dealt with
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:32,960	| IOT204 |	They are a European
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:35,008	| IOT204 |	And the
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:36,288	| IOT204 |	Basically started out
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:37,568	| IOT204 |	Like these things called
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:38,336	| IOT204 |	Wasp
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:40,384	| IOT204 |	Boats they were little Laura based
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:43,456	| IOT204 |	Networks it was a sensor Network for agriculture
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,992	| IOT204 |	Smart cities for whatever
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:45,760	| IOT204 |	And
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:49,344	| IOT204 |	They just announced a partnership with Ericsson that is going to
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:50,112	| IOT204 |	To provide
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:51,648	| IOT204 |	Nb-iot
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:54,464	| IOT204 |	Modules that will work with the light Valium
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:55,232	| IOT204 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:56,000	| IOT204 |	So
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,536	| IOT204 |	This actually reminds me
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,048	| IOT204 |	Very much
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:02,912	| IOT204 |	Of kind of shift that sigfox was making around
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:04,448	| IOT204 |	Open sourcing its Network
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:08,032	| IOT204 |	Just because these are all low power wide area in it
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,568	| IOT204 |	Providers
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:11,616	| IOT204 |	And we're basically seeing them try.
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:14,432	| IOT204 |	Established Solutions
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:17,248	| IOT204 |	Customers we understand this let's broaden
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:19,040	| IOT204 |	The number of radios we support
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:20,832	| IOT204 |	I'll get more people in here
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,112	| IOT204 |	So
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:23,904	| IOT204 |	We can basically build a business
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,952	| IOT204 |	Yeah and what they're doing in there
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:28,256	| IOT204 |	Starting out with a developer module leaking
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,024	| IOT204 |	Purchase
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:35,424	| IOT204 |	NBI Ortiz you said LTE cat M and some older GPRS Network skip
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:36,192	| IOT204 |	Just in case
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,984	| IOT204 |	There's no nb-iot coverage so
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:41,056	| IOT204 |	So this is just
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:45,664	| IOT204 |	It's a little piece of news but I think it's indicative of kind of an opening up in the
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:47,456	| IOT204 |	Low-power wide area
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:48,736	| IOT204 |	Hbase cell
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:49,248	| IOT204 |	Okay
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:51,552	| IOT204 |	Talk about
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,320	| IOT204 |	Google
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,088	| IOT204 |	And
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:53,600	| IOT204 |	It's plans
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:58,208	| IOT204 |	Against madhumeh and I think this is why you think they might want to buy
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:00,000	| IOT204 |	Or they'd be likely to buy
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,072	| IOT204 |	Yes assuming if twere
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:04,864	| IOT204 |	Note to go on sale yes I do
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:05,632	| IOT204 |	Google
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:07,680	| IOT204 |	Jumping in there and the reason being
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,984	| IOT204 |	And I didn't even know about the X news when I have the spot
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:13,568	| IOT204 |	I saw some figures over at search engine land
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,848	| IOT204 |	Couple days ago
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:16,128	| IOT204 |	And
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:17,408	| IOT204 |	What is the number of
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:21,504	| IOT204 |	Google actions in the US versus the number of skills for matinee
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:22,784	| IOT204 |	And
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:25,088	| IOT204 |	It's insane what a difference there is
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:28,416	| IOT204 |	There are roughly 60000 skills format of a as of
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:29,440	| IOT204 |	January
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:32,256	| IOT204 |	Emily 4253 Google actions
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:34,560	| IOT204 |	That is ridiculous
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:40,704	| IOT204 |	I know Google is competing better in the hardware side they're selling more Google devices
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:44,800	| IOT204 |	Desales I would suspect reduced pricing
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:50,944	| IOT204 |	It doesn't matter if you can do more with the Madam a on your own and
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:53,248	| IOT204 |	Even though I use Google home
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,528	| IOT204 |	For more than I use
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:55,552	| IOT204 |	Madam a
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:57,856	| IOT204 |	There's a huge difference between the apps or both
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:00,672	| IOT204 |	And it's so easy to find skills
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,696	| IOT204 |	For your Echo
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:08,096	| IOT204 |	On your phone of course you can stop
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:10,144	| IOT204 |	That's at the discovery is
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:10,656	| IOT204 |	Very good
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,448	| IOT204 |	Not so with Google
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:15,776	| IOT204 |	I can't even find in the app where you would enable or
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:20,640	| IOT204 |	Look for actions because there is no way to do it that I know of I went through every menu like a fine
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,664	| IOT204 |	You have to go to
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:25,248	| IOT204 |	And I knew anybody from there as well
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:29,856	| IOT204 |	So that's a problem Discovery is just not even there
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:31,136	| IOT204 |	Not on the phone anyway
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:32,928	| IOT204 |	The other big thing is
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:34,720	| IOT204 |	I started working at the
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:38,048	| IOT204 |	Google developer blog versus the Amazon developer blogs
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:39,840	| IOT204 |	And there's a dedicated one
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:41,632	| IOT204 |	Format Ma
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:48,032	| IOT204 |	Refer to it many times in the show because there's always something to talk about there's always
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:48,800	| IOT204 |	Blueprints
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:50,336	| IOT204 |	Here's an easy way to create a skill
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:51,872	| IOT204 |	There's just a lot of
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:58,784	| IOT204 |	What's a hand-holding but a lot of direction for both developers and non developers to make skills
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:02,624	| IOT204 |	Google there's just one developer blog and I went through every
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:05,440	| IOT204 |	Post friend
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:06,720	| IOT204 |	That has to do with
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:08,768	| IOT204 |	Google what's this interaction
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:09,792	| IOT204 |	It's just not
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,584	| IOT204 |	They're not telling it enough
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:13,120	| IOT204 |	And they're not making it easy enough
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:14,400	| IOT204 |	This is classic
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:16,960	| IOT204 |	Google this is what Google does
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:19,008	| IOT204 |	They're like we have been vented some
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:19,776	| IOT204 |	Something amazing
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,312	| IOT204 |	We'll throw it over the wall
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:23,616	| IOT204 |	And if anyone wants to pick it up
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:25,408	| IOT204 |	You should developers will come
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:26,176	| IOT204 |	Yeah and that's
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:28,736	| IOT204 |	You cannot have best
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:29,760	| IOT204 |	Coolest thing
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,296	| IOT204 |	But people will not show up
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:33,344	| IOT204 |	They don't know about it or they can't
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:35,904	| IOT204 |	Even if they see it people are so busy
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,928	| IOT204 |	Developers
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:38,976	| IOT204 |	Normal people were all like inundated
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:41,792	| IOT204 |	Carnation if you don't tell us why it matters
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,584	| IOT204 |	It's not going to matter
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:47,680	| IOT204 |	Yeah and I'm not sure that's what I'm going to be so you can
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:51,264	| IOT204 |	Buy or pay the developer for Madame a skill
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:54,592	| IOT204 |	I don't know if you can do that with an action on Google
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:56,384	| IOT204 |	If you can't I don't know for sure
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,920	| IOT204 |	If you can't
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:59,200	| IOT204 |	What's a Development Center
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:01,504	| IOT204 |	Well
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:02,016	| IOT204 |	Yeah
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:06,880	| IOT204 |	Well you're on a cool voice platform but Google isn't
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,648	| IOT204 |	Google Voice platform
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:08,928	| IOT204 |	There was actually
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,464	| IOT204 |	Think strategy Analytics
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:12,768	| IOT204 |	Just put out numbers saying that
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:14,816	| IOT204 |	Their Q4 smart speaker
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:16,352	| IOT204 |	Shipment screw 95
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,888	| IOT204 |	Percent about 38
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:19,936	| IOT204 |	5 million units and
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:20,704	| IOT204 |	Amazon
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:23,520	| IOT204 |	Amazon was by far the winner
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:28,896	| IOT204 |	Yeah let me Google sketching up on the hardware side but it doesn't matter if
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:35,552	| IOT204 |	Now the skills they are actions aren't there or discoverable I can just limited utility people get bored with the same old same old
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:41,696	| IOT204 |	The functionality I think there's far more in creating new functionality just out of the
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:44,512	| IOT204 |	Language translation for conversations on the
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:45,024	| IOT204 |	Smart display
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:46,816	| IOT204 |	And it's fantastic
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:49,120	| IOT204 |	I can't keep inventing everything there
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:50,400	| IOT204 |	Yeah and
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,704	| IOT204 |	They have been some really cool stuff
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,728	| IOT204 |	But implementing it
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,264	| IOT204 |	That's where they fall down like
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:57,056	| IOT204 |	I mean I've had so many issues with
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:58,592	| IOT204 |	That I'm just like
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:02,944	| IOT204 |	I think you hit the nail on the head it's typical Google
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:09,344	| IOT204 |	To just say we'll just make that some people
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,112	| IOT204 |	Do that anymore
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:11,648	| IOT204 |	Not if they really want to get
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,672	| IOT204 |	Consumers
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:13,440	| IOT204 |	In this case
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:14,720	| IOT204 |	They're not free
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:15,488	| IOT204 |	Right
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:17,792	| IOT204 |	It's one thing to be like I will give you an awesome Gmail Prada
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:20,864	| IOT204 |	Free cuz he knows something people understood at the time
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:29,056	| IOT204 |	Whole new functionality whole new type of product and people don't know what to do with it
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:29,824	| IOT204 |	Including developer
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:31,616	| IOT204 |	Okay
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,384	| IOT204 |	I agree with you Kevin
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:33,664	| IOT204 |	Already
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:34,432	| IOT204 |	Well
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:35,968	| IOT204 |	We have covered a lot there's probably
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:38,272	| IOT204 |	There is definitely more we could cover
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:40,832	| IOT204 |	We're going to stop here and move to Riot

EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:09,664	| IOT204 |	Ferguson either a text or email to a
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:10,688	| IOT204 |	User-configurable
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:12,992	| IOT204 |	DIY
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:15,040	| IOT204 |	Suggestion
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:17,088	| IOT204 |	But I've had a hard time finding anything
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,160	| IOT204 |	Hope you can help
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:21,184	| IOT204 |	Thanks for the show
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,768	| IOT204 |	Wow John Deere home sounds like my hoe
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:26,048	| IOT204 |	A lot of hops
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:26,816	| IOT204 |	Lots of hugs
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,608	| IOT204 |	So we got options
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,400	| IOT204 |	But my favorite option
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:32,192	| IOT204 |	Probably the easiest one.
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:34,240	| IOT204 |	It's going to be from smart
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:36,288	| IOT204 |	Thanks and provided it stays up
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:37,824	| IOT204 |	Which it's gotten much better
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:39,872	| IOT204 |	Historically
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:40,896	| IOT204 |	This should be good for you
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:41,920	| IOT204 |	Cuz you can buy
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:44,224	| IOT204 |	A little you can basically do this with a zigbee or Z-Wave
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:47,296	| IOT204 |	What you're going to do is
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:49,088	| IOT204 |	You would use the smart
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:50,112	| IOT204 |	Apps in smart
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:50,880	| IOT204 |	Things
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:51,648	| IOT204 |	And
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:53,952	| IOT204 |	Under Safety and Security you're going to find
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:56,000	| IOT204 |	Notify me when
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:57,280	| IOT204 |	Blah
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:58,560	| IOT204 |	Click through that
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:30:59,840	| IOT204 |	Can I click button
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,120	| IOT204 |	Pick your button
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:02,144	| IOT204 |	First thing you want to do is
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,168	| IOT204 |	Hook your button into
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:05,216	| IOT204 |	Platform so it shows up
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:05,728	| IOT204 |	And then
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:10,848	| IOT204 |	This buttons only $15 so you can have these all around the house if you
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:13,152	| IOT204 |	Without spending a ton of money
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:15,200	| IOT204 |	Samsung
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:15,968	| IOT204 |	Samsung SmartThings
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:17,760	| IOT204 |	This is
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:19,296	| IOT204 |	In your home this is not outside your home
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:23,392	| IOT204 |	They do actually have a SmartThings button that's cellular powered Samsung
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,416	| IOT204 |	Sun also makes that
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:24,928	| IOT204 |	R outside
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:25,952	| IOT204 |	Thermostat something
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:32,608	| IOT204 |	But inside the home you can just do this it will send you a notification and or
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:34,912	| IOT204 |	Now
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:36,448	| IOT204 |	You mentioned sending it to a list
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:40,032	| IOT204 |	There's no function to basically send it to you
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:41,824	| IOT204 |	And then two minutes later sent to someone else it's
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:43,360	| IOT204 |	If you want
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:46,688	| IOT204 |	You have to create basically six rules
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:47,712	| IOT204 |	Phone numbers for
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:50,528	| IOT204 |	Same button press will then
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:51,040	| IOT204 |	Shootouts
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:54,880	| IOT204 |	Right there might be a way to it
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:55,648	| IOT204 |	Like if your
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:57,952	| IOT204 |	Enter programming it might be a way to
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:59,744	| IOT204 |	Create a custom notification method
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:01,792	| IOT204 |	Do that
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:06,912	| IOT204 |	Absolutely they are very open when it comes to creating your own
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,960	| IOT204 |	Device handlers and so on so that
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:10,496	| IOT204 |	Good if that's not something
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:12,288	| IOT204 |	You want to do totally understand
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:16,384	| IOT204 |	I have seen some scripts that people put together to do something very similar
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:20,224	| IOT204 |	What you're asking so it's definitely possible if you want to mess the time
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:22,016	| IOT204 |	They do have a call at the
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:22,784	| IOT204 |	Pushover
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,576	| IOT204 |	App so that would actually send notice
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:25,344	| IOT204 |	Vacations to Lake
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:26,880	| IOT204 |	Devices
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:28,160	| IOT204 |	If you want to go that route
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:32,000	| IOT204 |	You spend all day on a computer or something like that you wanted to pop up while your
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:34,560	| IOT204 |	Hanging out in your Chrome browsers
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:40,448	| IOT204 |	Right yeah pushover is an API service that will basically turn something into a
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:46,080	| IOT204 |	What looks like a native notification just like it when an app send you a notification on your phone instead of an email or text
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:52,480	| IOT204 |	It's that kind of notification were talking about so that's possible and that's very customizable again he might have to do a little bit
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:54,016	| IOT204 |	Programming but I looked at it
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:57,600	| IOT204 |	And if we're talking maybe 10 lines of code and you can probably have
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:33:00,416	| IOT204 |	Some rules apply after 2 minutes
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:05,536	| IOT204 |	Ping this person via a notification then this person another 2 minutes later
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:09,120	| IOT204 |	Gets out of The Simple Solution but it's doable
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:10,656	| IOT204 |	So that is our recommendation
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:15,520	| IOT204 |	You could also do something via a gift but we didn't like it because of latency
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:17,056	| IOT204 |	And reliability issues
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:17,568	| IOT204 |	So
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:18,848	| IOT204 |	That's why we went with
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:21,408	| IOT204 |	Plus cost wise you know
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:22,432	| IOT204 |	You could Poppy's buttons all over
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:24,992	| IOT204 |	There you go
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:25,504	| IOT204 |	15 bucks
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:28,832	| IOT204 |	A button in every room
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:29,600	| IOT204 |	Maybe
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:30,368	| IOT204 |	Multiples in every
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,904	| IOT204 |	Yay
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:33,184	| IOT204 |	All right
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:34,208	| IOT204 |	John thanks

EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:00,832	| IOT204 |	And even some others you may not know about
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:05,696	| IOT204 |	Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:07,488	| IOT204 |	Ask for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:09,536	| IOT204 |	This week sponsor is urbanex
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,328	| IOT204 |	Accelerator for startups
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:13,376	| IOT204 |	Tackling difficult problems in today's
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:16,192	| IOT204 |	So we have Gabe batstone
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:18,496	| IOT204 |	Who is the CEO of context are
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:22,592	| IOT204 |	An industrial software company that's focused on transforming the future of work
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:23,360	| IOT204 |	True AI
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:25,664	| IOT204 |	So let's get this started with
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:26,688	| IOT204 |	Summit pretty base
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:30,272	| IOT204 |	How do you guys Envision transforming the future of
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:31,040	| IOT204 |	Work
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:33,088	| IOT204 |	Well the context are a little slice of
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:36,672	| IOT204 |	The future work is really focused on what we call Blue Collar AI
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:37,696	| IOT204 |	And that means
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:39,744	| IOT204 |	Providing technology that supports
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:41,792	| IOT204 |	People with warm hands on cold
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:46,400	| IOT204 |	Cold Steel write these are the people who make our trains roll our planes fly in our building
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:49,472	| IOT204 |	And imagine if we can create an environment
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:52,800	| IOT204 |	Any piece of Machinery equipment
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:53,568	| IOT204 |	About when it was made
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:57,408	| IOT204 |	We're going to make those jobs
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:34:59,456	| IOT204 |	More productive more safe and frankly more simulator
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:03,296	| IOT204 |	So contacts there is also an urban X startup
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:06,880	| IOT204 |	Can you tell me a little bit about why you participated in the program and what you get out of it
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:11,488	| IOT204 |	It was an interesting decision myself
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:12,512	| IOT204 |	No we are not
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:15,072	| IOT204 |	Young Angelina
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:17,120	| IOT204 |	Industrial software for a couple of decades
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:19,168	| IOT204 |	Michelle working with heavy weights like Lockheed Martin
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:21,984	| IOT204 |	Boeing and so on
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:26,336	| IOT204 |	And so it was a natural necessarily to go into an accelerator environment
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:30,688	| IOT204 |	But we found it
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:33,760	| IOT204 |	Collaboration
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:35,296	| IOT204 |	With a design Focus
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,576	| IOT204 |	Does make
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:41,184	| IOT204 |	You think differently worth considering
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:43,488	| IOT204 |	Greenpoint Brooklyn
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:45,536	| IOT204 |	Meet the people in the location
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:50,400	| IOT204 |	An association with BMW and something that seems like a no-brainer
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:52,448	| IOT204 |	It's a great impact on their business
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:53,472	| IOT204 |	Everything from
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:54,496	| IOT204 |	Public relations
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:56,544	| IOT204 |	Networking to just start ideas
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:36:00,896	| IOT204 |	We love that relationship and we're proud to be a part of that community
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:04,736	| IOT204 |	So by making it easier to communicate with industrial machinery
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:06,272	| IOT204 |	What are kind of the big challenges
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:07,552	| IOT204 |	You're trying to solve
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:11,136	| IOT204 |	What's funny the challenges change from
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:17,024	| IOT204 |	It seems like only a year ago that I was talking a lot about how do we deal with the end of work and there's not going to be any jobs
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:19,584	| IOT204 |	Iron Man vs Skynet in the workplace
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:24,960	| IOT204 |	And that is melted into the Global Steel shortage where now we don't have enough
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:29,312	| IOT204 |	Interesting
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:31,616	| IOT204 |	Foundational elements of
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:32,384	| IOT204 |	Demographic shift
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:34,176	| IOT204 |	Digital transformation
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:38,784	| IOT204 |	And I need for technology to be implemented in the workplace in a way that
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:40,320	| IOT204 |	Again can make people
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:43,392	| IOT204 |	Safer more productive and be able to do their jobs
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:50,304	| IOT204 |	And when you can match that altogether you start to then get solutions that not only changed companies but Industries and hopefully the entire
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:53,376	| IOT204 |	And where can people go to find out more

EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:26,400	| IOT204 |	It's fun they also do
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,448	| IOT204 |	So Tyson
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:28,960	| IOT204 |	How are you doing
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:33,824	| IOT204 |	Good great I really appreciate you for having me on and I'm excited to talk about all the
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:35,360	| IOT204 |	Stuff going on in iot
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:37,152	| IOT204 |	Before we go on no
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:39,200	| IOT204 |	I know you guys don't do just radios what else do you
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:43,296	| IOT204 |	Well we do over half of our business now is in iot
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:49,696	| IOT204 |	Type of products that we do microcontrollers and wireless connectivity all the different ones that you just mentioned that we also have
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:53,792	| IOT204 |	Products that go into infrastructure applications like high-speed data centers and
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:58,912	| IOT204 |	Optical Communications and wireless infrastructure and then a whole bunch of products to go into Automotive
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:01,216	| IOT204 |	Silly working a lot of areas but what's really
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:07,616	| IOT204 |	Kind of cool is it if you think about you know where Electronics go in our lives so you know we're working on a lot of the things that are going to be these laws
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:11,712	| IOT204 |	Long-term trends that are going to be no kind of transform the economy in the way we live
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:12,480	| IOT204 |	All right
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:13,760	| IOT204 |	So let's talk about
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:15,296	| IOT204 |	Radios
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:17,856	| IOT204 |	Because that's where I want to kick this off cuz that's almost where everything
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:19,904	| IOT204 |	I feel like we're in this
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,672	| IOT204 |	Weird
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:22,464	| IOT204 |	Point in the Smart Home
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:23,232	| IOT204 |	Where
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:24,768	| IOT204 |	Z-Wave and zigbee feel like there
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:29,376	| IOT204 |	If people are less inclined to use them and people are more inclined just a Wi-Fi
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:30,912	| IOT204 |	Meanwhile
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:33,472	| IOT204 |	We see things like Bluetooth and
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:36,800	| IOT204 |	Even Zippy pushing into the Enterprise and somewhat the industrial
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:40,128	| IOT204 |	Best smart home things
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:42,432	| IOT204 |	Personal area networks are all moving in
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,200	| IOT204 |	Is new areas
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,528	| IOT204 |	Everywhere as always
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:47,552	| IOT204 |	So talk to me about
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:48,320	| IOT204 |	What you see with
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:49,856	| IOT204 |	Future of radios in
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:51,904	| IOT204 |	Smart home maybe Industrial
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:58,816	| IOT204 |	Yes I could take a look at must-start with Wi-Fi and you know what you'll see ubiquitous technology that we all have in her home
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:39:04,704	| IOT204 |	Are smartphones in our laptops and tablets and I guess televisions and other streaming media devices
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:05,984	| IOT204 |	That's really where at
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:11,360	| IOT204 |	Started and the reason for a lot of these other Technologies is because there are some
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:13,152	| IOT204 |	Things that Wi-Fi has the challenge
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:19,296	| IOT204 |	Do you have to operate off of you know very low power is in a lot of the things that we do and iot or command and control
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:26,208	| IOT204 |	And you know for instance a door sensor or in a window sensor or something that you throw under your sink to
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:32,608	| IOT204 |	Measure water in all the sorts of things they have to run off of a battery for a long time and it's going to be like to be off of a coin cell
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:34,656	| IOT204 |	That's not really a good application
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:39,264	| IOT204 |	4 Wi-Fi or you can even think about a door lock you know you don't have power in your door lock so you don't want
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:45,664	| IOT204 |	The batteries to give out very quickly and set up for those kinetic control applications these other Technologies in particular zigbee
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:46,688	| IOT204 |	Bensi Wayne worth
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:48,224	| IOT204 |	Leading providers of both of those
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:52,832	| IOT204 |	Protocols there really much more tailored to the command-and-control networks
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:54,112	| IOT204 |	As opposed to Wi-Fi
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:58,208	| IOT204 |	And another aspect of this which we can get into if they'd zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:40:01,536	| IOT204 |	State interoperate with other zigbee and Z-Wave devices
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:04,096	| IOT204 |	And know how to talk to one another where is on
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:06,656	| IOT204 |	Our Wi-Fi you typically just hook up to the Internet
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:08,960	| IOT204 |	You're talking to the cloud but there's a robustness
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:11,008	| IOT204 |	Aspect about 2 so a lot of the homes
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:11,776	| IOT204 |	Security system
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:15,872	| IOT204 |	Interested are on the Z-Wave protocol or a lot of the lighting applications
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:18,176	| IOT204 |	Internet goes down you like for your lights
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:20,224	| IOT204 |	Still turn off and on in for that to all work
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:20,992	| IOT204 |	Together and so
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:23,552	| IOT204 |	Those are some of the reasons why is it being Z-Wave have
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:26,880	| IOT204 |	Yeah I'm taking over and then Smart Home Market in the home security Market
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:29,184	| IOT204 |	So you're saying zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:30,720	| IOT204 |	Are still a big player in this
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:33,792	| IOT204 |	And I don't disagree with that today but even if
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:35,072	| IOT204 |	CES we saw
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:35,840	| IOT204 |	2y
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:36,608	| IOT204 |	WiFi locks
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:39,936	| IOT204 |	Launch which I thought was crazy one solar-powered and one is
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:41,216	| IOT204 |	Apparently highly engineered
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:43,520	| IOT204 |	Do not require a bun
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:45,312	| IOT204 |	Watch battery life so I look at this and
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:46,592	| IOT204 |	Kind of like
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:49,152	| IOT204 |	It's so much easier I'm not saying Z-Wave and zigbee lever
EDL	00:40:49,152	00:40:49,664	| IOT204 |	Go away I'm just
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:54,016	| IOT204 |	The Hobbit smaller slice or maybe the same slice of an ever-expanding
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:58,368	| IOT204 |	I mean I think that's there's room for multiple Wireless Technologies
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:41:01,440	| IOT204 |	In the whole man we can stay on the smart home for a while
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:05,792	| IOT204 |	We've also got Bluetooth for streaming audio we've also got Bluetooth for a lot of the kids
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:07,840	| IOT204 |	Similar devices that need to connect
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:11,168	| IOT204 |	To our smartphones but you also have their a lot of you know you have
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:12,448	| IOT204 |	2700
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:14,752	| IOT204 |	Z-Wave devices available in lots of
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:15,776	| IOT204 |	Lots of different things
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:20,128	| IOT204 |	Is going on there and you have tons of zigbee devices that are out there you know everything
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:20,896	| IOT204 |	Spark plug
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:27,296	| IOT204 |	To accommodation devices and all of that and then you have the hubs Witcher getting created that has
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:28,320	| IOT204 |	Multiple Wireless
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:31,136	| IOT204 |	Technology on your smartphone you have LTE and
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:34,720	| IOT204 |	The cellular technology you have Wi-Fi you have Bluetooth for different use cases
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:35,744	| IOT204 |	I think that there is
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:38,048	| IOT204 |	Room for multiple Technologies within the home
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:41,376	| IOT204 |	Certainly as you look at the limitations of
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:47,776	| IOT204 |	Wi-Fi and we haven't really even started talking about mesh type of Technology where zigbee and Z-Wave are both messed
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:49,312	| IOT204 |	Technology since other devices
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:54,175	| IOT204 |	Talk to one another and it forms a more robust Network ways Wi-Fi is typically a
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:58,527	| IOT204 |	Star Network are you just talking into the Hub and they're addressing that with some of the
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:41:59,807	| IOT204 |	You no likey rower
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:02,367	| IOT204 |	I was going to say everybody has a mesh now
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:06,975	| IOT204 |	I certainly have that in my house
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:10,047	| IOT204 |	But that's not necessarily the way that everybody has things
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:16,447	| IOT204 |	So there's room for both of you look at the trends I mean you know the number of zigbee devices sold in the number of Z-Wave devices sold
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:22,847	| IOT204 |	Is increasing substantially every year man also has he talked about particular on those zigbee side that you know getting
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:26,943	| IOT204 |	The industrial applications as well as solution so that's also an interesting trend
EDL	00:42:26,943	00:42:27,711	| IOT204 |	I know that we
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:28,479	| IOT204 |	We haven't spoken
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:31,039	| IOT204 |	This much on the industrial Enterprise use cases by
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:31,551	| IOT204 |	Those radios
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:33,343	| IOT204 |	Trying to get traction and
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:34,111	| IOT204 |	World
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:35,135	| IOT204 |	What do you think
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:38,207	| IOT204 |	Something like Bluetooth needs to really gain adoption
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:40,255	| IOT204 |	In the Enterprise rental space
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:44,351	| IOT204 |	For one thing a lot of industrial applications and actually if you look at the
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:46,655	| IOT204 |	Hundreds of our Rio tea business
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:49,983	| IOT204 |	There are tons and tons of industrial applications unit
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:52,799	| IOT204 |	Factory automation Smart City applications
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:59,199	| IOT204 |	United listen to Smart Home in a lot of the 7-year look at retail and you look at Commercial Lighting and all of these sorts of things that again
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:43:00,991	| IOT204 |	I'm actually in the industrial space there's
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:06,879	| IOT204 |	An even wider variety of Wireless protocols there's the standards that we've been talking about what we actually have a
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:07,903	| IOT204 |	Substantial
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:09,183	| IOT204 |	Proprietary business
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:13,023	| IOT204 |	In Wireless that supports a lot of the Legacy protocols and a lot of the companies
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:14,303	| IOT204 |	What's the weather
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:18,399	| IOT204 |	Exactly where you know clear connect to her I think we have
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:24,799	| IOT204 |	Yeah we have over 50 Wireless protocols running on our wireless gecko platform so one of the things about our Hardware
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:28,383	| IOT204 |	You can run all of these different protocols on it Digby Z-Wave
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:29,151	| IOT204 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:35,551	| IOT204 |	And the light but you can also run some of the Legacy ones in a lot of people want to run you know what Legacy protocol they want to be able to up
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:41,439	| IOT204 |	Date to a more modern protocol like Bluetooth or certainly Digby or even thread and a lot of times they want to have
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:47,839	| IOT204 |	You know where you want to connect to a device with your smartphone directly as opposed to having to go over the network and the United Pursuit
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:48,351	| IOT204 |	Vision North
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:55,263	| IOT204 |	Controls are beacons assisted wide variety of applications that people like to use in an industrial
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:58,847	| IOT204 |	Space and so it could be having flexibility upgradability
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:05,247	| IOT204 |	And also multi-protocol capability are all things that are really attractive in the industrial space so you know what I think you see
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:11,647	| IOT204 |	A trend towards moving towards more of the standards but also the need to remain backwards compatible with the networks that are all
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:12,415	| IOT204 |	Already deployed
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:14,975	| IOT204 |	So that's a challenge but also I think an opportunity
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:15,999	| IOT204 |	In the industrial area
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:17,791	| IOT204 |	Last week I wrote about Bluetooth
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:20,863	| IOT204 |	Because I think there's a lot of change happening
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:21,887	| IOT204 |	With that standard
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:23,935	| IOT204 |	It's gone from controlling
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:26,239	| IOT204 |	My speaker with my smart phone or headphones
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:29,567	| IOT204 |	And now it's just trying to be everywhere to everything.
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:32,639	| IOT204 |	Talk to me about where you see Bluetooth going and how that's
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:37,247	| IOT204 |	Yeah I mean we're definitely seeing strong demand for Bluetooth
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:38,783	| IOT204 |	It'll be a lie and then
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:44,671	| IOT204 |	The emergence of the Bluetooth mesh technology and it's in a wide range of applications you know from Smart Home
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:45,695	| IOT204 |	Including the voice assistant
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:50,047	| IOT204 |	You got residential lighting connected toys home automation devices
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:56,447	| IOT204 |	Controllers in a smart locks are a good example if you know where you can unlock enough indicate and pom appliances you know
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:57,727	| IOT204 |	Coffee makers
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:44:59,519	| IOT204 |	And robotic devices and
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:02,591	| IOT204 |	Proliferation of Bluetooth in a lot of bees
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:03,615	| IOT204 |	Differin application
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:07,967	| IOT204 |	And then you also see a lot going on it in the China Market we just announced
EDL	00:45:07,967	00:45:14,367	| IOT204 |	You know what xiaomi which is out of the apple of China they have been a great echo system with the vehicle system there
EDL	00:45:14,367	00:45:17,439	| IOT204 |	Selling scooters in the US but they sell thousands of different devices
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:22,559	| IOT204 |	In China they're working on Bluetooth matching so we've partnered with them and are one of the first companies with it
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:24,351	| IOT204 |	Bluetooth mesh stack that people can
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:25,119	| IOT204 |	Take out the
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:31,519	| IOT204 |	Play Weston design products for so a lot of different things going on in the Bluetooth Market
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:32,543	| IOT204 |	Familiar with
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:35,871	| IOT204 |	Because the camera the wyze camera the $20 one
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:37,919	| IOT204 |	I know 1.5 million if you guys have
EDL	00:45:38,431	00:45:41,503	| IOT204 |	That is actually looks just like xiaomi scammer
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:42,783	| IOT204 |	So there you go
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:43,551	| IOT204 |	All right
EDL	00:45:43,551	00:45:44,319	| IOT204 |	What are the things
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:45,343	| IOT204 |	To Tappan fairly recent
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:46,879	| IOT204 |	Italy is Amazon buy
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:49,439	| IOT204 |	Eero and we see a lot of
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:50,207	| IOT204 |	Bigger company
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:53,535	| IOT204 |	The smaller kind of startups that
EDL	00:45:53,535	00:45:54,559	| IOT204 |	Iot space
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:56,095	| IOT204 |	I don't think that's weird or anything
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:45:57,375	| IOT204 |	But I'm curious
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:59,167	| IOT204 |	What happens from a
EDL	00:45:59,167	00:45:59,935	| IOT204 |	Product design
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:01,471	| IOT204 |	Perspective and how that affects
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:02,495	| IOT204 |	You know your business
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:03,775	| IOT204 |	1
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:06,079	| IOT204 |	It's possible that all your individual customers
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:07,871	| IOT204 |	Consolidate under just a few customers
EDL	00:46:07,871	00:46:08,895	| IOT204 |	Which doesn't seem
EDL	00:46:08,895	00:46:10,687	| IOT204 |	Great or two maybe they've got
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:11,967	| IOT204 |	Better relationships
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:12,991	| IOT204 |	Play other chip providers in there
EDL	00:46:13,503	00:46:14,783	| IOT204 |	Lab
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:21,183	| IOT204 |	I think that in the case of Amazon in particular it's pretty interesting every Nero has been a great partner of ours and the 15
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:25,023	| IOT204 |	84 radio in there that run spread is one that we've worked on with them
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:31,423	| IOT204 |	And that's a great mess technology in the home and can be an enabler in a window into all the other devices and then you've got ring
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:32,703	| IOT204 |	You know they came in
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:39,103	| IOT204 |	With the home security system and that was actually Z-Wave technology and natively with Amazon they've got Ziggy technology
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:42,175	| IOT204 |	So I think that you know what you talk about the multiple protocols
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:47,551	| IOT204 |	Those all come together in that way but it's also you have the larger companies while they're going to build a lot of things
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:50,367	| IOT204 |	I think they're also trying to enable
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:51,903	| IOT204 |	A broader ecosystem of
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:58,303	| IOT204 |	Providers and really streamlined the interface for people in the home you know whether it's a voice interface or getting devices to
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:47:04,703	| IOT204 |	Work together or to provide the gateways into do levels of integration that any individual company might not make so I think
EDL	00:47:04,703	00:47:08,031	| IOT204 |	Actually opens up opportunity not just for us
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:14,431	| IOT204 |	Provide silicon into those applications but actually it will accelerate the adoption of these iot Tech
EDL	00:47:14,431	00:47:15,967	| IOT204 |	Technologies and make them more accessible
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:18,015	| IOT204 |	So in your position
EDL	00:47:18,015	00:47:19,039	| IOT204 |	I feel like you are
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:25,951	| IOT204 |	Right there where you can see what's happening and iot the big trends that we should be thinking about going forward
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:28,511	| IOT204 |	I know probably a year ago you and I talked about
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:31,327	| IOT204 |	Improving Security on the chip side for iot
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:32,607	| IOT204 |	I know you guys
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:34,399	| IOT204 |	Are doing that with some second-generation
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:35,423	| IOT204 |	Products
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:36,959	| IOT204 |	And we can talk about specifics around
EDL	00:47:36,959	00:47:41,823	| IOT204 |	So curious what else are you guys seeing and thinking about designing in
EDL	00:47:41,823	00:47:43,359	| IOT204 |	Next Generation silicon
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:45,919	| IOT204 |	If we're talking just about silicon
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:47,455	| IOT204 |	Security is a big part
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:48,991	| IOT204 |	And that's really getting
EDL	00:47:48,991	00:47:50,527	| IOT204 |	You know payment grade
EDL	00:47:50,527	00:47:56,927	| IOT204 |	Type of security you know like what you'd be using with a smart card or the SIM card in your smartphone but being able to get the
EDL	00:47:56,927	00:47:58,207	| IOT204 |	Daughter to costpoint
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:48:04,607	| IOT204 |	And to be able to execute that was really really low power consumption that can be appropriate for iot devices and then
EDL	00:48:04,607	00:48:11,007	| IOT204 |	Figuring out how to make that standards of security is absolutely a big part of what we're doing it's a part of our first gen but
EDL	00:48:11,007	00:48:12,799	| IOT204 |	We're doing further optimization and
EDL	00:48:12,799	00:48:14,591	| IOT204 |	Integration on the 2nd gen
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:15,615	| IOT204 |	Products and then
EDL	00:48:15,615	00:48:21,759	| IOT204 |	You just look at you know as you're pushing silicon technology along you know driving power consumption for longer battery life
EDL	00:48:22,271	00:48:26,111	| IOT204 |	Driving longer-range the same time increasing the
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:30,207	| IOT204 |	Yeah the memory in the microcontroller functionality so that you can design
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:33,791	| IOT204 |	You know some basically you can think about it is fairly simple
EDL	00:48:33,791	00:48:37,119	| IOT204 |	AI type of functionalities that you can do more processing
EDL	00:48:37,119	00:48:42,751	| IOT204 |	And do more intelligent looking at sensors and things like that within the same footprint of cost then
EDL	00:48:42,751	00:48:43,775	| IOT204 |	Within the same footprint
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:50,175	| IOT204 |	Power and so that's what's really exciting about the Next Generation silicon as well as just being able to have it work over and Eva
EDL	00:48:50,175	00:48:51,711	| IOT204 |	Broader range of applications
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:52,991	| IOT204 |	How do you think the world
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:54,015	| IOT204 |	Which change
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:48:58,623	| IOT204 |	Technology industry would need to change if we actually wanted to build
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:49:00,159	| IOT204 |	An internet of things that
EDL	00:49:00,159	00:49:00,927	| IOT204 |	Add more
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:03,487	| IOT204 |	Local control in maybe
EDL	00:49:03,487	00:49:04,767	| IOT204 |	A lot less data going up
EDL	00:49:05,279	00:49:06,047	| IOT204 |	Cloud
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:09,119	| IOT204 |	Are focuses primarily on the devices
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:15,519	| IOT204 |	At the very edge the sensors and no devices that we all think about is connected and we also work
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:18,079	| IOT204 |	At the Gateway level to make sure that they're all talking
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:21,407	| IOT204 |	To one another but if you talk about the limitations at the very edge
EDL	00:49:21,407	00:49:27,551	| IOT204 |	In many cases I mean if you think about the tens of billions of iot devices being deployed you're not going to run a wire
EDL	00:49:27,551	00:49:28,319	| IOT204 |	Every one of them
EDL	00:49:28,319	00:49:30,111	| IOT204 |	And so you end up with
EDL	00:49:30,111	00:49:36,511	| IOT204 |	That's substantial number of these devices with fundamental constraints on the amount of power you talked about it.
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:42,911	| IOT204 |	Door lock with a solar cell or something like that energy harvesting is one way but it's really hard to guarantee 100% of the
EDL	00:49:42,911	00:49:43,935	| IOT204 |	Time that that works
EDL	00:49:43,935	00:49:49,567	| IOT204 |	So you're stuck with the little coin cell battery is or things like that and you don't want to replace them very often and that's it
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:53,919	| IOT204 |	Fundamental you no limit as to another trade-off between the battery life
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:57,759	| IOT204 |	And the amount of processing that's done in so that's why we've had just a
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:50:01,855	| IOT204 |	Tremendous focus on being able to integrate more memory more processing power
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:08,255	| IOT204 |	You know more clever since our interfaces and ways of communicating more efficiently so that you can maximize the song
EDL	00:50:08,255	00:50:09,023	| IOT204 |	Functionality
EDL	00:50:09,023	00:50:09,791	| IOT204 |	Within
EDL	00:50:09,791	00:50:11,327	| IOT204 |	Given energy
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:14,655	| IOT204 |	I think at this very very edge there's a lot of innovation
EDL	00:50:14,655	00:50:15,679	| IOT204 |	Going there
EDL	00:50:15,679	00:50:16,703	| IOT204 |	And
EDL	00:50:16,703	00:50:23,103	| IOT204 |	You know as well as innovating around use cases in the partitioning of the processing that's there and at the Gateway and how much gets up to the
EDL	00:50:23,103	00:50:29,247	| IOT204 |	The clouds I think there's a huge amount of innovation I think one of the wireless protocols also kind of play into that a little bit as though
EDL	00:50:29,247	00:50:33,087	| IOT204 |	To the extent that they can become more spectrally efficient or you can drive
EDL	00:50:33,087	00:50:39,231	| IOT204 |	You no further optimization of the power consumption at the wireless level that that also opens up a little bit more opportune
EDL	00:50:39,231	00:50:44,095	| IOT204 |	30 as well but the architecture you know within the data center in the cloud has made
EDL	00:50:44,095	00:50:48,191	| IOT204 |	Huge strides but as you push that further down it starts to look a little bit different
EDL	00:50:48,191	00:50:51,263	| IOT204 |	All right will Tyson thank you so much for coming on the show today
EDL	00:50:51,775	00:50:53,055	| IOT204 |	All right I really appreciate
EDL	00:50:53,055	00:50:56,127	| IOT204 |	You taking the time to talk to us it's exciting to see what's going on out there
