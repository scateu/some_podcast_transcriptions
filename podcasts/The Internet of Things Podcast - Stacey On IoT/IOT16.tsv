EDL	00:00:03,840	00:00:10,240	| IOT16 |	Hey everybody this is the intern
EDL	00:00:10,240	00:00:12,032	| IOT16 |	Things podcast with your house
EDL	00:00:12,544	00:00:13,312	| IOT16 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:14,848	00:00:17,408	| IOT16 |	Stacy Higginbotham somehow we switched roles
EDL	00:00:17,408	00:00:20,224	| IOT16 |	I decided I decided I'd I switch it up a little
EDL	00:00:20,224	00:00:21,760	| IOT16 |	Because today I am a
EDL	00:00:21,760	00:00:24,832	| IOT16 |	Recording for my hotel room in Aspen and Kevin Ware YouTube
EDL	00:00:25,344	00:00:28,928	| IOT16 |	In the home office in Pennsylvania
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:36,096	| IOT16 |	It is truly wonderful I am here for Fortune's brainstorm Tech event where I've I'm hoping to bring back all kinds of insights
EDL	00:00:36,096	00:00:38,400	| IOT16 |	About the internet of things that I would share with you next week
EDL	00:00:38,400	00:00:41,216	| IOT16 |	I should also note that this week we don't have a guest
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:44,288	| IOT16 |	Because travel uncertainties and we have
EDL	00:00:44,288	00:00:46,080	| IOT16 |	I guess a lot of the guests this week or traveling
EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:48,640	| IOT16 |	Try really hard to become but
EDL	00:00:48,640	00:00:50,432	| IOT16 |	People were just like nope can't do it
EDL	00:00:50,944	00:00:51,712	| IOT16 |	Gone
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:55,040	| IOT16 |	Vacation time so you're going to have to make do with Kevin and I
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:59,136	| IOT16 |	Cuz we we ate are Wheaties this morning had a little too much caffeine
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:00,160	| IOT16 |	Say a little hyper
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:04,768	| IOT16 |	And you also have less oxygen than I do being at a higher altitude so this ought to be interesting
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:06,048	| IOT16 |	Superfund
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:08,096	| IOT16 |	Alright so this week show we're going to
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:14,240	| IOT16 |	Start with some news we're going to move into Target new Internet of Things store and we're going to talk about the wide world of
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:15,520	| IOT16 |	Sports in The Internet of Things
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:18,336	| IOT16 |	All right
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:19,104	| IOT16 |	So
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:19,616	| IOT16 |	News
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:20,896	| IOT16 |	This week
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:22,176	| IOT16 |	Red
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:23,968	| IOT16 |	We talked about it a little bit last week
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:25,504	| IOT16 |	This week
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:27,040	| IOT16 |	The red group
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:27,552	| IOT16 |	Which is
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:30,112	| IOT16 |	For those of you guys who did not listen last week
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:34,464	| IOT16 |	Is a wireless protocol kind of Bluetooth
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:35,232	| IOT16 |	4
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:37,536	| IOT16 |	Connecting devices in The Internet of Things
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:41,632	| IOT16 |	And these guys are announcing officially that they are
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:44,192	| IOT16 |	Launching a certification program
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:46,752	| IOT16 |	Suggest like Wi-Fi products are certified
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:48,800	| IOT16 |	Going to be certified
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:50,848	| IOT16 |	That certification program will be out
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:53,920	| IOT16 |	And developed for September of this year
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:55,968	| IOT16 |	They also announced that Qualcomm
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:59,296	| IOT16 |	Is joining the thread Group which means that
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:00,064	| IOT16 |	Companies like
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:01,344	| IOT16 |	Guest
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:02,368	| IOT16 |	Freescale
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:03,136	| IOT16 |	Silicon labs
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:04,672	| IOT16 |	Samsung
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:05,952	| IOT16 |	Everybody is everybody
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:08,256	| IOT16 |	Yes lots of people I'm I'm I'm drawing a blank
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:09,536	| IOT16 |	There's Big Ass Fans
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,048	| IOT16 |	Since mother company
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,584	| IOT16 |	Where to but Qualcomm
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:14,912	| IOT16 |	You know is it me or is Qualcomm
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:15,680	| IOT16 |	Trying to
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:19,520	| IOT16 |	Do what they do with wireless charging throw the best way to say it
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:23,616	| IOT16 |	We had three wireless charging standards and Qualcomm got involved with all three
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,408	| IOT16 |	Separate standards hoping to
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:27,456	| IOT16 |	You know I guess pick the winner
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:29,760	| IOT16 |	Can I get to the about on everywhere's you're bound to win something
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:36,160	| IOT16 |	I think they're doing this as well here because they already had all seen all join and
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:38,208	| IOT16 |	I'm going to stop you right there because
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:39,232	| IOT16 |	Austine
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:40,512	| IOT16 |	And all join
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:43,584	| IOT16 |	Qualcomm is a founding member of the all seeing Alliance
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:45,888	| IOT16 |	Call doll join
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:48,960	| IOT16 |	So all join is actually further up the stack
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,496	| IOT16 |	It's not a wireless
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:53,568	| IOT16 |	So it's a little bit different
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:54,848	| IOT16 |	EXO thread
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:56,384	| IOT16 |	Is a wireless protocol
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:58,944	| IOT16 |	Also that's just the radios and how they talk to each other
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:01,248	| IOT16 |	Is
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:01,760	| IOT16 |	Housing
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:06,624	| IOT16 |	How how once the radios are talk to each other this is actually how the software way up there
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:08,672	| IOT16 |	Talks to each other like how devices talk to each other
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:12,256	| IOT16 |	Alright so they're getting involved in a different layer in the stack but
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,792	| IOT16 |	Okay I get it
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:17,376	| IOT16 |	So thread competes with zigbee
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,144	| IOT16 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,448	| IOT16 |	Bluetooth especially Bluetooth mesh
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:21,728	| IOT16 |	And
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:22,240	| IOT16 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,032	| IOT16 |	All seeing
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:24,800	| IOT16 |	Competes within
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,824	| IOT16 |	Games like iotivity
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:26,848	| IOT16 |	Probably
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:27,872	| IOT16 |	Brillo
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:30,688	| IOT16 |	We've we're not sure cuz we haven't seen that yet
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:32,736	| IOT16 |	Yeah probably homekit
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:34,272	| IOT16 |	So that's that's where those off
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:35,808	| IOT16 |	Right right right
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:40,672	| IOT16 |	I know
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:48,096	| IOT16 |	It's funny because you know one of the things that we said for years actually before we doing this show is this just so many stand
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:48,864	| IOT16 |	Nerds and
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:52,960	| IOT16 |	Methods and protocols and all it's all very confusing to the
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,752	| IOT16 |	For the young product buyer
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:59,104	| IOT16 |	It's challenging if your do-it-yourself or because you got a hope you're picking the right
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:01,664	| IOT16 |	Particle products and Salon
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:02,944	| IOT16 |	And
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:05,248	| IOT16 |	I like to see consolidation
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:08,832	| IOT16 |	So I guess in a way this is good but it really doesn't
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,624	| IOT16 |	Consolidate much at all dozen
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,136	| IOT16 |	Will wait
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:18,047	| IOT16 |	Okay I'm waiting here comes some more news that honestly if for the normal and consumer is it going to be
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:18,815	| IOT16 |	Mean much but
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:20,351	| IOT16 |	Silicon labs
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:22,655	| IOT16 |	Also this week is announcing
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:24,191	| IOT16 |	Pet products
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:26,495	| IOT16 |	Better made using silicon labs
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:27,775	| IOT16 |	Zigbee chips
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:30,591	| IOT16 |	They're releasing software that will make
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:31,615	| IOT16 |	Those chips
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,151	| IOT16 |	Updatable
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:33,919	| IOT16 |	To the
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:34,943	| IOT16 |	Thread standard
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,735	| IOT16 |	Through an over-the-air
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:40,063	| IOT16 |	Cell phone case with a safer bet if you go this route
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:43,903	| IOT16 |	So yes so it's possible that very soon
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,439	| IOT16 |	If you have zigbee chips and things
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:47,999	| IOT16 |	Those chips will be using
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,559	| IOT16 |	Threat but you as a consumer will never know
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:54,143	| IOT16 |	Right and because there's a certification process
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,447	| IOT16 |	You shouldn't have to worry about standardization in the Prada
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:59,775	| IOT16 |	Right and you as a consumer aren't going to actually be looking for assertive
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:01,567	| IOT16 |	Vacation until after September
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:04,127	| IOT16 |	Because while they announce the certification program
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,151	| IOT16 |	It doesn't actually
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,199	| IOT16 |	This. This is another case
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:10,015	| IOT16 |	Announced thread-like over a year
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,087	| IOT16 |	So
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:14,879	| IOT16 |	Again it does not pay to be on the
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,159	| IOT16 |	It's just very mental
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:20,511	| IOT16 |	It's new and it's very expensive that I can attest to and nsu's head
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:23,839	| IOT16 |	We don't know nothing about weave and Brillo because that's
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,375	| IOT16 |	A token question of a will
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,911	| IOT16 |	That work with red
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,423	| IOT16 |	Or not
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,215	| IOT16 |	I imagine
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:29,983	| IOT16 |	It has to
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:32,543	| IOT16 |	Because they are working with nest
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,079	| IOT16 |	It's separate from
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:36,127	| IOT16 |	But
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:41,759	| IOT16 |	I can't imagine that Google would spend 3.2 billion dollars on nest
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:42,527	| IOT16 |	West Indies
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:44,319	| IOT16 |	Was one of the founding members of
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:46,367	| IOT16 |	Thread for you would be like
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,647	| IOT16 |	Yeah you know what let's
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:49,183	| IOT16 |	Let's do something to totally does
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:56,863	| IOT16 |	You would think so I agree with you that makes sense however I wouldn't have expected the big nest news
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:57,887	| IOT16 |	The month ago to be
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:04,543	| IOT16 |	We've branded are cameras with Dropcam cameras is nest dropcam's and we've got a slightly updated
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:07,615	| IOT16 |	Well I would expect that that is Tony fadell all over
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,895	| IOT16 |	That is like
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:11,967	| IOT16 |	I have learned so much from my dears at Apple
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:13,247	| IOT16 |	Let us make a baby
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,015	| IOT16 |	HooHa
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:14,527	| IOT16 |	Overall apus
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,879	| IOT16 |	+
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:21,695	| IOT16 |	You know kind of geeky kind of nerdy
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,231	| IOT16 |	Here's some less nerdy
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,023	| IOT16 |	This is
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,839	| IOT16 |	Sort of if you like these products
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,631	| IOT16 |	The Amazon
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,399	| IOT16 |	Echo
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,423	| IOT16 |	Now works with
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:36,287	| IOT16 |	Which we talked about last week not knowing
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,567	| IOT16 |	They were going to do this
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:42,431	| IOT16 |	We were actually talking about will you mention that you spent I think $180 on
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,223	| IOT16 |	120 on
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:46,527	| IOT16 |	Lync light bulb switch work with wink
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:51,903	| IOT16 |	And they also work with the Philips Hue so with your Hue bridge and your Echo you could
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:52,927	| IOT16 |	I'll say
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,719	| IOT16 |	Unofficially control you
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,999	| IOT16 |	Wink bulbs
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:58,047	| IOT16 |	But now you can officially to it
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,863	| IOT16 |	Right in doing that actually
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:04,447	| IOT16 |	Also last week or maybe the week before noticed
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:07,519	| IOT16 |	Wink support was listed on the Amazon Echo website
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:11,615	| IOT16 |	I didn't think it was a big deal I just thought oh hey
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,639	| IOT16 |	There's wink support there
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:17,503	| IOT16 |	But then I made a hoo-ha about it last week
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,295	| IOT16 |	I had a scoop and didn't realize it
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,575	| IOT16 |	I did not get it
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,903	| IOT16 |	Will update the although
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:28,511	| IOT16 |	So after I guess over a week of turning my GE link
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:30,047	| IOT16 |	Light bulbs on and off
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:32,095	| IOT16 |	What do little
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:35,167	| IOT16 |	What I know I'm going to go out and buy some
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,191	| IOT16 |	What's going on
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:39,007	| IOT16 |	So what's happening is I'll tell Alexa
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:41,055	| IOT16 |	How to turn the light kitchen lights off
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,615	| IOT16 |	In all but one will turn off
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:46,175	| IOT16 |	Let me stop you right there
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:46,943	| IOT16 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:51,039	| IOT16 |	There's something I did learn and covering the non scoop news last week was
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:57,951	| IOT16 |	Where do you have some groups because you can't group them in the Wink app you have to group them in the Alexa app
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:59,231	| IOT16 |	They are grouped in the Alexa
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,767	| IOT16 |	Oh that's a glitch
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:02,815	| IOT16 |	It is it's
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:05,119	| IOT16 |	Popping up more and more often is a Different Light
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,143	| IOT16 |	Every time
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:08,703	| IOT16 |	So I have to tell it to turn off twice
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,471	| IOT16 |	To get all the lights off
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,263	| IOT16 |	I'm kind of wondering
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:15,871	| IOT16 |	If there's kind of like you know how it in your browser settings or something you might clear your
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,151	| IOT16 |	Cash
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,943	| IOT16 |	Just clean everything out
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:23,551	| IOT16 |	I'm kind of wondering if there's like a the equivalent in a smart home likely work settings
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:26,623	| IOT16 |	Or in Echo I have no idea cuz it
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,903	| IOT16 |	It kind of feels like that
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,183	| IOT16 |	Terror
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:31,743	| IOT16 |	I would say it's worth a shot if you don't mind
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:35,839	| IOT16 |	You know unlinking all of your lights and and rediscovering them and regrouping them
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,631	| IOT16 |	I'm going to bet you that works
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:40,959	| IOT16 |	So again in Aspen now but this is this is the reporting
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,239	| IOT16 |	The tappening
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:46,079	| IOT16 |	EXO next show I'll have regrouped and see if that pops up again in
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:49,919	| IOT16 |	You know if this is something I have to do every week I'm going to be like guys
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:50,431	| IOT16 |	This is
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:51,967	| IOT16 |	This is not
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,503	| IOT16 |	This is no bueno
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:58,623	| IOT16 |	Don't you actually don't sweat it while you're in Aspen I can use use the backdoor that that hacker created on the
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:01,183	| IOT16 |	Was it Nightline I forget what TV show
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,463	| IOT16 |	They never stopped they never got my
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:05,279	| IOT16 |	We didn't tell you that they got to be honest
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:12,447	| IOT16 |	I could I could do it except for I have to have a physical a person physically there
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,007	| IOT16 |	Button
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:19,871	| IOT16 |	Or maybe a Roomba with an extension
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:26,783	| IOT16 |	That's what I do I need to build it like a little Servo motor
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,831	| IOT16 |	You don't have it set up to hit the button for me
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:30,879	| IOT16 |	Little bits
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,183	| IOT16 |	What you don't have a telepresence robot like the rest of us
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:35,231	| IOT16 |	I do not
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:36,767	| IOT16 |	Alright so
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:40,095	| IOT16 |	Next news item which is something cool
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:43,935	| IOT16 |	Spending a lot of time
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,471	| IOT16 |	Target
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:46,751	| IOT16 |	This
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,543	| IOT16 |	Is what I've been waiting for
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:49,311	| IOT16 |	I think
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:53,663	| IOT16 |	I have to go to San Francisco to see it but it sounds like what I've been waiting for
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,431	| IOT16 |	Which is
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,199	| IOT16 |	Target
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,479	| IOT16 |	Has introduced
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:58,271	| IOT16 |	A store concept called
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,807	| IOT16 |	Open house
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,855	| IOT16 |	At the San Francisco
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:05,951	| IOT16 |	City Target which is on 4th Street
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:09,279	| IOT16 |	Crossing mosconi Woodbury always get the clothes we didn't
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:11,327	| IOT16 |	Remember to pack on a trip to San Francisco
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,095	| IOT16 |	Exactly
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:18,495	| IOT16 |	If this is a retail concept for selling the internet of things and right now they've got about 50 company
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:19,007	| IOT16 |	He's in there
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:22,591	| IOT16 |	So if you listen to the show you are familiar with a lot of these
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,383	| IOT16 |	Companies like
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,431	| IOT16 |	Yonomi tile August
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,479	| IOT16 |	Ring Whiting
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,527	| IOT16 |	High IQ
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,551	| IOT16 |	Keep going on I'm
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:34,367	| IOT16 |	Sonos Philips Hue
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:37,439	| IOT16 |	Mimo which is a baby monitor kind of concept
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,487	| IOT16 |	Jawbone
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:44,607	| IOT16 |	I got the whole lineup in there are so many
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:45,887	| IOT16 |	It looks
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:46,655	| IOT16 |	Amazing
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:51,263	| IOT16 |	This is a story-within-a-story concept right kind of like how Samsung
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:54,079	| IOT16 |	Puts in their little mini stores in Best Buy's and such
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,871	| IOT16 |	Yes now this is the only one
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:11:01,503	| IOT16 |	This is not a concept that is going to expand for now this is a in the basement of this
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,807	| IOT16 |	The single Target in San
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:07,391	| IOT16 |	The idea is there working with these vendors
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:10,719	| IOT16 |	To show off connected devices you can go in and buy them
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:11,999	| IOT16 |	But what's really cool
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,535	| IOT16 |	Is a setup
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:17,375	| IOT16 |	Scenarios where you can see exactly how the stuff
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:17,887	| IOT16 |	Can work
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,679	| IOT16 |	Singly and
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:20,959	| IOT16 |	Importantly
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,983	| IOT16 |	How it works
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:22,751	| IOT16 |	Together
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,287	| IOT16 |	So it won't show you
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:29,151	| IOT16 |	Onesti's partner so it will show you things like how I always talked about like the works with Nest concept
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:33,247	| IOT16 |	With like the Philips Hue Lights that I like so much where if you're
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,783	| IOT16 |	Nest set to away
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:36,063	| IOT16 |	Your Philips Hue Lights will just
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,343	| IOT16 |	Turn off
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:41,695	| IOT16 |	Or if it's a two-way for more than a day your Philips Hue Lights will go into like a random
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,719	| IOT16 |	Keto on and off pattern
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:44,767	| IOT16 |	Should I boil burglars
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:47,839	| IOT16 |	So it shows you those things are shows you that
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,119	| IOT16 |	Sonos working in
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:55,519	| IOT16 |	Conjunction with the mimo baby monitor so if your baby starts stirring the Sonos can be turned on to play White Noise or
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:57,311	| IOT16 |	Lullaby so maybe the baby will go back to
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:58,079	| IOT16 |	Asleep
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:59,359	| IOT16 |	Maybe you can make your phone ring
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:02,687	| IOT16 |	I was like that is actually not my phone ringing that is that is Street noise
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:03,711	| IOT16 |	Permit Aspen
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:05,503	| IOT16 |	There's apparently a
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:09,343	| IOT16 |	But they had a pray for you very nice very nice
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:15,743	| IOT16 |	I love this idea for two reasons one of the obvious reason is it shows and expose of the cancer
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:18,559	| IOT16 |	Consumer to really what's going on in the iot world premiere
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:20,607	| IOT16 |	A retail level of a real
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,655	| IOT16 |	Use case experiential kind of
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,679	| IOT16 |	Kind of thing
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:24,959	| IOT16 |	More importantly though
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:26,239	| IOT16 |	I see these types of
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:29,055	| IOT16 |	Concept homes every year
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:31,359	| IOT16 |	At the Consumer Electronics Show
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:33,151	| IOT16 |	The difference here is
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:36,735	| IOT16 |	When I go to CVS I go to one vendor's Booth such as
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:39,295	| IOT16 |	Spell can they show me their home field with WeMo
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:41,599	| IOT16 |	Going to go to somebody else's Booth me show me all of their products
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:45,183	| IOT16 |	This is showing all of the different vendors working
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,975	| IOT16 |	Gather and that's really key
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:52,351	| IOT16 |	So the closest I've come to this is Donna which is the back-end behind Staples connect
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,399	| IOT16 |	Possibly some other
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,167	| IOT16 |	Products
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:59,519	| IOT16 |	Where they located are located in Pennsylvania I believe
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:05,151	| IOT16 |	That's right I do remember them asking me to come out I guess I should go over you should go see it it's it's this concept in Pennsylvania
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:08,223	| IOT16 |	It's actually really
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:12,063	| IOT16 |	So you could see this without going to Sanford
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:14,879	| IOT16 |	But it is so powerful to see this
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,159	| IOT16 |	Because most people
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,439	| IOT16 |	Do not buy these
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:18,975	| IOT16 |	Product you're going to buy a device
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:20,767	| IOT16 |	The one-off reason
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:23,583	| IOT16 |	And the one on his case and sometimes that one-off use case
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,887	| IOT16 |	Is really not that compelling
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:31,007	| IOT16 |	Paying 60 bucks for a light bulb because it changes color
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:33,055	| IOT16 |	Or because it's connected to your phone
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:34,847	| IOT16 |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:40,735	| IOT16 |	If Stacey doesn't weekly sorry
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:45,343	| IOT16 |	It's because I have all of these other people's voices in my head
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:48,671	| IOT16 |	With other people
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:50,463	| IOT16 |	A lot from a person to be like
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:55,071	| IOT16 |	Yes I know that my connected doorbell will flash the lights when it rings
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:57,631	| IOT16 |	Alerting me to who's at the Emmy that's
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,399	| IOT16 |	That's just
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:01,983	| IOT16 |	Angry people have it in their head up a smart home is
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:06,335	| IOT16 |	You know something like The Invasion on Star Trek for example where everything does work together
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,871	| IOT16 |	All these different things going on
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:10,943	| IOT16 |	And yet then they go in their buy one product or like this isn't what
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:14,271	| IOT16 |	Gene Roddenberry promised me this is a light bulb that changes colors what do I do
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:18,367	| IOT16 |	Showing the whole home showing how these things work together is
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,647	| IOT16 |	Really the value at
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:21,695	| IOT16 |	And showing which things
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:26,047	| IOT16 |	Work with which other things so the only other place that does that is Amazon
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:33,215	| IOT16 |	Because it's online you can actually separate in their home automation Channel which products work with which other products
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:34,239	| IOT16 |	I spend a lot of time
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:38,335	| IOT16 |	And it's one of my favorite places to buy devices because
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,383	| IOT16 |	A good prices
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,919	| IOT16 |	It shows
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:44,479	| IOT16 |	What other things can work with what other things in
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:49,343	| IOT16 |	Most retailers don't have the resources to either constantly update that
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:51,647	| IOT16 |	I mean like when I come into Home Depot a lot of the time
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:54,975	| IOT16 |	Is like the cencap jumble that is like hassled out
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:57,791	| IOT16 |	Spot it hasn't been updated
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:59,327	| IOT16 |	3 months am
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:03,679	| IOT16 |	So target has basically combined the information
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,983	| IOT16 |	Hopefully it stays up to date
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,007	| IOT16 |	Did Amazon
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:07,775	| IOT16 |	Can provide
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:08,543	| IOT16 |	With
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:10,335	| IOT16 |	Feel like demos that CES off
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:13,663	| IOT16 |	With like some clear lucite furniture that
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:14,687	| IOT16 |	Looks cool I guess
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:18,015	| IOT16 |	And like the ability to play with all these products in real life
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:18,783	| IOT16 |	In real life in this
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,575	| IOT16 |	The store experience
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:22,111	| IOT16 |	And
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:26,719	| IOT16 |	It's supposed to be disliked living lab so if you buy stuff and you hate it or it's glitchy like
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:29,791	| IOT16 |	My GE link lights are right now
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:31,071	| IOT16 |	You can bring them back
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,119	| IOT16 |	And there's no restocking fee
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:36,447	| IOT16 |	When I talk to you David Newman who I'm hoping to get on the podcast
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,215	| IOT16 |	He was like
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:43,615	| IOT16 |	You know we're going to look at that as an opportunity to do consumer research you know you bring them back you tell us what happened and we're going to talk to the
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,383	| IOT16 |	Manufacturing be like
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:45,919	| IOT16 |	Hey what's up
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:46,943	| IOT16 |	Awesome
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:50,527	| IOT16 |	I love it I love it guys I think this is just amazing
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,063	| IOT16 |	It's a lot of work
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:52,831	| IOT16 |	But
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,367	| IOT16 |	I think it's a really interesting
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:56,671	| IOT16 |	I'm telling right step in for the startups
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:16:00,255	| IOT16 |	Hopefully when you man comes on the show Hill talk about how startups
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:02,815	| IOT16 |	Can get involved because he wants to actually have
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:09,215	| IOT16 |	Startups come and show off their products even before their maybe even available to do consumer research which would be gracemore
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:10,239	| IOT16 |	And it's March
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:14,335	| IOT16 |	And this is at the Metreon Target in San Francisco and it's in the basement you say
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,103	| IOT16 |	Yes in the
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:17,919	| IOT16 |	That sounds dank and dark but it's not thinking
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:23,039	| IOT16 |	If they have a glass stairway I mean you know there's a good chance it'll be successful
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:25,343	| IOT16 |	It took last year
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,903	| IOT16 |	Just saying if it's lucite
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:30,719	| IOT16 |	Clear acrylic Furniture everywhere
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,999	| IOT16 |	They Stitch you stuff looks great
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:35,327	| IOT16 |	All right so I'm excited about this I can't wait
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,095	| IOT16 |	To go and see it
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:37,887	| IOT16 |	If you guys are in Sanford
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:38,655	| IOT16 |	Francisco
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:41,215	| IOT16 |	Check it out report back
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:42,239	| IOT16 |	Can let us know
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:43,007	| IOT16 |	And
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:44,031	| IOT16 |	When we have to
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:46,079	| IOT16 |	Keep listening because sometime this summer
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:46,591	| IOT16 |	David Newman
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:51,199	| IOT16 |	Who's in charge of this is going to come on the show and tell us all about what they've learned so far hopefully
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,223	| IOT16 |	And how you guys can
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:55,039	| IOT16 |	Thinking about all right final news item for the day or not
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,319	| IOT16 |	Just things
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,599	| IOT16 |	We're talking about thinking about is
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,135	| IOT16 |	Wimbledon
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,415	| IOT16 |	Or specifically tennis
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:03,743	| IOT16 |	I guess it would be tennis specifically with
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:05,023	| IOT16 |	Yeah that works too
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:07,327	| IOT16 |	Yeah yeah I don't play tennis
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:08,095	| IOT16 |	Well I did one
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,167	| IOT16 |	What about you
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:19,103	| IOT16 |	Play on occasion I'm away from the ratchet tennis courts down the street public tennis courts so every once in awhile when running
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:21,407	| IOT16 |	Get some exercise will go and I'll head ball
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:23,711	| IOT16 |	Really that's my problem I can never hit the ball
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:26,271	| IOT16 |	That's kind of thumb the most important part
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:27,551	| IOT16 |	That's that was my
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:30,623	| IOT16 |	So is there something in the iot world I can help you with the ball
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:31,903	| IOT16 |	Maybe
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,695	| IOT16 |	There is there are connected raqqa
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:36,767	| IOT16 |	I think my general hand-eye coordination
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,791	| IOT16 |	Even the information
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:38,303	| IOT16 |	Connect
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:41,887	| IOT16 |	I was reading this
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:44,191	| IOT16 |	Put out a piece of content marketing
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:44,959	| IOT16 |	Antenna
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:45,983	| IOT16 |	And
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,287	| IOT16 |	Contact Marquis
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:51,359	| IOT16 |	This was actually really interest
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:52,895	| IOT16 |	And
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,407	| IOT16 |	He talked about
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:54,943	| IOT16 |	And I don't know how to say this
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,015	| IOT16 |	Babolat
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,063	| IOT16 |	Belittle
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:04,671	| IOT16 |	So this is a I believe it's actually a French
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:07,743	| IOT16 |	Direction compass
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,863	| IOT16 |	Connected tennis racket
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:14,911	| IOT16 |	And because they make
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:17,471	| IOT16 |	Connected tennis rackets they believe that by 2020
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:19,775	| IOT16 |	Everybody will be using smart tennis racket
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:22,847	| IOT16 |	That's because they are just so amazing and what they do
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:25,407	| IOT16 |	How you move the racket
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:28,735	| IOT16 |	How the ball hits the racket the strength of your serve all of this
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,247	| IOT16 |	Information
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:32,063	| IOT16 |	And they're transmitting it to the players
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:38,463	| IOT16 |	Real-time but also making video analysis immediately after the matches available to them
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:40,255	| IOT16 |	Yeah this is a this is actually a
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,791	| IOT16 |	Market that we
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:47,679	| IOT16 |	Probably should talk about more when we talked about IRT and and big data and such as a sports Market
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:49,727	| IOT16 |	Because there's so much information
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,519	| IOT16 |	Available or
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:53,567	| IOT16 |	Well it's hard to get that information
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:57,407	| IOT16 |	Without sensors in you know the tennis ball soccer balls whatever maybe
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:59,711	| IOT16 |	Golf clubs now on tennis rackets
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:05,599	| IOT16 |	You know that's all feedback to athletes didn't even Spectators I mean like I'm always watching golf
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:09,695	| IOT16 |	And they have the little ball Tracer that shows where the ball is going after
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:12,767	| IOT16 |	It's been hit the swing speed the height and all this
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:14,303	| IOT16 |	It's just amazing and it
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,839	| IOT16 |	It's more immersive experience both
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:18,911	| IOT16 |	Observer and probably as an athlete
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:20,959	| IOT16 |	To travel information it's just we don't
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:23,007	| IOT16 |	I don't think about it that much
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:29,151	| IOT16 |	What I thought was really kind of interesting as IBM talks about giving some of this data out to like
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:33,247	| IOT16 |	Coaches so you could actually coach someone playing against arrival
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,271	| IOT16 |	Based on this data
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:36,831	| IOT16 |	Yeah so
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:38,879	| IOT16 |	I mean if you feedback in the incredible
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:39,647	| IOT16 |	Inside
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:41,183	| IOT16 |	That that to me was just kind of
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:41,951	| IOT16 |	Crazy so
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:49,631	| IOT16 |	Idea was imagine playing against big Champions like Rafael Nadal
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,191	| IOT16 |	Which
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,983	| IOT16 |	I don't think that's possible and so
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,519	| IOT16 |	If the other thing is
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:58,335	| IOT16 |	This kind of information from the racket
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:00,383	| IOT16 |	Befuddled real-time 2
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:02,943	| IOT16 |	You know a smartwatch which could deliver
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:04,735	| IOT16 |	Haptic feedback to a person
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:08,575	| IOT16 |	But I know that on Wimbledon you know they don't allow coaching
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,087	| IOT16 |	For the sidelines
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:11,135	| IOT16 |	And I don't
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:13,951	| IOT16 |	No sale of smart watches at Wimbledon but you know
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:16,767	| IOT16 |	You can get coaching almost immediately
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:17,535	| IOT16 |	From a smartwatch
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:18,047	| IOT16 |	Watch which means
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:22,655	| IOT16 |	I think they would disallow that in competitions but it you know it's 4
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:23,679	| IOT16 |	Amateur
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:24,447	| IOT16 |	Regular people
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:25,983	| IOT16 |	That's pretty useful
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:27,263	| IOT16 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:29,567	| IOT16 |	Well it is not just your equipment
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:31,615	| IOT16 |	I mean equipment is the first thing
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,383	| IOT16 |	Because you know you
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:33,663	| IOT16 |	You've got
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:37,503	| IOT16 |	It's obvious that the instrument equipment
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:38,271	| IOT16 |	PocketInvEditor
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:43,903	| IOT16 |	It's also something that people already spend a lot of money on if you're even a amateur
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:46,463	| IOT16 |	Actually if you play a sport very seriously
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:49,023	| IOT16 |	You're willing to spend a crazy amount of money on it
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:49,791	| IOT16 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:52,095	| IOT16 |	So we're going to start seeing like sensors in clothing
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:54,143	| IOT16 |	You can already buy
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,423	| IOT16 |	Sensor embedded shirts
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:57,983	| IOT16 |	Socks 511
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,007	| IOT16 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:02,335	| IOT16 |	How do you make the
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:03,615	| IOT16 |	Best
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:06,687	| IOT16 |	That has sensors and it to monitor my heart rate
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:10,015	| IOT16 |	And my respiration rate and so on so when I go for a run
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:12,831	| IOT16 |	It's real time sending that information right to my phone
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:13,855	| IOT16 |	Did it help you
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:14,623	| IOT16 |	I got tired
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:19,488	| IOT16 |	Give me good feedback
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:25,888	| IOT16 |	All joking aside I like to work in certain heart rate zones for certain types of workouts like my Speedway
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:27,424	| IOT16 |	Working at Temple work
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:31,008	| IOT16 |	And I'm going too fast or I'm working too hard. I shouldn't
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:33,312	| IOT16 |	Be running out fast for temple workout
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:36,640	| IOT16 |	I can keep that speed up for 3 miles then obviously
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:37,408	| IOT16 |	It's going to be a wasted effort
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:40,480	| IOT16 |	So long-term yes I can help absolutely
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:42,528	| IOT16 |	Did it give you feedback right away
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:43,808	| IOT16 |	Pick it up later
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:44,832	| IOT16 |	No real son
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:49,696	| IOT16 |	I would think some sort of it wasn't a screen or was it have
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,720	| IOT16 |	On screen
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:51,488	| IOT16 |	So haptics
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:58,912	| IOT16 |	Sure if I if maybe you could set Target zones for the heart rate and have the data sent to the watch and when I
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:02,496	| IOT16 |	Too high new mattress too high you need to slow down
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:05,568	| IOT16 |	How do you get a double tap if I'm going too slow and get a single tap Shore
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:07,104	| IOT16 |	Cuz that's that's what I think
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:09,152	| IOT16 |	Really awesome
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:16,064	| IOT16 |	Absolutely and you know all these sensors don't have to be embedded in these things going back to the tennis bed and I and I said
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:20,160	| IOT16 |	Because there was a Kickstarter That was supposed to deliver in January still hasn't so
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:22,720	| IOT16 |	I'm not advocating go get this by any means but
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:28,608	| IOT16 |	They have a company came out with a shot stats Challenger to a way to make your tennis racket smart
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:31,424	| IOT16 |	It literally is it it looks like a
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:34,496	| IOT16 |	A racket dampener for people who do play tennis and what that is
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:38,336	| IOT16 |	Except it has a small screen on it's got sensors inside and you can
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:41,920	| IOT16 |	Measure you know the speed of your swing the speed of your servant
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:44,992	| IOT16 |	The angle of the racket when you hit the ball and so on so
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:48,832	| IOT16 |	Yeah you can add these to regular tennis rackets
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:53,952	| IOT16 |	I'm sure it goes for all types of sport II I've seen things you can attach the golf clubs for personal information so
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:57,280	| IOT16 |	If we don't have to embed all this right in this equipment is what
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:01,632	| IOT16 |	I'm really intrigued by a kind of all of these option
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,680	| IOT16 |	Where they might come from
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:07,008	| IOT16 |	Eventually you should be able to stream all this data into Lake
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,800	| IOT16 |	Android Fitbit or Android Wear
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,080	| IOT16 |	Is it a better way
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:12,384	| IOT16 |	Which one which one
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:13,408	| IOT16 |	Google Fit
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:13,920	| IOT16 |	On Android
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:16,224	| IOT16 |	Google Fit Android Wear or
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:17,248	| IOT16 |	Healthkit
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,296	| IOT16 |	And perhaps
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,064	| IOT16 |	You know
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:23,136	| IOT16 |	You could use that to track you know your burgeoning shoulder injury
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:23,648	| IOT16 |	Who knows
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:25,440	| IOT16 |	If that's a potential
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:26,976	| IOT16 |	I wish I had more to say about the
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,768	| IOT16 |	But since I don't play tennis or
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,304	| IOT16 |	I don't that
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:34,144	| IOT16 |	Let's let's be honest Thrillers were talking about is cuz it's kind of cool name babala
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,936	| IOT16 |	Baba black sheep
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:36,704	| IOT16 |	I was excited
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,752	| IOT16 |	Window tinting idea
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:40,544	| IOT16 |	Play ideas like how this changes
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:42,336	| IOT16 |	And how it changed
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:43,872	| IOT16 |	Because
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:47,456	| IOT16 |	There's a lot of ways that Sports
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:48,992	| IOT16 |	With the Advent of
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:51,296	| IOT16 |	More data like it changes the way you
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:52,832	| IOT16 |	Plan your defense
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:57,696	| IOT16 |	It also changes the way that you could
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:59,232	| IOT16 |	Potentially
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:00,000	| IOT16 |	Compete
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:03,328	| IOT16 |	Can a single person Sports so Lake
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:05,376	| IOT16 |	You know what everyone has SmartWatches coaching them
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:09,472	| IOT16 |	How does that change the nature of the game does it make it faster does it make it
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:11,264	| IOT16 |	You know more precise I don't know
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:14,592	| IOT16 |	Will sit in some sense once you add the technology
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:18,432	| IOT16 |	Kind of brings a different way of competing at if you look at you know formula
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:22,528	| IOT16 |	1 cars and all the technology they have in there I mean these guys
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:25,344	| IOT16 |	Are constantly tweaking the code of their cars to make them
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:28,928	| IOT16 |	Have an advantage over other people's code in their cars and
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:35,328	| IOT16 |	It's going to be very interesting to see how that develops in terms of competitive Sports in general
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:39,168	| IOT16 |	You know every time I've gone to a supercomputing show I always see the Formula One guys
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:42,496	| IOT16 |	Actually there it's like the the racing teams
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:44,032	| IOT16 |	They're there because that's
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:45,568	| IOT16 |	Important
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,336	| IOT16 |	Cardiff
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,104	| IOT16 |	Competition
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:48,896	| IOT16 |	It would be very interesting
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:50,432	| IOT16 |	Sensors become such
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,712	| IOT16 |	An important part of
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:56,576	| IOT16 |	Cheating because these Sports don't normally kind of give a nod to technology
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:25:00,160	| IOT16 |	We need to link change sensors on the NASCAR so we don't have any accidents no no
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,696	| IOT16 |	I don't know if you are
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:06,304	| IOT16 |	I am just going to date that you're very more mechanical and electronic in those car
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:07,584	| IOT16 |	It's very
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,632	| IOT16 |	I still use manual
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:12,448	| IOT16 |	Tachometers for example they don't even have speedometers so
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:16,800	| IOT16 |	It's very much a mechanical sport compared to say Formula One
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,592	| IOT16 |	I don't people like the exit
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,384	| IOT16 |	Isn't that part of the
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:22,944	| IOT16 |	People in them certainly do not but
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:25,760	| IOT16 |	Yeah I mean I'm not going to lie there's a there's definitely
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:28,320	| IOT16 |	Portion of a Nascar fan base or racing fan base that
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:30,624	| IOT16 |	Watch it for the big one
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:35,488	| IOT16 |	It's kind of a Bittersweet saying I don't like you probably don't know this
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:37,792	| IOT16 |	Mention it
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:40,864	| IOT16 |	I'm not this past weekend but the weekend before there was a
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:42,912	| IOT16 |	Terrible accident where
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:44,192	| IOT16 |	At the finish line
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:44,960	| IOT16 |	Karwan
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:48,288	| IOT16 |	Up and over to other cars and into the catch fence at
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,312	| IOT16 |	Daytona
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:51,360	| IOT16 |	And literally the entire car
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:54,944	| IOT16 |	Went to Pieces the engine flew out for example
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,224	| IOT16 |	The front end was gone
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:59,808	| IOT16 |	Basically nothing was left with the roll cage in a little bit of sheet metal and
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:01,856	| IOT16 |	Thankfully do the safety
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:04,672	| IOT16 |	The driver did not get hurt he walked out of it but it was
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:08,768	| IOT16 |	Touch and go for the first 30 seconds after that happened me people thought this man was dead
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:10,048	| IOT16 |	And there were actually
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:11,328	| IOT16 |	Spectators that
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:14,912	| IOT16 |	Were injured from debris that didn't get caught by The Catcher And so
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:17,472	| IOT16 |	I mean it's nice to hope for these accent
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:18,240	| IOT16 |	Sputnik
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:20,032	| IOT16 |	Can be careful what you wish for yes
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:27,200	| IOT16 |	Well gosh that is such a grim. I kind of don't want to end the podcast I will send you that the YouTube video this crash and you
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:29,504	| IOT16 |	You will be will be scared for this person's life
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:31,552	| IOT16 |	Of course you know at this point he's okay but yeah
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:34,112	| IOT16 |	All right we'll add that to the show notes
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:34,624	| IOT16 |	Maybe
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,672	| IOT16 |	I'm like
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:42,048	| IOT16 |	I don't even know rather Grim so let's let's bring finish the show on an uphill and say it one more time
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:43,072	| IOT16 |	Pop-A-Lock
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,632	| IOT16 |	Or father later
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,680	| IOT16 |	No actually I
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:48,448	| IOT16 |	I realized
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:50,240	| IOT16 |	Time 45 minutes
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:50,752	| IOT16 |	Device
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:51,776	| IOT16 |	Review
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,080	| IOT16 |	All right
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,360	| IOT16 |	This week's device
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:59,200	| IOT16 |	Home connected doorbell
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:26:59,968	| IOT16 |	It's actually
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:00,992	| IOT16 |	It's the doorbell.
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:07,392	| IOT16 |	And to get the doorbell you actually have
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,160	| IOT16 |	To sign up for their monitor
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:09,696	| IOT16 |	Security system
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,000	| IOT16 |	But
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,536	| IOT16 |	People likes this
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:17,888	| IOT16 |	Doorbell so much they actually got 40,000 new sign ups
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:21,472	| IOT16 |	Jasper the freaking doorbell which is amazing
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:24,032	| IOT16 |	Just so you know what you're getting into
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:26,336	| IOT16 |	What you do Vivint offers
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,872	| IOT16 |	Connected homes
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,920	| IOT16 |	This is not a DIY project
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:31,712	| IOT16 |	Normally I don't mess with these but
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:35,808	| IOT16 |	I thought it was either I was kind of going through a connected doorbell phase
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:38,112	| IOT16 |	And I thought it was so interesting that
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:40,160	| IOT16 |	They were one of the first to offer
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:41,440	| IOT16 |	A video doorbell
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:43,744	| IOT16 |	I did I decided to happen
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:46,048	| IOT16 |	Install it so they came out and installed it be
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:47,840	| IOT16 |	Because this is that kind of product
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:53,216	| IOT16 |	They charge between 54 and $70 a month for a monitored home security product
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,776	| IOT16 |	The pricing differential there's three levels
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:58,336	| IOT16 |	It basically offers you can feel
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,616	| IOT16 |	Levels of storage
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,152	| IOT16 |	I'm in different levels look like
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:02,944	| IOT16 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:04,224	| IOT16 |	So they work with
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:05,504	| IOT16 |	Z-Wave devices
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:10,112	| IOT16 |	So they will also connect you up with other Z-Wave devices in your house
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:11,904	| IOT16 |	Nice which is kind of cool
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:14,976	| IOT16 |	Actually set up my SmartThings controller is a secondary
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:16,768	| IOT16 |	Controller it will actually go into that
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,584	| IOT16 |	Completely different podcast
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:21,888	| IOT16 |	Because it's it's worth talking about
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:23,936	| IOT16 |	The doorbell
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:24,960	| IOT16 |	Because
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:26,240	| IOT16 |	I liked it
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:27,776	| IOT16 |	It's a nice-looking doorbell
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:29,568	| IOT16 |	The most doorbell
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:33,664	| IOT16 |	Video connected doorbells it is the smallest of the
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:34,176	| IOT16 |	Ring
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:35,712	| IOT16 |	Skybell
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:36,992	| IOT16 |	Didn't
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:38,528	| IOT16 |	Doorbell trifecta
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:40,064	| IOT16 |	It is
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:42,368	| IOT16 |	About an inch and a half across
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:44,160	| IOT16 |	It's about 3 in tall
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,208	| IOT16 |	It looks like a doorbell
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:47,488	| IOT16 |	Which is really important
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:48,768	| IOT16 |	Because
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:50,816	| IOT16 |	Sometimes people get to my door
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:51,328	| IOT16 |	And they're like
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,656	| IOT16 |	Button
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:56,192	| IOT16 |	What do I do
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:59,520	| IOT16 |	The other nice thing about this is they come in and install it
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:02,848	| IOT16 |	They also is installed with a
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:06,176	| IOT16 |	And again you're going to be paying for it every month
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:10,528	| IOT16 |	So when it's installed
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:12,064	| IOT16 |	What happens is
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:13,856	| IOT16 |	If someone Rings your doorbell
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:18,720	| IOT16 |	It comes up on a security panel that they install in your house as well so you could video honest
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:21,024	| IOT16 |	On the security panel to touch screen panel
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:24,352	| IOT16 |	You also get it on any of the phone's you hook up to the doorbell
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:27,424	| IOT16 |	So I get a notification on my phone it rings on my phone
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:29,984	| IOT16 |	I'm in it sounds like a doorbell chime you can
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:32,032	| IOT16 |	China variety of chimes
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:33,824	| IOT16 |	And it will also bring
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,616	| IOT16 |	Your
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:37,664	| IOT16 |	Manual doorbell chime if you want
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:38,688	| IOT16 |	At 2 actually
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:39,968	| IOT16 |	No it does
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:41,760	| IOT16 |	It only rings through the
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:43,296	| IOT16 |	Doorbell chime
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,576	| IOT16 |	Sound through your touchpad
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:46,368	| IOT16 |	I like you guys
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:48,928	| IOT16 |	Forget that forget the

EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:53,280	| IOT16 |	Video it is instantaneous
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:54,560	| IOT16 |	So
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:55,328	| IOT16 |	It's pretty sweet
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:57,632	| IOT16 |	I will say because I spent a lot of time on the phone
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:00,960	| IOT16 |	That feature is less exciting to me because
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:02,752	| IOT16 |	I'm on the phone so
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:03,520	| IOT16 |	I'm not able to
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:06,336	| IOT16 |	You you can open Allina conversation with someone
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:09,408	| IOT16 |	You know what they're at your door and be like hey what you doing

EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:14,784	| IOT16 |	Leave the package at the door
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:18,624	| IOT16 |	Can you do that through the the display panel you can
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:23,232	| IOT16 |	Okay so you could you know hope put your phone call on hold or whenever mutant
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:25,280	| IOT16 |	Kind of. You just can't do it with the phone when
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:30,144	| IOT16 |	And I particularly can't because I have some weird phone issues
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:31,680	| IOT16 |	Attleboro
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:32,704	| IOT16 |	Well I have
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:34,496	| IOT16 |	I have the Moto X
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,520	| IOT16 |	Second generation
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,032	| IOT16 |	Verizon
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:37,568	| IOT16 |	Which
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:40,128	| IOT16 |	What's Mia it takes me off of the data Network when I'm going to
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,432	| IOT16 |	Recess
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:43,968	| IOT16 |	But that's a very
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:47,296	| IOT16 |	Unique it's a Unique Ink although if you
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:51,904	| IOT16 |	And everyone in your family has on the Verizon Moto X 2nd generation or a
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:58,304	| IOT16 |	That's better get fairy
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:00,096	| IOT16 |	What is interesting though
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:01,632	| IOT16 |	And if you hate
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:04,704	| IOT16 |	Having if you don't want to do if you don't want to go DIY
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:05,728	| IOT16 |	This is a crate
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:08,544	| IOT16 |	Product because they will actually set up
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:10,336	| IOT16 |	Garage door open
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:14,432	| IOT16 |	They set up a garage door opener so it's like the UPS man
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:15,200	| IOT16 |	Ring doorbell
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:19,040	| IOT16 |	You can actually from your phone or the control panel
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:22,880	| IOT16 |	Open your garage and tell the UPS due to leave it in your
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:25,184	| IOT16 |	Garage and then close the garage door behind the
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:30,048	| IOT16 |	You can do that from your office like 20 miles away from your house you can do it
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,328	| IOT16 |	Inside your house
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:32,096	| IOT16 |	It's pretty sweet
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:32,864	| IOT16 |	Sandy
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:33,888	| IOT16 |	Attendee
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:35,168	| IOT16 |	So
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,216	| IOT16 |	Night vision on this thing is nice
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:39,776	| IOT16 |	Steel division on it is nice
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:42,336	| IOT16 |	What other questions do people have
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,616	| IOT16 |	About connected doorbells Kevin
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:45,408	| IOT16 |	Is it hard wire
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:50,272	| IOT16 |	Or is it is there a battery it is hardwired into my existing doorbell
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:52,064	| IOT16 |	And that was a nice thing about having them
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:54,112	| IOT16 |	Install install took about an hour
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:32:01,280	| IOT16 |	Yammy most people have a doorbell wired doorbell anyway I would think and so it's a replacement for that direct replace
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:01,792	| IOT16 |	Yes
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:06,144	| IOT16 |	If I'm not mistaken these are the folks who also
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:09,984	| IOT16 |	They're did you a whole package here I mean like as you said you got the doorbell and they have
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:12,544	| IOT16 |	The garage door opener they have connected door lock
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:15,360	| IOT16 |	Calm have in house wifi cameras
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:17,152	| IOT16 |	But I think they also offer internet service
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:20,736	| IOT16 |	They do they have actually internet service in some places
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,528	| IOT16 |	Yeah
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:24,320	| IOT16 |	And they have a whole home automation f
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:26,880	| IOT16 |	I'm thinking
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:27,648	| IOT16 |	And this is important
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:29,440	| IOT16 |	Unofficial open
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:33,280	| IOT16 |	Internet home automation service although they are
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:34,560	| IOT16 |	Planning
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:36,352	| IOT16 |	But they don't have it now
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:39,424	| IOT16 |	So while they actually hooked up my
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:41,216	| IOT16 |	The secondary key
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:41,984	| IOT16 |	Control
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:44,032	| IOT16 |	So I could tie my SmartThings in through this
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:45,824	| IOT16 |	I don't know what they would do that for every
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:47,104	| IOT16 |	Ketchum
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:48,640	| IOT16 |	Did you offer lotion
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:50,176	| IOT16 |	Motion sensors door window sensors
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:51,712	| IOT16 |	It all of it's based on Z-Wave
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:53,504	| IOT16 |	So if you're a Z-Wave
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:57,088	| IOT16 |	Send or have Z-Wave stuff they can link your existing Z-Wave stuff in
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:58,368	| IOT16 |	Got that
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:01,440	| IOT16 |	You know what that's it is not bad so if you're like
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:02,208	| IOT16 |	You're kind of like
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:06,560	| IOT16 |	I've been gandaras monitored home security so if you're getting your like
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:07,840	| IOT16 |	I like monitor homes
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:08,352	| IOT16 |	Security
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:14,752	| IOT16 |	And if you if you decide to go with these guys
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:16,288	| IOT16 |	And you're going to pay the monthly fee
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:21,152	| IOT16 |	Do they give you the hardware cuz that's a pretty common
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:27,808	| IOT16 |	There you go you sign up you pay this and think of you I think it's up to $1,500 worth of the hardware free
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:29,344	| IOT16 |	How to control panels like 9
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:29,856	| IOT16 |	Hundred of that hard
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:30,880	| IOT16 |	Wow
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:34,208	| IOT16 |	Yeah the sky control panel is $900
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:36,768	| IOT16 |	I'll stick with my iPad thank you
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:38,560	| IOT16 |	Yeah it's a nice nice piano
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:40,096	| IOT16 |	So
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:43,424	| IOT16 |	Gay that smoke alarms carbon monoxide
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:44,704	| IOT16 |	Video cameras
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:45,984	| IOT16 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:49,568	| IOT16 |	Why did their offer no package just like a lot of the
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,872	| IOT16 |	Traditional isps are starting to do now
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:56,992	| IOT16 |	Yeah and it it's got cellular backup and it's primarily a cellular system
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:58,784	| IOT16 |	Which is what a lot of
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:01,600	| IOT16 |	The modern ones are which is great people like me who don't have
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:06,464	| IOT16 |	Yeah that's we still have the old ADT system and no landline now so
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:09,280	| IOT16 |	We haven't used ATT system in years because of that
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,864	| IOT16 |	That is that is our
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:13,888	| IOT16 |	Our product
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:15,168	| IOT16 |	I like it
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:21,056	| IOT16 |	I think it's kind of fun if not convinced enough to pay $54 a month
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:26,944	| IOT16 |	Ford although my husband in this biscuits into something and we're actually talking about paying
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:28,736	| IOT16 |	The monthly fee for monitored security
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:30,784	| IOT16 |	So if we do that
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:34,880	| IOT16 |	I will probably use Vivint and I will do it because they have this doorbell product
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,160	| IOT16 |	So
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:42,560	| IOT16 |	I'm not in their target audience I'd rather do it myself but you can even with the struggles and
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:45,632	| IOT16 |	I was getting things to talk to each other but there is there's definitely a big Market
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:49,728	| IOT16 |	Yeah well and the fact that I can bring in my SmartThings stuff I'm kind of like
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:51,264	| IOT16 |	Hey
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:53,312	| IOT16 |	All right
