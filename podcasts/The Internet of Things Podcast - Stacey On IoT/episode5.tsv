EDL	00:00:19,456	00:00:21,248	| episode5 |	Dunt Dunt
EDL	00:00:21,248	00:00:22,016	| episode5 |	Yeah
EDL	00:00:22,016	00:00:25,344	| episode5 |	Oh I guess I should have got a spooky music like
EDL	00:00:26,368	00:00:28,928	| episode5 |	Still working on sound effects for the show
EDL	00:00:28,928	00:00:32,512	| episode5 |	No no that's it that's that's all we have
EDL	00:00:32,512	00:00:33,280	| episode5 |	Okay then
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:35,584	| episode5 |	Or maybe that was probably more like a
EDL	00:00:35,584	00:00:36,096	| episode5 |	Wentworth
EDL	00:00:36,608	00:00:37,632	| episode5 |	Sad trombone
EDL	00:00:37,632	00:00:39,168	| episode5 |	Okay so
EDL	00:00:39,168	00:00:40,704	| episode5 |	Let's get a started with
EDL	00:00:40,704	00:00:42,496	| episode5 |	Oh I don't know what's more exciting
EDL	00:00:42,496	00:00:45,312	| episode5 |	Mysterious SEC filings are brand new Bluetooth lighting
EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:49,152	| episode5 |	We talked about letting a lot was talking about the FCC for a minute
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:49,664	| episode5 |	All right
EDL	00:00:50,176	00:00:51,200	| episode5 |	So
EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:52,224	| episode5 |	Kevin you want to kick ass off
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:59,136	| episode5 |	I would love to sew first and foremost we don't know exactly what the FCC has tested
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:00,416	| episode5 |	But they have tested something
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:03,232	| episode5 |	That would be related to internet of things we think
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:07,328	| episode5 |	Thanks to your Dave's that's over that's not funny he noticed
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:11,680	| episode5 |	A Google filing with the SEC where a device was tested a smart device
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:16,800	| episode5 |	We're not sure exactly what it is what do we know we know it has Bluetooth
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:19,104	| episode5 |	And that's it that's all we kind of know
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:23,968	| episode5 |	In terms of the internal radios and such they seen I spent some time looking at the filing
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:24,992	| episode5 |	Really couldn't
EDL	00:01:24,992	00:01:27,040	| episode5 |	Make too much heads or tails of
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:28,064	| episode5 |	What does Maybe
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:32,928	| episode5 |	Some people are saying it has to do with Google Glass I don't think so at all but
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:35,744	| episode5 |	You know because it only has Bluetooth and there was talk of
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:39,328	| episode5 |	He label in August for the FCC label
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:40,864	| episode5 |	Touch screen type device
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:44,192	| episode5 |	I was actually wondering maybe it's a beacon of some kind
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:48,544	| episode5 |	That's kind of what I looked at it that's what I thought in that we should explain for those who don't know
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:53,408	| episode5 |	Well I was going to say we should start with what an easy label is
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:57,504	| episode5 |	And why they are so the FCC has to approve any device out there with a
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,808	| episode5 |	Most of you guys probably know that
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:00,832	| episode5 |	But to those of you who don't
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:02,368	| episode5 |	So anything that has a radio
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:04,416	| episode5 |	Has to do with FCC approval because
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,696	| episode5 |	Sting's interfere in
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:06,208	| episode5 |	That's bad
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:07,232	| episode5 |	Assisi Heights
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:14,656	| episode5 |	Cuz it was bad cuz it's bad when your cell phone doesn't work cuz you got some cheap microwave oven like
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:15,680	| episode5 |	Mess with your signals
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:19,008	| episode5 |	So that's what the FCC approval label in
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:20,032	| episode5 |	You'll find it on
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:22,336	| episode5 |	Everything from Lake toys to
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:23,872	| episode5 |	High-end iot devices
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:29,760	| episode5 |	I used to have to be used to be either extra on the device to be a paper label but now they have electronic labels where
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:32,064	| episode5 |	The FCC certification IDs and such
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,088	| episode5 |	Canby
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,880	| episode5 |	Sean just like the software version on your phone
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:37,184	| episode5 |	Very nice so that's what this is
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:41,536	| episode5 |	It's it's fairly new it it was only recently that the SEC I started allowing that
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:46,144	| episode5 |	How do you say need a screen for it so it's if you don't have a screen on your device or not to have any label
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:48,448	| episode5 |	So this device has a screen
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,984	| episode5 |	See we learn something already
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,264	| episode5 |	Most vegans don't have screens
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:52,800	| episode5 |	True let's
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:57,152	| episode5 |	True and and in the testing data there was talk about normal usage
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:58,688	| episode5 |	I've only just
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:05,600	| episode5 |	5 mm between this device and something else so that kind of put the kibosh on the ibeacon thing to exist
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,112	| episode5 |	Some degree
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:10,720	| episode5 |	So okay so will it first fall will tell people what a beacon is so a beacon
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:11,744	| episode5 |	Is
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:15,328	| episode5 |	It's a device that uses Bluetooth to offer location data
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,096	| episode5 |	And it
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:18,400	| episode5 |	They basically constantly transmits to your
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,168	| episode5 |	Your phone
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:22,496	| episode5 |	And your phone if it has the appropriate app will open up an app
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:25,312	| episode5 |	Tied to that Beacon and says something like
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:28,896	| episode5 |	Hey you are here and here's what you can do based on the information that you
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,432	| episode5 |	You're here so I can be like
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:30,944	| episode5 |	Historic
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:33,760	| episode5 |	Coupon if you're in my house it could be like
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,064	| episode5 |	You have access to this liquor cabinet
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,600	| episode5 |	Or
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:40,416	| episode5 |	Do you like this
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:45,792	| episode5 |	Room this temperature and it will share data with the house that says you know there's a person in this room you should turn on lights
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,584	| episode5 |	My house is
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:49,120	| episode5 |	Isn't that smart yet but one day it will be
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:50,144	| episode5 |	I'm very excited
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:53,472	| episode5 |	So that's that's kind of the promise and Hope
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,240	| episode5 |	The beacons
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,288	| episode5 |	But this if it has a screen
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:59,360	| episode5 |	Bluetooth Google filed this on April 20th
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:02,432	| episode5 |	The Friday before I saw that Samsung filed
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:05,248	| episode5 |	For a Smart Lock with the FCC
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,552	| episode5 |	And I got all excited thinking
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,576	| episode5 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,112	| episode5 |	Samsung S introducing a Smart Lock
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:13,440	| episode5 |	But they were actually doing an nfc-based Smart Lock for the
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,464	| episode5 |	Small to medium
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,000	| episode5 |	It says business and it was actually more like
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:18,815	| episode5 |	NFC RFID kind of Base
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,583	| episode5 |	Listing with a card
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,631	| episode5 |	But that is what I learned
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,655	| episode5 |	Samsung actually had
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,935	| episode5 |	The Samsung home division over
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,471	| episode5 |	South Korea four
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,287	| episode5 |	Yahoo new
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:30,079	| episode5 |	Yeah probably everybody over himself
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:37,759	| episode5 |	So what's a nice trip so maybe then this could be a Smart Lock that ties into the holding
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,551	| episode5 |	Nest Dropcam infrastructure
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:42,879	| episode5 |	And set your phone with its Bluetooth unlock Sherlock I don't know
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:46,463	| episode5 |	And you would need a screen I mean you wouldn't need a screen but a screen
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:47,743	| episode5 |	Might work
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:48,255	| episode5 |	For that
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:52,351	| episode5 |	Will fix a touch screen there might be an alternative
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:58,751	| episode5 |	Method of Entry such as entering a PIN number or something like that
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:01,311	| episode5 |	And a lot of people that again keypads
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,847	| episode5 |	Very popular way for small business
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,383	| episode5 |	Google's actually been cut
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,663	| episode5 |	Keenan Smallville
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:10,271	| episode5 |	But whatever it is thanks for the FCC testing we know it will be safe
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:13,343	| episode5 |	Safe and not interfere with your cell phone
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,647	| episode5 |	There's Our Mysterious SC
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,415	| episode5 |	Sissy device
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,695	| episode5 |	And since we're speaking about Bluetooth
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:24,095	| episode5 |	We'll talk about lighting we do talk about it a lot but this is the first Bluetooth lighting device that actually tried
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,887	| episode5 |	It's from a company called ilumi
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,423	| episode5 |	And
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:30,495	| episode5 |	This just hit the market actually last Wednesday
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:34,847	| episode5 |	I was in New York so I didn't get a chance to fully run it through its Paces to talk about it
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:40,223	| episode5 |	Before last week's show so sorry about that you guys are a week late on this but
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:42,527	| episode5 |	I've been living with these I've had
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:46,879	| episode5 |	The two kind of air called a 19 so the normal size light bulbs
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,671	| episode5 |	And I had a down Lamp Theater
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,695	| episode5 |	Full color
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:51,487	| episode5 |	So full color LED lights
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:54,559	| episode5 |	The a19 version the normal light bulb
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:55,071	| episode5 |	Persian is
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,863	| episode5 |	89.95
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:59,679	| episode5 |	Yowza so 90 bucks they're very heavy
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:02,239	| episode5 |	And the
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:04,031	| episode5 |	Downlite is about 90 bucks
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,847	| episode5 |	I'm sorry is about 19:9
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:08,383	| episode5 |	95 Silverado hundred bucks
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:14,271	| episode5 |	But they're all Bluetooth so all you need you don't need a hug you just need your phone
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:18,623	| episode5 |	But after living with them for almost week I can tell you you
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,671	| episode5 |	You want more than your phone
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,207	| episode5 |	You want a switch
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:25,023	| episode5 |	Because the second you run out of Bluetooth range
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:28,095	| episode5 |	You can't do anything with the light
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,375	| episode5 |	So if you want to turn it off
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:31,423	| episode5 |	You got to go walk by the light bulb
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:32,959	| episode5 |	You're not
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:34,495	| episode5 |	At that point in time my God
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:36,799	| episode5 |	Why Suburban totally defeats the purpose
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:41,151	| episode5 |	Especially if you were like me and you live in a big house with an open floor plan
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:43,967	| episode5 |	Cuz you're like looking at the light across the room in your like
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:44,991	| episode5 |	I would have turned it off
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,319	| episode5 |	I got to go
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,599	| episode5 |	I got to get up and go near me
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,367	| episode5 |	To turn it off
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:52,415	| episode5 |	That's a lot of dough for
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,951	| episode5 |	Limited range light bulb
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:58,047	| episode5 |	To me but but but I will say this in the video that you took
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:02,911	| episode5 |	It was actually kind of cute your dog dancing around underneath the light switch was changing colors
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:06,239	| episode5 |	The light colors look pretty intense in my route
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:08,799	| episode5 |	They do that they're amazing so the light
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:10,335	| episode5 |	Colors are like
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:14,943	| episode5 |	The Christmas light quality they're very vibrant the blue is phenomenal
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,967	| episode5 |	The white
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:18,271	| episode5 |	It's very stark white I wouldn't
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,551	| episode5 |	Wouldn't recommend that
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:23,391	| episode5 |	White what I will say that these guys have got going for them
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:24,927	| episode5 |	It's the software experience
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:26,719	| episode5 |	The more of these
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,255	| episode5 |	Alternative lighting
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:31,071	| episode5 |	Things that I try the more I realized that Hughes app
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,351	| episode5 |	Sucks
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:36,191	| episode5 |	These so illumi has built
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:37,215	| episode5 |	Experiences
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:37,727	| episode5 |	That's what they call it
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:40,031	| episode5 |	And what they've done is
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:43,103	| episode5 |	The ones that I've tried that are really interesting
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,639	| episode5 |	Are called
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,663	| episode5 |	Torch
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,711	| episode5 |	And this one actually the lights will follow you
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:51,039	| episode5 |	Now I only have three tests bulbs but they
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,063	| episode5 |	They notice where your phone is
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:55,135	| episode5 |	And they light up as you walk through your house
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,183	| episode5 |	I like that isn't that fun
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:08:01,279	| episode5 |	I'd like that that's like. That's why I want begin to my house and have it all tied together
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:02,303	| episode5 |	Here you don't need that
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:04,863	| episode5 |	Pékin because you are your friends The Weeknd
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:05,375	| episode5 |	Exactly
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:08,191	| episode5 |	It is fine if you have your phone on you
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,983	| episode5 |	If you don't
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,751	| episode5 |	It's kind of a bummer
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,031	| episode5 |	But
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:18,431	| episode5 |	So so that was a really cool thing and to enable it all you do is go to the experience section and you literally collect your lights you want in
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,711	| episode5 |	Can you turn it on and boom
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:20,991	| episode5 |	Again
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,551	| episode5 |	You run into the problem that we talked about before which is
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:27,647	| episode5 |	Your house is a shared environment and your phone is personal to you
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:29,951	| episode5 |	But it runs on IOS and Android
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,999	| episode5 |	So you can't have you know
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:35,327	| episode5 |	Two people having this kind of experience although you're going to have dueling you know
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,351	| episode5 |	Lights flickering on and off
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,911	| episode5 |	We didn't put it
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:42,239	| episode5 |	In our front porch so that was kind of neat when you come in
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:44,799	| episode5 |	You know the front hallway light will come on and you often have
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:46,847	| episode5 |	With you so that's fine
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:49,919	| episode5 |	The other experience that I showed with the dog was the Dance Experience
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:52,479	| episode5 |	And that thing was up
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:56,063	| episode5 |	So it tracks through Spotify on your device
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,087	| episode5 |	Or Google Play
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,135	| episode5 |	Or iTunes
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:08:59,903	| episode5 |	On your iPhone
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:03,487	| episode5 |	And if you're playing that through your phone speaker
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,023	| episode5 |	Or I actually went through a Bluetooth
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,351	| episode5 |	A Jambox that I had
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,911	| episode5 |	On the bench by my door
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,751	| episode5 |	The lights turn
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,775	| episode5 |	Bright colors and they
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,055	| episode5 |	Have different
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,359	| episode5 |	Dance mode that is all colors they have
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:21,151	| episode5 |	Cool mode that is cold colors
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,431	| episode5 |	In a fire mode that is
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:22,943	| episode5 |	Only one color
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,223	| episode5 |	And that's pretty
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:25,503	| episode5 |	Nice
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,527	| episode5 |	Very nice
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,575	| episode5 |	So those are
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,343	| episode5 |	Those lights
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:29,855	| episode5 |	And
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:32,159	| episode5 |	So far I'm not sold on
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,207	| episode5 |	Unlike on the Wi-Fi better
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:38,047	| episode5 |	Well wider range for one thing and then
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:41,375	| episode5 |	I like the torch feature I I think the
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:44,703	| episode5 |	The mix of having both is going to be kind of fun or just having Deacons
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,215	| episode5 |	Better deployed in
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,287	| episode5 |	Yep
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:51,103	| episode5 |	I'm kind of disappointed we haven't seen more
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,639	| episode5 |	Pecans for the home
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,407	| episode5 |	Implementation
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:56,223	| episode5 |	But that's just me me to they're coming
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:58,527	| episode5 |	I'm I'm still waiting for the zoo Lee Outlets
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,319	| episode5 |	You know there's the
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:02,111	| episode5 |	The Wally home
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:05,183	| episode5 |	Sensors that are integrated with nest
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:07,231	| episode5 |	But you're right there's
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:08,511	| episode5 |	There's not a lot
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:10,815	| episode5 |	Actually out on the market that are tied into other
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:13,375	| episode5 |	Nope
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:17,727	| episode5 |	Nope nope nope by speaking of Nest there is something to talk about
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:22,847	| episode5 |	That you actually have you can't use it this way yet but you got an Amazon Echo and we talked about it last week
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:28,223	| episode5 |	Wait don't I talk about the Amazon Echo actually you know what you didn't talk about it much
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:31,807	| episode5 |	After you did the review from that that time until
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,343	| episode5 |	Until just recently when
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:36,671	| episode5 |	It came some third-party Integrations we talked about it last week
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:37,951	| episode5 |	What is it
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,999	| episode5 |	Right now integrates with
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:43,071	| episode5 |	Define exactly
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:46,399	| episode5 |	So you've been able to test that which is very cool
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:51,007	| episode5 |	But now that Amazon has the SDK out there for these 3rd party invitations
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:54,335	| episode5 |	Absent developer I guess he has Early Access
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:58,175	| episode5 |	I'm assuming he's using the official SDK but I don't know for sure
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:00,479	| episode5 |	PayPal apps that you can control
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:04,831	| episode5 |	Uses Echo to control Smart lights through Corky's wink hub
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:08,159	| episode5 |	And he can also control his nest thermostat right through
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,183	| episode5 |	The echo
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,463	| episode5 |	Yes
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:12,767	| episode5 |	So I saw that I have a tried it and
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:17,631	| episode5 |	I kind of want to although we can't yet cuz he can't publish that dab
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,471	| episode5 |	Here we're getting into some question
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:22,751	| episode5 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:26,847	| episode5 |	I use the Echo app literally every single night both me and here's the
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,127	| episode5 |	My husband
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,151	| episode5 |	Hello
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:29,919	| episode5 |	That's big
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,199	| episode5 |	Doesn't use almost
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,735	| episode5 |	He uses almost nothing in our house that's
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,319	| episode5 |	But
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:37,855	| episode5 |	We also I
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,135	| episode5 |	I talk to Google
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:40,415	| episode5 |	To shut down my nest
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:40,927	| episode5 |	So
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:43,743	| episode5 |	Make a Google Now
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,303	| episode5 |	I'm not going to say it
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,327	| episode5 |	Can you talk to me
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:49,119	| episode5 |	But I actually tell it to
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,399	| episode5 |	To turn my Nest down
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,679	| episode5 |	If I'm downstairs and I don't want
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:56,287	| episode5 |	So I don't now I'm going to have option
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:57,823	| episode5 |	Do I tell him
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:59,103	| episode5 |	Alexa to do it or do I tell
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,919	| episode5 |	My phone to do it
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,991	| episode5 |	And I don't know
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:07,295	| episode5 |	Cuz my phone is named Charles in my
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:09,599	| episode5 |	My echo was named Alexa so
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,623	| episode5 |	It's a job
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:14,207	| episode5 |	Bear in mind I'm currently using an iPhone
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:17,535	| episode5 |	Because I'm doing some testing of a case with an e ink display in it
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,839	| episode5 |	And in the
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:20,607	| episode5 |	Google
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:22,911	| episode5 |	Voice command I don't want to say it
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:26,239	| episode5 |	On iOS I can't control my nest
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:31,103	| episode5 |	So for iOS users who have an echo and a nest
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:31,871	| episode5 |	There you go
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,431	| episode5 |	Oh so my husband will be thrilled
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,479	| episode5 |	I don't know about that but
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:40,831	| episode5 |	He actually he will he's really liking the voice control of all of
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:45,183	| episode5 |	The stuff and it is I will say it's super handy like when you're in bed cuz we
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,975	| episode5 |	Like I said we have the remote control in bed and
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:50,047	| episode5 |	Okay Alexa
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:50,815	| episode5 |	Make it colder
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,095	| episode5 |	She's like
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,119	| episode5 |	Boom
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:56,191	| episode5 |	I'm really liking her she is
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:59,007	| episode5 |	She's becoming my favorite person in the house I'm going to be honest
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:02,079	| episode5 |	See now I'm disappointed because I had the invite to order
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:06,687	| episode5 |	And I chose not to because there were no Integrations there was no SDK available
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,711	| episode5 |	I'm like
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:13,087	| episode5 |	A hundred bucks I got to wait 6 months for it now shows
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:16,927	| episode5 |	You chose poorly lesson learned
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:23,839	| episode5 |	No what did I do I got up at 3 in the morning order an Apple Watch that I still don't have report
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:26,655	| episode5 |	But it's going to be worth it I hear that the Hue app on the Apple watch
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:27,679	| episode5 |	Is amazing
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:34,591	| episode5 |	Well I'm looking forward to trying the apps and as a former Android Wear user I still have my Android Wear watch
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:38,431	| episode5 |	It's amazing to me that there are over 3000 Apple watch apps on day one
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:40,991	| episode5 |	Where is Android Wear we didn't have that much
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:44,319	| episode5 |	And they're very very few apps that control
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:46,367	| episode5 |	Home automation systems on Android Wear
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:47,903	| episode5 |	Will actually have to get you some
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:50,975	| episode5 |	Home automation devices set up so you can X

EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:59,167	| episode5 |	To get my insteon system setup again yes
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:04,543	| episode5 |	Yes I know I don't think there was anything about it but I think it was that was pretty
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:08,895	| episode5 |	So I also wouldn't there there's a few news items that we should

EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:41,567	| episode5 |	Not bad
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,079	| episode5 |	Which
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,615	| episode5 |	That's reasonable to me
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,127	| episode5 |	That's
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:47,711	| episode5 |	Oh you know what the third item is
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:48,991	| episode5 |	Stress
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,039	| episode5 |	Temperature
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:52,831	| episode5 |	Hello
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,599	| episode5 |	Has taken again
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:56,159	| episode5 |	Temperature we're just talking about the mess
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:58,463	| episode5 |	There you go
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:58,975	| episode5 |	Not that.
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:00,511	| episode5 |	So
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:03,839	| episode5 |	I'm really I am really excited about
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:05,887	| episode5 |	Both as a person
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:11,775	| episode5 |	Who has kind of Sam Lackey blood pressure things going on but also because I'm a parent and
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:13,311	| episode5 |	Mostly because I
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,079	| episode5 |	Blood pressure issue
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:15,615	| episode5 |	Cosmo
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:17,919	| episode5 |	So I'm really excited about like monitor
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:21,759	| episode5 |	And I think you should be much as you but
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:23,551	| episode5 |	The collective you because
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:27,135	| episode5 |	Quite honestly we talked so much about home automation and smart
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:28,927	| episode5 |	Sync devices in the house but really
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:30,975	| episode5 |	I Ortiz
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:34,559	| episode5 |	Is going to be very big in in health and was just today that
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:39,935	| episode5 |	I think Los Angeles hospital has put 80,000 of its patience on
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:42,495	| episode5 |	Apple's Health kitten and such you know
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,007	| episode5 |	So
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:47,615	| episode5 |	There's so much Health Data out there and it's hard to get at it's hard to get at these
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:52,223	| episode5 |	These different measurements which are constantly changing so devices like this are super helpful
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,527	| episode5 |	Oh I agree in what I
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:58,879	| episode5 |	And in talking to the CEO of scanadu his name is Walter de Brouwer
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:00,927	| episode5 |	This man is so smart and so fun
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:01,695	| episode5 |	But
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:04,767	| episode5 |	Biggest thing that's going to be happening here is
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,791	| episode5 |	He believes it
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:07,583	| episode5 |	And if the combination of
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,375	| episode5 |	The processing power in your phone
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,423	| episode5 |	Cheap ubiquitous sensors
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:12,959	| episode5 |	And
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:16,799	| episode5 |	The digitization of medical data that can be aggregated and made searchable
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,335	| episode5 |	And crowdsourced
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:21,407	| episode5 |	Will basically create kind of a Moore's Law
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,479	| episode5 |	The medical industry
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:25,759	| episode5 |	Wish
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:28,831	| episode5 |	Basically he means it's going to speed up the medical industry
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,855	| episode5 |	Incredibly rapidly
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:33,439	| episode5 |	So he thinks we're going to see all of this change
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,975	| episode5 |	Consumer Healthcare
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:38,815	| episode5 |	Faster than the personal computer change business and consumer technology
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:39,839	| episode5 |	Back in like the 90
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,119	| episode5 |	And that is
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:44,191	| episode5 |	That is huge and I really don't think that many people
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:48,543	| episode5 |	In like the pharmaceutical industry or the insurance industry kind of really grok that
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,335	| episode5 |	So I cannot wait
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:52,127	| episode5 |	Exciting stuff
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,407	| episode5 |	All right
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:53,919	| episode5 |	Well

EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:40,511	| episode5 |	And I'd love for you to tell us a little bit about how you related to them
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:43,327	| episode5 |	And we're going to talk a little bit about how you design
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:44,863	| episode5 |	User interfaces
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,655	| episode5 |	For the Smart Home
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,423	| episode5 |	On the Apple watch

EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,463	| episode5 |	And I think that song
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,023	| episode5 |	Just helps driver behavior in the different
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:16,095	| episode5 |	Would Peak succeeds you guys succeed
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,887	| episode5 |	All right we'll Peak is one of the

EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:21,983	| episode5 |	Almost a dozen kind of home hubs
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,519	| episode5 |	I tried out and
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:28,127	| episode5 |	Coming hopefully later this week you guys are going to do a refresh of the app

EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:35,039	| episode5 |	Kind of things and hopefully later on we'll talk a little bit about that
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:36,063	| episode5 |	The first
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:38,367	| episode5 |	We're going to focus on the watch because that
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:40,415	| episode5 |	Is probably what everyone is focused on right now
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:43,231	| episode5 |	So Mark why don't you start by telling us a little bit
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,767	| episode5 |	Because you have one
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:48,095	| episode5 |	Can you tell us a little bit about what you've experienced
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,375	| episode5 |	Since you've had one in
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,655	| episode5 |	What you like what you don't like
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,447	| episode5 |	You're not sure
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:57,055	| episode5 |	It's finished it on there for several days
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:58,591	| episode5 |	And it's kind of a hot mess
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:01,407	| episode5 |	Wait we should wish ask you which version did you get
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:04,479	| episode5 |	I got the stainless

EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:08,575	| episode5 |	38 millimeter versions of a smaller one
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:14,719	| episode5 |	The stainless steel band that wraps around
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:17,279	| episode5 |	I'm hardware and it is absolutely gorgeous
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:19,583	| episode5 |	Feels nice
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,351	| episode5 |	Put on
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:23,167	| episode5 |	Relatively comfortable
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:29,311	| episode5 |	You know I don't want want to watch like 20 years if it's so far no 3 Days Inn
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,663	| episode5 |	Beautiful logic
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:38,783	| episode5 |	Votes not in yet
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:43,391	| episode5 |	It's clearly going to be on screen quality
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:47,743	| episode5 |	Beautiful bride
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:51,327	| episode5 |	These little moments where
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:54,911	| episode5 |	You look so you swipe up to get one particular menu
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:58,495	| episode5 |	Like to watch you Excel if you can swipe up
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:04,639	| episode5 |	To get the client has a slight down to get another menu
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:07,199	| episode5 |	That's how that works
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,479	| episode5 |	Let's go to another
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,759	| episode5 |	And you
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:11,039	| episode5 |	Costa-hawkins don't follow you
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:13,855	| episode5 |	I just condition
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:19,232	| episode5 |	I'm not even
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:23,072	| episode5 |	It's cool it's definitely
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:26,656	| episode5 |	One of those products do you got to learn it
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,984	| episode5 |	Distance to complicated
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:32,032	| episode5 |	For what it's actually do
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:35,616	| episode5 |	It's certainly not like the first couple days of the iPhone
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:37,152	| episode5 |	6 Mile
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:39,200	| episode5 |	Is it a function of
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:41,248	| episode5 |	There are too many
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:42,784	| episode5 |	Different ways to
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:47,904	| episode5 |	Control it like too many different options or is it just a function of they don't
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:48,672	| episode5 |	Logically
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:49,440	| episode5 |	Seem to follow
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:54,304	| episode5 |	Auntie Christmas early too much going on
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:22:02,240	| episode5 |	Okay I can't find kind of a logical usually you can kind of see below the hook
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:09,920	| episode5 |	And I'm not saying that they weren't grappling something that couldn't have been solved
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:11,968	| episode5 |	Like maybe this is it
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:14,272	| episode5 |	Because the nature of a problem
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:19,136	| episode5 |	An interface on a risk that complicated it could be
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,928	| episode5 |	Good
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:24,768	| episode5 |	It is it just feels like I'm still trying to figure my way around
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:25,792	| episode5 |	Surprise
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:29,376	| episode5 |	I said to someone earlier today
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:37,824	| episode5 |	And I kind of imagined play music I want Steve Jobs still
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:40,896	| episode5 |	Loud and in charge of things this is the kind of product
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:45,248	| episode5 |	He might have sent back and I know it's hard I don't care
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:48,320	| episode5 |	I don't think you would have sounded that nice about
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:55,488	| episode5 |	Mystery we want to keep our clean G rating
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:03,680	| episode5 |	Again I want to sympathize with how complex it isn't then literally I'm new to this problem is
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:07,776	| episode5 |	Because a problem Samsung did
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:14,176	| episode5 |	Android Wear
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:18,016	| episode5 |	Can you see Peyton icicle no more
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:21,088	| episode5 |	All right
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:23,136	| episode5 |	Glad

EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:29,024	| episode5 |	Okay its design for tiny fingers
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:30,816	| episode5 |	And so far it has a
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:33,120	| episode5 |	We'll call it an inconsistent maybe syntax
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:33,888	| episode5 |	Design syntax
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:41,568	| episode5 |	The mechanic
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:45,408	| episode5 |	The underlying interaction

EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,584	| episode5 |	You didn't want to ask me

EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:24,064	| episode5 |	Okay let's talk about building
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:28,160	| episode5 |	The apps and con of working with notifications and all of that
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:32,256	| episode5 |	Because some of the best apps that so far I've seen
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:36,608	| episode5 |	On The Watcher that I've seen people review on the watch have been those that kind of
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:38,912	| episode5 |	Appear to be very effective at
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:43,264	| episode5 |	Managing notifications kind of in a Spartan Manor and also giving people
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:45,056	| episode5 |	A lot of information or

EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:53,248	| episode5 |	How were you kind of thinking about designing the app
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,016	| episode5 |	For the peak homes
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:58,368	| episode5 |	The promise the pcap
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:24:59,136	| episode5 |	Pretty simple
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:04,256	| episode5 |	The same way that a lot of this
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:06,816	| episode5 |	It is very simple premise which is
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,864	| episode5 |	I want to turn on my lights
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:09,632	| episode5 |	Or
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:13,984	| episode5 |	You know my favorite scenarios I'm coming home and I
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:15,520	| episode5 |	Remote switch

EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:23,968	| episode5 |	It's Great Compromise
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:32,160	| episode5 |	Felt like the right place to do that sort of thing
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:35,232	| episode5 |	Eventually become a voice control
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:36,256	| episode5 |	Watch so far
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:38,048	| episode5 |	Better than the phone
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:42,912	| episode5 |	That
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:49,056	| episode5 |	Along little things like a somebody just arrived home

EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:05,952	| episode5 |	And it's crochet
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:07,488	| episode5 |	That's one of the reasons
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:09,024	| episode5 |	I like this
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,584	| episode5 |	HomeSmart homes for rent
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,864	| episode5 |	And we've been developing the app
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:17,472	| episode5 |	Sounds great
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:22,080	| episode5 |	And that we imagine
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:24,896	| episode5 |	Will the Ikea track

EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:37,184	| episode5 |	How that relationship works with the way up Apple setup to watch
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:44,096	| episode5 |	Super sensible and SMS
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:46,912	| episode5 |	Will they give me permission
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:48,448	| episode5 |	Cereal place

EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:59,712	| episode5 |	Right now I can't do that
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:03,296	| episode5 |	And I can choose take a couple of those things because
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,088	| episode5 |	First party
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:06,368	| episode5 |	First access
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,904	| episode5 |	Features
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:12,768	| episode5 |	So instead of the watch being your home screen by default
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:15,840	| episode5 |	Are the watch face being the home screen by default
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:22,240	| episode5 |	The PCAT becomes my home screen by default
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:25,824	| episode5 |	Las Vegas

EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:29,408	| episode5 |	So
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:32,992	| episode5 |	It needs to go 90 further than just nearly I can
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:38,624	| episode5 |	Customize the grid of icons ride with the phones and Android
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:41,952	| episode5 |	IOS

EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:48,864	| episode5 |	First-party and third-party apps
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:55,264	| episode5 |	Far far more control over that experience that little grid
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:28:01,152	| episode5 |	On the way I can just fine
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:02,688	| episode5 |	Watches just
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:04,480	| episode5 |	One Step too many

EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:25,216	| episode5 |	It cuts out some of the possible Magic
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:33,408	| episode5 |	Level access nothing
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:37,248	| episode5 |	How many steps does it take to launch the app have you counted
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:40,832	| episode5 |	Let's see okay so I got to reach over
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,464	| episode5 |	Up comes the
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:48,768	| episode5 |	Good rap songs
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:51,072	| episode5 |	I can pretty much directly tap you up
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:54,144	| episode5 |	And then I'm on at the first screen
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:55,168	| episode5 |	Set alarm
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:57,216	| episode5 |	Nicely designed and it's basically
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:59,520	| episode5 |	The the anyone gets
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:05,152	| episode5 |	Little squares
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:08,224	| episode5 |	Some that utilize control
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:11,296	| episode5 |	One aspect you how one of them could be the mode Switcher
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,576	| episode5 |	The way
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:17,952	| episode5 |	Another one can be kitchen lighting
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:23,840	| episode5 |	And you just going to rain slows in a row on the watch so something the first one shows up and you swipe
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:25,632	| episode5 |	Brighten you
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:27,424	| episode5 |	So it's
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:29,216	| episode5 |	It's three steps
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:35,360	| episode5 |	Are four steps if I want to like turn off the light
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:37,408	| episode5 |	Switch from home to work
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:39,968	| episode5 |	2 steps
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:41,504	| episode5 |	Envy Apple
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:45,344	| episode5 |	Significantly better
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:50,208	| episode5 |	Tiny tiny

EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:57,120	| episode5 |	I don't think it's funny at all because right now if I want to turn off the light
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:58,912	| episode5 |	I hit a switch
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:29:59,424	| episode5 |	I mean
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:04,032	| episode5 |	Is usually the way we're trained now if I want to turn off a light if I
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:05,568	| episode5 |	Counted out
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:08,128	| episode5 |	Getting up I'm walking over to a place
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:09,408	| episode5 |	And I'm turning off a light
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:10,432	| episode5 |	But
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:12,224	| episode5 |	In my head
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:14,016	| episode5 |	When I think about it
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:17,600	| episode5 |	All those other steps are complete until I get to the light and turn off
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:20,416	| episode5 |	Like my brain just discounts all those other steps right
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:27,840	| episode5 |	Today's news
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:31,424	| episode5 |	That's a losing battle but a couple of things
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:37,056	| episode5 |	A different way
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:38,080	| episode5 |	Are there
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:45,760	| episode5 |	That's one aspect of this compound
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:47,296	| episode5 |	The way of being

EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:59,840	| episode5 |	Weirdest shifting gears
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:02,912	| episode5 |	Another was much more complex
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:05,216	| episode5 |	Shifting into night mode
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:11,360	| episode5 |	Which Baron allows the bathroom light to turn on read it supposed to light so that it doesn't

EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,600	| episode5 |	Beautiful
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:25,440	| episode5 |	The watch then it's less about these like
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:28,512	| episode5 |	One switch after another but instead
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,304	| episode5 |	Youth small gloves
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:32,608	| episode5 |	Controls

EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:42,080	| episode5 |	So my kitchen camera
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:43,616	| episode5 |	I can see.
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:44,896	| episode5 |	I think maybe two steps
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:49,760	| episode5 |	Raptor on the pole counting steps for the same thing
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:53,344	| episode5 |	I can do that while I'm still in the meeting and not be staring down at

EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:58,720	| episode5 |	In the office
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:01,536	| episode5 |	And let's talk about this broad kind of
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:04,096	| episode5 |	Design rules for the Apple watch
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:05,632	| episode5 |	And
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:08,192	| episode5 |	You know let's just about design rules kind of for the wrist
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:09,984	| episode5 |	Even you know
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:12,032	| episode5 |	Well we'll keep it probably more Apple watch Focus
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:15,872	| episode5 |	You know if I'm breaking it down I'm thinking about
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:17,664	| episode5 |	And in tying it to the Smart Home
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:19,968	| episode5 |	Or the smartoffice however we want to
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:20,480	| episode5 |	I think about that
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:23,552	| episode5 |	You know I'm thinking about it in terms of notification
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:25,344	| episode5 |	Versus
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:26,112	| episode5 |	Taking an action
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:28,160	| episode5 |	In a building where maybe I'm not
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:30,976	| episode5 |	Or maybe I'm in it and I just
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:32,000	| episode5 |	I want to turn my lights off
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:32,512	| episode5 |	Without getting up
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:33,792	| episode5 |	So
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:37,632	| episode5 |	What are kind of the things I want to think about from a notice
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:38,656	| episode5 |	Application standpoint
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:41,472	| episode5 |	As a user I can think about
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:43,520	| episode5 |	You know I don't want to be overwhelmed by notification
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:46,336	| episode5 |	I've already a little overwhelmed
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:47,104	| episode5 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:49,152	| episode5 |	Buzz false alarms
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:50,688	| episode5 |	And also things that
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,992	| episode5 |	You know what I get on my phone and I'm like
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:55,296	| episode5 |	I really can't do anything
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:58,624	| episode5 |	This information I think you were with me one day when I was like
