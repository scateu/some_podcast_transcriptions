EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:29,344	| IOT196 |	So
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:30,368	| IOT196 |	First step
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:31,648	| IOT196 |	We have a message from
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:32,928	| IOT196 |	Frank
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:33,952	| IOT196 |	Big eyes
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:35,488	| IOT196 |	Love the show thank you
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:36,256	| IOT196 |	So much for
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:37,024	| IOT196 |	All you do
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:38,048	| IOT196 |	Coyote
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:38,560	| IOT196 |	Chifans
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:40,096	| IOT196 |	I'm trying
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:41,120	| IOT196 |	Find some way
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:43,424	| IOT196 |	To use sensors or
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:44,704	| IOT196 |	Other iot
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:45,216	| IOT196 |	Qi devices
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:46,752	| IOT196 |	To trigger
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:47,264	| IOT196 |	An announcement
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:48,800	| IOT196 |	Could be the weather
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:51,360	| IOT196 |	Close or something but
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:53,408	| IOT196 |	It seems very complicated online
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:54,688	| IOT196 |	She is my
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:55,712	| IOT196 |	SmartThings setup
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:56,992	| IOT196 |	To trigger in an ounce
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,272	| IOT196 |	Very kind
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:00,064	| IOT196 |	And wondering if you have
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:00,832	| IOT196 |	An easy way to do things
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:03,136	| IOT196 |	I also think that
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:04,416	| IOT196 |	The new Amazon
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,184	| IOT196 |	Routine
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,464	| IOT196 |	My shortcut
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,744	| IOT196 |	Process quite a bit
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:08,512	| IOT196 |	I wanted your thoughts
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:09,792	| IOT196 |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:11,584	| IOT196 |	Oh
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:12,352	| IOT196 |	Frank
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,632	| IOT196 |	I am sad to tell you
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,424	| IOT196 |	There's a little confusion about
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:16,960	| IOT196 |	We couldn't figure out
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:18,240	| IOT196 |	Migraine wanted
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:20,032	| IOT196 |	Have
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,824	| IOT196 |	Make SmartThings talk to my connect
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:23,360	| IOT196 |	Active speakers and make them
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:25,664	| IOT196 |	Say things to me but I think what you actually
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:27,200	| IOT196 |	Why is smart speakers
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,480	| IOT196 |	Have things trigger on them
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:31,040	| IOT196 |	We actually talked about this about a month ago
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:33,856	| IOT196 |	When we talked about an app called notify me
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,136	| IOT196 |	So
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:35,904	| IOT196 |	There is
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:38,720	| IOT196 |	That and that is for the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:39,744	| IOT196 |	Devices
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:40,512	| IOT196 |	And
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:42,304	| IOT196 |	The other option
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,840	| IOT196 |	Is in routines
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:45,120	| IOT196 |	They're actually a
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:49,984	| IOT196 |	A few devices that will be able to trigger a notification on your Amazon
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,008	| IOT196 |	Echo devices
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:54,080	| IOT196 |	Right now they're pretty limited ring is one of them
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:57,408	| IOT196 |	And so Emotion Detector on your ring doorbell cam
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,688	| IOT196 |	Actually trigger notify
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,736	| IOT196 |	Vacation on your Amazon
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,272	| IOT196 |	Echo the challenges
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:05,088	| IOT196 |	It doesn't actually say anything out loud
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:06,368	| IOT196 |	It just turns the light
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:06,880	| IOT196 |	Ring
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:09,440	| IOT196 |	Yellowy color and then you say
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,208	| IOT196 |	Mel Torme
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,488	| IOT196 |	Do I have notifications
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:12,768	| IOT196 |	And she
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,536	| IOT196 |	I will say
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:14,304	| IOT196 |	Yes
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,328	| IOT196 |	Do you want to hear them
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:16,864	| IOT196 |	Will say yes
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,888	| IOT196 |	And then she will tell you what happened
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,168	| IOT196 |	So it's
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:21,472	| IOT196 |	It's not really a push situation but that's
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:23,008	| IOT196 |	Probably less annoying
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,032	| IOT196 |	For most cases
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:30,432	| IOT196 |	I don't know what do you think yeah it's not ideal I certainly understand why it's been implemented that way and I see
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:35,552	| IOT196 |	Sync Amazon in any other speaker maker should add an option to say if I have a notification just
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:38,112	| IOT196 |	Shout it out don't put that extra step in there
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:41,184	| IOT196 |	Unfortunate that extra step is there right now so
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:42,976	| IOT196 |	Yeah I'd like to see like where you could opt
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:45,024	| IOT196 |	But I also see Bryant
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:48,608	| IOT196 |	You probably want to opt into it and it probably only want to opt into it
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,376	| IOT196 |	But during certain times of the
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:56,032	| IOT196 |	Just like your phone notifications which is how all of these devices send you notifications today typically so yeah let's
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:59,872	| IOT196 |	Can replicate the notification controls that we have in these apps
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:00,640	| IOT196 |	Right on the speakers
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:03,456	| IOT196 |	Now if you want to use your SmartThings
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:06,016	| IOT196 |	Things to trigger announcements or things to happen
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,296	| IOT196 |	On your speakers
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:13,696	| IOT196 |	Right now you can't do it for your smart speakers but you can do it for the Bose soundtouch and various Samsung
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:14,464	| IOT196 |	Multi-room speakers
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:18,815	| IOT196 |	And in that case what you can do as you connect those devices to SmartThings
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:22,399	| IOT196 |	And if a certain person enters the room or something happens
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:23,423	| IOT196 |	Your speakers
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:23,935	| IOT196 |	Play a noise
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:26,751	| IOT196 |	So that is not exactly what you're after
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,799	| IOT196 |	But it may get you part way there
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,103	| IOT196 |	So Frank I am sorry for the bad news
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:33,663	| IOT196 |	If anybody else has some ideas
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,431	| IOT196 |	4 franc
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,199	| IOT196 |	Boy let us know
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:36,479	| IOT196 |	Okay
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:37,503	| IOT196 |	Next up
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:39,551	| IOT196 |	We have a message from
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,343	| IOT196 |	Dylan also
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:42,367	| IOT196 |	Tell me about smart speakers
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:44,159	| IOT196 |	Hey Kevin it's tasty

EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:48,511	| IOT196 |	Eric Westervelt
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,279	| IOT196 |	Smart speakers
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,047	| IOT196 |	So I'm feeling
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:51,583	| IOT196 |	And
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,631	| IOT196 |	Install door speakers
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,911	| IOT196 |	Stealing that are
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:56,703	| IOT196 |	The ceiling
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:59,007	| IOT196 |	Simplifying one manufacturer
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,287	| IOT196 |	That
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,823	| IOT196 |	Snakes a CO2
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,359	| IOT196 |	Smoke detector
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,383	| IOT196 |	Bose speaker
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,175	| IOT196 |	Just looking for something that
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,967	| IOT196 |	Compatible with Google or
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:08,991	| IOT196 |	Assistance
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,783	| IOT196 |	Hockey stores
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,319	| IOT196 |	Don't have any preference
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,343	| IOT196 |	But why
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,111	| IOT196 |	Your preferences
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:16,415	| IOT196 |	Old houses on the market
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:17,951	| IOT196 |	Feeling Sparks
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:22,559	| IOT196 |	So we have good news for Dylan because
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,351	| IOT196 |	He's an advantageous
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,375	| IOT196 |	Situation right now
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:31,775	| IOT196 |	If he's got a new home build it's a lot easier to do speaker mounts for some of these smart speakers
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:34,079	| IOT196 |	And it's actually not too expensive
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:36,383	| IOT196 |	There is a company that makes
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:39,455	| IOT196 |	A flush mount system for walls or ceilings
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,991	| IOT196 |	4
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:43,039	| IOT196 |	Or either I guess I should say the
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,063	| IOT196 |	Echo Dot
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,855	| IOT196 |	And the Google home Mini
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:48,671	| IOT196 |	Sell the company or the brand is Mount
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,439	| IOT196 |	Genie
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:52,767	| IOT196 |	I have not used these I do not have a new home build butt
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:54,047	| IOT196 |	Food ideas with a
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:59,935	| IOT196 |	Drywall saw a little bit of wiring the more expensive one surprisingly are for the Amazon
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:02,751	| IOT196 |	Echo dot M14 20 bucks
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:05,823	| IOT196 |	A 5-pack if you have a bunch of speakers not is 90 bucks
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:07,359	| IOT196 |	A free Google home Mini
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:12,991	| IOT196 |	SB company makes or sells one for $15 or 5 for $50 so if you have a choice
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,039	| IOT196 |	I probably go with the Google home Mini
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:21,439	| IOT196 |	Devices and then use the speaker mounts because they're like cheaper in any case they come with everything you need is a template to
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:23,999	| IOT196 |	Cut into drywall but of course if you have a new home build you really
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,279	| IOT196 |	Aren't cutting into
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:27,583	| IOT196 |	Existing drywall you like a little work around it
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:29,375	| IOT196 |	And they also come with
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:32,191	| IOT196 |	Wires that will connect for the power
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:34,239	| IOT196 |	I noticed one thing for the one that
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:37,055	| IOT196 |	The echo.dot uses it cuz of the ten foot cord
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:40,127	| IOT196 |	Where's the one with the Google home mini they only supplies 6 foot cord
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:44,479	| IOT196 |	Brigand new home build you can probably have your electrician use whatever power
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:47,551	| IOT196 |	Wires he or she wants to use just a wire these up
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:53,951	| IOT196 |	So expensive the sound might be a little Waffle they seem to have like a Sound Chamber to help with that because some of those be
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:56,767	| IOT196 |	Figures the. So particular the sound comes from the base
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,303	| IOT196 |	Of the echo Dot and that
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:01,119	| IOT196 |	Kind of gets covered up by this little speak so
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:07,519	| IOT196 |	Probably another reason consider the home mini ones but that's just my opinion so it's not too expensive if you're a do-it-yourself kind of purse
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:10,847	| IOT196 |	Person and don't mind doing a little wiring you should be able to do this
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:14,687	| IOT196 |	And it's not again a new home build just asked for electrician to do it
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,199	| IOT196 |	They love that
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:17,503	| IOT196 |	They'll do that for you all
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,015	| IOT196 |	Day
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:20,319	| IOT196 |	As long as you're paying yes they will
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:27,743	| IOT196 |	That and just so you know cuz usually speakers when you put them in your ceiling the slow low voltage thing but
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:29,279	| IOT196 |	Actually Mount smart
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:32,351	| IOT196 |	Speakers that will be a normal voltage thing
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,887	| IOT196 |	Which maven
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:36,959	| IOT196 |	Someone else can help do it or it made me different
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:37,471	| IOT196 |	Code required
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:41,055	| IOT196 |	It depends on your jurisdiction and your local building codes
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,079	| IOT196 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,871	| IOT196 |	Let's take our next
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,151	| IOT196 |	Color
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:45,919	| IOT196 |	Which is
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:47,199	| IOT196 |	From Kimberly
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,223	| IOT196 |	And she
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:49,503	| IOT196 |	Has a question about
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:50,015	| IOT196 |	Homekit
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:52,063	| IOT196 |	And outdoor lighting
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:54,111	| IOT196 |	This is actually a fairly common question
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:55,647	| IOT196 |	Variations of History Fair
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,671	| IOT196 |	Common question
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:57,439	| IOT196 |	So
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,975	| IOT196 |	I think many of you will find this valuable
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:01,279	| IOT196 |	Okay let's hear from Kimberly
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:02,559	| IOT196 |	Hi this is
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:03,839	| IOT196 |	Kimberly from Florida
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,399	| IOT196 |	And my husband and I have Smart Home
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,423	| IOT196 |	We have a
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:09,215	| IOT196 |	Arlo cameras
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:10,495	| IOT196 |	I'm outside
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:13,055	| IOT196 |	With Hue motion sensor light
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:15,103	| IOT196 |	And we have homekit
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,895	| IOT196 |	And my question is
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:19,199	| IOT196 |	Can we write an essay
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,223	| IOT196 |	Statement
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:21,503	| IOT196 |	Is there a way
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:24,831	| IOT196 |	To make it so that when the motion sensor light comes on
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:28,159	| IOT196 |	The after a period of time it will go off
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:28,927	| IOT196 |	Right now
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:31,999	| IOT196 |	We have a raccoon or other little
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,023	| IOT196 |	Visitor
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,303	| IOT196 |	The light goes on
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:36,095	| IOT196 |	And it stays on until Emmanuel
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,375	| IOT196 |	Shut the light off
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,399	| IOT196 |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:38,911	| IOT196 |	Have a great day
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:44,031	| IOT196 |	So this was actually pretty easy to resolve kind of threw
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:46,847	| IOT196 |	But if you would like a hidden setting in the
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:49,151	| IOT196 |	Philips Hue software the mobile app
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:50,687	| IOT196 |	There is
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:53,759	| IOT196 |	A way to create routines in the Philips Hue app
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:56,575	| IOT196 |	One of those routines is actually a timer
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:09:00,671	| IOT196 |	And what you can do Kimberly is go right into the
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,975	| IOT196 |	Two routines tab in the app
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,023	| IOT196 |	You'll see a timers button
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:10,911	| IOT196 |	Tap that and it'll just say hey click the plus button hurt your first timer you can name it then you could
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,935	| IOT196 |	Then put in the
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:16,287	| IOT196 |	Time of the timer like how long do you want before something happens to your lights
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,055	| IOT196 |	So
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:21,407	| IOT196 |	It could be 1 minute 35 whatever you'd like couldn't be ours if you'd like but I think
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:26,015	| IOT196 |	For a light to come on due to motion sense you're probably looking at about 5 minutes or so
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,807	| IOT196 |	Then you just choose where
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,855	| IOT196 |	This is going to run meaning what
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,135	| IOT196 |	Seen or rooms
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:33,439	| IOT196 |	I probably put the lights
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:38,303	| IOT196 |	In a room by themselves called outside or maybe the by the drive I call it driveway for example
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,071	| IOT196 |	Once you
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:43,167	| IOT196 |	Said where you can then choose what action to take
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:43,935	| IOT196 |	And when you
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,959	| IOT196 |	See the actions
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:46,495	| IOT196 |	There's a bunch of
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:50,591	| IOT196 |	Different choices such as dim night light mode last on staybright
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,871	| IOT196 |	There's also an author
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:55,711	| IOT196 |	Option which is what you want so choose the off option
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,479	| IOT196 |	Save it
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:58,271	| IOT196 |	And you should be all set
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:02,879	| IOT196 |	Therefore when your Arlo camera detects motion and turns on your Hue Lights
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:06,463	| IOT196 |	That should trigger this Hue routine for the timer
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:09,791	| IOT196 |	Which would then shut the light off after the time you specified when you set it up
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:16,959	| IOT196 |	Just keep in mind that once you set this timer up it's going to continuously run so if you're using those lights
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:18,495	| IOT196 |	Or any other purpose which
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:21,055	| IOT196 |	I suspect you're not because you're using motion detection
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,079	| IOT196 |	Fire them off
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:25,663	| IOT196 |	They're going to just keep shutting off every X number of minutes however
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:31,039	| IOT196 |	That's you sad so that's something to consider it's kind of like you may want to use these lights off a single purpose
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:34,111	| IOT196 |	At this point because if you're using them for like outdoor parties
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:36,927	| IOT196 |	Well the lights are going to shut off on everybody for 5 minutes
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,975	| IOT196 |	Which might could make a really cool party games
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:41,791	| IOT196 |	Everybody freeze when the lights go off
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,071	| IOT196 |	I take a shot
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:43,839	| IOT196 |	No okay
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:44,607	| IOT196 |	I don't know what kind of parties are
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:45,887	| IOT196 |	Probably not
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,423	| IOT196 |	All right
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:48,703	| IOT196 |	Now
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,983	| IOT196 |	I have disappointing news
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,775	| IOT196 |	For Sherry
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,567	| IOT196 |	I Sherry centos
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,591	| IOT196 |	Really
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:55,871	| IOT196 |	Great idea
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:56,639	| IOT196 |	And so
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:58,943	| IOT196 |	We'll listen to that and
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,223	| IOT196 |	Will tell her what we found out
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,271	| IOT196 |	Hi this is Sherry from North
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,295	| IOT196 |	North Carolina
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:06,623	| IOT196 |	Just Alexa knows who I am when I ask a question
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:10,207	| IOT196 |	Can she automatically increase the volume
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:11,743	| IOT196 |	When answering a question
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:14,815	| IOT196 |	I am curious to know because I'm hard of hearing
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,351	| IOT196 |	Thank you
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:17,887	| IOT196 |	Sherry
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:19,679	| IOT196 |	Like I said this is disappointing
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:23,519	| IOT196 |	I actually reached out to Amazon and there met him a group
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:24,543	| IOT196 |	And they said
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,311	| IOT196 |	Oh
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,079	| IOT196 |	No
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:26,847	| IOT196 |	She can't do that
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:30,175	| IOT196 |	There's nothing in there that is even remotely able to do that however
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:32,991	| IOT196 |	On the plus side they said that sounds like a really good idea
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,015	| IOT196 |	And so they forwarded that on to
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:34,527	| IOT196 |	To their team
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:35,807	| IOT196 |	What does that mean
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:36,831	| IOT196 |	I don't know
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,623	| IOT196 |	Maybe one day you'll get the speech
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:44,511	| IOT196 |	It does sound like a good idea to have different levels of volume for different
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,791	| IOT196 |	Recognize voices
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:50,143	| IOT196 |	I mean obviously that's not going to help us hear Tech that makes things worse
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:53,727	| IOT196 |	But you never know they could take this as feedback and create
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,775	| IOT196 |	Custom volumes for different people
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:58,847	| IOT196 |	Which would be awesome although I will caution you that it
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,383	| IOT196 |	It's always louder for you
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,151	| IOT196 |	That might be
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,967	| IOT196 |	Really bad depending on the certain times of day or What's happen
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,503	| IOT196 |	But I do like it
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,039	| IOT196 |	So
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:10,879	| IOT196 |	Sorry that you had to have it before the Amazon people implemented
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,415	| IOT196 |	You're getting all the bad news questions
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,183	| IOT196 |	I know
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:13,951	| IOT196 |	Okay
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:15,743	| IOT196 |	Well we have kind of good news for free
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:18,559	| IOT196 |	This is his second call but
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:22,399	| IOT196 |	Poor man apparently has had his lights on for 3 weeks now according
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:24,703	| IOT196 |	This message by the time we've answered it it's been
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:26,751	| IOT196 |	But
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,287	| IOT196 |	Frank has sensors on everything
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:29,823	| IOT196 |	And wants to know how to

EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:39,551	| IOT196 |	Big fan
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,319	| IOT196 |	Sensors
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:43,135	| IOT196 |	Sensors on everything I can think of
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,183	| IOT196 |	10 reasons to turn things on
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,463	| IOT196 |	I guess I did
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,743	| IOT196 |	Seal
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:49,023	| IOT196 |	Like we talked about it
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:51,071	| IOT196 |	Because my
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:51,839	| IOT196 |	She's our
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:52,607	| IOT196 |	How to turn
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,631	| IOT196 |	Things back office
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:54,911	| IOT196 |	Either
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:55,679	| IOT196 |	Besan
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,447	| IOT196 |	An action
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:58,495	| IOT196 |	The center or a period of time
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:00,031	| IOT196 |	But you can run through that that would
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:00,799	| IOT196 |	The awesome
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:02,847	| IOT196 |	And if you could do it quickly.
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:03,615	| IOT196 |	Because my life
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,383	| IOT196 |	Lebanon Napa
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:04,895	| IOT196 |	3 weeks
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:06,687	| IOT196 |	With the sensors and I don't know how to turn
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:07,711	| IOT196 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:09,247	| IOT196 |	First offering
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,271	| IOT196 |	I'm going to apologize
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,551	| IOT196 |	Thanks for leaving you with your lights on
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:12,831	| IOT196 |	For forever
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,855	| IOT196 |	Long time
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:16,159	| IOT196 |	I'm I'm you may have solved this but
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,951	| IOT196 |	This is actually something that
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,743	| IOT196 |	I was puzzled by until I realized
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:21,023	| IOT196 |	The solution and it's such a
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:23,839	| IOT196 |	Silly solution I felt kind of like an idiot but it is also
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:26,911	| IOT196 |	I paid some kind of like really is this the best way to do this
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,935	| IOT196 |	But it kinda is
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:31,007	| IOT196 |	And that is for every time that you have a a light
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:34,335	| IOT196 |	It goes on automatically you have to set an automation to
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,103	| IOT196 |	Make it go
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:35,871	| IOT196 |	African
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:37,919	| IOT196 |	You can do it like we talked about with
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:39,967	| IOT196 |	Kimberly setting a timer so if you have a light that
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,247	| IOT196 |	How is only going to be
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:43,551	| IOT196 |	Motion activated or activated that way
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,599	| IOT196 |	Doing something like that
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,903	| IOT196 |	If you are
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:50,975	| IOT196 |	Probably more like oriented around time like bedtime
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:53,279	| IOT196 |	Then you probably need to set up another
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,559	| IOT196 |	Timer for
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:56,095	| IOT196 |	After this time of night
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:56,863	| IOT196 |	Turn this off
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:57,887	| IOT196 |	So that is
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:59,679	| IOT196 |	Unfortunately how that's going to have
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,959	| IOT196 |	After work and
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:07,359	| IOT196 |	What sensors it is tricky I have one in my home office or a motion sensor that after a certain hour
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,639	| IOT196 |	The day I walk in
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:11,199	| IOT196 |	Obviously it sees me and it turns on the office lights
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:15,039	| IOT196 |	But if I don't do anything about it those office lights will always stay on
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:20,927	| IOT196 |	Those lights are voice-controlled so I actually just want to go to the office I tell Google home in my case
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,207	| IOT196 |	Shut these lights
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:22,719	| IOT196 |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:24,767	| IOT196 |	And I'm trying to think of other
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,047	| IOT196 |	I mean I talk to
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:26,815	| IOT196 |	Timatim a lot
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:27,839	| IOT196 |	Turn off my lights
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:33,727	| IOT196 |	So you have to do it once you're out of the sensor range in a sense you have to legally leave the room almost Sensei it that's the thing
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:37,567	| IOT196 |	Yeah or not here's another option let's say it's all down
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:40,895	| IOT196 |	Stairs or something like that you could program like a smart button
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:42,943	| IOT196 |	And do the button to turn them off
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,479	| IOT196 |	And just leave that button in whatever room
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:45,503	| IOT196 |	You're not it
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:47,551	| IOT196 |	Or good night routine at the end of the day
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,855	| IOT196 |	There's lots of ways to do it but
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:50,623	| IOT196 |	You actually have to program
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,671	| IOT196 |	Automatically
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,207	| IOT196 |	So
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:55,487	| IOT196 |	That is our good news bad news
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:59,327	| IOT196 |	Hey more opportunities to learn and enjoy home automation
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,655	| IOT196 |	Okay here is another question
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,935	| IOT196 |	About madhumeh
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:04,703	| IOT196 |	Clearly
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:10,335	| IOT196 |	Amazon is doing really well in this world because we get a lot of questions about Madam and not that many belt
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:14,431	| IOT196 |	So here we go this is from Chris and he wants to know
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:15,455	| IOT196 |	How to
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:17,759	| IOT196 |	Who helped make Madam a a little bit more
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,527	| IOT196 |	Convenient
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,295	| IOT196 |	His iPhone
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:19,807	| IOT196 |	Let's hear it
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,087	| IOT196 |	Hi Kevin
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:22,367	| IOT196 |	Stacy
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,135	| IOT196 |	Chris
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:23,903	| IOT196 |	Wisconsin
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,415	| IOT196 |	Question
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:25,439	| IOT196 |	I have
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:26,463	| IOT196 |	Amanda May
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:28,255	| IOT196 |	Smart home devices
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:32,095	| IOT196 |	Morning and night and
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:32,863	| IOT196 |	They run
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,631	| IOT196 |	FaceTime
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,911	| IOT196 |	Man words
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:36,191	| IOT196 |	I would like to
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:37,983	| IOT196 |	No it's pause
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:38,751	| IOT196 |	Apple is
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:39,775	| IOT196 |	We have
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,287	| IOT196 |	IPhone
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,335	| IOT196 |	Wondering if
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:44,383	| IOT196 |	When we give the command
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,663	| IOT196 |	Anime
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:46,943	| IOT196 |	To say good night
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:49,247	| IOT196 |	Phones
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:50,783	| IOT196 |	And do not disturb mode and in
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:51,551	| IOT196 |	In the morning
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:53,087	| IOT196 |	Wake up they would come out
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:55,135	| IOT196 |	You could help me out any that would
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:55,647	| IOT196 |	Be great
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:16:01,279	| IOT196 |	So Chris I am right there with you cuz I typically do use an iPhone
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:02,559	| IOT196 |	I'm not a
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:04,351	| IOT196 |	Big user of homekit
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,911	| IOT196 |	Unfortunately for you and for me
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:10,495	| IOT196 |	There's really no way to do this at least not one that I have found
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:13,055	| IOT196 |	After extensive searching and testing
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:15,359	| IOT196 |	Creating all kinds of routines and such
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,895	| IOT196 |	The problem is
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,687	| IOT196 |	Apple really locks down
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:20,735	| IOT196 |	What has access to its
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,015	| IOT196 |	Phone's features
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:27,903	| IOT196 |	You can use Siri to set your phone to go into Do Not Disturb mode or you could program it by time
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:31,231	| IOT196 |	Without side of the Apple world I have not found a way to
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:36,863	| IOT196 |	To do that so I mean I've even looked at trying to use the homekit features in the home
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:37,631	| IOT196 |	Software app
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:44,031	| IOT196 |	2 when you shut a light that's homekit enabled do something in the phone but unfortunately in the home app you can only control
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:49,151	| IOT196 |	Other homekit devices in the iPhone is not a homekit device in that regard so
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:55,551	| IOT196 |	There's just no easy way to do it with Madam and I have found so that means you need to either speak another come on before
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:58,111	| IOT196 |	It's time for bed or you need to schedule it
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,647	| IOT196 |	Not great options
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,951	| IOT196 |	But those are the only two we have at this point
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,047	| IOT196 |	Glad I don't have an iPhone
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,583	| IOT196 |	So that's
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,887	| IOT196 |	It's pretty straightforward our next answer
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:12,703	| IOT196 |	In question really is not a straightforward so
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:13,727	| IOT196 |	We're going to get in here
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:17,055	| IOT196 |	Jamie wants our opinion of the home assistant DIY Pro
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:21,919	| IOT196 |	And this is kind of like openhab or homebridge it's another kind of
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:23,455	| IOT196 |	You run it yourself
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:26,783	| IOT196 |	Some other computer in your house
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,551	| IOT196 |	Sand
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:30,111	| IOT196 |	It's really powerful but it is also
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:32,927	| IOT196 |	Maybe not the friendliest ecosystem for newbies
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:34,975	| IOT196 |	This particular person's question
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,743	| IOT196 |	Covers
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:38,303	| IOT196 |	Olive home assistant and specifically
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,071	| IOT196 |	Using it
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:39,839	| IOT196 |	With wired alarms
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:42,143	| IOT196 |	So let's hear from Jamie
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:44,191	| IOT196 |	Hi Stacy and Kevin
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:49,055	| IOT196 |	Mine Jamie Campbell and I'd like to know what your opinion is of the
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:49,823	| IOT196 |	Home assistant
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:53,407	| IOT196 |	Open source DIY home automation project
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:59,039	| IOT196 |	Shameless episodes ago Stacy mentions the konnected alarm panel it sounds like the
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:04,671	| IOT196 |	Perfect solution using all the wired Burglar Alarm sensors which are already installed in our house
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:12,351	| IOT196 |	Integration with modern home automation wired sensors are reliable and
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,655	| IOT196 |	Batteries connected panel works
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:17,983	| IOT196 |	Where's the Home assistant project which sounds interesting
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:22,335	| IOT196 |	And your opinion will the home assistant project be viable in the long run
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:28,735	| IOT196 |	Is it easy enough to use for the next owner of our house to consider it an asset and how well does it integrate with
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:30,527	| IOT196 |	Other office shelf sensors
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:33,087	| IOT196 |	Thanks a lots look forward to your answer by
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,111	| IOT196 |	Okay Jamie
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:37,183	| IOT196 |	Because you know what home assistant is
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:38,719	| IOT196 |	I'm going to assume that you're
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:41,023	| IOT196 |	Self-selecting into the type of people who are like
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:42,047	| IOT196 |	They don't see a board
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:44,863	| IOT196 |	Can go by the way what is that
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:48,703	| IOT196 |	Yes I can play and customize and do crazy things
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:51,007	| IOT196 |	If you are that person home assistant
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:51,775	| IOT196 |	Is lovely
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:52,543	| IOT196 |	It actually has
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,079	| IOT196 |	Much better
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:54,847	| IOT196 |	Interface
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:56,383	| IOT196 |	It still could be prettier
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:57,151	| IOT196 |	But it's
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,687	| IOT196 |	It's much better than it used to be
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,967	| IOT196 |	And it has a large
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:01,759	| IOT196 |	Community of people who are
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:05,087	| IOT196 |	Putting things on the home assistant Forum boards that
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,647	| IOT196 |	You can find all kinds of ways to cook
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,695	| IOT196 |	Control example Utah
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:10,463	| IOT196 |	Wired alarms
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,999	| IOT196 |	There are honestly
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:12,767	| IOT196 |	Doesn't
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:16,351	| IOT196 |	You can actually connect and with lovey instruct
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,911	| IOT196 |	If you were comfortable doing that
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:20,447	| IOT196 |	I'm going to go ahead and recommend
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,983	| IOT196 |	Connected with a k
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:24,031	| IOT196 |	Alarm system because that's actually easy enough
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,055	| IOT196 |	I could do it
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:27,871	| IOT196 |	It was still a little intimidating but it wasn't
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:29,919	| IOT196 |	I didn't have to
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:30,943	| IOT196 |	I have my own life
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:31,711	| IOT196 |	Relays
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:34,271	| IOT196 |	Tri-center suck it whatever is in
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,063	| IOT196 |	Things that I barely
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:38,879	| IOT196 |	Comprehend what they are this was a very simple process
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,671	| IOT196 |	WhatsApp videos online
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:45,535	| IOT196 |	Support me through it and if you already have wired device isn't connected panel there's a
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:48,351	| IOT196 |	Decent chance it may work with that depending on the brand
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,631	| IOT196 |	Yeah they have
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:50,399	| IOT196 |	Tons
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,167	| IOT196 |	So
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:53,215	| IOT196 |	That's part of it and then the other thing is
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:54,495	| IOT196 |	I'm going to stay home assistant
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:56,543	| IOT196 |	If you want to go that route
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,567	| IOT196 |	I wouldn't feel
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:01,919	| IOT196 |	If you're comfortable spending that time and effort I would say go for it is
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:04,479	| IOT196 |	A community the people who are doing it
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,015	| IOT196 |	Die Hard
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:07,807	| IOT196 |	Fans of the stuff I don't
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:09,855	| IOT196 |	See it like it has a very robust
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:12,927	| IOT196 |	Community that is still contributing it's not like I seen it drop off
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:15,487	| IOT196 |	In fact I've seen the community grow over time
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:16,255	| IOT196 |	So
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:22,399	| IOT196 |	I will also drop a link into the show notes to a epic video it's an hour-long update published in
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:26,239	| IOT196 |	About how home assistant is doing and what's coming next
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,263	| IOT196 |	It will help you
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:29,055	| IOT196 |	They have some big things planned so
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:30,591	| IOT196 |	If you're up for it
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:31,103	| IOT196 |	Do it
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:36,223	| IOT196 |	And one of the other reasons to consider doing it it's all local there's no
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:39,551	| IOT196 |	Cloud involved in a lot of people like that local ability to
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:41,599	| IOT196 |	Keep their data kind of within the home
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:43,135	| IOT196 |	Yeah that is very true
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,159	| IOT196 |	I will say
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:45,951	| IOT196 |	Since I'm in this mindset right now is some
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:46,975	| IOT196 |	Someone who's selling their home
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:48,255	| IOT196 |	Everything you do
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:51,327	| IOT196 |	It's not something you're going to be able to hand over to somebody
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,095	| IOT196 |	Later so
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,631	| IOT196 |	You're going to move in a year
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,143	| IOT196 |	Maybe don't do
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:57,983	| IOT196 |	That's just where it again
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,775	| IOT196 |	And that's where my headspace is at right now
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,311	| IOT196 |	Are you guys I'm just like a hoe
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:02,591	| IOT196 |	How am I going to document
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,615	| IOT196 |	The stuff for people
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:04,639	| IOT196 |	I can't
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,151	| IOT196 |	This goes out

EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:54,304	| IOT196 |	True
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,840	| IOT196 |	I didn't think about that part of it
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:57,120	| IOT196 |	Please do,
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:59,936	| IOT196 |	I would love to hear it and publish it on the show

EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:04,032	| IOT196 |	To it
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:07,104	| IOT196 |	Back to the grindstone Kevin we have got more
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:07,872	| IOT196 |	Questions to
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:08,640	| IOT196 |	Answer
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:09,664	| IOT196 |	This one
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:11,456	| IOT196 |	We get a variation of this every week so
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:14,784	| IOT196 |	Let's do it this one is from Brent with a quest
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,808	| IOT196 |	About Wi-Fi
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,600	| IOT196 |	Let's hear from Brent
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:19,136	| IOT196 |	Hi this is
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,928	| IOT196 |	Is Brandt from Roy Utah
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:26,304	| IOT196 |	I have a shop that I'm building its back into my property is not that far from the house but
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:28,096	| IOT196 |	I definitely will need to put in
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:28,864	| IOT196 |	Something.
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:30,400	| IOT196 |	Extend the Wi-Fi out there
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:33,472	| IOT196 |	So I can monitor a 3D printer in a few weather
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:34,496	| IOT196 |	Items like that
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:38,592	| IOT196 |	I know how to extend it but I'm looking for options that might be
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:41,408	| IOT196 |	A little bit more functional or maybe even
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,176	| IOT196 |	Cool
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:44,736	| IOT196 |	I know I've heard there's some
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:46,016	| IOT196 |	Start speakers
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,296	| IOT196 |	That maybe work is
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:50,112	| IOT196 |	Place an extender I'm just looking for ideas
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:51,392	| IOT196 |	Let me know
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:52,416	| IOT196 |	Thanks
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:53,696	| IOT196 |	So this
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:59,072	| IOT196 |	Question is actually fairly easy because there are so many good options
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:01,376	| IOT196 |	I am kind of particular to using
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:03,680	| IOT196 |	Google Wi-Fi but there are other
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,448	| IOT196 |	Mesh
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:07,008	| IOT196 |	Options out there Linksys has one
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:10,336	| IOT196 |	Orbi
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:12,896	| IOT196 |	I mean there's so many euro
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:14,944	| IOT196 |	But part of me says if your
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:16,736	| IOT196 |	Building a shop out back
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:23,136	| IOT196 |	Depending how far it is I don't know Stacy you think it makes sense actually run a wired connection out there and then
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:24,160	| IOT196 |	Maybe
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:25,696	| IOT196 |	Extended that way
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,464	| IOT196 |	True
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,488	| IOT196 |	I mean okay
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:31,584	| IOT196 |	Okay so this is me I love wired I literally have an ethernet port
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:34,656	| IOT196 |	It sometimes too in every single room of my house including my kitchen
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:38,496	| IOT196 |	So you're talking to a lady whose like hey can I rent some conduit
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:41,824	| IOT196 |	Flush some Cat6 cables and ethernet through here
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:43,616	| IOT196 |	If you answered yes then by God
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:44,128	| IOT196 |	That's what I'm going to do
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:46,688	| IOT196 |	So if you have that option
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:47,712	| IOT196 |	I'm all for that
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:51,296	| IOT196 |	Because then you could do cool stuff like have like 4K video
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:52,064	| IOT196 |	Out there
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:54,880	| IOT196 |	That's going to be a little bit better but no maybe you don't need that yet
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:58,464	| IOT196 |	Again if you're going to extend just Wifi really any mesh the
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:23:59,488	| IOT196 |	It's going to be good
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:03,072	| IOT196 |	Would you actually wait until it like a new
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:08,960	| IOT196 |	Round of mesh routers comes out because Brian was saying you know do we know of anything coming down the pike that might be useful
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,472	| IOT196 |	In terms of
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:16,384	| IOT196 |	Smart Homes with Wi-Fi anytime soon
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:18,176	| IOT196 |	With those in terms of new products
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:22,016	| IOT196 |	But you have to remember is even if your router is like the sickest
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:24,832	| IOT196 |	Most awesome WiFi 6 router out there
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:26,624	| IOT196 |	And now we're no longer calling it like a x
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:29,184	| IOT196 |	Even if you do that
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:31,744	| IOT196 |	You got to remember that the other the receiving
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,024	| IOT196 |	Also have
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:34,304	| IOT196 |	Has to be a x
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,328	| IOT196 |	Or Wi-Fi 6
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:36,096	| IOT196 |	Compatible
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,376	| IOT196 |	To get all of those
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:40,704	| IOT196 |	Advantages right so most bones right now
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:42,240	| IOT196 |	Especially all the
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:44,544	| IOT196 |	Connected gear that were throwing out to
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:45,056	| IOT196 |	That's all like
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:47,104	| IOT196 |	Wales school it's like
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:48,384	| IOT196 |	Wi-Fi for
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,664	| IOT196 |	Or three even
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,432	| IOT196 |	So
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,456	| IOT196 |	You know having
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:57,344	| IOT196 |	The latest and greatest is really going to only affect you when they start seeing that in devices so I think you're going to be fine for a while
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,928	| IOT196 |	Okay our next question
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,464	| IOT196 |	Is all about
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:02,976	| IOT196 |	Outdoors
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:05,024	| IOT196 |	We got a couple outdoor question
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:07,328	| IOT196 |	Is coming our way so let's get started first
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,096	| IOT196 |	With j
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:09,632	| IOT196 |	Let's hear from Jay
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,424	| IOT196 |	Maybe third time's the charm
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:13,728	| IOT196 |	Kevin and Stacy
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:14,496	| IOT196 |	Is Jade
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,776	| IOT196 |	From Santa Clarita
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:16,544	| IOT196 |	Question is
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,056	| IOT196 |	Temperature sensor
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,848	| IOT196 |	I've got the
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:20,384	| IOT196 |	Keen home vents
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:23,968	| IOT196 |	Paired up with my ecobee thermostat and there's temp
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:24,736	| IOT196 |	Retreat centers in
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,528	| IOT196 |	Room but there indoor only of course
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:28,320	| IOT196 |	That looking for an outdoor temperature
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:31,136	| IOT196 |	Scepter don't want to go around.
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:33,952	| IOT196 |	Weather station if necessary
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:38,048	| IOT196 |	So wondering if you can make any recommendation I also have the
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:38,816	| IOT196 |	Habitat
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:39,584	| IOT196 |	Iot hub
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:40,864	| IOT196 |	And I've got some
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:43,168	| IOT196 |	Smoke detectors and another
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:44,448	| IOT196 |	Just after 2
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,984	| IOT196 |	Gird up to that so
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:47,520	| IOT196 |	When are you going to recommend
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:50,336	| IOT196 |	Amsterdam temperature sensor for outdoors at all
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:52,128	| IOT196 |	Zigbee or Z-Wave
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:53,920	| IOT196 |	How to hook up to the habitat
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:55,712	| IOT196 |	Thank you very much in a great show
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,224	| IOT196 |	Enjoy listening
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:57,248	| IOT196 |	Figure
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:58,272	| IOT196 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:25:59,552	| IOT196 |	Jay
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:01,088	| IOT196 |	I want to do like
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:03,904	| IOT196 |	Give you a temp sensor cuz I assume you want your temps
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:05,184	| IOT196 |	Center to actually work
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:06,208	| IOT196 |	With your smart
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:08,768	| IOT196 |	So they're plenty of devices out there that
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:11,328	| IOT196 |	You can like just look outside your like it's 42 degrees
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:14,912	| IOT196 |	What is really frustrating to me is a lot of connected
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:17,728	| IOT196 |	Devices like doorbells and even some outdoor cameras
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:24,128	| IOT196 |	How temperature sensors in them but they're not visible to you unless you're pulling up something like openhab or Eve
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:24,640	| IOT196 |	Even Homosassa
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:28,480	| IOT196 |	So I'm going to assume that you're a normal person who isn't going to do that
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:30,528	| IOT196 |	And you're going to need a dedicated outdoor
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,040	| IOT196 |	Temperature sensor
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:32,576	| IOT196 |	Inference that
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:34,112	| IOT196 |	I am going to recommend
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:34,880	| IOT196 |	Bnet at
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:39,232	| IOT196 |	They actually just got bought by a grand they have a netatmo weather station
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:40,768	| IOT196 |	And it is
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:43,584	| IOT196 |	I am expensive it's usually on sale around the holidays
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:45,120	| IOT196 |	This is what I've used
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:47,680	| IOT196 |	In the past to know what the weather is outside it is
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:49,728	| IOT196 |	$180
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,264	| IOT196 |	You can also buy it with
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,032	| IOT196 |	The rain gauge
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,056	| IOT196 |	If you want and
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:54,848	| IOT196 |	And then you can actually get it for like 200
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:56,384	| IOT196 |	And
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:27:02,016	| IOT196 |	Yeah that's my big recommendation cuz you can actually pull that data in through other services like a gift
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:02,528	| IOT196 |	And then
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:04,064	| IOT196 |	Tie that information
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:05,600	| IOT196 |	Did you like your Hue Lights or something like that
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:08,928	| IOT196 |	And if you don't want to buy anything new because
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,720	| IOT196 |	Why not save money right
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:11,744	| IOT196 |	You can always
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:12,512	| IOT196 |	Speaking again
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:14,816	| IOT196 |	If go use Weather Underground
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:17,376	| IOT196 |	See if anyone has like a weather station near you
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:18,912	| IOT196 |	And that might be
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:19,680	| IOT196 |	Close enough
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:20,960	| IOT196 |	To work and then you can basic
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:22,240	| IOT196 |	Just pull that data end
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:26,080	| IOT196 |	Weather Underground says it's 42 degrees do the following with
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,616	| IOT196 |	At home stuff
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:29,920	| IOT196 |	And that's actually something that I've done
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:33,760	| IOT196 |	In the past I've turned my Hue Lights blue when it was below freezing outside
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:34,528	| IOT196 |	And
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:35,296	| IOT196 |	Yeah that was
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,856	| IOT196 |	Kind of a fun little thing I did when I was
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:40,416	| IOT196 |	Trying to get ready early in the morning with the dog and
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:40,928	| IOT196 |	Now I just look at
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:42,720	| IOT196 |	My Fatima a device
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:48,352	| IOT196 |	Do using somebody else's weatherstation what's next somebody else's wife I never
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:50,144	| IOT196 |	Never never mind
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,192	| IOT196 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:55,776	| IOT196 |	So that I probably use you
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,824	| IOT196 |	No no they don't
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,616	| IOT196 |	I have a lovely
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,896	| IOT196 |	Oh actually they could be
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,408	| IOT196 |	Because they have the guest
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:02,432	| IOT196 |	Knots
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,736	| IOT196 |	It's possible
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:08,576	| IOT196 |	That's my new excuse for any weird downloads that we see on my Wi-Fi
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:09,344	| IOT196 |	From my IP
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:12,160	| IOT196 |	The address okay other outdoor sensor questions
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:13,440	| IOT196 |	This one comes from Bruce
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:14,464	| IOT196 |	Let's hear it
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,816	| IOT196 |	Santa Fe
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:19,840	| IOT196 |	I live on a
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:21,376	| IOT196 |	1/2 Lots
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:25,728	| IOT196 |	In our driveways by 300 feet long I'd love to have some sort of the
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:30,336	| IOT196 |	Sensor that tells me when somebody is pulled into our driveway in
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:32,640	| IOT196 |	Send me notification of some
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:34,688	| IOT196 |	Is that something that can be done relatively
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:39,040	| IOT196 |	By the way since I live in Santa Fe
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:40,064	| IOT196 |	Where were you
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:40,832	| IOT196 |	300
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:41,600	| IOT196 |	30 days
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:42,368	| IOT196 |	Every year
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,440	| IOT196 |	This word set up
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,464	| IOT196 |	Solar recharging
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:49,024	| IOT196 |	Look forward to your response
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:51,072	| IOT196 |	Okay Bruce
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:54,912	| IOT196 |	I don't know how long your driveway is which does change my recommendation
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:56,192	| IOT196 |	Just a little bit
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:29:01,056	| IOT196 |	But the bottom line is if it's too far away if you can't use any of the popular thing
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:02,848	| IOT196 |	Things like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:04,640	| IOT196 |	Were 50 years away
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:08,736	| IOT196 |	So that throws you into this weird other
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,272	| IOT196 |	So that's
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:13,344	| IOT196 |	If your driveway super long you're going to be in the land of
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:14,112	| IOT196 |	Dedicated
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,392	| IOT196 |	Driveway sensors
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:17,952	| IOT196 |	Which companies like Chamberlain
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:19,488	| IOT196 |	I found a company called guard line
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:22,048	| IOT196 |	It also makes a really well-reviewed system
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:24,352	| IOT196 |	These are going to use a different radio
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,376	| IOT196 |	Technology that
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:26,144	| IOT196 |	I can go farther
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:26,912	| IOT196 |	In
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:27,936	| IOT196 |	Guidelines
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:28,960	| IOT196 |	In particular
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:30,752	| IOT196 |	They have one that will go
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:32,288	| IOT196 |	Auto quarter mile
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:34,080	| IOT196 |	And then they have one for a little bit closer
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,872	| IOT196 |	What they do is
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,640	| IOT196 |	The
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:37,408	| IOT196 |	Sensor
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:38,688	| IOT196 |	Is battery powered
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:40,480	| IOT196 |	When it's triggered
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:42,784	| IOT196 |	It'll send an alarm at alert
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:43,552	| IOT196 |	Alarm
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:45,856	| IOT196 |	And that's good enough for you and the alarm can be back
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:46,624	| IOT196 |	Back in your house
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:47,648	| IOT196 |	Then that's great
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:50,976	| IOT196 |	If you wanted to actually do something like turn on your porch light
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:51,744	| IOT196 |	That's where things
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:55,072	| IOT196 |	Skyline lets you
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:56,096	| IOT196 |	Tie into a
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:30:00,192	| IOT196 |	A 12-volt switch so what you can do is you take the receiver you take off the back
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,472	| IOT196 |	Can you wire
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:03,264	| IOT196 |	Whatever switch you want
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,032	| IOT196 |	To that
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:04,800	| IOT196 |	Device
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:07,104	| IOT196 |	And then when the sensor is triggered
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:11,200	| IOT196 |	And instead of like the alarm actually going off on the receiver what'll it do it is it
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:11,968	| IOT196 |	Google say hey
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:13,504	| IOT196 |	Something just happened
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:15,040	| IOT196 |	My state just changed
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:15,552	| IOT196 |	Now
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:17,088	| IOT196 |	To bring that back and
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:19,392	| IOT196 |	Smart home you're going to need some
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:20,160	| IOT196 |	I'm pretty heavy lift
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:21,952	| IOT196 |	SmartThings is going to be your best
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:25,536	| IOT196 |	Because they have a dedicated community
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:26,048	| IOT196 |	So import
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:27,328	| IOT196 |	And
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,864	| IOT196 |	There's plenty of discussion
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:30,400	| IOT196 |	About wifi-based
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:31,680	| IOT196 |	Relays
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:32,960	| IOT196 |	For 12 volt
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,728	| IOT196 |	Contact
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:34,240	| IOT196 |	Sensors
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:36,544	| IOT196 |	Yeah those are all things you're going to want to go
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:39,872	| IOT196 |	Until what you'll do is you'll take your 12 volt contact
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:42,176	| IOT196 |	Center that converts to Wi-Fi
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:42,688	| IOT196 |	Wire that too
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,224	| IOT196 |	State changes
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:45,760	| IOT196 |	Send a notification over Wi-Fi
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,296	| IOT196 |	Then
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,320	| IOT196 |	You're going to have to program
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:49,600	| IOT196 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:50,112	| IOT196 |	App that you watch
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:52,160	| IOT196 |	Actually
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:52,928	| IOT196 |	Do something with that
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:57,024	| IOT196 |	So that's a really long way of saying it's going to be kind of a pain in the butt so
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:58,560	| IOT196 |	This may not be the
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:30:59,328	| IOT196 |	Best option
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:00,864	| IOT196 |	The Garland stuff is about a hundred bucks
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:03,424	| IOT196 |	You can buy the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:04,960	| IOT196 |	The12volt to.wifi stuff for
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:06,752	| IOT196 |	Between actually
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,776	| IOT196 |	10 +
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:09,824	| IOT196 |	5 + $20
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:13,152	| IOT196 |	The other option I want to give you especially if you have Wi-Fi
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:14,432	| IOT196 |	Play all the way out there
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:15,200	| IOT196 |	Is
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:16,224	| IOT196 |	Kind of Overkill
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:16,736	| IOT196 |	But it will work
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:18,016	| IOT196 |	Ring make
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:18,784	| IOT196 |	Fix a camera
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:19,808	| IOT196 |	Called the spotlight
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:22,880	| IOT196 |	If you take the ring Spotlight cam
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:23,648	| IOT196 |	In a solar panel
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:25,952	| IOT196 |	You can actually put that out there
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:28,000	| IOT196 |	If you have the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:29,280	| IOT196 |	I think can get that far out
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:30,560	| IOT196 |	Then
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:33,888	| IOT196 |	That will actually send you that ties directly into
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:35,936	| IOT196 |	You all kinds of smart home systems
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:36,960	| IOT196 |	And you can do that so
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:39,264	| IOT196 |	That tho will cost you
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:41,312	| IOT196 |	$229
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:42,848	| IOT196 |	For the camera and the solar panel
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:43,616	| IOT196 |	But
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:44,640	| IOT196 |	It is a stand-alone thing
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:46,432	| IOT196 |	Is predicated though
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:48,480	| IOT196 |	Are you having Wi-Fi as far out as the edge
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:50,784	| IOT196 |	Keep your driveway and then you get both the camera and emotion
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:54,880	| IOT196 |	Which I know it feels like Overkill but really there are
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:56,928	| IOT196 |	No outdoor capable
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:59,232	| IOT196 |	Wifi-based sensors that we
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:00,000	| IOT196 |	Find
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:01,280	| IOT196 |	If any of you out there
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:01,792	| IOT196 |	Have them
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:05,376	| IOT196 |	It also alleviates any wiring
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:07,424	| IOT196 |	Which is a big big plus I think
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:09,216	| IOT196 |	All of the solutions I told you where wire
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,520	| IOT196 |	Well except for the
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:14,080	| IOT196 |	Oh I see the voltage that I was thinking about like none of these things have
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:15,616	| IOT196 |	But yes
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:16,896	| IOT196 |	That the wiring
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:19,712	| IOT196 |	That's not hard wiring you could totally do it
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:20,480	| IOT196 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,016	| IOT196 |	Just don't like it
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:22,528	| IOT196 |	12
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:25,856	| IOT196 |	I mean
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:26,624	| IOT196 |	Could you look it
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:28,416	| IOT196 |	I'm like have you ever licked a 9 volt battery
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:31,744	| IOT196 |	At my daddy
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:33,024	| IOT196 |	To do that to me cuz he's
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:38,400	| IOT196 |	Sometimes I let the dog like it pay does not like that you are so mean
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:39,680	| IOT196 |	Small children
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:42,496	| IOT196 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:44,800	| IOT196 |	Norm
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:46,336	| IOT196 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:49,408	| IOT196 |	I feel like we're done with Outdoors let's go indoors
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:52,480	| IOT196 |	Two Echo skills for middle schoolers
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:54,528	| IOT196 |	Dean has like a raped
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:56,320	| IOT196 |	And we cannot
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:57,088	| IOT196 |	Wait
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:57,600	| IOT196 |	To tell you what
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:32:59,648	| IOT196 |	So let's hear
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:00,416	| IOT196 |	From Dean
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:02,720	| IOT196 |	7
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:04,256	| IOT196 |	Try this one more time
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:06,816	| IOT196 |	16 and I'm a designer body
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:07,840	| IOT196 |	Steve Perry
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:10,656	| IOT196 |	I have the genius our kids that just loved
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:12,448	| IOT196 |	You thought you were talking about writing
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:13,984	| IOT196 |	Nikolas and so on
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:15,264	| IOT196 |	And why isn't it
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:17,056	| IOT196 |	Can we write
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:18,336	| IOT196 |	Stills or
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:19,104	| IOT196 |	NFL
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:23,200	| IOT196 |	Can we do something with iot and I was curious how
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:23,968	| IOT196 |	Still at 8
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:24,992	| IOT196 |	This Quest
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:28,576	| IOT196 |	In and see it from the perspective of middle schoolers
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:30,624	| IOT196 |	Because they are native to this
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:31,904	| IOT196 |	Technology
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:33,440	| IOT196 |	Any help would be
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:34,720	| IOT196 |	Great I
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:35,232	| IOT196 |	Would appreciate
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:37,280	| IOT196 |	Thanks in advance in
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:38,304	| IOT196 |	Totally love your show
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:44,192	| IOT196 |	So can I just say I love this question Dean I'm a big believer in
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:45,472	| IOT196 |	Stem
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:49,056	| IOT196 |	Young people learning to code in Tinker and make
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:50,080	| IOT196 |	So this is awesome
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:53,152	| IOT196 |	And you are in luck if you have not seen it yet
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:54,176	| IOT196 |	On the
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:56,224	| IOT196 |	Amazon developer site
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:56,992	| IOT196 |	4
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:58,272	| IOT196 |	Madam age
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:59,296	| IOT196 |	Skills
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,576	| IOT196 |	There is a kids
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:01,600	| IOT196 |	Section end
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:06,976	| IOT196 |	We'll put a link in the show notes all that you could probably just Google Madam a skills
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:11,840	| IOT196 |	Kit for kids which is how I found this at I spent like an hour
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:14,144	| IOT196 |	Just pulling through everything on here
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:16,192	| IOT196 |	So everything here is geared towards
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:19,520	| IOT196 |	Kids under the age of 13 and that's important because
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:25,152	| IOT196 |	Amazon provide all the information you need to satisfy the privacy and
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:26,176	| IOT196 |	Compliance laws
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:31,296	| IOT196 |	And the parental consent laws for kids cuz that's obviously a part of this even if you're just doing this
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:32,576	| IOT196 |	In a classroom I think you
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:34,112	| IOT196 |	Probably seems to want to follow those
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:36,672	| IOT196 |	There's also some amazing little
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:37,952	| IOT196 |	How do I say
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:41,536	| IOT196 |	Tips not just tips but some really cool tools you can use
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:44,096	| IOT196 |	Have you heard of speech cons before
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:45,888	| IOT196 |	Con con
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:47,424	| IOT196 |	See I have not
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:49,728	| IOT196 |	I'm going to play one or two the right now
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:52,032	| IOT196 |	Speech cons are little interjections
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:54,080	| IOT196 |	Can you can have Madam a reed
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:55,104	| IOT196 |	Any word
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:55,616	| IOT196 |	As
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:58,688	| IOT196 |	In a certain way let me give you an example
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:34:59,456	| IOT196 |	Alrighty
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:00,992	| IOT196 |	Aloha
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,528	| IOT196 |	Yoga
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:07,136	| IOT196 |	Certain interjections kind of got a little more personality than the same old same old
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:10,976	| IOT196 |	And I think it would just love you too faced Peach concept
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:17,632	| IOT196 |	There's hundreds of them there's hundreds of them and on top of all that getting back to the heart of the question
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:18,656	| IOT196 |	There are
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:19,424	| IOT196 |	Kids
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:22,240	| IOT196 |	Skill tutorials and I followed through with one
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:24,288	| IOT196 |	And I'm not going to lie. There's some
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:30,432	| IOT196 |	Working bother me an Amazon has made this easy as possible but it's more than just like building say the
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:32,480	| IOT196 |	Voice interface and the responses
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:35,808	| IOT196 |	You have to go through after you've done that because
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:37,600	| IOT196 |	For example they build a quiz
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:44,000	| IOT196 |	Game skill in there tutorial on Michael this is easy once you get the first part done then you have to go and build
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:46,560	| IOT196 |	Amazon AWS Lambda function
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:47,584	| IOT196 |	And then link
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:50,144	| IOT196 |	Wii user interface to that code
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:53,984	| IOT196 |	So not trying to scare you I'm just saying you may want to
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:58,848	| IOT196 |	Do the Lambda function for the kids and let them work on the user interface you link the two
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:01,408	| IOT196 |	And then they can test it customize it and heck
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:02,176	| IOT196 |	If it's
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:04,480	| IOT196 |	Really awesome and they want to share it with other kids
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:07,552	| IOT196 |	You all can publish it to the Alexa skills
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:13,952	| IOT196 |	Library so another good reason to follow all those legalities and things in case you decide you want to publish it so just
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:18,048	| IOT196 |	At the site go through it I don't think you need to be a heavy-duty Kotor to get
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:20,608	| IOT196 |	What you want done and again I think of you
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:25,216	| IOT196 |	The kids focus on the voice user interface you can tell them how you're going to tie it together with
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:26,496	| IOT196 |	AWS in the cloud
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:28,288	| IOT196 |	But you probably won't do that part yourself
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,312	| IOT196 |	Very cool
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:30,848	| IOT196 |	I kind of want to do this now too
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:32,384	| IOT196 |	I want it to say awooga
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:33,152	| IOT196 |	All the time
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:34,944	| IOT196 |	Actually I don't know why that
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:35,968	| IOT196 |	What's tickling me so much
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:36,736	| IOT196 |	But it really is
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:39,808	| IOT196 |	Okay
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:48,256	| IOT196 |	Sorry there's just so many and you can just keep clicking on them up here's one of my favorites before we leave this one
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:53,888	| IOT196 |	Alright does Google have anything like this
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:54,912	| IOT196 |	I am not
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:59,008	| IOT196 |	Seen anything like this I'm sure they have ways to modulate the voice but
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:00,800	| IOT196 |	I've not seen like a web page
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:07,200	| IOT196 |	Filled with hundreds of these that you can play back and then just you know listen to and that you were that's the one I want to use
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:07,968	| IOT196 |	You have John Legend
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:11,040	| IOT196 |	His voice
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:12,320	| IOT196 |	They don't have that though
