EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:59,552	| IOT184 |	That's a UK let.
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:00,064	| IOT184 |	IO
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:02,112	| IOT184 |	Hey Kevin
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:04,160	| IOT184 |	Start off this week with
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,184	| IOT184 |	Branding
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,464	| IOT184 |	The Wi-Fi Alliance
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:07,488	| IOT184 |	Is at it again
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,024	| IOT184 |	They have decided
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:11,840	| IOT184 |	But the energy. 11.
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:13,632	| IOT184 |	Acaax
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:15,936	| IOT184 |	Angie B I don't know Q
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:17,728	| IOT184 |	It's all way too confusing
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,008	| IOT184 |	Yente
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:19,776	| IOT184 |	Their solution
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:20,800	| IOT184 |	Is
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:21,824	| IOT184 |	Adverse
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:29,248	| IOT184 |	So the new ax standard is going to be called Wi-Fi 6
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:31,296	| IOT184 |	I guess AC within B5
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:34,624	| IOT184 |	I guess it would be and that would be
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,392	| IOT184 |	4
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:41,536	| IOT184 |	Cats they're doing a rebranding all those with numbers you will not hear about Wi-Fi one two and three cuz
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,352	| IOT184 |	I'm gone
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:49,728	| IOT184 |	We're beyond that although a lot of smart home devices doorbell
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:51,008	| IOT184 |	B r g
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:53,568	| IOT184 |	They do so that's going to be interesting
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:54,592	| IOT184 |	And that gets us
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:56,640	| IOT184 |	To public service announcement about Wi-Fi
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,944	| IOT184 |	You probably do not need
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,480	| IOT184 |	Update your system
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:01,760	| IOT184 |	To LAX
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:03,296	| IOT184 |	Not yet anyway
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:04,832	| IOT184 |	Don't don't do it
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:10,464	| IOT184 |	Don't do it I'm an early adopter of these things and I am not doing it
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:10,976	| IOT184 |	Yes
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,256	| IOT184 |	Because
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:15,072	| IOT184 |	It has to be really awesome and to get the amazing GBS
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,656	| IOT184 |	The 2.3 gigabits-per-second capacity
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:21,728	| IOT184 |	1.2 using all 8
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:27,872	| IOT184 |	Streams and apple be using 160 megahertz channels that's the biggest pipe I believe for ax
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,896	| IOT184 |	Okay
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,992	| IOT184 |	You will also
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:34,272	| IOT184 |	You said you need to do that
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,320	| IOT184 |	And then your client devices also
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,088	| IOT184 |	Have to have
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:40,416	| IOT184 |	Copper capability otherwise they're just going to use what they can do
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,440	| IOT184 |	Invited in
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:43,488	| IOT184 |	Remember what that is but it's
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:44,768	| IOT184 |	A gigabit per second
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,096	| IOT184 |	So
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:50,400	| IOT184 |	Upgrade your smartphones not using us yet
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:52,704	| IOT184 |	Which is probably the year most popular most
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,472	| IOT184 |	Commonly
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,752	| IOT184 |	Used device
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:57,056	| IOT184 |	Certainly not your iot devices
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:59,360	| IOT184 |	So if you think this is going to help you in that capacity
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:04,480	| IOT184 |	Percy routers that have us and I believe there have been already
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:05,504	| IOT184 |	Released
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:12,160	| IOT184 |	I don't recall who has put them out there but don't rush to get them because you're right once you have the router
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:16,768	| IOT184 |	Then you're going to have to wait for your client devices to have their Hardware upgraded
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:23,167	| IOT184 |	To take full advantage of this and that means yes your phone's your tablet your set-top boxes you two devices which again
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:25,983	| IOT184 |	Probably won't get this capability anyway because
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:29,311	| IOT184 |	Gabby cranmore antennas and older devices to get this so
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:30,079	| IOT184 |	There's just no rush
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:35,455	| IOT184 |	So wait for that APK or 32k TV with all the antennas and maybe then
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:36,479	| IOT184 |	Maybe then
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,271	| IOT184 |	So what other thing
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:40,831	| IOT184 |	And this is kind of annoys me and maybe I'm nitpicking here
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:44,159	| IOT184 |	Here's what I do not want to see happen but I'm sure it's going to anyway
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:46,463	| IOT184 |	Do you remember Stacy when
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:50,303	| IOT184 |	Neuer wife I came out and all of these companies said hey we got
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:53,887	| IOT184 |	5G Wi-Fi Wichita
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,423	| IOT184 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:05:02,079	| IOT184 |	Technically that was correct because hey this is versus the 6th generation of life I standards for
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:02,847	| IOT184 |	Nostra news
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:06,687	| IOT184 |	Please do not call it 6G don't even call the old ones
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,711	| IOT184 |	5G because
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:08,735	| IOT184 |	You're messing around with
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:13,599	| IOT184 |	No cellular network naming conventions in that ditch
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:17,439	| IOT184 |	I will call at the first one it doesn't
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,975	| IOT184 |	This is so upsetting to me
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,023	| IOT184 |	I just can't
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:22,815	| IOT184 |	So let's talk about
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:25,119	| IOT184 |	Satellite.
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:29,215	| IOT184 |	Is launching an iot satellite Network
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:29,983	| IOT184 |	Amazon
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,775	| IOT184 |	Web services
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,543	| IOT184 |	This
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:36,895	| IOT184 |	Is designed to basically give you connectivity for things where there is no Cellular Connection
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:37,919	| IOT184 |	And
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,199	| IOT184 |	It is so cool
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:46,367	| IOT184 |	It is cool and I totally understand what they're trying to do because you know there are remote areas where you might want iot
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,903	| IOT184 |	Key devices or applications
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:51,999	| IOT184 |	And you just don't have good cellular coverage so doesn't matter if
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:54,815	| IOT184 |	You know he had an NB iot device
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:57,375	| IOT184 |	If there's no network
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:59,423	| IOT184 |	It's funny to me iridium is like the
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,983	| IOT184 |	Satellite service that just will never die
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,007	| IOT184 |	Remember
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:06,847	| IOT184 |	It was actually for voice Communications back in the day
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:09,663	| IOT184 |	For the same reason because of cellular coverage
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:14,527	| IOT184 |	Yeah when you were going to your trip to Antarctica
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:18,111	| IOT184 |	Crazy septum
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,415	| IOT184 |	You had your sat phone
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:22,207	| IOT184 |	Yes satellite is one of those
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,743	| IOT184 |	Expensive necessities
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,535	| IOT184 |	They've always wanted
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,095	| IOT184 |	Find use cases that
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,703	| IOT184 |	When you're doing satellite
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,983	| IOT184 |	One of the cost is
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:36,543	| IOT184 |	Launching a satellite
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:40,383	| IOT184 |	But the other costs are you got these
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:42,687	| IOT184 |	Really the modules that you have to have to
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:45,759	| IOT184 |	Communicate with a satellite or very expensive
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,295	| IOT184 |	Again
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:48,575	| IOT184 |	To be honest
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:53,695	| IOT184 |	IRT actually makes more sense than some of the other implementations for satellite Communications
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,719	| IOT184 |	The Voice
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:57,023	| IOT184 |	For internet you had like up to 2
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:59,327	| IOT184 |	Second latency
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,351	| IOT184 |	Highlights
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,375	| IOT184 |	So here's my question
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,679	| IOT184 |	They're talking about this is called cloud
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,215	| IOT184 |	They're talking about using it Electra
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:08,031	| IOT184 |	Makes sense
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:12,127	| IOT184 |	Another popular thing on a shipping container
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,919	| IOT184 |	But comes to buy
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:16,479	| IOT184 |	Most of those are going to function
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:21,855	| IOT184 |	With like normal radios that talk to a Gateway the gateway to satellite backhaul
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,879	| IOT184 |	But a lot of
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:25,183	| IOT184 |	Could actually just be done effectively be a lot
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:28,511	| IOT184 |	So you can say hey if it's a refrigerated shipping container
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:33,887	| IOT184 |	Yule log it like log temperature changes and if it goes out of range even if you could have notified
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,655	| IOT184 |	Vacation
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,447	| IOT184 |	It's unclear if there's much you can
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,215	| IOT184 |	Do
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:37,983	| IOT184 |	Lake in the middle of the ocean
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,775	| IOT184 |	There may be something
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:43,103	| IOT184 |	It has to be a high-value item to Justified
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:43,871	| IOT184 |	Cost
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,919	| IOT184 |	So I'm just thinking here
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:51,039	| IOT184 |	And it's possible when you go back into cellular range
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:54,111	| IOT184 |	Just uploaded
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:57,183	| IOT184 |	Again I think it makes sense for some high-value objects
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:59,231	| IOT184 |	If you're transporting diamonds then
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:02,303	| IOT184 |	Popping on this network so you can see it wherever it is
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,071	| IOT184 |	But I don't know
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,351	| IOT184 |	We'll see
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:07,679	| IOT184 |	Maybe third time's a charm for iridium I don't know maybe
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,471	| IOT184 |	I'm just such a satellite you know
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:12,031	| IOT184 |	I look satellites I just
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:12,799	| IOT184 |	It's a difficult business
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:14,847	| IOT184 |	California
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,407	| IOT184 |	Which is left and right
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:20,991	| IOT184 |	Crazy has left and left space of corset net neutrality
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,783	| IOT184 |	They now have this new law
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,063	| IOT184 |	That we talked about that is the
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:30,463	| IOT184 |	Cybersecurity law covering smart devices it is the first state to pass such a lot is SB 327
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:33,535	| IOT184 |	Passed in late August and the governor signed it
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,559	| IOT184 |	It's a first step
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,839	| IOT184 |	It's minimum
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,607	| IOT184 |	So we need
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:38,143	| IOT184 |	Work because it's just
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:41,215	| IOT184 |	Requiring that any device that connects to the internet
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:47,103	| IOT184 |	Has to have reasonable security features so we talked about this on Pryor show it's a first step it's not the end-all be-all by any means
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:52,479	| IOT184 |	So the law requires manufacturers to equip connected devices with quote
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,527	| IOT184 |	A reasonable security feature or
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,295	| IOT184 |	Futures
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,063	| IOT184 |	Designed to permit
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,599	| IOT184 |	Packers from
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:09:02,719	| IOT184 |	It does not define what this feature should be some people are upset about this but I actually think it's
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:07,583	| IOT184 |	Probably a good thing to keep this bag because technology and decryption Technologies change so quickly
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:10,399	| IOT184 |	It does mandated connected devices
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,679	| IOT184 |	Come with unique passwords
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,727	| IOT184 |	That users can change
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:17,823	| IOT184 |	So yeah I would love for them to say that you know you force users to change
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,615	| IOT184 |	That didn't happen
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:23,711	| IOT184 |	I think they are forced a required for Caesar to change if it doesn't
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:25,759	| IOT184 |	Come with a unique password I think it's an either-or
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,575	| IOT184 |	So
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:30,623	| IOT184 |	Some critics have talked about
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,927	| IOT184 |	Dealing with mean to bag which I've just
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:34,975	| IOT184 |	Praise but they're like it's not useful
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:35,999	| IOT184 |	And they also
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,535	| IOT184 |	Basically are like saying
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:41,119	| IOT184 |	Hey instead of forcing people to add security features why don't you
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,399	| IOT184 |	Insecure future
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:47,519	| IOT184 |	I wish that they'd spent more time deciding what those insecure features actually are
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:52,639	| IOT184 |	Device to the internet
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:54,175	| IOT184 |	Typically I think
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,199	| IOT184 |	Good practices or
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,735	| IOT184 |	Car security alert
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:10:02,367	| IOT184 |	Make sure every devices over there update and
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:05,183	| IOT184 |	Unique he's actually are really relevant
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,207	| IOT184 |	And I like
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,791	| IOT184 |	That's a good thing
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,071	| IOT184 |	That gets a little bar in
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| IOT184 |	No hay
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,911	| IOT184 |	Okay so that is the new law
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:17,727	| IOT184 |	The idea is this only works for people selling devices
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:18,495	| IOT184 |	California
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,287	| IOT184 |	California
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,823	| IOT184 |	So do many other
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:24,383	| IOT184 |	The most populous state in the US
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,407	| IOT184 |	Chimpanzee
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:27,199	| IOT184 |	Has got
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,223	| IOT184 |	How do you want it
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:32,831	| IOT184 |	I think I might not sure yet
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:35,903	| IOT184 |	What is going to bring to the table but I think I might
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:38,463	| IOT184 |	IBM has actually put out a blog post
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,743	| IOT184 |	That's
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:46,143	| IOT184 |	Explain how to add IBM Watson services to home assistant which I know is a platform some of our folks
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:49,471	| IOT184 |	Home assistant is open source and it's something you kind of
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:55,871	| IOT184 |	Have to put on your own device like a Raspberry Pi instead of buying a Smart Hub human system becomes the Hub so it's more for the
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:57,919	| IOT184 |	DIY folks in the books like the program
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:04,831	| IOT184 |	I think it's going to be interesting to try and I think I'm going to do this because I want to see you again what Watson brings
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,367	| IOT184 |	The idea here is it
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:11,999	| IOT184 |	Platform-agnostic devices in your house and will provide a unified interface and then
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:14,815	| IOT184 |	My guess is based on what IBM is saying
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,095	| IOT184 |	They will help you
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,375	| IOT184 |	And developers make
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:21,471	| IOT184 |	Compose analytics visualization cash boards and new apps
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:22,751	| IOT184 |	I'm thinking
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:29,151	| IOT184 |	Will it bring some kind of machine learning Watson actually start bringing more smarts to the smart home as a reason
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,687	| IOT184 |	So that's the whole
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:32,223	| IOT184 |	But I will have to try it and see
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:38,367	| IOT184 |	Provokes a half home assistant it doesn't look too difficult to integrate a little bit of
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:41,951	| IOT184 |	I think that's something everybody should have anyway I'll get off my soapbox
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,975	| IOT184 |	And
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,255	| IOT184 |	Yeah it's pretty much
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:46,303	| IOT184 |	Bright out there and I github
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:48,351	| IOT184 |	Repository and add
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,375	| IOT184 |	Got it and
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:53,983	| IOT184 |	So are you looking for like visualisations of what's happening in your home like what kind of machine learning are you
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:54,751	| IOT184 |	Trying to do with your hair
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:12:01,663	| IOT184 |	Will know it would be nice if Watson saw that I'm doing the same things all the time manually if there's a way to automated Maybe
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,943	| IOT184 |	You could come to be like the
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,991	| IOT184 |	Amazon Padme hunches
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:08,831	| IOT184 |	I still haven't have you thought Hunters on your battle Bay yet
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,855	| IOT184 |	I got soul Hunters
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:14,719	| IOT184 |	All right. I don't know yet but I am very curious
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:17,791	| IOT184 |	Hey
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,095	| IOT184 |	Okay
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:21,119	| IOT184 |	Rooting
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,143	| IOT184 |	Right along
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,935	| IOT184 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:24,703	| IOT184 |	Mox
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:27,519	| IOT184 |	Apple's bringing keyless door entry to campuses
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:28,287	| IOT184 |	And
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:33,151	| IOT184 |	You know
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:33,919	| IOT184 |	Why are there
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:41,599	| IOT184 |	Yeah they're in this is great and I'm taking classes at my Community College my daughter is taking classes at her College
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:47,999	| IOT184 |	Neither one is one of the three that Apple just added support to and I think they'd already mentioned that this was going to happen these canvases it's Duke
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:53,887	| IOT184 |	University of Alabama and University of Oklahoma
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:59,519	| IOT184 |	They can use that to you know when I need to show the ID that can pay for things using their
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:02,335	| IOT184 |	Student account with that really interested me was
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,663	| IOT184 |	Using that to get into their dorms the gym in the library
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:10,271	| IOT184 |	And told them through NFC and I'm like okay that's cool that iPhone has NFC and so does he
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:15,647	| IOT184 |	It's awesome
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:19,231	| IOT184 |	Why don't we have more NFC locks because to me this
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:23,583	| IOT184 |	Just makes more sense of remembering little codes like we had at my house or example
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:24,351	| IOT184 |	Punching arm
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,631	| IOT184 |	Kiko don't get in
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:29,727	| IOT184 |	Makes more sense perhaps than Bluetooth which has a much larger range in might be easier
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:30,495	| IOT184 |	Pack
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:33,567	| IOT184 |	Yeah NFC just put something close to the door open
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:36,895	| IOT184 |	I do recall that Yale had about two years ago some NFC locks
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:40,735	| IOT184 |	But I don't see them for sale anymore and I just wonder if the idea of NFC locks
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:42,015	| IOT184 |	Was head of it
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:42,783	| IOT184 |	Time
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:47,647	| IOT184 |	Because people wouldn't have phones and watches with NFC at that time but now it's becoming so prevalent
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,671	| IOT184 |	I think we need to research
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,207	| IOT184 |	Kevin I don't know
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:52,767	| IOT184 |	I want to think it's a power
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:59,167	| IOT184 |	Consumption thing or maybe it was just people don't use it and you know it
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:04,031	| IOT184 |	Is interference
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:10,943	| IOT184 |	Maybe someone has a really good explanation
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,223	| IOT184 |	All right
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:13,503	| IOT184 |	We're puzzled by this
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,783	| IOT184 |	But I am
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,831	| IOT184 |	Microsoft has brought Cortana
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:21,183	| IOT184 |	Too noise cancelling headphones these are $350 which is expensive
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:22,207	| IOT184 |	In the rain
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,487	| IOT184 |	Headphones
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:25,791	| IOT184 |	What why why Cortana
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,375	| IOT184 |	Well
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:32,703	| IOT184 |	I mean they did me this earlier this week after being Hardware event
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:35,007	| IOT184 |	Where they also debuted all new Surface products
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,823	| IOT184 |	Surface Pro's news
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:43,199	| IOT184 |	Sunset Ford so this kind of goes along with that in terms of new hardware
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:46,783	| IOT184 |	So you really going to add they're not going to have Google or Madam a
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:47,807	| IOT184 |	Now they're going to
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:49,599	| IOT184 |	Try and get people using Cortana
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:51,647	| IOT184 |	We put that thang up the partnership
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:54,975	| IOT184 |	They do and maybe they'll integrated Madam a
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:57,023	| IOT184 |	Into these with a firmware update later
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,303	| IOT184 |	But I'm not surprised that you was
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:04,703	| IOT184 |	Cortana the thing is to use them to use the Cortana bets you do have to be paired with a computer or a phone
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:05,727	| IOT184 |	Something that
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:10,847	| IOT184 |	Has Cortana already installed obviously and it's no different than Google assistant or Madame a butt
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:13,407	| IOT184 |	If you're not using Cortana any other devices
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:15,199	| IOT184 |	Likely going to buy these headphones
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,527	| IOT184 |	The one nice thing is normally on
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:20,319	| IOT184 |	Headphones that have an assistant built in
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,087	| IOT184 |	You have to
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:21,855	| IOT184 |	Tap something
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,391	| IOT184 |	To enable.
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,671	| IOT184 |	Assistant
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,463	| IOT184 |	You don't have to do that with these
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,231	| IOT184 |	D6
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:33,375	| IOT184 |	Kind of an always-on thing you can't set turn off by default yet but I presume you will be able to in the future but you just
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,911	| IOT184 |	Say Hey Cortana
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:36,191	| IOT184 |	And if you're wearing his headphones
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,215	| IOT184 |	He responds in your ears
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,055	| IOT184 |	So I am not buying this
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:45,407	| IOT184 |	All right moving right along to some quick news Bates Johnson Controls
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:45,919	| IOT184 |	Which
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:46,943	| IOT184 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,223	| IOT184 |	Control products
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:50,783	| IOT184 |	Industrial stuff that they bought a thermostat maker called
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:52,063	| IOT184 |	Lux products
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:53,087	| IOT184 |	Lux actually
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:16:00,255	| IOT184 |	I have a thermostat which is a
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,791	| IOT184 |	The talks to Google home
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:06,655	| IOT184 |	Set the nice-looking
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,959	| IOT184 |	It works
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:12,031	| IOT184 |	It works it's $150 people like it
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:13,311	| IOT184 |	Johnson Controls
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,359	| IOT184 |	So yay
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:16,639	| IOT184 |	Splunk
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:17,151	| IOT184 |	Which is
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,711	| IOT184 |	This is a data logging
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:22,527	| IOT184 |	Company they now have their first
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:24,319	| IOT184 |	Industrial iot product
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:28,671	| IOT184 |	Surprisingly called Splunk for industrial iot
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:31,231	| IOT184 |	This brings Splunk logging
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:32,511	| IOT184 |	Software
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:35,071	| IOT184 |	Machine learning toolkit
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:37,119	| IOT184 |	Visualization
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:38,143	| IOT184 |	Package
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:39,935	| IOT184 |	All to the industrial world
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:43,775	| IOT184 |	So this is really to capture and analyze data in a
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:47,615	| IOT184 |	Customizable dashboard I suspect on exmoor analytics that anything else
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,663	| IOT184 |	It's logging in and out
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:51,199	| IOT184 |	So you get all this information
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:55,807	| IOT184 |	Sponge has been involved in the IT world for a long time
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:56,831	| IOT184 |	Smogon all kinds
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:59,391	| IOT184 |	Now it is going into the
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:02,975	| IOT184 |	What was all the OT role vs. operational Technologies
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:05,279	| IOT184 |	Sensor controls Industrial
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:08,351	| IOT184 |	Hardcore stuff and a lot of that
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:11,679	| IOT184 |	Stop is on his own network that never deals and touches with it now
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:14,495	| IOT184 |	So spark is basically saying
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:17,567	| IOT184 |	Something just for you
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,335	| IOT184 |	Power
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:22,943	| IOT184 |	Energy Transportation these companies have these networks artist Abba
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,991	| IOT184 |	So it's a big deal
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:26,271	| IOT184 |	Asplundh
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,039	| IOT184 |	There are
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:29,343	| IOT184 |	Tough tools in the industrial world
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,439	| IOT184 |	So the competition there should be
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,207	| IOT184 |	Kind of interesting
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:35,487	| IOT184 |	But it's possible
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,767	| IOT184 |	As
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,047	| IOT184 |	Companies are pursuing
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:40,863	| IOT184 |	The internet of things and what they call Digital Trends
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:41,631	| IOT184 |	Information
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:43,679	| IOT184 |	The it guys are getting a lot
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:47,263	| IOT184 |	More say in what happens on the OT side so that maybes blocks weigh in
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,311	| IOT184 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:52,127	| IOT184 |	Speaking of industrial GE
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,407	| IOT184 |	Could have started
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:57,759	| IOT184 |	5 years ago with the industrial internet-of-things
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:59,039	| IOT184 |	I was there
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:01,855	| IOT184 |	GE just started talking about its jet airplane engine
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:04,927	| IOT184 |	How old is Cindy
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:06,207	| IOT184 |	Octave machine learning
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:10,559	| IOT184 |	Everything was going to be a service
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:12,095	| IOT184 |	She's been in trouble for a while
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:14,655	| IOT184 |	And earlier this week and CEO John Flannery
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:17,727	| IOT184 |	Was
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:19,775	| IOT184 |	Surprisingly kicked out
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,311	| IOT184 |	And replaced
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:23,103	| IOT184 |	So
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:26,943	| IOT184 |	No Larry
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,967	| IOT184 |	And selling various assets
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:29,503	| IOT184 |	So now
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,271	| IOT184 |	Larry Culp
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,295	| IOT184 |	The new CEO
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,087	| IOT184 |	It's going to be
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:35,391	| IOT184 |	Finishing that up and trying to
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:36,927	| IOT184 |	LG get back
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,719	| IOT184 |	Track
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:41,023	| IOT184 |	They also announced
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:41,791	| IOT184 |	The sale
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:43,071	| IOT184 |	Oh
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:45,887	| IOT184 |	Is intelligent platforms automation business
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:48,191	| IOT184 |	Emerson and this week I'm actually at
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:48,959	| IOT184 |	The Emerson
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,495	| IOT184 |	Annual country
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:56,639	| IOT184 |	Prince and announcements on Tuesday the day Emerson answers on Tuesday that they bought the intelligent platforms
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:59,711	| IOT184 |	Business sadly they could not say much about it including
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:00,991	| IOT184 |	The deal terms
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:06,111	| IOT184 |	That business did generate about 210 million in Revenue in 2017
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:07,135	| IOT184 |	So
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:08,927	| IOT184 |	Probably hopefully higher than that
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:09,951	| IOT184 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:15,583	| IOT184 |	Interesting it's the most like this was one of the more successful areas in this space for GE because
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:19,679	| IOT184 |	Perfect example early adopters of their industrial internet control system
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:25,567	| IOT184 |	Saw a 40% reduction in maintenance minutes because of the predictiveness of Analytics
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:31,199	| IOT184 |	White and Emerson which has their automation controls business which is very much apart
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:33,247	| IOT184 |	Process manufacturing so thick
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,527	| IOT184 |	Anything like
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:36,319	| IOT184 |	Oil and gas chemical refinery
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,111	| IOT184 |	Even some food production
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:38,623	| IOT184 |	Those guys
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:40,671	| IOT184 |	Bunch of clients
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,463	| IOT184 |	It's this week that talked about saving
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,487	| IOT184 |	Gobs of money
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,047	| IOT184 |	Actually
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:48,351	| IOT184 |	Generating real savings from there
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:50,143	| IOT184 |	Installation of smarter
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:52,191	| IOT184 |	Sensors in predictive and using things like
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:55,775	| IOT184 |	So this DuckTales really well
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:56,543	| IOT184 |	But
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:58,079	| IOT184 |	It is still kind of like where I live
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,871	| IOT184 |	What is happening with GE
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,639	| IOT184 |	The answer is
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,175	| IOT184 |	A lot
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,271	| IOT184 |	But
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:08,575	| IOT184 |	Big companies are picking up the pieces
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,391	| IOT184 |	Export
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:13,439	| IOT184 |	Heart digital know how
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,975	| IOT184 |	To a lot of other places
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:18,047	| IOT184 |	Emerson already had plenty of digital know how
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:19,327	| IOT184 |	Other places
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,119	| IOT184 |	You can never have
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:21,887	| IOT184 |	Too much know how
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:25,471	| IOT184 |	I feel like some people might feel they have too much
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:28,543	| IOT184 |	They don't need to tell me how much you know how they have
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:29,311	| IOT184 |	All right
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,079	| IOT184 |	Speaking of know how
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:31,359	| IOT184 |	Kevin
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:33,407	| IOT184 |	You know how we can use our
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:34,943	| IOT184 |	Doors windows
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,967	| IOT184 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:42,111	| IOT184 |	Yes I kind of feel like the door window sensor doesn't get respect it's like the least respected thing in the iot world in the smart
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:43,647	| IOT184 |	So
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:45,439	| IOT184 |	I had a couple sitting around so I
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:48,767	| IOT184 |	Different ways to use them cuz what do most people use it for
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:50,559	| IOT184 |	Doors and windows
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,839	| IOT184 |	For security
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:57,215	| IOT184 |	Total sense but these things are pretty inexpensive the batteries last a long time and they
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:21:03,103	| IOT184 |	Just make for a great trigger event for so many different things you can automate in the home so this week I wrote a blogpost
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:04,895	| IOT184 |	Explaining for unique
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:06,175	| IOT184 |	Use cases that
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:12,575	| IOT184 |	I come up with and I'm sure other people have come up with more some helping people share their own I know you have a favorite you can chime in when I
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,343	| IOT184 |	Say your favorite
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:21,280	| IOT184 |	My kids just don't turn on the exhaust fan in the bathroom when you take a shower which is not good for the bathroom
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:24,352	| IOT184 |	Terrible actually thought about spending some
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:26,144	| IOT184 |	Serious money for a
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:31,008	| IOT184 |	Exhaust fan that had a humidity sensor but the easier thing to do is to just put
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:33,312	| IOT184 |	The fan on a Smart Switch
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:39,456	| IOT184 |	And then use a door window sensor on the actual shower door so when they're taking a shower it just goes on
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,992	| IOT184 |	That's it maybe it's not the most
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:47,136	| IOT184 |	Slightly thing to see about having that sensor on a shower door I feel shower curtain obviously this is not going to work but it works
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:50,720	| IOT184 |	Pretty well in certain cases
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:52,512	| IOT184 |	So that's one way
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:54,048	| IOT184 |	Humidity
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:55,840	| IOT184 |	You know I haven't seen any problems
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:59,424	| IOT184 |	I know you're not like IP rated that I know of but
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,704	| IOT184 |	To be honest
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:03,264	| IOT184 |	There should be less humidity when they're taking a shower then
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:04,288	| IOT184 |	Biggest fan
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,312	| IOT184 |	I don't know
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:08,640	| IOT184 |	They're cheap and outfits 20-25 bucks for sensor
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:10,432	| IOT184 |	Also
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:16,832	| IOT184 |	I tend to after dinner had to my little comfy chair which is a recliner and I thought about this NyQuil
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:17,600	| IOT184 |	Why do I every night
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,160	| IOT184 |	Turn on the light
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:21,440	| IOT184 |	To that chair and
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:23,488	| IOT184 |	Turn on a playlist on the Google home
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,512	| IOT184 |	I just put
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,560	| IOT184 |	A door window sensor
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,584	| IOT184 |	Into the chair
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:31,168	| IOT184 |	I need the chair smart and nobody knows cuz you can't see it
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:31,936	| IOT184 |	To do it either
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:38,336	| IOT184 |	Flip my recliner over and where the footrest resides when the chair is not in recline position that's where you put the lid
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,360	| IOT184 |	Magnetic contact
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:41,408	| IOT184 |	And then on the inside of the charity but the
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,176	| IOT184 |	Centered self
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:45,504	| IOT184 |	Now when you recline in the chair you got a trigger event
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:46,528	| IOT184 |	And now
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:50,368	| IOT184 |	I sit down my light goes on in my music starts playing really really cool
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,392	| IOT184 |	That was my favorite one
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:59,072	| IOT184 |	And it's not going to have to have a certain
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:06,240	| IOT184 |	Want to talk about before but I'll mention again cuz what time is hey why walk into a dark closet
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:12,640	| IOT184 |	Sure you have a light switch for a minute walk-in closet to put the light on but we're leaving the light on all the time we walk out of the closet
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:14,944	| IOT184 |	I have to switch summer wasting electricity
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:16,736	| IOT184 |	Just put a door sensor
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:19,552	| IOT184 |	On the backside of that closet door and put a smart bulb in the
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,320	| IOT184 |	Cause it rather
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,600	| IOT184 |	I just open the door
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,624	| IOT184 |	Life Goes On
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:24,672	| IOT184 |	Close the door
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:30,816	| IOT184 |	So you're not walking into a dark closet and it's hitting electricity if you are like us and forget to turn that switch off
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:32,096	| IOT184 |	I do that
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:37,216	| IOT184 |	I do that in a couple places I do that on my closet door but I do it with a motion sensor
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:39,520	| IOT184 |	And then I also do it in my laundry
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,056	| IOT184 |	Because
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:45,152	| IOT184 |	It is awesome
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,944	| IOT184 |	And then again I use a motion sensor there
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:52,064	| IOT184 |	The other place
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:55,648	| IOT184 |	Master bathroom
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:58,208	| IOT184 |	I have it set to go
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:59,232	| IOT184 |	At 8
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:02,560	| IOT184 |	Lighting thing so it's not like
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:08,960	| IOT184 |	Makes sense and we often have our hands full bring laundry into the closet so yeah makes little sense in closet
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:12,288	| IOT184 |	And for his other tips you're going to have

EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:09,888	| IOT184 |	I'm calling in regards
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:12,192	| IOT184 |	Question on a
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,472	| IOT184 |	Freezer that I
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,776	| IOT184 |	Modified to hold the
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:17,056	| IOT184 |	Keg of beer
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:18,848	| IOT184 |	I'm trying to monitor how freaky
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:19,616	| IOT184 |	Plant Cycles
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:22,688	| IOT184 |	Have a Z-Wave monitor but it
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:25,248	| IOT184 |	Currently only reports out about every 30 minutes
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:29,856	| IOT184 |	How are usages so I don't get a very good idea when it's actually running or not
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:32,160	| IOT184 |	Curious if you guys have any recommendation
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:33,184	| IOT184 |	End of a different product
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:35,488	| IOT184 |	Use that word
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,000	| IOT184 |	Allow me

EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:39,328	| IOT184 |	Frigerator
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:41,376	| IOT184 |	How long was that if you had a way to
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:44,192	| IOT184 |	Monitor the internal temperature
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:45,984	| IOT184 |	Of the refrigerator that would also be
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:47,008	| IOT184 |	Be helpful had trouble
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:47,776	| IOT184 |	Find nanny
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:48,544	| IOT184 |	But don't
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:49,824	| IOT184 |	Require mounting
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:51,616	| IOT184 |	The sensor in
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:53,408	| IOT184 |	Inside and it would have trouble getting out of this
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:54,944	| IOT184 |	Any help
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:55,456	| IOT184 |	Would be appreciate
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:58,016	| IOT184 |	Alright lyrics
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,552	| IOT184 |	This is a lovely
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:01,856	| IOT184 |	Question and an easy one
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:02,624	| IOT184 |	For the most part
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,392	| IOT184 |	So
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:09,024	| IOT184 |	My suggestion to you right away is using smart plug like the WeMo Insight or any smart plug
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:11,328	| IOT184 |	That has some sort of energy
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,096	| IOT184 |	Tracking on it
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:13,376	| IOT184 |	And
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:16,960	| IOT184 |	Put that in and you'll get a nice little graph of azure refrigerator cycle
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,264	| IOT184 |	So that's
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:23,104	| IOT184 |	That's one way to do it and ask for the temperature inside
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:24,896	| IOT184 |	We actually addressed that last week with
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:25,920	| IOT184 |	Variety
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:26,432	| IOT184 |	Temperature
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:27,968	| IOT184 |	Sensors
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:33,344	| IOT184 |	If you're worried about the wireless signal getting out of the refrigerator which is like a giant Faraday cage
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,880	| IOT184 |	You can put it on the temperature
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,672	| IOT184 |	Which is like
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:37,184	| IOT184 |	The probe
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:39,232	| IOT184 |	Connect to a device
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:41,024	| IOT184 |	An approach that is inside the freezer
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,560	| IOT184 |	Isis actually outside
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:46,400	| IOT184 |	The freezer so expensive
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:48,192	| IOT184 |	Or required
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:49,728	| IOT184 |	Required a hug
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:52,032	| IOT184 |	So you may not love it but
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:55,360	| IOT184 |	Someone else did suggest a cheaper alternatives you have
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:57,408	| IOT184 |	SmartThings and are feeling incredibly
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:57,920	| IOT184 |	Technically savvy
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,200	| IOT184 |	So
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:03,040	| IOT184 |	Listeners actually sent me an e-mail
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:04,832	| IOT184 |	If you guys have SmartThings
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:08,672	| IOT184 |	He's been using the xiaomi temperature sensors there on $9
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:09,184	| IOT184 |	2
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,976	| IOT184 |	Check his freezer
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:13,280	| IOT184 |	Temperature so that's an option
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:16,352	| IOT184 |	You do have to download a special device Handler
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,632	| IOT184 |	On GitHub
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:18,656	| IOT184 |	Orthocenter
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:20,192	| IOT184 |	And lieutenant
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,728	| IOT184 |	So this is not
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:25,568	| IOT184 |	I think I fully believe that everyone is capable of doing this but
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:26,592	| IOT184 |	Some people mean
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:29,408	| IOT184 |	But for 9 bucks
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:35,040	| IOT184 |	So it's actually pretty easy to install a SmartThings Handler
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:41,440	| IOT184 |	I had to do it for some fibaro devices for example and literally or just downloading a code from GitHub saving it as a text file
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:43,488	| IOT184 |	Remember that file format is for SmartThings
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,256	| IOT184 |	Images
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,536	| IOT184 |	Using your SmartThings app
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:51,936	| IOT184 |	How to install it once you do that then SmartThings Hub knows what to do with information from that sensor or device
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:52,960	| IOT184 |	It's not so bad
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:55,520	| IOT184 |	And you mentioned Stacy's a WeMo Insight switch
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:57,568	| IOT184 |	That was actually one of the first
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:28:00,896	| IOT184 |	Iot devices that I added to my house it's super useful
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:07,296	| IOT184 |	I wish we could do more than just look in the app and see a log or real-time energy use but and there may be ways
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:09,344	| IOT184 |	Listen to what I have not look at wemos apis
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,368	| IOT184 |	But there's no
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:13,696	| IOT184 |	Simple native way to like Mucinex trigger events to say hey
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:15,488	| IOT184 |	The refrigerator has been running
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:19,840	| IOT184 |	Too long or something maybe something's wrong as a result what's not running at all when it should be
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:25,728	| IOT184 |	Easy way to use that but still it is informative and I think get there on the right track
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:28,800	| IOT184 |	Yes it doesn't fibaro they also have
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:30,592	| IOT184 |	Energy tracking
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:33,152	| IOT184 |	It's ass eating
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:34,176	| IOT184 |	If you have a heart
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,992	| IOT184 |	Okay so Derek we hope that
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:38,528	| IOT184 |	Helps you and congratulations

EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:49,568	| IOT184 |	And make them available to anyone anyone who needs them
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:50,080	| IOT184 |	Art of that
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:53,664	| IOT184 |	Somebody has a lot of
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:54,944	| IOT184 |	When the internet first came out
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:56,480	| IOT184 |	It was a massive

EDL	00:33:58,528	00:33:59,552	| IOT184 |	As you have lines
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:02,112	| IOT184 |	Companies like Google and Facebook
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:03,392	| IOT184 |	Decentralized a lot of
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:05,952	| IOT184 |	I've come out of those come
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:09,024	| IOT184 |	Wondering
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:12,096	| IOT184 |	Play Rolling is
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:15,936	| IOT184 |	For their decentralized that and I think iot exactly one major ass

EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:20,032	| IOT184 |	I would probably agree with you
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:21,824	| IOT184 |	Before we get into like
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:24,896	| IOT184 |	Crazy nitty-gritty technical details cuz I think you guys are
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:27,456	| IOT184 |	Actually launching some products that make sense for the future
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:28,992	| IOT184 |	Internet
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:30,016	| IOT184 |	What is the internet of the
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:33,856	| IOT184 |	We talked about decentralisation Butler
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:35,648	| IOT184 |	How we think about designing this
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:36,672	| IOT184 |	How we think about the
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:37,184	| IOT184 |	Problem set
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:38,464	| IOT184 |	We start talking about
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:41,280	| IOT184 |	Challenges
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:42,304	| IOT184 |	What the
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:45,888	| IOT184 |	If you training at our how do you ensure that the best
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:46,656	| IOT184 |	Things about the internet
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:48,704	| IOT184 |	Virginia Beach Red Witch is that anyone
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:50,752	| IOT184 |	Anywhere an idea or

EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:07,136	| IOT184 |	An enormous amount of value and they have a huge amount of
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:07,648	| IOT184 |	Technology which
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:10,208	| IOT184 |	Information on their Network

EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:16,608	| IOT184 |	Enormous resources
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:18,400	| IOT184 |	So had I think about the internet
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:20,192	| IOT184 |	How do you
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:21,984	| IOT184 |	Take those advantages
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:23,520	| IOT184 |	Is that the internet Giants
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:25,056	| IOT184 |	And make them available everyone
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:27,104	| IOT184 |	How can you make sure that
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:29,152	| IOT184 |	Even if you don't have an enormous Center resources
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:32,992	| IOT184 |	It's all about
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:33,760	| IOT184 |	How do you make
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:34,528	| IOT184 |	Sure that
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:38,880	| IOT184 |	The four billion people on Earth that still don't have internet
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:40,672	| IOT184 |	How to get online
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:42,464	| IOT184 |	Field have a great
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:42,976	| IOT184 |	Experience
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:44,256	| IOT184 |	NBA Bulls
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:46,560	| IOT184 |	To do so in a way that they
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:52,960	| IOT184 |	So much of the internet is really centralized in North America and west
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:56,800	| IOT184 |	The bytes call-out traffic
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:35:57,568	| IOT184 |	And that
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:35:58,848	| IOT184 |	That as
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:01,664	| IOT184 |	We get away from this place has the internet somewhat
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:05,760	| IOT184 |	Becomes actually much more expensive for those people who actually
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:10,624	| IOT184 |	Pay more for it.
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:12,928	| IOT184 |	Everything about how do you make sure that you
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:15,488	| IOT184 |	Creation on one side
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:16,512	| IOT184 |	And then democratized
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:18,560	| IOT184 |	Wow
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:19,328	| IOT184 |	All right
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:20,864	| IOT184 |	That's a lot to think about
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:22,400	| IOT184 |	What about old ways of doing
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:22,912	| IOT184 |	So
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:24,448	| IOT184 |	We have had
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:25,984	| IOT184 |	And actually this is something I've seen
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:29,056	| IOT184 |	Anglesey access and the kind of internet archive
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:30,848	| IOT184 |	Which is
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:31,616	| IOT184 |	Peer-to-peer Network
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:34,688	| IOT184 |	So we've had in historically things like
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,456	| IOT184 |	Napster
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:36,736	| IOT184 |	Original Skype
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:39,040	| IOT184 |	But then there was also really interest
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:40,320	| IOT184 |	Things about Distributing
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:42,368	| IOT184 |	Haitian with networks likes
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:46,720	| IOT184 |	One person had phone connectivity other people had this program
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:49,024	| IOT184 |	Your phone could talk to each other and backhaul using
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:50,560	| IOT184 |	Original phone
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:52,352	| IOT184 |	So how should we think about
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:53,888	| IOT184 |	Bringing those types of
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,168	| IOT184 |	Technologies
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:56,448	| IOT184 |	Forward or should we
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:58,240	| IOT184 |	Skip all that
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,264	| IOT184 |	And there's a new way to do
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:01,312	| IOT184 |	Yeah you know I think that
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:03,104	| IOT184 |	You know the nature of
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:03,872	| IOT184 |	Ecology
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:05,152	| IOT184 |	He is that
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,432	| IOT184 |	It moved in service
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:07,200	| IOT184 |	Sine wave
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:09,504	| IOT184 |	Overtime where you have a map
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:10,528	| IOT184 |	Dispersion
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:11,808	| IOT184 |	Validation
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:14,368	| IOT184 |	Networks will definitely
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:15,904	| IOT184 |	That went forward your network
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:17,952	| IOT184 |	Even when Micah
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:21,280	| IOT184 |	The way that's gay
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:23,072	| IOT184 |	It doesn't mean that
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:27,680	| IOT184 |	Life is always right
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:31,008	| IOT184 |	In those two things and constantly be fine
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:33,056	| IOT184 |	Disrupt whatever the reality was
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:35,872	| IOT184 |	Foreign and hopefully striving towards
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:38,176	| IOT184 |	More distributed more efficient
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:39,712	| IOT184 |	Secure future
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:40,480	| IOT184 |	The internet

EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:43,552	| IOT184 |	Inside about
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:44,576	| IOT184 |	Is a protocol

EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:49,952	| IOT184 |	Is actually backed Limited
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:52,512	| IOT184 |	It means it was designed around the idea of
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:53,536	| IOT184 |	If you actually have
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:54,304	| IOT184 |	The internet.

EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:57,120	| IOT184 |	The globular
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:58,144	| IOT184 |	But you actually had to happen
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:01,216	| IOT184 |	Planetary
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:02,496	| IOT184 |	That stops working
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:04,288	| IOT184 |	When you have to rely on be light because
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:06,336	| IOT184 |	Particle of light going from
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:08,128	| IOT184 |	Mars's
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:11,200	| IOT184 |	And so you can't rely on

EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:16,832	| IOT184 |	It's a trap
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:17,856	| IOT184 |	On an address
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:19,648	| IOT184 |	What ipff

EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:29,632	| IOT184 |	And then you can distribute

EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:33,984	| IOT184 |	Some of the things that we were working on it with
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:35,008	| IOT184 |	Peer-to-peer Network
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:36,800	| IOT184 |	I didn't get a p switch
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:39,104	| IOT184 |	Not really interesting is when we
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:40,128	| IOT184 |	Two blocks
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:42,688	| IOT184 |	Chain and other cryptocurrencies
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:44,736	| IOT184 |	Could create some sort of incentive
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,064	| IOT184 |	I got a little bit of that
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:48,832	| IOT184 |	Striped bass
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:50,880	| IOT184 |	My server
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:53,184	| IOT184 |	Band with tears away that I can
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:54,464	| IOT184 |	Actually get compensated
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:57,536	| IOT184 |	There's been a lot of hype
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:38:59,328	| IOT184 |	Some of the cryptocurrencies and blockchain
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:03,168	| IOT184 |	That if you combine ability
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:03,936	| IOT184 |	To address
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:04,960	| IOT184 |	Contact
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:05,728	| IOT184 |	Actually content
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:10,080	| IOT184 |	With that it has
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:11,360	| IOT184 |	The current
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:12,640	| IOT184 |	The or other

EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:15,456	| IOT184 |	That might
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:16,736	| IOT184 |	Be away again

EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:22,368	| IOT184 |	Doing it
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:25,440	| IOT184 |	Really interesting I think you know that your body is around
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:27,488	| IOT184 |	And so
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:29,792	| IOT184 |	It's a
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:30,304	| IOT184 |	How can we
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:31,840	| IOT184 |	Together
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:33,888	| IOT184 |	I have the traditional internet
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:34,656	| IOT184 |	With now this
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:38,496	| IOT184 |	Weeks ago
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:39,520	| IOT184 |	Support.

EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:42,336	| IOT184 |	So that you could

EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:46,688	| IOT184 |	That's the interplanetary file
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:50,016	| IOT184 |	And I guess I don't know that we know exactly what
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:52,320	| IOT184 |	That's going to go but if we can be a gateway
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:56,160	| IOT184 |	To make it so that more people can access these new technologies
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:56,672	| IOT184 |	Cheap things to make
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:05,888	| IOT184 |	Okay so we talked about distributed we talked about making things cheaper talked a little bit about some of the things
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:07,168	| IOT184 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:08,192	| IOT184 |	Your birthday weekend
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:09,472	| IOT184 |	So
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:11,264	| IOT184 |	The last couple weeks you guys have
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:14,336	| IOT184 |	Pinterest drop Inus left and right
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:15,360	| IOT184 |	It's been kind of fun some of it
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:17,152	| IOT184 |	I don't care very much about like
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:20,992	| IOT184 |	For y'all but there are lots of things I do care about
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:24,832	| IOT184 |	About was actually the bandwidth Alliance
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:28,416	| IOT184 |	So talk to me just a little bit about what your goal is there
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:31,232	| IOT184 |	Yeah so what the bandwidth alliances
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:32,000	| IOT184 |	Citic group
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:33,536	| IOT184 |	A provider
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:35,072	| IOT184 |	Come together
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:35,840	| IOT184 |	To say
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:36,608	| IOT184 |	That
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:37,888	| IOT184 |	We should reduce
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:39,680	| IOT184 |	Cost of moving data
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:45,312	| IOT184 |	Between different providers so typically if you're using a cloud provider
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:46,848	| IOT184 |	Google Cloud
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:48,128	| IOT184 |	Microsoft and IBM
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:50,688	| IOT184 |	When you put it into them
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:52,736	| IOT184 |	Do you want to take data back out
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:54,784	| IOT184 |	Talk to you a lot
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:00,160	| IOT184 |	You're a fat provider
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:01,696	| IOT184 |	Alldatapro
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:03,744	| IOT184 |	Ashburn Virginia where you got
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:05,536	| IOT184 |	Your data center back the time user
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:07,840	| IOT184 |	Cruise in Sydney Australia
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:09,376	| IOT184 |	You got to pay for that
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:11,680	| IOT184 |	With a number of dividers
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:15,520	| IOT184 |	Is the markup on bandwidth
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:16,800	| IOT184 |	Are extremely high but
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:19,616	| IOT184 |	Barbie threesome
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:22,176	| IOT184 |	The cloud provider
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:22,944	| IOT184 |	They will
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:24,992	| IOT184 |	My hand that data directly off

EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:32,479	| IOT184 |	Is the one major old out
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:38,623	| IOT184 |	Good thing to do
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:41,695	| IOT184 |	Okay and let's talk about another one of your
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:46,047	| IOT184 |	It is tied to something that you guys.
EDL	00:43:46,047	00:43:46,815	| IOT184 |	Spring
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:48,607	| IOT184 |	Beyonce program called workers
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:50,655	| IOT184 |	Really
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:52,447	| IOT184 |	Interesting
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:55,519	| IOT184 |	Been out for a while so I'd love to get an update on how people are using
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:57,311	| IOT184 |	And then you guys also a noun
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:58,847	| IOT184 |	Key Value Store
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:43:59,359	| IOT184 |	For workers
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:00,639	| IOT184 |	Which
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:02,943	| IOT184 |	I was really exciting like data could be
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:05,503	| IOT184 |	All over the place and accounted for but tell me about that
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:07,039	| IOT184 |	Yes boo
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:10,111	| IOT184 |	Today

EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:24,703	| IOT184 |	And that if you needed a new
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:27,263	| IOT184 |	The new application you bought a new server
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:28,543	| IOT184 |	Cancel the deployment
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:30,847	| IOT184 |	Time for that was measured in months

EDL	00:51:01,247	00:51:01,759	| IOT184 |	And that is
EDL	00:51:07,135	00:51:07,903	| IOT184 |	Quit
EDL	00:51:07,903	00:51:10,463	| IOT184 |	Is design around at Uni

EDL	00:51:13,279	00:51:16,095	| IOT184 |	Be able to fix any problem
EDL	00:51:16,095	00:51:17,375	| IOT184 |	Come across the line
EDL	00:51:17,375	00:51:18,911	| IOT184 |	And if there's any noise or anything
EDL	00:51:18,911	00:51:19,679	| IOT184 |	That might
EDL	00:51:19,679	00:51:22,495	| IOT184 |	Interfered with any of the communication
EDL	00:51:22,495	00:51:24,287	| IOT184 |	Where this really matter
EDL	00:51:27,871	00:51:28,639	| IOT184 |	Devices that are
EDL	00:51:28,639	00:51:29,919	| IOT184 |	Connected to a wire
EDL	00:51:29,919	00:51:31,711	| IOT184 |	And don't move around alot
EDL	00:51:31,711	00:51:33,759	| IOT184 |	More and more
EDL	00:51:33,759	00:51:36,575	| IOT184 |	Internet on wireless
EDL	00:51:38,623	00:51:40,671	| IOT184 |	Gcp is that
EDL	00:51:40,671	00:51:42,719	| IOT184 |	In those conditions where you see a y
EDL	00:51:43,231	00:51:45,279	| IOT184 |	TTP is actually incredibly low on
EDL	00:51:47,839	00:51:49,119	| IOT184 |	First of all it built
EDL	00:51:49,119	00:51:50,399	| IOT184 |	Security and by default
EDL	00:51:51,423	00:51:53,727	| IOT184 |	Wait really designed around
EDL	00:51:53,727	00:51:55,519	| IOT184 |	Mobile
EDL	00:51:55,519	00:51:58,335	| IOT184 |	Experience where we know that there's going to be lost.
EDL	00:52:00,383	00:52:02,175	| IOT184 |	Is overwhelmed
EDL	00:52:02,175	00:52:03,711	| IOT184 |	That could mean because somebody
EDL	00:52:03,711	00:52:05,503	| IOT184 |	Turn on the microwave or
EDL	00:52:06,783	00:52:07,551	| IOT184 |	Google

EDL	00:52:13,183	00:52:13,951	| IOT184 |	A used car
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:15,999	| IOT184 |	Stancil Mount of their own property
EDL	00:52:16,511	00:52:19,583	| IOT184 |	Back protocol has been adopted by
EDL	00:52:20,607	00:52:23,167	| IOT184 |	Bmchs
EDL	00:52:24,703	00:52:27,007	| IOT184 |	Finally got ratified by the idea
EDL	00:52:29,055	00:52:31,359	| IOT184 |	That will again be that Gateway
EDL	00:52:31,359	00:52:33,151	| IOT184 |	Where is a mobile device
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:34,175	| IOT184 |	Will be able to talk
EDL	00:52:34,175	00:52:34,943	| IOT184 |	Duet
EDL	00:52:34,943	00:52:35,711	| IOT184 |	Quick
EDL	00:52:35,711	00:52:36,991	| IOT184 |	And then behind
EDL	00:52:36,991	00:52:37,503	| IOT184 |	Will still
EDL	00:52:38,271	00:52:43,391	| IOT184 |	PCT in HDPE and all the things that standard web server
EDL	00:52:43,391	00:52:44,415	| IOT184 |	The Wire
EDL	00:52:46,207	00:52:47,743	| IOT184 |	We hope to bring the back
EDL	00:52:47,743	00:52:48,255	| IOT184 |	World
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:50,303	| IOT184 |	Connection
EDL	00:52:50,303	00:52:51,839	| IOT184 |	From the device
EDL	00:52:51,839	00:52:52,863	| IOT184 |	Wandering around

EDL	00:52:53,887	00:52:54,399	| IOT184 |	Dude the Clown
EDL	00:52:55,423	00:52:56,191	| IOT184 |	Out running
EDL	00:52:56,191	00:52:57,215	| IOT184 |	The address of the internet
EDL	00:52:57,727	00:52:58,495	| IOT184 |	And then
EDL	00:52:58,495	00:52:59,263	| IOT184 |	Eubank
EDL	00:52:59,263	00:53:00,799	| IOT184 |	Traditional protocol
EDL	00:53:05,151	00:53:09,759	| IOT184 |	Do you think of this is again something that help make the internet
EDL	00:53:09,759	00:53:11,807	| IOT184 |	Make it more on again tomorrow
EDL	00:53:11,807	00:53:15,135	| IOT184 |	Is it something that previously
EDL	00:53:15,903	00:53:19,231	| IOT184 |	Okay
EDL	00:53:19,999	00:53:21,535	| IOT184 |	Think of your network
EDL	00:53:21,535	00:53:22,815	| IOT184 |	Where can you register your network
EDL	00:53:22,815	00:53:23,583	| IOT184 |	Is
EDL	00:53:23,583	00:53:25,887	| IOT184 |	And I believe you said 154 City
EDL	00:53:25,887	00:53:28,447	| IOT184 |	So because this is all tied back
EDL	00:53:28,447	00:53:29,215	| IOT184 |	To you guys
EDL	00:53:29,727	00:53:34,335	| IOT184 |	How do you answer the charge that idea that well are we just centralizing around
EDL	00:53:35,359	00:53:36,127	| IOT184 |	Innovative
EDL	00:53:36,127	00:53:36,639	| IOT184 |	Places
EDL	00:53:37,663	00:53:39,199	| IOT184 |	Really
EDL	00:53:43,807	00:53:46,111	| IOT184 |	Bride-to-be
EDL	00:53:46,111	00:53:47,135	| IOT184 |	In terms of
EDL	00:53:47,135	00:53:50,719	| IOT184 |	Pushing the internet over but doesn't require
EDL	00:53:50,719	00:53:52,767	| IOT184 |	Beat the only provider
EDL	00:53:52,767	00:53:54,559	| IOT184 |	Ipff

EDL	00:53:56,607	00:53:57,631	| IOT184 |	Browsers that don't
EDL	00:53:57,631	00:53:58,399	| IOT184 |	What IP path
EDL	00:53:59,423	00:54:00,447	| IOT184 |	Write the world
EDL	00:54:00,447	00:54:02,239	| IOT184 |	But if you have a father
EDL	00:54:07,615	00:54:08,895	| IOT184 |	Down

EDL	00:54:39,615	00:54:40,895	| IOT184 |	It's on
EDL	00:54:41,919	00:54:45,247	| IOT184 |	Call what is a chicken-and-egg problem on the internet
EDL	00:54:45,247	00:54:46,527	| IOT184 |	The browser guys don't want to
EDL	00:54:51,391	00:54:53,439	| IOT184 |	And what we found it
EDL	00:54:55,743	00:54:59,327	| IOT184 |	If we can be kind of the first mover and solving the problem
EDL	00:55:02,911	00:55:03,679	| IOT184 |	Standard
