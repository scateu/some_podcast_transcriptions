EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:25,664	| IOT213 |	Let's kick this party off with
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,688	| IOT213 |	Venture
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:31,808	| IOT213 |	Do a lot of this on the show because most Venture capitalists fund iot stuff just is
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,344	| IOT213 |	You're part of their regular
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:35,648	| IOT213 |	Regular ginormous funds
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,928	| IOT213 |	But clear Ventures
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:38,720	| IOT213 |	Just announced
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,000	| IOT213 |	On Wednesday
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:43,072	| IOT213 |	A 180 million dollar second fund
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,096	| IOT213 |	It is dedicated
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:46,144	| IOT213 |	Specifically to
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:46,656	| IOT213 |	Iot
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,936	| IOT213 |	It's
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,472	| IOT213 |	Industry 4.0
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,008	| IOT213 |	Architectures that
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:52,288	| IOT213 |	Will help
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,056	| IOT213 |	Make this possible
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:55,360	| IOT213 |	So I talked to one of the co-founders
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:58,688	| IOT213 |	At Clear Ventures it is Chris rust
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:01,504	| IOT213 |	And he actually was the second employee Roadrunner
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:04,320	| IOT213 |	All of you guys were
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:07,904	| IOT213 |	So here I had a great conversation about
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,952	| IOT213 |	What happens when we connect
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,488	| IOT213 |	Bunch of machines
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:12,768	| IOT213 |	To each other
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:15,328	| IOT213 |	One of my favorite insides that he had
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,096	| IOT213 |	Was
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,376	| IOT213 |	When we combine
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:19,424	| IOT213 |	Sensors and sensor data
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:23,776	| IOT213 |	With machine learning we're basically going to start having machines that
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:24,800	| IOT213 |	I can learn from each other
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,848	| IOT213 |	Way faster
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:29,664	| IOT213 |	Then they can learn from us as people
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:31,968	| IOT213 |	Which means we're going to have to think about
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,736	| IOT213 |	How to build
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:36,576	| IOT213 |	Machines that can talk to each other learn from each other trust each other
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:39,904	| IOT213 |	And do all of this in a way that doesn't involve
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:40,416	| IOT213 |	People getting in the
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:42,720	| IOT213 |	This is a big
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:44,000	| IOT213 |	Crazy idea
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:46,048	| IOT213 |	And I'm very excited to see
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,840	| IOT213 |	What they do with it
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:50,144	| IOT213 |	In terms of the types of Investments they make
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:55,776	| IOT213 |	Clear Ventures is a venture fund that is very technically driven this founder in the other
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:56,544	| IOT213 |	The co-founder
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:00,896	| IOT213 |	Really go deep on architecture their last bundle mosto
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:02,432	| IOT213 |	Cloud-based architectures
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:03,712	| IOT213 |	But
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:04,992	| IOT213 |	This time they're going to go
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,016	| IOT213 |	Deeper into
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:06,784	| IOT213 |	Umai
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,064	| IOT213 |	Probably going to see some
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:11,648	| IOT213 |	Cool container orchestration news I know you guys are like
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:12,416	| IOT213 |	Like a block
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:13,952	| IOT213 |	But it is actually
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:15,488	| IOT213 |	For eyes
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:22,911	| IOT213 |	It is enough for the entrepreneurs out there who are in these fields you mentioned a eye but there's a
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:23,679	| IOT213 |	Also
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:27,775	| IOT213 |	IRT in general Big Data V Garver robotics
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,055	| IOT213 |	Self-driving vehicles
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:30,591	| IOT213 |	It was of the kinds of
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:31,615	| IOT213 |	Disruptive
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:33,919	| IOT213 |	Startups that the clear fund is looking at
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:35,711	| IOT213 |	So
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,991	| IOT213 |	Stay tuned for that
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:37,759	| IOT213 |	Or
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,527	| IOT213 |	Reach out to them if
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,039	| IOT213 |	Do you have a brother
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:41,599	| IOT213 |	Okay
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:42,879	| IOT213 |	Next Step
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:43,391	| IOT213 |	We've got
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,439	| IOT213 |	Another fundraising
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,975	| IOT213 |	This is
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:50,559	| IOT213 |	Yeah we don't know if it's his Voodoo or V2 I'm going with voodoo
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:54,143	| IOT213 |	X video oh so I'm going with V2
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,423	| IOT213 |	So
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,703	| IOT213 |	Voodoo or video
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,263	| IOT213 |	Raised 32 million in
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:05,407	| IOT213 |	Second-round financing and this is a company that does iot device security at the embedded
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,455	| IOT213 |	And I actually wrote about them
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,735	| IOT213 |	Probably a year ago
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,527	| IOT213 |	They want to do two things
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:12,831	| IOT213 |	I want to make it really easy for every device
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,599	| IOT213 |	Sneaker
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:15,903	| IOT213 |	To get security on their devices
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:17,695	| IOT213 |	And they want to make it really easy to
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:22,303	| IOT213 |	The way they do this is they're trying to create this database of device types
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:25,887	| IOT213 |	Vulnerabilities and best practices associated with each device
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:29,215	| IOT213 |	It's doing this on its own without
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:31,263	| IOT213 |	Work from the companies for building devices
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:35,359	| IOT213 |	So it's trying to extract this information from websites from
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,639	| IOT213 |	Various
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:37,663	| IOT213 |	LPS
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:41,247	| IOT213 |	And then it's trying to use AI to assign rules to
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:42,783	| IOT213 |	Taxo
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:49,183	| IOT213 |	If it's an HVAC controller for example it's going to say hey in HVAC controller should never talk to any website
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,207	| IOT213 |	Except for the manufacture
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:54,559	| IOT213 |	So if it sees anything outside of those rules your behavior outside of those
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:55,839	| IOT213 |	It won't let it
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:56,351	| IOT213 |	Happen
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:57,631	| IOT213 |	What's
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:02,239	| IOT213 |	Exciting here is it doing that automatically Sono it person has to sit down
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:04,031	| IOT213 |	Figure out every device on the network
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:05,055	| IOT213 |	And figure out rules for the
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:10,687	| IOT213 |	This is like an AI kind of play almost ASU said like identify the
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:13,247	| IOT213 |	Potential threats of a device-level
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:16,831	| IOT213 |	And also some big data analysis from what I gather because
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:20,415	| IOT213 |	What they've done is they've a dataset of 70 million
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,951	| IOT213 |	Embedded system binaries
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:25,791	| IOT213 |	So walked between the firmware and the software that run on devices
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,071	| IOT213 |	And
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:28,351	| IOT213 |	According to them
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:30,911	| IOT213 |	This is true or not but doing less
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,447	| IOT213 |	18 months they say
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,727	| IOT213 |	That they've helped mitigate
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:37,055	| IOT213 |	Total of 150 zero-day vulnerabilities
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:40,383	| IOT213 |	And more than 100000 security issues on
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,687	| IOT213 |	A large number of devices so
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:46,783	| IOT213 |	Yeah if you had to do this company by company or device by device on your own
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,831	| IOT213 |	It would probably take forever they're just
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:51,903	| IOT213 |	Looking at the whole market and try to figure out where they can
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:53,951	| IOT213 |	Add value by scanning these things in advance
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:57,023	| IOT213 |	It's a pretty cool
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:07:02,143	| IOT213 |	System they also have a test lab so when they see devices they run them in their test lab and they actually
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:07,775	| IOT213 |	Run them on what is essentially open networks and they see what kind of vulnerabilities and attacks
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:09,055	| IOT213 |	Hit these devices
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,591	| IOT213 |	And then they let the manufacturer
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:11,615	| IOT213 |	No
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:12,895	| IOT213 |	So is it
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:15,967	| IOT213 |	How to fold Microsoft actually has one of these they have a
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:19,807	| IOT213 |	I think it is a Honeypot lab but they have a formal night
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:25,439	| IOT213 |	Yeah I don't know the name of that interesting I just realized these folks are based in Tel Aviv
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:26,975	| IOT213 |	They are
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:29,535	| IOT213 |	Call the good iot security firms for piston
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:32,351	| IOT213 |	Did somewhere in Israel and they all have peoples in the IDF
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,119	| IOT213 |	Because
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,911	| IOT213 |	Man your IDF training
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:35,679	| IOT213 |	Apparently
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,191	| IOT213 |	Good stuff right
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:41,567	| IOT213 |	Okay and one more industrial Enterprise E I O T story of VMware
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:45,919	| IOT213 |	They have released their second version of their pulse iot Platte
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:48,991	| IOT213 |	This is a platform that does a lot of stuff
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,783	| IOT213 |	This is for companies who want
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,063	| IOT213 |	Device management
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:55,647	| IOT213 |	They want to integrate their devices and applications for the
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,927	| IOT213 |	The edge
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,695	| IOT213 |	To the cloud
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:00,255	| IOT213 |	Feels like I'm saying a lot of jargon here but these are
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,023	| IOT213 |	Kind of crucial things that
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,047	| IOT213 |	Have
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:06,399	| IOT213 |	They also do Edge device lifecycle management
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,423	| IOT213 |	Which means like
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,447	| IOT213 |	All these things at the edge
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:12,031	| IOT213 |	I need to know what they are you need to be able to say
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:15,615	| IOT213 |	Hey this is the software version running on them roll that back
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,383	| IOT213 |	If you have an update
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:17,407	| IOT213 |	All of that
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,431	| IOT213 |	Is what this song
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:20,735	| IOT213 |	Scary
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:27,135	| IOT213 |	Yeah device management platform I mean that over the air updates support container management there's that word again
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:27,903	| IOT213 |	Containers
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:30,207	| IOT213 |	Alerts and notifications so
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:31,487	| IOT213 |	This is kind of your
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:34,815	| IOT213 |	Platform management system for iot devices
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,351	| IOT213 |	Moe's at the edge I presume
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:41,471	| IOT213 |	It's both of the edge and in the cloud is basically what you're going to do is if you have
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:47,871	| IOT213 |	Iot devices and an application that's pulling for these devices it lets you see
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:50,943	| IOT213 |	The infrastructure associated with that apple
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,455	| IOT213 |	Application in
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,039	| IOT213 |	Absolutely make sense
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:57,599	| IOT213 |	I know they're competing platforms that do similar things
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:09:00,159	| IOT213 |	Microsoft Google and Amazon so
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,463	| IOT213 |	Throw your hat in the ring VMware I love it
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,535	| IOT213 |	This is for people who are doing things on premise
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:11,935	| IOT213 |	You probably can do this I know that VMware has deals with AWS and I believe with Microsoft
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:13,471	| IOT213 |	What's I'm unclear as to how
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,007	| IOT213 |	Deeply you could
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:17,823	| IOT213 |	Integrate with their systems are on their clouds
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,847	| IOT213 |	With us but
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:21,407	| IOT213 |	Just more tools out there for the
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,943	| IOT213 |	Shirley Caesar and
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:27,551	| IOT213 |	Let's talk about the smart home for a little bit we've got Amazon
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,063	| IOT213 |	He
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:31,391	| IOT213 |	You guys are probably familiar with this program
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,695	| IOT213 |	Don't need a lot of people who have it implemented
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,743	| IOT213 |	But what it does is the Amazon Key Program
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,023	| IOT213 |	Let's
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,535	| IOT213 |	Amazon
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:42,143	| IOT213 |	Packages be delivered inside your house if you have certain door locks
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,959	| IOT213 |	Camera for your car
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,799	| IOT213 |	Now it's expanding to
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:51,871	| IOT213 |	Your car rise thanks to a deal that we talked about
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:54,431	| IOT213 |	Before with Chamberlain and it's my cue
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,199	| IOT213 |	Platform
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:59,295	| IOT213 |	I wonder how many people's garages are clean enough to leave up
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:03,647	| IOT213 |	I'm so upset you guys cuz I pooped out
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,159	| IOT213 |	Literally
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:05,951	| IOT213 |	Literally on Monday
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:08,767	| IOT213 |	And this news came out on Tuesday
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,303	| IOT213 |	And the ability to test it out
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,071	| IOT213 |	Came out then two
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:17,727	| IOT213 |	So I couldn't test out this functionality but I think it's probably going to be super appealing to a lot of people
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:21,055	| IOT213 |	Who didn't want to let an Amazon delivery person inside their house
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,103	| IOT213 |	But letting someone inside
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:25,151	| IOT213 |	Garages usually lower
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:31,295	| IOT213 |	Right right because typically you'll have an interior door to your garage from your home and most people I think we keep that locked
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,855	| IOT213 |	A lot of people don't actually lock it
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:36,159	| IOT213 |	I just called into slippers Amazon
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:37,439	| IOT213 |	Let those Amazon people in the house
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,999	| IOT213 |	You could start locking
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,023	| IOT213 |	Or you could have her
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:45,119	| IOT213 |	An automatic lock that you can remotely lock When You're Expecting Amazon
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:47,679	| IOT213 |	But
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:51,263	| IOT213 |	I like this idea I like the idea of letting someone
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:53,311	| IOT213 |	My garage the nice thing about the Chamberlain is it
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:56,895	| IOT213 |	Amazon person forgets to close the garage which they shouldn't be
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,663	| IOT213 |	Because there's going to be
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,199	| IOT213 |	Integration
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,735	| IOT213 |	Their stuff that says they closed it
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:04,063	| IOT213 |	But if they haven't the Chamberlain thing will actually let you
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:06,623	| IOT213 |	Angie.
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,159	| IOT213 |	Amazon
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:11,743	| IOT213 |	Should add as a service for this the ability to say
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,791	| IOT213 |	When the package is
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:16,863	| IOT213 |	Asteria meaning it's about to be delivered to my house
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:19,167	| IOT213 |	Make sure that my garage door
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:21,471	| IOT213 |	The interior door is locked if it's not lock it
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:22,751	| IOT213 |	I like it
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:26,335	| IOT213 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,383	| IOT213 |	And speaking of doors
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,151	| IOT213 |	Arlo
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:31,967	| IOT213 |	Is going to the front door
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:38,879	| IOT213 |	They're going to release a video doorbell according to Dave Zach's from
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,415	| IOT213 |	Zatznotfunny
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:42,975	| IOT213 |	Tom harbin
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:44,511	| IOT213 |	Are you excited about an hour
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:47,583	| IOT213 |	Well I don't really use
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:51,935	| IOT213 |	Any Arlo products and as I look at this it kind of looks like the nest
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,983	| IOT213 |	To me which is what I do use
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,263	| IOT213 |	So
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:58,847	| IOT213 |	I'm not in the market for one but if I was I would be interested in this yes
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,639	| IOT213 |	I'm kind of like
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,175	| IOT213 |	Why does everyone need a video doorbell
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:05,503	| IOT213 |	The market is totally saturated like how many options
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:10,879	| IOT213 |	Well you could say the same about webcams you can say the same night
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:14,719	| IOT213 |	Oh I will
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,767	| IOT213 |	It's not out yet
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:18,047	| IOT213 |	This is still theoretical
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:21,887	| IOT213 |	We should talk about our Lotus briefly because it is now
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:25,215	| IOT213 |	Publicly traded companies so it makes sense that they have to
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:27,263	| IOT213 |	Expand their product line Beyond cameras
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:31,359	| IOT213 |	And that's why it exists quite frankly it doesn't do anything differently it's
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:34,431	| IOT213 |	Snow 2 megapixel camera full HD video quality
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:40,575	| IOT213 |	I watch you love you two way audio etcetera so it's no different than anything else on the market but
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:42,111	| IOT213 |	You're right they have to expand the product line
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:43,903	| IOT213 |	And we have pricing on this
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:48,255	| IOT213 |	We do not we have basically a photo screenshot of the doorbell
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,279	| IOT213 |	As well as a
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:53,375	| IOT213 |	Marketing piece that shows the suite of products including the doorbell
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:57,727	| IOT213 |	Price might be the differentiator although it's not in the Arlo cameras which are high quality
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,287	| IOT213 |	Price commensurate with
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:00,799	| IOT213 |	Quality
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,335	| IOT213 |	We'll just see
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,919	| IOT213 |	If you're in the market for a video doorbell and you've already got Arlo gear
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,967	| IOT213 |	This probably would make a lot of sense to buy
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:13,855	| IOT213 |	Although if you're in the market for a video doorbell and you have a Google Assistant I would steer you to the nest
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:15,391	| IOT213 |	And if you had Amazon
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:17,439	| IOT213 |	Deeply embedded in your life I would still YouTube
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,231	| IOT213 |	So I'm kind of like
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:20,511	| IOT213 |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:21,279	| IOT213 |	Pick your platform
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:24,863	| IOT213 |	Pick your platform and will Arlo make it as a platform
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,143	| IOT213 |	Big shrug
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:27,679	| IOT213 |	Alright let's have a drone delivery
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:30,239	| IOT213 |	Garage delivery
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,519	| IOT213 |	Drone delivery
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:34,079	| IOT213 |	This package will come down your chimney
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:40,223	| IOT213 |	Now I really want probably could manage that but I don't think you want that
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:42,783	| IOT213 |	What's interesting about this and we're talking about
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:45,855	| IOT213 |	The FAA has now allowed work given
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:46,879	| IOT213 |	Certification
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,927	| IOT213 |	US air carrier certification
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:51,743	| IOT213 |	Two alphabets Wing Aviation unit
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,791	| IOT213 |	Which is the part that does the drones
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:56,607	| IOT213 |	I did not realize that they would need
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:14:00,447	| IOT213 |	Air carrier certification for this it's rather interesting that they did
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,495	| IOT213 |	And now they have it
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:04,031	| IOT213 |	When can I start
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:04,543	| IOT213 |	Delivering
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:06,335	| IOT213 |	2 homes
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,871	| IOT213 |	Whatever price you were there supporting
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:10,175	| IOT213 |	So what is air carrier
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:10,943	| IOT213 |	Ignition status
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:18,111	| IOT213 |	That's the interesting thing to me it kind of means they have to follow the same rules and regulations as traditional aircraft
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:23,999	| IOT213 |	A drone is not a planet does not passengers and so on so I'm not
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:27,071	| IOT213 |	Quite sure that's why I was surprised he needed the air
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,351	| IOT213 |	Carrier designation here
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:31,167	| IOT213 |	Well I mean planes carry cargo
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:32,703	| IOT213 |	Sometimes I mean like FedEx in
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:34,239	| IOT213 |	UPS hub
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,263	| IOT213 |	Athleta cargo plane
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:40,895	| IOT213 |	I assume I I just look like one of the rules associated
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:42,175	| IOT213 |	I don't know
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:44,479	| IOT213 |	Yeah that I do not know I mean
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,271	| IOT213 |	The question
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:48,831	| IOT213 |	The certifications good for two years I know that much
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:50,111	| IOT213 |	And this was interesting as well
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:54,719	| IOT213 |	One Pilot obviously not a pilot inside the Drone was there really small
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:57,279	| IOT213 |	Can operate up to 5 phones at once
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:59,839	| IOT213 |	And only during the day as a result of the certification
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:05,983	| IOT213 |	That makes sense so I've been talking to people quite a bit about my driverless cars and tell operation
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:10,335	| IOT213 |	And idea that you'll have one person responsible for
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,615	| IOT213 |	And the people I've talked
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,151	| IOT213 |	They're doing
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:13,919	| IOT213 |	Commercial vehicle
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:15,199	| IOT213 |	Commercial truck
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,479	| IOT213 |	Transport
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:18,015	| IOT213 |	They have
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,551	| IOT213 |	One person operating
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,319	| IOT213 |	10
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,343	| IOT213 |	Autonomous vehicles
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,647	| IOT213 |	And so
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,927	| IOT213 |	It's kind of an interesting
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,719	| IOT213 |	This idea of like
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,487	| IOT213 |	How are we
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:30,303	| IOT213 |	Going to have these autonomous futures
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:33,631	| IOT213 |	And by how much can you reduce the human
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,143	| IOT213 |	Presents
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:40,543	| IOT213 |	Because basically we think of this is like the robots are taking over but what's really happening is the robot for help
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,055	| IOT213 |	Happiness scale
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:43,871	| IOT213 |	And you saw this back in the day when we had
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,687	| IOT213 |	Servers Avenue used to be like
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,455	| IOT213 |	Way Back Inn
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:51,551	| IOT213 |	Backwood everyone had a server Closet in their office
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:55,391	| IOT213 |	Late 90s early aughts you had like one person can manage 5 to 10
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,671	| IOT213 |	Cerberus basically
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:16:01,023	| IOT213 |	And then what has happened is now where to point where it
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:03,071	| IOT213 |	Google Amazon one person can manage
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,375	| IOT213 |	And
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:11,519	| IOT213 |	We're probably going to see something similar as our Automation and management gets better for
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:13,567	| IOT213 |	Autonomous vehicles
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,359	| IOT213 |	I would even say things like
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:17,663	| IOT213 |	Connected devices like right now in a
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:19,967	| IOT213 |	Building when you have a building management system
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:23,295	| IOT213 |	You might have one facilities person who manages
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,319	| IOT213 |	A floor
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:27,647	| IOT213 |	Connected devices usually it's broken down by the
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,415	| IOT213 |	Types of pie
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:30,463	| IOT213 |	Alexa one person for the lighting platform on
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:32,767	| IOT213 |	Window platform
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:34,559	| IOT213 |	But
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:38,399	| IOT213 |	We often forget that there's this huge intermediate step in
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,447	| IOT213 |	Little intermittent
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:43,519	| IOT213 |	Leaps of progress we're basically just
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:45,055	| IOT213 |	Allowing one person to manage
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,871	| IOT213 |	And letting software
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,383	| IOT213 |	Take over the rest
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:51,711	| IOT213 |	How many times we have that for the smart home because
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:56,063	| IOT213 |	You and I are probably the point people in our homes for the many dozens of devices that we have
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,599	| IOT213 |	But yeah
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:58,879	| IOT213 |	It's all about scalability
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:16:59,903	| IOT213 |	I totally agree with that
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,951	| IOT213 |	Yes we are evaluating
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,231	| IOT213 |	Things this is how I mean
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:05,023	| IOT213 |	Personally this is one of the ways I have value
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,303	| IOT213 |	News
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:08,351	| IOT213 |	Things just how I look at the world I'm like hey
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:13,727	| IOT213 |	How can that scale how many devices can one person now managed with this particular advice
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:15,263	| IOT213 |	You're not the only
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,055	| IOT213 |	It's a good one
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,335	| IOT213 |	It is what it is
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:21,151	| IOT213 |	Synthesis in the us obviously
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,943	| IOT213 |	During start deliveries in the US
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,223	| IOT213 |	Planning to start
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:27,551	| IOT213 |	Commercial package delivery in Blacksburg Virginia later this year
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:30,879	| IOT213 |	And Wing already does deliveries
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,159	| IOT213 |	And Australia
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:35,743	| IOT213 |	And I believe they're about to be in testing and Helsinki
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:38,303	| IOT213 |	It was just there
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,071	| IOT213 |	I know
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,607	| IOT213 |	You could order something by drone
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:45,215	| IOT213 |	That kind of makes up Helsinki Salo City
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,031	| IOT213 |	For what that's worth
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:51,359	| IOT213 |	It's a low City there's not a lot of skyscrapers so
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:53,151	| IOT213 |	I think there were like two or
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:55,199	| IOT213 |	3 and they were really skyscrapers they were like
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:55,967	| IOT213 |	20 story building
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:57,759	| IOT213 |	And they were more in Espanol
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:17:59,039	| IOT213 |	Helsinki
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,367	| IOT213 |	Okay
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:03,903	| IOT213 |	Stop saying that
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:05,183	| IOT213 |	All right
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,207	| IOT213 |	Wise
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:10,303	| IOT213 |	Is beta testing Google Assistant integration
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:15,167	| IOT213 |	Man $30 and $20 cameras just
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:15,679	| IOT213 |	Keep getting
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:16,703	| IOT213 |	Better
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:19,775	| IOT213 |	So yeah release date like that
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,823	| IOT213 |	Timbre in the wise community
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:25,151	| IOT213 |	Site you can follow along with those who are beta testing
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:29,247	| IOT213 |	You may still be able to apply I'm not sure on that one but it's worth reading
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:33,343	| IOT213 |	What they did to testers are seeing their seeing some issues I mean that's what a beta test is
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:35,903	| IOT213 |	You know kind of weed those out get them fixed such as
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:38,719	| IOT213 |	Super long latency times on one person reported like a
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,999	| IOT213 |	15 second delay
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:44,095	| IOT213 |	Before they were actually able to see their camera on sale OK Google home
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,631	| IOT213 |	Humphreys amp over the phone
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:52,543	| IOT213 |	But they're getting there and that's important I've been watching for wise to add Google Assistant support as well as Sono switch
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,335	| IOT213 |	I know that was supposed to be out last year
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:56,127	| IOT213 |	Management perspective this year but
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,407	| IOT213 |	New news on the Sonos front
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,479	| IOT213 |	And I love the fact that we like
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:02,015	| IOT213 |	18
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:02,783	| IOT213 |	Second delay
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,087	| IOT213 |	Life is terrible
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:08,415	| IOT213 |	Well it means
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:10,719	| IOT213 |	It isn't real use case I just love how
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,791	| IOT213 |	How spoiled I was just going to say we're so spoiled
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:17,887	| IOT213 |	Like I remember when I would wait like a minute and a half for a webpage to live
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:23,775	| IOT213 |	That I had when you were on Roadrunner
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:24,799	| IOT213 |	All right
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:27,359	| IOT213 |	Also Google Assistant news we've got
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:29,919	| IOT213 |	Can call them skills
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:32,991	| IOT213 |	Integrations
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,271	| IOT213 |	Interactions routine
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:37,087	| IOT213 |	I think it's if does applets
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:38,111	| IOT213 |	Google dance routines
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:40,159	| IOT213 |	Animated skills
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:42,463	| IOT213 |	Amana Bay by the way is our version of
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,231	| IOT213 |	Amazon speaker
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,511	| IOT213 |	Amazon stick
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,023	| IOT213 |	Special Assistant
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,047	| IOT213 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,583	| IOT213 |	So
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,607	| IOT213 |	What can we do
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:50,655	| IOT213 |	We can do more with water
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,703	| IOT213 |	Water
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:54,495	| IOT213 |	So now you can integrate
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:58,591	| IOT213 |	Leak Detectors such as the leak smart or the Flow by Moen
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:00,639	| IOT213 |	To get notifications
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:01,919	| IOT213 |	Your pipes leak
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:03,711	| IOT213 |	And you can even tell the assistant
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,735	| IOT213 |	Shut off your water
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:07,039	| IOT213 |	And also for you gardeners out there
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:08,575	| IOT213 |	Audi rsq3
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:10,367	| IOT213 |	Smart sprinkler controller
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:12,159	| IOT213 |	Is now available
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:13,951	| IOT213 |	To integrate with the Google Assistant
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:16,511	| IOT213 |	They're looking to they been Google
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:19,327	| IOT213 |	Adding support for the rain Birds
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,631	| IOT213 |	Irrigation controllers in the coming weeks as well
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,167	| IOT213 |	Exciting
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:25,727	| IOT213 |	So this is kind of an earth day thing talk about
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:27,263	| IOT213 |	Hey
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:32,383	| IOT213 |	Save water so the flow system the Flow by Bowen
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,663	| IOT213 |	You don't have to have Moen
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,943	| IOT213 |	Pictures for this to work
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:38,783	| IOT213 |	Basically the flow system is a $500
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,295	| IOT213 |	Device
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,367	| IOT213 |	Thing that your water
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:45,439	| IOT213 |	Yeah I was like what is that thing but water mean
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,207	| IOT213 |	Water
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:47,999	| IOT213 |	So you can get this
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:51,583	| IOT213 |	At Home Depot and Amazon we've actually had the CEO of this company on
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:53,119	| IOT213 |	Podcast before
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,887	| IOT213 |	Gables lovely
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:56,191	| IOT213 |	But it will show you
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:59,519	| IOT213 |	What the what are you saying it to text things like slow leaks
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,799	| IOT213 |	Which is really important
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:01,311	| IOT213 |	Because they're
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,615	| IOT213 |	Usually very hard to detect
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,663	| IOT213 |	Pipe bursting
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:07,199	| IOT213 |	Like water is raining down on you you're like
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:08,479	| IOT213 |	Oh yeah dude
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:11,039	| IOT213 |	So this allows you to turn off
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:12,575	| IOT213 |	Where is well
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:17,696	| IOT213 |	It's one of the less-expensive options out there some of the others are about $800
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:18,976	| IOT213 |	So
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:20,256	| IOT213 |	That's exciting
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,280	| IOT213 |	And
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:26,912	| IOT213 |	I think I'm going to install one of these when I get to a new house that I actually own which is going to be a while
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,192	| IOT213 |	Very sad about that
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:29,472	| IOT213 |	But
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:30,752	| IOT213 |	I
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:36,128	| IOT213 |	I think this is the sort of thing that makes a lot of sense if you have the income in
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:36,896	| IOT213 |	Want to focus on
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:39,712	| IOT213 |	I habitat
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:42,272	| IOT213 |	Happy, I want to focus on prevention here so I like
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:45,088	| IOT213 |	I also like the idea of like
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:46,112	| IOT213 |	What a prank you could have
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,136	| IOT213 |	Haji
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:48,160	| IOT213 |	Turn off the water
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:51,232	| IOT213 |	When somebody's in the shower
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:53,280	| IOT213 |	Oh that's so bad
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,560	| IOT213 |	See this is why we need
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:56,096	| IOT213 |	Admin privileges
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:58,400	| IOT213 |	Yes I agree
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:59,168	| IOT213 |	I agree
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,960	| IOT213 |	I am terrible no one would ever
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:02,752	| IOT213 |	All right
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:04,544	| IOT213 |	What's in the news portion on
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:07,104	| IOT213 |	An exciting bit of news that I found in
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:10,176	| IOT213 |	I have a husband who is allergic to fire ants
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:11,456	| IOT213 |	And so we used to
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:15,552	| IOT213 |	In college together we'd go out places with our friends and
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:20,416	| IOT213 |	Fight places to wear Outdoors over who would have to inject his EpiPen
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:22,464	| IOT213 |	If he got bit by a fire ant
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:23,232	| IOT213 |	Count me out
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,000	| IOT213 |	Yeah
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,024	| IOT213 |	We rise like Madden
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:29,632	| IOT213 |	Now that he's my husband I totally would.
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:31,168	| IOT213 |	Bananas fiber
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:33,472	| IOT213 |	Right
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:36,544	| IOT213 |	So the folks at Rice University
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:38,080	| IOT213 |	I built a prototype
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:39,104	| IOT213 |	Device that you
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:40,128	| IOT213 |	Where on your wrist
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:44,224	| IOT213 |	And it does the injection for you so you press this button and
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:47,296	| IOT213 |	Can you inject epinephrine into someone's system so this is
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:48,832	| IOT213 |	For children
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:51,136	| IOT213 |	Mostly or but it could have been for my
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,160	| IOT213 |	My husband back in the day
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,184	| IOT213 |	You're so squeamish
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:56,000	| IOT213 |	And this is not something you can buy yet
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:59,072	| IOT213 |	But it is really exciting I think
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:01,120	| IOT213 |	That you have this device that you
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:04,192	| IOT213 |	You can wear around your wrist very clunky and you just press this button is like
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:08,800	| IOT213 |	It's a smart app rotates a little bulky obviously this is a prototype
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:11,104	| IOT213 |	But this is fantastic not connected I could
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:13,664	| IOT213 |	I'd like to see somebody get out
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:17,248	| IOT213 |	People hit like that panic button on their phone or watch to be able to
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:22,624	| IOT213 |	Have it automatically inject if it detects whatever needs to be detected I don't know
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,672	| IOT213 |	Can before you go into
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:27,488	| IOT213 |	Anaphylactic shock there must be some way to detect that
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:30,560	| IOT213 |	I also wonder if this ever comes to Market if it
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:31,584	| IOT213 |	Piers in
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:34,656	| IOT213 |	What's a combat uniforms or gear
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:36,960	| IOT213 |	Oh that's really interesting
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:39,264	| IOT213 |	Yeah you could like give your soldier a burst of
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:40,800	| IOT213 |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,592	| IOT213 |	Here's your adrenaline shot get up Soldier
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,128	| IOT213 |	Wow
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:45,920	| IOT213 |	The same size
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:49,760	| IOT213 |	Cuz that's totally built it as a built-in feature in all of the lake
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:50,784	| IOT213 |	Space suit
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,576	| IOT213 |	Combat suits
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:54,368	| IOT213 |	Yeah, batsuits Bae Suzy and I
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:58,208	| IOT213 |	I'm building my own for the zombie apocalypse I think they'll include this
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:04,608	| IOT213 |	Yeah get that in there so we'll look in here for this it's obviously still a prototype really interesting
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:06,400	| IOT213 |	Plus it's from one of my favorite sites
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:06,912	| IOT213 |	Medgadget
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,728	| IOT213 |	Is just as awesome site

EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:44,448	| IOT213 |	Alright this week's voicemail is from
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:44,960	| IOT213 |	Json
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:47,776	| IOT213 |	IStation Kevin this is JC
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:52,128	| IOT213 |	I've been automating my home but I'm
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,432	| IOT213 |	I was wondering
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,480	| IOT213 |	You could recommend
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:58,016	| IOT213 |	A sensor to put in each
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:00,064	| IOT213 |	Set monitor sings like
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:02,368	| IOT213 |	Humidity motion and Light
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,672	| IOT213 |	I don't currently have a hub
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:06,976	| IOT213 |	But that isn't ever the question
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:08,768	| IOT213 |	Your suggestions would be helped
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:13,888	| IOT213 |	Jason I'm so glad you asked this question because now I can tell you about my
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:14,912	| IOT213 |	Spirit Center
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:16,704	| IOT213 |	In like the whole wide world
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,472	| IOT213 |	I'm not kidding
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:19,008	| IOT213 |	You guys this is the aeotec
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,288	| IOT213 |	Multisensor 6
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:21,568	| IOT213 |	I
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,080	| IOT213 |	Love this
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:23,616	| IOT213 |	Pretty
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:24,384	| IOT213 |	Dysfunctional
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:26,432	| IOT213 |	And you can actually install it
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,200	| IOT213 |	Recessed
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:29,248	| IOT213 |	So it's not even like super visible
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:31,296	| IOT213 |	Catches
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:32,320	| IOT213 |	It is expensive
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:33,600	| IOT213 |	It's about 60 bucks
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:36,928	| IOT213 |	But for all of that you get a motion sensor
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:37,952	| IOT213 |	A temperature sensor
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:38,720	| IOT213 |	A light sensor
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,512	| IOT213 |	Humidity sensor
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,816	| IOT213 |	A vibration sensor and
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,840	| IOT213 |	A UV sensor
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:45,120	| IOT213 |	All of that is
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:49,728	| IOT213 |	Pretty freaking awesome and I will tell you having tested the sensor out
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,520	| IOT213 |	It is very accurate
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:52,800	| IOT213 |	And
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,568	| IOT213 |	Latency is
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:54,848	| IOT213 |	Greeley
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:56,128	| IOT213 |	Low on
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:58,432	| IOT213 |	The SmartThings platform which is what I tried it up again
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:02,272	| IOT213 |	So this is a Z-Wave sensor you will need
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,040	| IOT213 |	Hub with
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,856	| IOT213 |	I would recommend SmartThings
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:10,464	| IOT213 |	The Furious stuff works well with it works well with openhab home assistant
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:12,256	| IOT213 |	Lots of other products
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:13,536	| IOT213 |	So
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:15,584	| IOT213 |	Yeah there are some other alternatives
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:20,960	| IOT213 |	On the market for Barro's motion sensors also the same price range about $60
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:25,056	| IOT213 |	It's lacking humidity if I recall correctly so
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:27,872	| IOT213 |	Obviously at the same price I probably go with
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:29,152	| IOT213 |	Aerotek
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:30,176	| IOT213 |	Stacey recommended
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:35,808	| IOT213 |	$60 per room kinetic quickly so I only mention this with a caveat
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:38,624	| IOT213 |	Monoprice makes a Z-Wave Plus
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:41,952	| IOT213 |	Sensor for motion temperature humidity and Light
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:44,000	| IOT213 |	It's only $30
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:44,768	| IOT213 |	However
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:51,680	| IOT213 |	Most of the reviews on Amazon where you can purchase it for $30 are in the negative category so
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:56,800	| IOT213 |	Treme I probably spend $90 and get one of each the Monoprice in the Aerotek
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,592	| IOT213 |	You can always return the one that's
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:00,640	| IOT213 |	Not working well for you and then
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:03,200	| IOT213 |	Equip all of the rooms at the one that does work best for you
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:06,784	| IOT213 |	Yes and there's also a device from
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:07,296	| IOT213 |	Zoos
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:09,344	| IOT213 |	Z o o z
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:10,880	| IOT213 |	That is
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:12,672	| IOT213 |	$33
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:14,976	| IOT213 |	This particular sensor only works with
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:18,560	| IOT213 |	Open system so the securifi almond
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:21,120	| IOT213 |	Which is popcorn we don't talk a lot about
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:22,400	| IOT213 |	What is a good platform
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:26,752	| IOT213 |	Home assistant habitat SmartThings you are going to need a custom device Handler
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:27,520	| IOT213 |	Murphy's on Spa

EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:35,008	| IOT213 |	Not weeks
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:36,032	| IOT213 |	Not much
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:37,568	| IOT213 |	Using our intuitive
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:38,592	| IOT213 |	Drag and drop interface
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:39,872	| IOT213 |	At available s
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:41,664	| IOT213 |	Nice
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:45,504	| IOT213 |	All right so companies use the phrase open and independent
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,272	| IOT213 |	A lot
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:47,552	| IOT213 |	What do you guys mean
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:48,064	| IOT213 |	Buy open
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:51,904	| IOT213 |	Buy open I mean the whole platform is a
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:53,696	| IOT213 |	Accessible via secure API
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:55,488	| IOT213 |	Which allow you to interface
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:56,256	| IOT213 |	Chewy

EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:05,472	| IOT213 |	Buy
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:07,264	| IOT213 |	I mean we are one of the
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,032	| IOT213 |	Only vendor
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:10,336	| IOT213 |	They can take the same code base
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:12,128	| IOT213 |	And run it anywhere
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:13,920	| IOT213 |	At the edge on Prim
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:14,944	| IOT213 |	In a data center
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:15,968	| IOT213 |	Private cloud
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:16,992	| IOT213 |	Public cloud
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:18,272	| IOT213 |	The possibilities are
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:23,136	| IOT213 |	Endless we have customers running the platform in AWS Azure Alibaba
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:25,184	| IOT213 |	And a private data centers all over the
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:26,976	| IOT213 |	This flexibility
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:29,024	| IOT213 |	Gives you the freedom to choose your own desk
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:30,816	| IOT213 |	You decide
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:31,840	| IOT213 |	Where do you host Your solution
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:33,632	| IOT213 |	And how your data is stored
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:36,192	| IOT213 |	If your plans change and you decided
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:38,240	| IOT213 |	Remove
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:39,008	| IOT213 |	Cantu
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:39,776	| IOT213 |	That sounds excellent
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:43,872	| IOT213 |	So where can I go to find out more about software AG
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:44,384	| IOT213 |	And
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:45,408	| IOT213 |	Camila sodi
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:47,968	| IOT213 |	You can go to software AG

EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:04,608	| IOT213 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host and today's guest
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,888	| IOT213 |	Is Danny Fong
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,936	| IOT213 |	Who is a postdoc fellow
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:09,216	| IOT213 |	@prince
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:10,240	| IOT213 |	Stemscopes Ida paw
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:11,520	| IOT213 |	So
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:12,544	| IOT213 |	He's probably
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:14,336	| IOT213 |	How are you doing
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:16,384	| IOT213 |	Hi Stacy
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:19,456	| IOT213 |	Me and I am so excited to have you on the show
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:25,344	| IOT213 |	You were part of a team that released something just a few weeks ago called iot inspector
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:27,648	| IOT213 |	That allows me to run this program on Micah
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:30,720	| IOT213 |	And then see what devices are on my network
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:35,328	| IOT213 |	We're going to try my best day so let's kick it off with why the heck did you guys built this
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:42,240	| IOT213 |	Demolition started in November last year Thanksgiving when a few friends of mine receive
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:44,288	| IOT213 |	Need the number of iot devices asked
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:46,336	| IOT213 |	Presents and they're like
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:49,152	| IOT213 |	Should we use these iot
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,176	| IOT213 |	And they knew that I
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:52,480	| IOT213 |	And I was doing iot research
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:58,112	| IOT213 |	Is there a way for us to figure out if he's i'll devices are easy to use
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:33:01,440	| IOT213 |	Like one way is to send those devices to Denny's
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:04,256	| IOT213 |	Danny's colonies in the lab and analyze
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:07,584	| IOT213 |	Play some but either way so that was struggling motivation
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:09,120	| IOT213 |	How we started
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:12,192	| IOT213 |	Doing this project the whole goal is to make it
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:14,240	| IOT213 |	Super easy for an average
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:14,752	| IOT213 |	Consumer
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:19,360	| IOT213 |	To check if their iot devices are safe or not
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:19,872	| IOT213 |	In their home
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:21,920	| IOT213 |	Or you know before
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:25,248	| IOT213 |	They decide to return their products back to Amazon or something
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:26,784	| IOT213 |	Whether they should keep using it
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:28,064	| IOT213 |	Sebastian motivation
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:29,088	| IOT213 |	I guess run average
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:32,672	| IOT213 |	Consumer it is very difficult for them to do what we do in the lab
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:35,488	| IOT213 |	Such a setting up a wireless network with running
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:37,792	| IOT213 |	Wireshark and analyze the traffic
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,584	| IOT213 |	So we decided that
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:40,352	| IOT213 |	On average
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:41,632	| IOT213 |	Consumer we need a
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:44,704	| IOT213 |	Do them something simple something clickable
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:50,336	| IOT213 |	That they can use almost instantaneously to figure out if they're iot devices
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,360	| IOT213 |	Are trustworthy
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:52,384	| IOT213 |	Sabattus
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:53,920	| IOT213 |	How we started this project
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:57,248	| IOT213 |	Okay so if the goal is to figure out
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:34:00,064	| IOT213 |	If these devices are safe to use and run
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:01,600	| IOT213 |	How are you guys measuring
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:02,624	| IOT213 |	What are the things you're looking
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:04,160	| IOT213 |	Coyote NC
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:06,976	| IOT213 |	To help our users determine if
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:08,256	| IOT213 |	A particular iot device
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:10,304	| IOT213 |	Inspector
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:14,400	| IOT213 |	Shows visualization that answers to Broad question
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:15,680	| IOT213 |	The first question is
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,472	| IOT213 |	Are my devices
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:18,752	| IOT213 |	Talkin to the internet
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:19,776	| IOT213 |	When they're not supposed
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:22,336	| IOT213 |	And a second question is
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:25,664	| IOT213 |	To whom were my iot devices talking
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:29,248	| IOT213 |	Occiput first point we have visualization
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:31,552	| IOT213 |	Such as a graph that shows
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:33,600	| IOT213 |	At what time your devices
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:36,416	| IOT213 |	We're talkin sending and receiving traffic
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:38,976	| IOT213 |	Say for instance we have a camera in the lab
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:41,536	| IOT213 |	We could see that when we're using it
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:42,816	| IOT213 |	Now we can see spikes
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:44,864	| IOT213 |	In the bed with the consumer
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:45,632	| IOT213 |	Overtime
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:49,472	| IOT213 |	When it's not being used obviously there should not be any traffic
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:50,240	| IOT213 |	Received
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:53,056	| IOT213 |	Another instance is we have an Amazon Echo
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:55,872	| IOT213 |	In our lab as well we ran I'll Constructor
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:57,408	| IOT213 |	Analyze the echo
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:34:59,968	| IOT213 |	You found that there's constant
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:03,808	| IOT213 |	Stream of traffic being received and sent by Amazon Echo
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:06,880	| IOT213 |	Presumably it while the Amazon Echo was
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:08,416	| IOT213 |	Contacting the server
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:09,184	| IOT213 |	Maybe for Harvey
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:10,464	| IOT213 |	Kings or something
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:12,256	| IOT213 |	That's one classic question
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:13,536	| IOT213 |	Thataylaa Construction
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:16,352	| IOT213 |	Answer the second question is
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:18,656	| IOT213 |	I to whom my devices were talking to
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:21,984	| IOT213 |	Show at the answer this question I expect a present
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:23,264	| IOT213 |	Cables
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:24,544	| IOT213 |	In points
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:27,360	| IOT213 |	Dad go devices were talking to buy in points
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:28,128	| IOT213 |	I meant
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:30,176	| IOT213 |	What is the name of the server what is it
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:32,992	| IOT213 |	IP address what country is what type of
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:33,760	| IOT213 |	Server
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:34,784	| IOT213 |	Your devices
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:38,880	| IOT213 |	Say for instance we have a smart TV or Roku Smart TV
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:42,720	| IOT213 |	Money started that watching say Princeton's Bloomberg live news
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:46,048	| IOT213 |	We could see that the TV was talking to
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:48,864	| IOT213 |	Not only bloomberg.com but also
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:51,424	| IOT213 |	Video hosting Services run by Google
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:56,544	| IOT213 |	As well as a number of advertising or tracking services such as Google Analytics
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:02,688	| IOT213 |	This table will allow us to visualize exactly
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:03,456	| IOT213 |	Which
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:04,480	| IOT213 |	Parties for a contact
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:07,040	| IOT213 |	These could be first parties
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,832	| IOT213 |	In this case of fire
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:10,112	| IOT213 |	Boombah.com
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:11,648	| IOT213 |	Could be start party
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:16,000	| IOT213 |	Team is case you could be the advertising services such as school Analytics
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:17,280	| IOT213 |	Got it
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:19,328	| IOT213 |	So I haven't used it those are somewhat
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:22,656	| IOT213 |	I think the fact that some devices do
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:25,728	| IOT213 |	Like share State information so there's kind of a their heart
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:27,008	| IOT213 |	Ping or maybe
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:29,824	| IOT213 |	Connected devices that are connected to other devices have some sort
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:30,592	| IOT213 |	Back-channel
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,360	| IOT213 |	Communication
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:35,200	| IOT213 |	And there's things like overnight updates like sometimes my devices when I'm not using them
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:36,736	| IOT213 |	Arsenic
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:38,784	| IOT213 |	Lot of traffic which can look a little weird
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:40,320	| IOT213 |	You're like oh
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:40,832	| IOT213 |	That's what that
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:43,904	| IOT213 |	I love having the visibility into that
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:46,720	| IOT213 |	I do think it's important to understand like
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:53,120	| IOT213 |	What's happening on the back end and I'm curious how do you think device makers should communicate
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:54,656	| IOT213 |	Both on Howell
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:56,704	| IOT213 |	Often their devices are communicating to the network
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:58,496	| IOT213 |	And then we're there
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:36:59,008	| IOT213 |	Communicating
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:01,056	| IOT213 |	In the current setting
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:07,456	| IOT213 |	Some smart TVs made her such as Roku and Amazon would say that in their privacy policies
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,224	| IOT213 |	Especially
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:11,296	| IOT213 |	Bad the devices contacts
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:11,808	| IOT213 |	Hardee's
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:14,112	| IOT213 |	So if consumers
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:19,232	| IOT213 |	Read these privacy policies carefully it should not be a surprising
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:21,024	| IOT213 |	Facts that their TVs
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:25,120	| IOT213 |	We're talking to a range of third-party services
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:26,912	| IOT213 |	That is state right now for Smart TV
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:30,496	| IOT213 |	Stay right now for non-smart TV such
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:32,288	| IOT213 |	Hive smart plugs
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:37,920	| IOT213 |	Is little unclear so one example is we have a smart plug a WeMo plug and some people
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:38,688	| IOT213 |	It was
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:40,992	| IOT213 |	Talking to
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:42,784	| IOT213 |	Some third-party iot
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:43,552	| IOT213 |	Control service
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:48,928	| IOT213 |	That would allow a user to turn on and off the switch remotely is not clear
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:50,720	| IOT213 |	A user
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:57,120	| IOT213 |	That when they bought the product from Amazon it is not clear the user with know that they're smart plug with top
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:38:00,704	| IOT213 |	Talk to a service other than the manufacturer in bloom cell
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:02,752	| IOT213 |	Status of current state
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:03,776	| IOT213 |	In terms of
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:07,616	| IOT213 |	Question about what we think I should do
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:11,200	| IOT213 |	I definitely believe that there should be more transparency and privacy
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:11,712	| IOT213 |	Policy
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:20,928	| IOT213 |	How to say thatto your product will talk to these third parties where you know he's sure that you'll be some constant stream of coming
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:21,696	| IOT213 |	Location
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:24,768	| IOT213 |	But in reality I'm not sure how
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:25,536	| IOT213 |	Weather that would help
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:26,816	| IOT213 |	For two reasons
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:28,352	| IOT213 |	The first reason is sad
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:32,448	| IOT213 |	I don't know if they haven't sent it for saying something like that in other words
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:38,080	| IOT213 |	If a vendor says that your smart plug will be talking to an iot control strawberry such as tuya in China
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:39,872	| IOT213 |	Pc-1 example
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:40,640	| IOT213 |	Thinking out loud
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:44,992	| IOT213 |	I don't know how consumers would take that and that might reduce number of sales
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,528	| IOT213 |	Tessa Brooks recent
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:47,552	| IOT213 |	Second reasons.
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:49,088	| IOT213 |	I'm not sure if
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:50,368	| IOT213 |	Many consumers
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:53,184	| IOT213 |	Understand what that means I am with you
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:55,232	| IOT213 |	Both of those reasons are excellent reason
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:56,512	| IOT213 |	And I think
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:58,304	| IOT213 |	There's a lack of vendor
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:39:00,608	| IOT213 |	Desire to do this because it could hurt sales
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:02,912	| IOT213 |	We're sending your data to some place
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:04,192	| IOT213 |	Chinese platform
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:04,960	| IOT213 |	Provider you know some
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:07,008	| IOT213 |	Even though it
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:07,520	| IOT213 |	It's totally the
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:09,312	| IOT213 |	Other vendors
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:14,176	| IOT213 |	Right inside the traffic was talking about me not be like
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:16,480	| IOT213 |	Any private information this could be just
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:18,272	| IOT213 |	Someone turning on and off switch
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:23,136	| IOT213 |	And I'm too someone to consume
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:24,160	| IOT213 |	They may just freaked out
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:29,024	| IOT213 |	But there's also the need to educate the overall Market about
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:30,560	| IOT213 |	What is problematic Behavior
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:31,840	| IOT213 |	What isn't
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:34,656	| IOT213 |	So let's go and do something else at this tracks which is
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:35,936	| IOT213 |	Poor encryption or weekend
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:36,960	| IOT213 |	And I believe there
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:40,544	| IOT213 |	Three things that I can see I can see devices with
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:42,336	| IOT213 |	No sort of security on them
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:44,128	| IOT213 |	Weak encryption and
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:45,152	| IOT213 |	Insecure
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:45,920	| IOT213 |	Practices
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:46,944	| IOT213 |	In terms of
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:50,016	| IOT213 |	Security of neutralization we show
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:52,832	| IOT213 |	Instances of no encryption
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:58,976	| IOT213 |	Secure encryption or we can cryption those can be very confusing labels and we are still working on the way to
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:03,072	| IOT213 |	Fine-tune those labels that's what these labels mean is the following
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:04,352	| IOT213 |	No encryption
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:05,632	| IOT213 |	Meaning
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:08,448	| IOT213 |	A device is talking to the server using
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:08,960	| IOT213 |	In this case
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:11,008	| IOT213 |	Http unencrypted
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:12,032	| IOT213 |	480
EDL	00:40:12,032	00:40:14,336	| IOT213 |	We've seen lots of instances of those
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:15,872	| IOT213 |	We don't know if
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:17,920	| IOT213 |	Devices were actually sending
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:22,016	| IOT213 |	Sensitive information to the clouds or not we don't have the data but it is
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:23,040	| IOT213 |	Away
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:24,576	| IOT213 |	Rest assured that all your devices
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:27,136	| IOT213 |	Talking to the cloud without encryption
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:28,672	| IOT213 |	This is actually pretty common
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:30,208	| IOT213 |	Even happens on
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:30,976	| IOT213 |	My phone sometime
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:34,048	| IOT213 |	Android pixel 2
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:36,352	| IOT213 |	I sometimes talk to the clouds without encryption
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:38,400	| IOT213 |	Sometimes you just to test working City
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:39,680	| IOT213 |	Status no encryption
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:41,472	| IOT213 |	Insecure encryption
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:43,008	| IOT213 |	The very bad case
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:46,848	| IOT213 |	So when Taliban cryption their various encryption methods
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:47,872	| IOT213 |	The most
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:51,712	| IOT213 |	The industry-standard today is this encryption card TLS 1.0
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:56,064	| IOT213 |	In supposed to be secure and it's difficult to break
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:57,856	| IOT213 |	But they're still exist
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:58,880	| IOT213 |	Outdated ink
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:01,696	| IOT213 |	Encryption methods such as TLS 1.0
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:03,488	| IOT213 |	Depression that predates
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:05,024	| IOT213 |	Current at 1.2
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:07,328	| IOT213 |	Researchers have found ways to
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:12,704	| IOT213 |	Sportpaleis 1.0 such that if your device is running on July 2108 encryption
EDL	00:41:13,216	00:41:16,800	| IOT213 |	There's a potentially a hacker May intercept your traffic
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:18,336	| IOT213 |	Extract
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:23,456	| IOT213 |	Potentially sensitive information in your Indian communication
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:24,992	| IOT213 |	Because he is well known that he
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:26,272	| IOT213 |	Insecure yet
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:27,808	| IOT213 |	We still
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:28,832	| IOT213 |	See
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:30,880	| IOT213 |	A small number of devices
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:32,160	| IOT213 |	Whisk LS1
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:34,464	| IOT213 |	10 being used in the encryption
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:36,512	| IOT213 |	I am not going to say what company
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:39,584	| IOT213 |	Some major company that makes Smart TVs
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:40,864	| IOT213 |	In fact
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:45,216	| IOT213 |	We talked to one of their customer representative
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:48,288	| IOT213 |	And ask if their devices used
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:50,336	| IOT213 |	State-of-the-art encryption
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:53,407	| IOT213 |	Their customer rap say something long line of yes we all in
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:58,527	| IOT213 |	One of the TV channels
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:01,343	| IOT213 |	We communicate with the cloud using TLS 1.0
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:02,879	| IOT213 |	Oh so they're actively lying
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:03,903	| IOT213 |	So not cool
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:10,303	| IOT213 |	Actually is aware of what's going on
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:11,839	| IOT213 |	You're right you are a much nicer
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:13,887	| IOT213 |	Alright so that's insecure
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:15,935	| IOT213 |	And then week is
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:19,775	| IOT213 |	If you show the devices using Beacon
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:22,335	| IOT213 |	It means that a device
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:23,359	| IOT213 |	Support
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:24,127	| IOT213 |	Weak ciphers
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:27,199	| IOT213 |	It doesn't necessarily mean that they are asked
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:31,807	| IOT213 |	Free using we Cipher Suites in their last communication always saying is that these devices
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:34,367	| IOT213 |	So
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:35,391	| IOT213 |	In a case
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:37,439	| IOT213 |	Where a server actually
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:39,743	| IOT213 |	Yes using weak Cipher Suites
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:41,279	| IOT213 |	The entire communication
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:42,303	| IOT213 |	Will be using weeks
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:45,887	| IOT213 |	Always saying that if we label device
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:48,959	| IOT213 |	Add honey wheat encryption the device supports weeks
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:51,263	| IOT213 |	There are way more devices
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:52,799	| IOT213 |	With weak encryption
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:54,079	| IOT213 |	I'm insecure encryption
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:55,103	| IOT213 |	I don't know why
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:58,175	| IOT213 |	Potentially devices with weak encryption
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:42:59,967	| IOT213 |	That is devices with weak Cipher Suites
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:04,063	| IOT213 |	Could be a because of backward compatibility but don't know why
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:09,695	| IOT213 |	But it may not be as bad as insecure encryption that is pieces using TLS 1.0
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:11,231	| IOT213 |	Okay
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:11,999	| IOT213 |	So it's kind of like
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:14,815	| IOT213 |	If I send my daughter to school with
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:15,327	| IOT213 |	Lunch money
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:19,423	| IOT213 |	She may go to the cookie stand or she make it a chicken sandwich
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:22,239	| IOT213 |	But both are on offer in with her money she could buy both
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:24,799	| IOT213 |	Are either and so I don't actually know if she's
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:29,663	| IOT213 |	That is correct that is a very good analogy
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:32,735	| IOT213 |	So that explains kind of what you guys are measuring
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:35,807	| IOT213 |	Let's talk about how companies have reacted
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:37,855	| IOT213 |	That's because now it's been in the market
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:39,391	| IOT213 |	Kit for a while you guys have been testing
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:40,927	| IOT213 |	Before it was you
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:41,695	| IOT213 |	At least
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:45,279	| IOT213 |	Are you talking to some of the vendors at these devices are there reaching out in the saying
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:47,071	| IOT213 |	Hey
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:50,655	| IOT213 |	There's an issue or maybe even offering more clarity I know that sometimes when
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:53,471	| IOT213 |	I'm looking at some of the places my thing is talking to him like
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:56,543	| IOT213 |	I take that belongs to the company but I don't know
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:58,847	| IOT213 |	We have actually not talk to you any
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:01,663	| IOT213 |	For some reason I just talked about like
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:03,711	| IOT213 |	Devices that use TLS 1.0
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:06,015	| IOT213 |	We have not reached out
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:07,551	| IOT213 |	Company say that old
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:11,135	| IOT213 |	Your devices are not our talking 1.0 we are
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:13,695	| IOT213 |	Time to do that once we gather more concrete evidence
EDL	00:44:14,719	00:44:15,487	| IOT213 |	Got it
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:17,279	| IOT213 |	So let's talk about actually
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:18,815	| IOT213 |	What you guys are doing with this
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:20,863	| IOT213 |	That's cuz there's a couple caveat by thinker
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:21,631	| IOT213 |	Importance for people in
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:23,167	| IOT213 |	1 is
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:25,727	| IOT213 |	The data you guys are gathering is for research for
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:26,495	| IOT213 |	Purposes
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:28,287	| IOT213 |	It's possible for me to delete it
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:30,335	| IOT213 |	But you probably would rather I didn't tell you
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:31,359	| IOT213 |	Look at it is that
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:33,407	| IOT213 |	I mean I know you're analyzing
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:33,919	| IOT213 |	In the state of
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:37,759	| IOT213 |	Congratulation
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:38,783	| IOT213 |	That is correct
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:41,599	| IOT213 |	We'd rather you not delete it but we give you the option
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:44,927	| IOT213 |	To easily be today like you want to say Frances
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:47,231	| IOT213 |	You accidentally capture a sensitive data
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:51,583	| IOT213 |	From a sensitive device always together
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:52,863	| IOT213 |	As much data
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:54,143	| IOT213 |	As possible because
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:56,191	| IOT213 |	So far there isn't
EDL	00:44:56,191	00:44:57,727	| IOT213 |	We haven't seen any
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:44:59,519	| IOT213 |	Non-proprietary death
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:02,591	| IOT213 |	Coyote research Community to look into
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:06,175	| IOT213 |	Ashley security privacy problems
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:07,455	| IOT213 |	We want to be the first
EDL	00:45:07,967	00:45:09,247	| IOT213 |	Studio session label
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:12,575	| IOT213 |	Where individual devices word labeled
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:13,855	| IOT213 |	Buy users
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:15,391	| IOT213 |	So that we know exactly
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:16,671	| IOT213 |	Which
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:17,439	| IOT213 |	Device
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:18,975	| IOT213 |	What type of device
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:19,743	| IOT213 |	Off this device
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:21,535	| IOT213 |	Was sending what kind of traffic
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:26,143	| IOT213 |	And there's also the issue that this has to run on
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:27,167	| IOT213 |	Computer
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:29,471	| IOT213 |	Fairly constantly
EDL	00:45:29,471	00:45:30,239	| IOT213 |	Yes
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:30,751	| IOT213 |	To get the data
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:31,775	| IOT213 |	Installed
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:35,103	| IOT213 |	Actually you don't need to run this offer constant
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:37,663	| IOT213 |	You can run this for however however long you like
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:39,199	| IOT213 |	Just look at the data right now
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:41,247	| IOT213 |	7 days
EDL	00:45:41,759	00:45:42,783	| IOT213 |	In a medium case
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:45,087	| IOT213 |	Users running ourselves
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:46,367	| IOT213 |	17 minutes
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:49,183	| IOT213 |	Presumably to scan their Network
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:50,719	| IOT213 |	See what devices are network
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:54,559	| IOT213 |	Just have a brief overview of whom their devices were talking to
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:57,119	| IOT213 |	Although we have a very long tail love you
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:46:00,703	| IOT213 |	Startran this offer for as long as ours
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:01,215	| IOT213 |	Hours
EDL	00:46:01,727	00:46:03,519	| IOT213 |	So we can receive a variety of use
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:06,847	| IOT213 |	Encases people ran this offer for 17 minutes
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:10,687	| IOT213 |	Okay and do they refund it or do they
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:11,967	| IOT213 |	Just run it once in
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:13,503	| IOT213 |	Check it out and then move on
EDL	00:46:13,503	00:46:14,783	| IOT213 |	Bible said that's a good question
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:16,063	| IOT213 |	Okay
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:18,367	| IOT213 |	And this is tracking my traffic on my
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:18,879	| IOT213 |	Mywifi net
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:21,439	| IOT213 |	This is tracking
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:22,719	| IOT213 |	The traffic
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:23,999	| IOT213 |	Of devices
EDL	00:46:23,999	00:46:26,559	| IOT213 |	A Wi-Fi network that you exist
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:28,095	| IOT213 |	Explicitly wanted monitor
EDL	00:46:28,095	00:46:28,863	| IOT213 |	Right I do have to
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:29,887	| IOT213 |	Check the
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:32,959	| IOT213 |	What is an option model
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:35,263	| IOT213 |	So it's not going to pick up my like
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:38,079	| IOT213 |	Weird zigbee things are Bluetooth things unless they talk back
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:42,175	| IOT213 |	That is correct inspector only looks at the
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:42,687	| IOT213 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:44,735	| IOT213 |	Should I expect Network
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:45,247	| IOT213 |	Congestion
EDL	00:46:46,527	00:46:47,551	| IOT213 |	Yes you will
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:50,111	| IOT213 |	In fact the way this offer work sister
EDL	00:46:50,111	00:46:50,623	| IOT213 |	It does Arby's
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:52,671	| IOT213 |	To intercept the network
EDL	00:46:52,671	00:46:54,463	| IOT213 |	Traffic what does it mean to stat
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:56,255	| IOT213 |	Let's say that you're watching
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:46:57,279	| IOT213 |	A smart TV
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:59,839	| IOT213 |	And normally your smart TV will be talkin trapeze
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:03,423	| IOT213 |	Router but with respect to running your smart TV traffic
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:04,703	| IOT213 |	Spurs
EDL	00:47:04,703	00:47:05,471	| IOT213 |	Go to the router
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:09,055	| IOT213 |	Rather for the traffic to your computer running
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:11,615	| IOT213 |	I need a computer for traffic back to the router
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:13,407	| IOT213 |	Before the traffic goes back to the internet
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:17,759	| IOT213 |	NYC / so you can see that there's extra packets being sent or received in the air
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:20,063	| IOT213 |	Absolutely airwave Esprit muschamp
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:21,087	| IOT213 |	With twice
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:22,111	| IOT213 |	Amount of traffic
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:24,415	| IOT213 |	Our case we've experienced
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:25,183	| IOT213 |	Reduced
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:28,767	| IOT213 |	Network quality especially if you're on a home network that is slow
EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:29,791	| IOT213 |	That's one of the risks
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:31,327	| IOT213 |	I'll running out in Spanish
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:35,935	| IOT213 |	Is you get the greatest Network appointments although in my own experience
EDL	00:47:35,935	00:47:40,799	| IOT213 |	I have not seen any significant degradation like I can still watch TV on normally
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:45,407	| IOT213 |	Maybe sometimes see the image quality made a little bit blurry but I can still watch TV
EDL	00:47:46,175	00:47:46,687	| IOT213 |	Okay
EDL	00:47:47,199	00:47:51,807	| IOT213 |	SI I didn't notice any problems but this is another reason that maybe you want to run it and then shut it down
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:54,367	| IOT213 |	I've been having done this in
EDL	00:47:54,367	00:47:56,159	| IOT213 |	I know it hasn't been out super long
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:58,719	| IOT213 |	What are your takeaways so far
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:02,559	| IOT213 |	Have you changed your friends Minds do they want to return their products are they okay
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:05,375	| IOT213 |	I see one of my friends
EDL	00:48:05,375	00:48:08,703	| IOT213 |	Smart plug that send information to China every 5 Seconds
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:09,727	| IOT213 |	He was not happy about it
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:15,103	| IOT213 |	I'm not sure whether he is going to send send it back to Amazon but he was not happy about
EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:16,127	| IOT213 |	Tupac talking to China
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:23,295	| IOT213 |	A lot of companies use Chinese platforms because they are cheaper or sometimes devices from
EDL	00:48:23,295	00:48:29,183	| IOT213 |	China are cheaper and people tend to vote with their wallets and so far consumers are not willing to spend more money
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:31,231	| IOT213 |	On something that
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:32,511	| IOT213 |	Maybe doesn't have an affiliation
EDL	00:48:33,279	00:48:34,815	| IOT213 |	Is that something
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:38,911	| IOT213 |	That you think might change as we publicize the results of your research
EDL	00:48:39,423	00:48:42,239	| IOT213 |	That's probably be pragmatic kind and that's probably be anal
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:45,055	| IOT213 |	I tend to fall into the pragmatic kind
EDL	00:48:45,055	00:48:46,335	| IOT213 |	I don't care
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:51,967	| IOT213 |	Who my devices talking to As Long As I believe that there's no personal information being lost
EDL	00:48:51,967	00:48:52,991	| IOT213 |	So I'm probably fine
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:55,039	| IOT213 |	When using smart plug
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:56,831	| IOT213 |	That talks to Sage we are
EDL	00:48:56,831	00:48:57,855	| IOT213 |	By the way yes
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:48:58,623	| IOT213 |	My smart plug
EDL	00:48:59,135	00:48:59,647	| IOT213 |	Was talking
EDL	00:49:00,159	00:49:05,279	| IOT213 |	A server is actually located in Amazon AWS
EDL	00:49:07,071	00:49:08,607	| IOT213 |	My guess is that
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:09,119	| IOT213 |	The traffic
EDL	00:49:09,631	00:49:10,399	| IOT213 |	In this case
EDL	00:49:10,399	00:49:13,471	| IOT213 |	It's mostly mqtt traffic or xmpp traffic
EDL	00:49:13,471	00:49:15,263	| IOT213 |	Physically iot control traffic
EDL	00:49:15,263	00:49:19,871	| IOT213 |	That is unlikely to have my name or other part of very personal information in it
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:20,895	| IOT213 |	I most likely find
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:26,015	| IOT213 |	On the other hand it's the kind that may not be comfortable
EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:30,879	| IOT213 |	As my smart plug is talking to China even though
EDL	00:49:30,879	00:49:34,463	| IOT213 |	The communication isn't likely to include personal information
EDL	00:49:34,975	00:49:36,255	| IOT213 |	Someone in
EDL	00:49:36,255	00:49:37,279	| IOT213 |	Those companies
EDL	00:49:37,791	00:49:40,095	| IOT213 |	May still infer my
EDL	00:49:40,095	00:49:40,863	| IOT213 |	Living habits
EDL	00:49:41,887	00:49:46,495	| IOT213 |	When I turn on turn off the switch or your when I get home
EDL	00:49:46,495	00:49:48,543	| IOT213 |	Disinformation
EDL	00:49:49,055	00:49:50,335	| IOT213 |	I'm also
EDL	00:49:50,335	00:49:51,359	| IOT213 |	There's a smart TVs
EDL	00:49:51,359	00:49:54,175	| IOT213 |	I'm constantly talk to Truckers
EDL	00:49:54,687	00:49:56,479	| IOT213 |	The same way you would process web and then
EDL	00:49:56,479	00:49:57,503	| IOT213 |	Your web pages
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:59,039	| IOT213 |	Advertisement ads
EDL	00:50:00,319	00:50:01,855	| IOT213 |	Salvini
EDL	00:50:02,623	00:50:05,695	| IOT213 |	The other day it was still very difficult to take actions
EDL	00:50:05,695	00:50:06,463	| IOT213 |	Because
EDL	00:50:07,743	00:50:09,279	| IOT213 |	Tracking services are very
EDL	00:50:09,791	00:50:10,303	| IOT213 |	How to block
EDL	00:50:11,071	00:50:11,839	| IOT213 |	So here's why
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:14,911	| IOT213 |	Weekly install say
EDL	00:50:16,191	00:50:18,239	| IOT213 |	And then we would still be able to browse
EDL	00:50:18,239	00:50:19,263	| IOT213 |	Google web pages
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:25,407	| IOT213 |	Astronaut in iot World we're not sure if we turn off access to say
EDL	00:50:25,407	00:50:27,967	| IOT213 |	Yaga cam.com
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:29,503	| IOT213 |	Access to our servers
EDL	00:50:29,503	00:50:31,039	| IOT213 |	We're not sure if
EDL	00:50:31,551	00:50:33,343	| IOT213 |	Anymore because
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:35,135	| IOT213 |	BSR services
EDL	00:50:35,647	00:50:36,415	| IOT213 |	Dad
EDL	00:50:36,415	00:50:37,695	| IOT213 |	Are essential
EDL	00:50:37,695	00:50:38,975	| IOT213 |	Functionalities
EDL	00:50:38,975	00:50:39,999	| IOT213 |	All iot devices
EDL	00:50:40,511	00:50:42,559	| IOT213 |	The same case goes with smart TVs
EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:46,143	| IOT213 |	We tried blocking some of the actual names in smart TVs
EDL	00:50:46,143	00:50:47,679	| IOT213 |	Some channels
EDL	00:50:47,679	00:50:48,447	| IOT213 |	So it is
EDL	00:50:48,959	00:50:50,495	| IOT213 |	Quite difficult to take
EDL	00:50:51,007	00:50:56,383	| IOT213 |	This point even though you know that your devices are potentially talking to data aggregators
EDL	00:50:56,383	00:50:58,431	| IOT213 |	Chinese servers
EDL	00:50:58,943	00:50:59,967	| IOT213 |	At this point
EDL	00:50:59,967	00:51:01,503	| IOT213 |	There's little you can do
EDL	00:51:03,295	00:51:04,575	| IOT213 |	Well that is demoralizing
EDL	00:51:05,343	00:51:08,415	| IOT213 |	I feel like on that note we should end this conversation
EDL	00:51:08,415	00:51:13,791	| IOT213 |	I don't know how well consumers understand this I think tools like what you guys are offering is a
EDL	00:51:13,791	00:51:14,815	| IOT213 |	Great first step to
EDL	00:51:14,815	00:51:17,887	| IOT213 |	Help them understand so I really appreciate you doing that
EDL	00:51:18,399	00:51:18,911	| IOT213 |	And
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:20,191	| IOT213 |	Coming on the show this week
