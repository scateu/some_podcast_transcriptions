EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:45,120	| IOT152 |	Because toy fair is awesome I went
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:46,400	| IOT152 |	A couple years ago
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:47,168	| IOT152 |	And I was
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,704	| IOT152 |	Prepared for like high-tech toys
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:49,984	| IOT152 |	I was not
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:52,032	| IOT152 |	Prepared for what toy fair actually is
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:52,800	| IOT152 |	It is like
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,080	| IOT152 |	Soulmate dolls
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,104	| IOT152 |	Stuffed animal
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:59,968	| IOT152 |	Very low text at the high-tech stuff was actually pretty relegated to just a few
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:01,504	| IOT152 |	100 square feet in the Javits
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,016	| IOT152 |	Vengeance
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:04,320	| IOT152 |	So it was in 2014
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,856	| IOT152 |	So very low tech industry
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:07,904	| IOT152 |	Trying to get
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,672	| IOT152 |	More high-tech
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,464	| IOT152 |	And they're doing it with matinee
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:11,744	| IOT152 |	Kevin your thoughts
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,536	| IOT152 |	Well
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:19,936	| IOT152 |	I mean I think there's there's Merit in some of these things like there's some interesting trivia type games and box games that
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:20,704	| IOT152 |	Add some smarts
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:26,080	| IOT152 |	But for the younger crowd I just worried about
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:28,128	| IOT152 |	They always listening type
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:34,016	| IOT152 |	Microphone stuff and kids privacy we seen so many connected toys for this has been an issue
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:36,832	| IOT152 |	Those were smaller companies Amazon
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:41,952	| IOT152 |	Maybe they were protecting their databases and servers and so on as much as Amazon does but still
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:43,232	| IOT152 |	I went a little when I hear about
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:47,840	| IOT152 |	And to be fair these are companies like Mattel and Hasbro building the sin
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:51,424	| IOT152 |	Using Amazon stuff it I think actually
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:54,496	| IOT152 |	Amazon as opposed to having them do it themselves
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,776	| IOT152 |	Tell me the smarter move because
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:58,336	| IOT152 |	I feel like both Hasbro Mattel it had some
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,872	| IOT152 |	Issues were they
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:01,408	| IOT152 |	I didn't think all this technology
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:03,712	| IOT152 |	So
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:07,040	| IOT152 |	And I kind of like the idea of adding
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:07,808	| IOT152 |	Some of these
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,088	| IOT152 |	Gaming Elliman
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,112	| IOT152 |	It's to the ecobee
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,648	| IOT152 |	Because it is kind of a fun thing
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,184	| IOT152 |	To do with your kids
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,464	| IOT152 |	Like my daughter and I play
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:15,488	| IOT152 |	Would you rather
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,791	| IOT152 |	And we also play Jeopardy
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:19,839	| IOT152 |	So some of these things
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,351	| IOT152 |	Especially
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:22,655	| IOT152 |	Especially like trivia games I think
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,423	| IOT152 |	Would be fine
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:25,215	| IOT152 |	In this isn't Amazon
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,775	| IOT152 |	First for a coveted toys
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,799	| IOT152 |	Last September
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,847	| IOT152 |	The echo button
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:32,895	| IOT152 |	Which is like a $20 pair of button
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,199	| IOT152 |	You hit the button
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,991	| IOT152 |	And you're like
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,551	| IOT152 |	It's like a button in trivia so you
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:40,319	| IOT152 |	You get to go next
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:44,159	| IOT152 |	Right right they work with certain
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,439	| IOT152 |	Skills Witcher
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,719	| IOT152 |	Game oriented
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:50,559	| IOT152 |	That's a little more interactivity that less voice but still smart so yeah
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,863	| IOT152 |	I get it there aren't too many of those
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:59,007	| IOT152 |	What's 16 of those right now
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,079	| IOT152 |	I thought that already
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:06,431	| IOT152 |	The other thing is they talk about most of these being things like
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:07,455	| IOT152 |	It will play a soundtrack
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,271	| IOT152 |	I'm sorry it is so lame
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:13,599	| IOT152 |	I'm not I'm not excited about that but I would like to
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,623	| IOT152 |	Be able to interact
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,135	| IOT152 |	Morphwiz
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:16,671	| IOT152 |	Amazon
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,463	| IOT152 |	I do think if you wanted to do that though
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:22,559	| IOT152 |	You would actually want to build like a Persona 4 Madam a
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:23,583	| IOT152 |	Laker game persona
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:25,887	| IOT152 |	So
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,679	| IOT152 |	When you were playing with her
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,727	| IOT152 |	That would be great by daughters only child
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:31,007	| IOT152 |	She'd have more of a
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:34,079	| IOT152 |	It's more fun as opposed to like
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:34,591	| IOT152 |	The score
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:38,431	| IOT152 |	Right right
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,967	| IOT152 |	I thought it was interesting that the
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:44,063	| IOT152 |	Travel trivia game The Voice Originals When in Rome which is
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:44,831	| IOT152 |	This morning's choice
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:50,975	| IOT152 |	It uses voice actors for some of the questions and some effects and such and I think that's great that's a speaker
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,255	| IOT152 |	But then
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:54,047	| IOT152 |	You know
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:57,375	| IOT152 |	Maturbation keep track of the scores and provide guidance on rules but
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:03,519	| IOT152 |	That's a part of the fun of the game just and it's Dino just adding scores up and I'm not having fights with angry sandwich see that score
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,823	| IOT152 |	As opposed to just saying
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:07,871	| IOT152 |	You know you're winning 7 by 7 points
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:10,943	| IOT152 |	There's no questions asked at that you know there's no math involved
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:17,855	| IOT152 |	I guess I was thinking like when you be fun to have a monopoly arbitrator because like I don't know about you
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:20,671	| IOT152 |	When I play Monopoly with some of my friends it's like all out War
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,231	| IOT152 |	Different rules
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:25,023	| IOT152 |	House rules in Monopoly
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:27,583	| IOT152 |	So you can you can definitely see like
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:30,143	| IOT152 |	An opportunity there but then I got to take up
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:34,239	| IOT152 |	And then I'm like I don't explain to Madame about like
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:37,055	| IOT152 |	My family is like oh
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:40,383	| IOT152 |	You can you can give people instead of paying the back you can give them like
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:43,199	| IOT152 |	Returns when they land on your property
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:43,711	| IOT152 |	Wichita
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,271	| IOT152 |	I think my husband and I almost divorced over
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:52,927	| IOT152 |	Chase book this may not appeal to all our listeners but I would say the best use of a smart speaker pair with a game
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,975	| IOT152 |	What do you have the smart speaker whoever it is
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:58,303	| IOT152 |	Dungeon master in Dungeons & Dragons
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,863	| IOT152 |	Okay speaking
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:03,167	| IOT152 |	Dangerous
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:08,543	| IOT152 |	I could have been somebody either I could have just said
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,823	| IOT152 |	Speaking of matter bag but I
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,639	| IOT152 |	Play next weekend
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:17,247	| IOT152 |	Traveling it's crazy it makes me the information is reporting that
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,527	| IOT152 |	You should not take money
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,295	| IOT152 |	From
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:21,087	| IOT152 |	Amazon's Madame a fund
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:22,111	| IOT152 |	And the reason
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,903	| IOT152 |	Is because
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,927	| IOT152 |	They will screw you over
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:29,791	| IOT152 |	That's me too long didn't read version of this
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:31,071	| IOT152 |	They pulled a couple examples
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:36,447	| IOT152 |	Really the point of the story isn't don't take money from Amazon it's just that all the big
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,215	| IOT152 |	Platforms
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,519	| IOT152 |	Really trying to win
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:41,055	| IOT152 |	It's a consumer Smart Home
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,335	| IOT152 |	Consumer Hardware
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:42,847	| IOT152 |	Which means
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:45,151	| IOT152 |	They don't have time for your
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:46,431	| IOT152 |	Efforts to build an app
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:48,223	| IOT152 |	They're going to turn you into a modified hard
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,247	| IOT152 |	Fast as I can
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,039	| IOT152 |	So
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:53,599	| IOT152 |	Example what are the examples was Amazon
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:56,415	| IOT152 |	Had made an offer to buy August
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,183	| IOT152 |	Locks
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,207	| IOT152 |	Apparently end
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:58,975	| IOT152 |	August
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,999	| IOT152 |	Said
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:00,511	| IOT152 |	No
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:03,071	| IOT152 |	We don't want that and
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:05,887	| IOT152 |	Then they were like well okay fine will work with yuan
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:06,911	| IOT152 |	Amazon
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,983	| IOT152 |	Deprogram but it turned out that Amazon kind of wanted to take
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,543	| IOT152 |	The software experience away from August
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:16,383	| IOT152 |	August was like no I want to send people to my ass
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,663	| IOT152 |	Because that's what's valuable
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,943	| IOT152 |	Me neither
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:19,967	| IOT152 |	Usernames I neither
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:21,759	| IOT152 |	Data other email
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:23,807	| IOT152 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:27,903	| IOT152 |	Yeah it does and this is the danger in this race in general
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:30,207	| IOT152 |	Just before the show you drop a good example of
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:31,487	| IOT152 |	What's the Apple home app
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:36,095	| IOT152 |	That's the unified experience for a smart home and now I'm kit world
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:39,679	| IOT152 |	But all the individual apps they're still there and still install if you want them
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:42,495	| IOT152 |	But the thing is once people go to an easier CMAs
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,775	| IOT152 |	Experience of
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:48,383	| IOT152 |	Then these companies that sell the products and create the software for it
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,919	| IOT152 |	Who's out of the sufferer experience
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:55,039	| IOT152 |	Once actually Jason Johnson over in August to the Sea over dog is
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:56,575	| IOT152 |	I'm about
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,111	| IOT152 |	This sort of like
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,647	| IOT152 |	Commodification
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:02,975	| IOT152 |	And he was like you know the poor always going to send people to rap to
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,279	| IOT152 |	Things like you have to download the app
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,559	| IOT152 |	Install it to calibrate your
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:11,935	| IOT152 |	But that's that's not making that customers life
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:15,775	| IOT152 |	Isaiah Wright
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:16,799	| IOT152 |	This didn't feel great
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,823	| IOT152 |	This makes sense
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,871	| IOT152 |	The lesson to learn from this is
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,151	| IOT152 |	My God
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:23,711	| IOT152 |	If you don't have some unique and compelling a pin
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,223	| IOT152 |	I'm with you
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:28,575	| IOT152 |	A lot of the value of these things is to do not ever have to use the app
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:31,647	| IOT152 |	I mean I can't tell you how little I use my phone to control my
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:32,671	| IOT152 |	Back to devices
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:35,999	| IOT152 |	And that's great for maybe Amazon
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,023	| IOT152 |	Google
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:39,327	| IOT152 |	Music now but it's not great for
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,607	| IOT152 |	Hello sir tune
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:41,631	| IOT152 |	Any others
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:44,447	| IOT152 |	Yeah. I don't use my Wink app
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:47,775	| IOT152 |	Very much at all even though I have install my watch my phone's Etc
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:48,287	| IOT152 |	It's all voice
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:51,871	| IOT152 |	Tell me that
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:52,383	| IOT152 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:10:00,831	| IOT152 |	Gel and then the other samples when we were familiar with your other show which is Amazon had invested in nucleus which
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:01,855	| IOT152 |	Which was making an inner
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,135	| IOT152 |	Cam system using battle
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,415	| IOT152 |	And then they put out the
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:08,511	| IOT152 |	We had Jonathan Frankel on the show talking about how this
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:16,703	| IOT152 |	What yeah they can see why I can say it was not just intercom systems video conference type intercom system with a screen a display just
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,983	| IOT152 |	Like the Echo Show now has so
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:19,775	| IOT152 |	I don't blame him for being upset
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,055	| IOT152 |	Indeed RI
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,615	| IOT152 |	This is not this is
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,663	| IOT152 |	An ongoing
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:29,247	| IOT152 |	Do you want to be valuable I think you have to Center yourself around Gathering
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,295	| IOT152 |	Useful data from you
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:31,807	| IOT152 |	Your device
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:34,623	| IOT152 |	And you don't companies that do that really well
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:36,415	| IOT152 |	Please like Kenzo
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,439	| IOT152 |	Connected thermometer
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,975	| IOT152 |	Basically
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:39,999	| IOT152 |	Creating
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,047	| IOT152 |	Epidemiological
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:43,583	| IOT152 |	So close you guys
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,911	| IOT152 |	Unblock where diseases are spreading
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,191	| IOT152 |	And that kind of stuff is
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:51,263	| IOT152 |	Really compelling in the other side where I think you could get
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,543	| IOT152 |	Value is
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,311	| IOT152 |	Something like
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,847	| IOT152 |	I hesitate to even say that you love and be
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:58,943	| IOT152 |	It's really expensive in G he's going to come in and try to do very similar things
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,479	| IOT152 |	But that's something that provides
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,759	| IOT152 |	Value without
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:02,271	| IOT152 |	The app
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:05,343	| IOT152 |	But it's just so unique in the market you're like yeah okay
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:07,647	| IOT152 |	This makes sense
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:13,791	| IOT152 |	This is why everybody wants to get out of hardware and this is why we're not excited about the Netgear Arlo IPO
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,583	| IOT152 |	Why were concerned about Ring
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,119	| IOT152 |	Raising money at a
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,655	| IOT152 |	Billion dollar valuation
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,167	| IOT152 |	Just us
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,959	| IOT152 |	Realistic by the way
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:23,519	| IOT152 |	As you just heard ring is a sponsor of the show
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:24,543	| IOT152 |	In
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:26,079	| IOT152 |	Obviously does not change your opinion on anything
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:28,383	| IOT152 |	All right
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:30,431	| IOT152 |	That's the hard life for Hardware
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,967	| IOT152 |	Let's talk about something
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,991	| IOT152 |	Cool and Future
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:33,759	| IOT152 |	AC
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:36,319	| IOT152 |	There's an event this week called the international salad
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:37,343	| IOT152 |	State circuit
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:40,671	| IOT152 |	Comforts which is like the nerdiest place in the world
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:41,951	| IOT152 |	It is awesome
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,719	| IOT152 |	For people who likes
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:47,327	| IOT152 |	Imparted what team out of this was a bunch of cool new sensors
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:52,191	| IOT152 |	So when you guys probably heard about was Sony did a low-power CMAs
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:53,727	| IOT152 |	Ucmas just means
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:58,591	| IOT152 |	Manufacture a low-power image sensor that does motion detection on the scent
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:11:59,871	| IOT152 |	So basically
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,151	| IOT152 |	It's like
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,967	| IOT152 |	Something's moving it doesn't it just needs that sensor
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:05,503	| IOT152 |	And you don't need to have like
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:07,295	| IOT152 |	Crazy battery or crazy bandwidth
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,575	| IOT152 |	In Texas caviar
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:11,647	| IOT152 |	This is interesting cuz it does take
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:16,255	| IOT152 |	The need for two sensors and turn them into one you don't need a motion sensor to set as well as a camera
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,535	| IOT152 |	This has like a stack
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:19,583	| IOT152 |	Structure where one piece of it
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:23,423	| IOT152 |	Can do the detection and it doesn't through each individual pixel on the top sensor
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,983	| IOT152 |	When the pixels detect movement
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:30,591	| IOT152 |	I kind of think this some of this technology sorter used in phones today with pixel focusing features
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:35,455	| IOT152 |	It's just a way to make this cheaper and smaller
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,991	| IOT152 |	Inside of device
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:40,319	| IOT152 |	Exactly that's all you need to like change the game
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,087	| IOT152 |	Cheaper
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,111	| IOT152 |	Smaller lower power
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,439	| IOT152 |	This does the motion detection
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,743	| IOT152 |	At only one point one
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,279	| IOT152 |	Ashton Kutcher
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,303	| IOT152 |	Crazy
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:53,119	| IOT152 |	Qualcomm has there they have
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:55,167	| IOT152 |	It's an image sensor that does
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:57,983	| IOT152 |	Do like 3 to 5 machine learning models
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,775	| IOT152 |	Just the execution of them
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,311	| IOT152 |	But it can do those
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,847	| IOT152 |	Sub to milliwatts
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,711	| IOT152 |	Not this year last year
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:08,735	| IOT152 |	End
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:10,783	| IOT152 |	Talk about it okay
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:14,111	| IOT152 |	So Microsoft also showed off
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:15,647	| IOT152 |	New time of flight
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,415	| IOT152 |	Sensor
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:18,975	| IOT152 |	This is actually a type of sensor used in the lighthouse
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:20,511	| IOT152 |	Camera that we've talked about a little bit
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,559	| IOT152 |	Basically it just gets death
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:25,119	| IOT152 |	So instead of just seeing a flat picture the computer season
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:27,167	| IOT152 |	What something is based on
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:27,935	| IOT152 |	And gets a sense of death
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,215	| IOT152 |	This is
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,007	| IOT152 |	Useful for all kinds of
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:32,799	| IOT152 |	And
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:33,567	| IOT152 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,359	| IOT152 |	Basically making it
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:37,407	| IOT152 |	More accurate
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:38,431	| IOT152 |	Conception because once again
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:42,015	| IOT152 |	That's the name of the game here
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,551	| IOT152 |	So let's see what else
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:47,647	| IOT152 |	What else do we see there's a couple things I linked to anytime storage
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:49,951	| IOT152 |	Talk about this including 200
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:50,719	| IOT152 |	Meter race
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,487	| IOT152 |	Imaging
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,303	| IOT152 |	Get to Bloomberg
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,583	| IOT152 |	Which wrote this week
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:58,399	| IOT152 |	Story about how everyone will have
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,167	| IOT152 |	A smart home
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:02,239	| IOT152 |	Is this story actually disappointed me a little bit because
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:04,287	| IOT152 |	Is very much focused on the gadget
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,055	| IOT152 |	In
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:06,335	| IOT152 |	I don't know about you Kevin but
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:09,407	| IOT152 |	I have so many smart gadgets but I still have a very dumb hole
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,455	| IOT152 |	So I don't really
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,735	| IOT152 |	Appreciate that
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:17,599	| IOT152 |	Every ship like the idea that guess we're all good except these gadgets to make our lives easier and better but I don't
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:25,535	| IOT152 |	I totally agree I said this for a while now I've had a lot of smart home devices in my house but that the data is not used
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,815	| IOT152 |	Contextually and together
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,863	| IOT152 |	Home itself has not yet smart
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:29,887	| IOT152 |	And so
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:34,751	| IOT152 |	I think we're getting there and I think we're seeing the Growing Pains of that obviously with
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:35,775	| IOT152 |	These stories like
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,823	| IOT152 |	Don't let Amazon invest in your startup
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:41,919	| IOT152 |	Bloomberg appreciate you highlighting a lot of relief
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:45,247	| IOT152 |	They're on the same page as us with basic
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:47,551	| IOT152 |	What things have to be
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:48,575	| IOT152 |	Provide additional
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:49,343	| IOT152 |	Function they can't just be
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,135	| IOT152 |	For no reason
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:51,903	| IOT152 |	Or for just room
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:54,719	| IOT152 |	Okay let's
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:56,767	| IOT152 |	Do the news Rundown
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,047	| IOT152 |	Last week
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,583	| IOT152 |	Google bus idly and Kevin
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:00,863	| IOT152 |	Has something to say
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:04,959	| IOT152 |	I had something to write actually I put a blog post up late last week after
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,495	| IOT152 |	For thinking about the whole
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,775	| IOT152 |	Intent to purchase
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:08,799	| IOT152 |	Google isn't
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,823	| IOT152 |	How to purchase thyroid
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:13,151	| IOT152 |	You know we talked Stacy you and I talked about the
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:15,967	| IOT152 |	Google's iot strategy marketing message
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:18,015	| IOT152 |	Platform save tools a few weeks back
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:18,783	| IOT152 |	And said
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:19,807	| IOT152 |	Its competitors
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,575	| IOT152 |	Talamore
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:22,367	| IOT152 |	Helen cohesive end-to-end story
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,415	| IOT152 |	So the purchases Island
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:31,327	| IOT152 |	Actually will help Google because I really has a very compelling end-to-end story to talk about why you should connect your products
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:37,215	| IOT152 |	Why and how you should connect your product how do you create business value save a whole business process Services team
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:39,519	| IOT152 |	To help people go from prototype
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:41,567	| IOT152 |	Two incomplete projects
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:43,871	| IOT152 |	And I don't see that at Google so
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,919	| IOT152 |	Google's going to get that Google's going to get
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,687	| IOT152 |	Zaxby's
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:53,087	| IOT152 |	Existing customer base of which Lutron is I did not know that fact I took Lutron Just 4 months of working as I wait to get there
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:53,855	| IOT152 |	Products connected
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:54,623	| IOT152 |	Which is
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:59,999	| IOT152 |	Super impressive if you ask me how long does it take Google to do that I can't even name a company that's done that with Google yet
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:00,767	| IOT152 |	I don't know
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:04,351	| IOT152 |	I believe there's 45 employees from zyber that will also become
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:08,191	| IOT152 |	Google says well so I was getting a lot of smarts a lot of
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:09,727	| IOT152 |	Experienced a lot of business
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:12,543	| IOT152 |	This process management when it comes to iot
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:15,615	| IOT152 |	And I think it's a great idea for them to do this a lot of
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:19,711	| IOT152 |	People wear poo poo in his whole deal with a lot of an adolescent like you understand
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:22,271	| IOT152 |	The whole story here so that that was my thought
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:28,415	| IOT152 |	And does Ivory and I have no idea how many people are still there and how much of the original platform is
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:31,743	| IOT152 |	But when seikaly started out it started out
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:34,047	| IOT152 |	Basically in mm
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:34,815	| IOT152 |	8
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:37,375	| IOT152 |	So way before it was very forward-looking
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:40,191	| IOT152 |	In the biggest thing you probably would have
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:41,983	| IOT152 |	Recognized it was called patchbay
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:45,823	| IOT152 |	And it did radiation monitoring in Japan
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:46,591	| IOT152 |	And after the
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:49,663	| IOT152 |	Big earthquake in the nuclear disaster
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:56,319	| IOT152 |	Fukushima is at Fukushima that sounds right now they actually had a crowdsourced
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,087	| IOT152 |	Radiation
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:58,879	| IOT152 |	Pittsfield
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:16:59,903	| IOT152 |	Very Google
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,439	| IOT152 |	Fairy Lake
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,207	| IOT152 |	We are Tech
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:05,791	| IOT152 |	Where is we want to try to change the world we're going to build
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:09,375	| IOT152 |	Some crazy platform and just have people crowdsourced stuff on it
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:09,887	| IOT152 |	It just
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,959	| IOT152 |	That's his Heritage so what
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:14,751	| IOT152 |	Feels like not only do they have a
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:17,311	| IOT152 |	Telling story but it came from a very Google
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:20,639	| IOT152 |	That sounds it's a good fit
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:22,687	| IOT152 |	Okay other news
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,735	| IOT152 |	This elicited 204
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,503	| IOT152 |	Kevin so
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,271	| IOT152 |	Kevin
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:32,671	| IOT152 |	Yeah that was really really impressed by this is another Google thing and has to do with machine learning where I'm sorry artificial
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,183	| IOT152 |	Intelligence
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,975	| IOT152 |	Google Verity
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,767	| IOT152 |	Which is their health
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:39,327	| IOT152 |	Osteria they are able to
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:41,375	| IOT152 |	Take retina scans from eyes
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:44,447	| IOT152 |	And determine with 70% of the time
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:45,983	| IOT152 |	Accuracy
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:49,823	| IOT152 |	If you're going to have a cardiovascular event heart disease issue
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:53,151	| IOT152 |	And the way they do this is they scanned
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:53,919	| IOT152 |	Old
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:54,943	| IOT152 |	Retinas
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:57,247	| IOT152 |	Look for patterns that isn't there AI
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,271	| IOT152 |	And then check
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:00,319	| IOT152 |	The results of the AI predictions against
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:01,599	| IOT152 |	People
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:04,927	| IOT152 |	Five years later or within five years did have health issues that's how they taught it
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:07,487	| IOT152 |	And that's actually amazing because
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,535	| IOT152 |	To do that today
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:12,607	| IOT152 |	The method requires a blood test and so on
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,887	| IOT152 |	It only is
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,935	| IOT152 |	Accurate 72% of the time
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:20,287	| IOT152 |	So with a i and retinal scanning is almost as accurate as blood test
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,567	| IOT152 |	That's it
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,615	| IOT152 |	That is and
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:25,663	| IOT152 |	It ties into two things one is
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:27,967	| IOT152 |	When people are talking about health
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,735	| IOT152 |	Data
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,759	| IOT152 |	I think it's really important
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,039	| IOT152 |	We talked about
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,319	| IOT152 |	Like electronic records
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:35,135	| IOT152 |	I think I could become increasingly important for
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,159	| IOT152 |	Training
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:37,695	| IOT152 |	Do you have to have
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,207	| IOT152 |	Both
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:41,791	| IOT152 |	Potato that you're looking at but you also have to know that diagnose
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:43,071	| IOT152 |	Gnosis or what have
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,095	| IOT152 |	Listen to the patient
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,375	| IOT152 |	It says you're going to need them or
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:47,167	| IOT152 |	Picture to get these
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:49,471	| IOT152 |	That's why we see a lot of x-ray
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,751	| IOT152 |	Kind of AI efforts
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:51,775	| IOT152 |	Because that's like
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:52,799	| IOT152 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:57,919	| IOT152 |	Or that person is having a stroke but some of these other things
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:58,943	| IOT152 |	School requirements
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,711	| IOT152 |	Longitudinal
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,015	| IOT152 |	A patient over a p
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:03,807	| IOT152 |	Right
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:07,647	| IOT152 |	Just related I actually just yesterday joined the Stanford heart
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,951	| IOT152 |	Study program through my Apple watch
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,743	| IOT152 |	So I'm confirming my own
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:14,303	| IOT152 |	Heart rate data to that program which is the one where they can
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,607	| IOT152 |	Predict if you're going to have health issues or heart issues
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,143	| IOT152 |	All right
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,423	| IOT152 |	Maybe one day we'll see her
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:22,495	| IOT152 |	I'm gay
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,519	| IOT152 |	This is for me
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,543	| IOT152 |	Why is Cam
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:28,127	| IOT152 |	So they're launching a second wyze cam I got an email last week saying hey
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:31,199	| IOT152 |	You got your first wife campuses the $20 camera that we
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:35,551	| IOT152 |	And apparently a bunch of you guys were really into it cuz a lot of
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:37,087	| IOT152 |	I don't know if y'all bought one
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:38,879	| IOT152 |	I really enjoyed mine
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,159	| IOT152 |	Superfine
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:40,927	| IOT152 |	And
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:44,767	| IOT152 |	It's like disposable because it twenty bucks it does a lot of good stuff
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,559	| IOT152 |	Second one's coming
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:51,167	| IOT152 |	And they're getting an ifta integration integration
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:53,215	| IOT152 |	Coming up which is what they said they would do
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:20:01,407	| IOT152 |	Yeah if you have a show for example you be able to say Madam a show my wyzecam excetera new
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,175	| IOT152 |	Stream at 4.
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,479	| IOT152 |	It is and
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,015	| IOT152 |	I'm not sure what day is it
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:07,551	| IOT152 |	Functionality will provide
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:09,087	| IOT152 |	So that's what
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:13,439	| IOT152 |	You don't know what this new one has motion tagging a better sensor
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:17,023	| IOT152 |	Still the same price
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:18,047	| IOT152 |	It's crazy
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,863	| IOT152 |	These guys
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:24,447	| IOT152 |	For Amazon people their whole model is to
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:24,959	| IOT152 |	To sell something
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:27,775	| IOT152 |	Barest minimum margins they can it's just sell
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:30,079	| IOT152 |	We'll see how that works out for
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:32,383	| IOT152 |	Hey we are commodities
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,151	| IOT152 |	Accepted
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:34,943	| IOT152 |	Duvin design your product for that reality
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:37,503	| IOT152 |	All right and do you need
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:38,527	| IOT152 |	Madam
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:39,039	| IOT152 |	In your car
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,319	| IOT152 |	I don't
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:44,927	| IOT152 |	I would just talk to my phone or carplay or Android auto
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:49,279	| IOT152 |	Your car is still that maybe don't have Bluetooth or USB ports and whatnot so
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:55,167	| IOT152 |	The Wirecutter said hey if you need madhumeh in your car there's a number of plug-ins at you
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:55,935	| IOT152 |	You could get
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:59,007	| IOT152 |	Like 60 bucks or so
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:01,055	| IOT152 |	They ran through all of them
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:03,871	| IOT152 |	I think the general take on this was he here they are
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:07,967	| IOT152 |	They're okay they really need it I don't know
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:09,759	| IOT152 |	Do they link to
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:12,575	| IOT152 |	I would imagine they'd have to
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:14,879	| IOT152 |	Did you have a subscription or
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:17,184	| IOT152 |	Yeah I know it's you it's is probably it would choose
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:20,768	| IOT152 |	To the phones again I guess you should just use Google Assistant
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:23,328	| IOT152 |	You can use your phone
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:28,448	| IOT152 |	If you have a matinee happening and she's always listening on your phone sometimes do have that built in now so
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:32,544	| IOT152 |	I don't see the need for an atom but again I have a newer car that has
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:35,104	| IOT152 |	No carplay and Android auto my choice so
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:36,896	| IOT152 |	I can just speak to the car
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:38,432	| IOT152 |	As opposed to plugging in a little
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:40,992	| IOT152 |	Gadget taking up another spot
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:43,040	| IOT152 |	If you do have some gadgets
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:45,600	| IOT152 |	I think you're testing a camera system
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:47,392	| IOT152 |	I am
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,672	| IOT152 |	Will have more
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,720	| IOT152 |	Reminder Kevin
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:51,488	| IOT152 |	Homework
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:55,840	| IOT152 |	Also cars
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,864	| IOT152 |	Alphabet song
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:59,936	| IOT152 |	Getting a little closer to having a self-driving
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:02,240	| IOT152 |	How long will it be till we're riding around
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:08,384	| IOT152 |	I don't think it's going to be too much longer we knew that waymo was testing there
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,152	| IOT152 |	Sweet of
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:11,456	| IOT152 |	Self-driving cars in the Phoenix area
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:14,784	| IOT152 |	And what they've done now is they have gotten
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,808	| IOT152 |	Approval
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:18,624	| IOT152 |	To operate as a TNC in Arizona
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:21,184	| IOT152 |	Which TNC is a transportation Network company
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:23,744	| IOT152 |	That allows them to legally charge for rides
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:26,560	| IOT152 |	So at this point from a legislative standpoint it
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:32,704	| IOT152 |	It's kind of like they got their ducks in a row there because Arizona is one of the more liberal states when it comes to self driving car testing now.
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:33,984	| IOT152 |	Okay
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:35,264	| IOT152 |	These guys to Paisley
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:37,824	| IOT152 |	Take on the Ubers in the lift some song with us
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:38,848	| IOT152 |	With WeMo
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:39,616	| IOT152 |	Self-driving
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:40,384	| IOT152 |	You can charge money
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,688	| IOT152 |	All right
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:44,224	| IOT152 |	And now for something totally
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:47,040	| IOT152 |	I have recently been testing
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,576	| IOT152 |	Bicycle Domingo
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:50,368	| IOT152 |	Mirror and this is
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,136	| IOT152 |	This is America
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:58,816	| IOT152 |	This is a mirror that has a 7-inch display in it and you can
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,584	| IOT152 |	Basically
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:02,400	| IOT152 |	You basically program widgets and all the widgets are pretty
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,168	| IOT152 |	HealthWorks
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,216	| IOT152 |	Weather in
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:07,776	| IOT152 |	News oriented so it's it's like
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:08,800	| IOT152 |	Dashboard interior
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,616	| IOT152 |	And I program
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:12,384	| IOT152 |	Mine with
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:15,200	| IOT152 |	Yeah I connected it to my Fitbit
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:17,248	| IOT152 |	You can also connect to an Apple watch
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:18,528	| IOT152 |	And the deuce things
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:23,392	| IOT152 |	Are some unlimited that I found lots of things I have the Virgin Wall Street Journal
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:24,928	| IOT152 |	I want to see the BBC
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:28,256	| IOT152 |	What's cool about this mirror
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,536	| IOT152 |	Where is wenzhou
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:31,072	| IOT152 |	You can set a general settings
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,352	| IOT152 |	And then you said
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:33,632	| IOT152 |	Your own personal
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:36,960	| IOT152 |	What is it does it takes the information from your
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,264	| IOT152 |	This is only your iPhone for now
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,032	| IOT152 |	But your phone
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:41,568	| IOT152 |	And it
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:45,408	| IOT152 |	This is Stacy's phone so I'm going to show her dashboard
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:47,968	| IOT152 |	Can see Mike my Twitter
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:50,784	| IOT152 |	And it's nice because it it's personalized
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,320	| IOT152 |	To an extent
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,856	| IOT152 |	You have to get within about
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:54,624	| IOT152 |	4 feet
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:56,416	| IOT152 |	You can change the rain gif
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,952	| IOT152 |	If you want to before feet felt
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,720	| IOT152 |	About right
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:23:59,488	| IOT152 |	So people didn't
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,536	| IOT152 |	Set it off while they were walking by
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:05,632	| IOT152 |	And every other time when people walk by
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:06,656	| IOT152 |	It just shows you
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:07,936	| IOT152 |	Like the weather
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:08,960	| IOT152 |	Which also is nice
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:14,336	| IOT152 |	It reminds me a lot of it first came out
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:16,640	| IOT152 |	Text information is personalized
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:19,968	| IOT152 |	But this obviously Idaho health component because of you said you connected
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:21,248	| IOT152 |	Did your Fitbit so you can get
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:22,784	| IOT152 |	Your statistics on
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:26,112	| IOT152 |	Wigs body mass steps and so on and so forth for the day
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,392	| IOT152 |	I love that it's
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:28,672	| IOT152 |	A multi-user.
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,440	| IOT152 |	Display
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:30,976	| IOT152 |	Although for the iPhone
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:33,280	| IOT152 |	I think I'd only works with iPhone as you said
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:36,864	| IOT152 |	Nobody my house character phone saying to the bathroom which is typically what I would see this
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:39,424	| IOT152 |	Part of this
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:40,960	| IOT152 |	So how practical is
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:41,472	| IOT152 |	First off
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:44,288	| IOT152 |	Comes in two sizes there's a regular 24
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:49,152	| IOT152 |	$500
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:49,920	| IOT152 |	So this is not cheap
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,456	| IOT152 |	And then there's a
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:54,528	| IOT152 |	32 High by 24 wide which is what
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,320	| IOT152 |	600
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,880	| IOT152 |	Initially I stuck it in the bath
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:24:59,648	| IOT152 |	But that's
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,928	| IOT152 |	I was like I never have my phone
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:04,000	| IOT152 |	So I was just getting the generic
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:04,768	| IOT152 |	What's playing
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:05,536	| IOT152 |	That felt like that
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,352	| IOT152 |	To the hallway
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,144	| IOT152 |	In there
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,168	| IOT152 |	People pass by
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:11,936	| IOT152 |	That's good
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:13,728	| IOT152 |	The other Flipside
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:14,496	| IOT152 |	Is
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,520	| IOT152 |	If you have a child
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:18,080	| IOT152 |	Again they're not carrying a phone
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,104	| IOT152 |	They don't exist for this
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:21,408	| IOT152 |	And you know it
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:23,200	| IOT152 |	It in the hallway
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,736	| IOT152 |	Can see like how many calories I consume
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:28,064	| IOT152 |	I can't remember if I put that in there they can read my Twitter feed
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:30,112	| IOT152 |	So there's trade-offs
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,904	| IOT152 |	And the other the final thing is
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:33,440	| IOT152 |	Do you really need this
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:34,720	| IOT152 |	Yeah probably
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:36,768	| IOT152 |	What it is fun
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:38,560	| IOT152 |	Yeah I mean it when you're away from your phone
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:45,472	| IOT152 |	You're in the bathroom your brush your teeth, to her whatever it is do you need that if you needed that you probably bring your phone in with you and stay right
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:46,496	| IOT152 |	Read it while you're doing yourself
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:49,824	| IOT152 |	But it is nice that's why I
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:51,360	| IOT152 |	Actually one of my most common bathroom
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:53,920	| IOT152 |	What's the weather today
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:55,456	| IOT152 |	So
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:58,016	| IOT152 |	I think it's kind of like whatever user interface works for you
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:01,088	| IOT152 |	Senior Lifestyle
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:03,136	| IOT152 |	And it does I asked if they would ever use
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:05,440	| IOT152 |	Something like the Fitbit cuz I wear that in the bathroom
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:07,744	| IOT152 |	They're taking my identity
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,536	| IOT152 |	Turn bluetooth reset that Fitbit has
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:13,120	| IOT152 |	Security things so they they aren't they may one day do it though for the Apple watch
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:14,656	| IOT152 |	So Kevin
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:15,424	| IOT152 |	You
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,704	| IOT152 |	Get Lucky
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:19,008	| IOT152 |	I have the darndest time
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,288	| IOT152 |	Keeping the sky up
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,312	| IOT152 |	Because I am on
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:23,104	| IOT152 |	Eero Wi-Fi
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:25,664	| IOT152 |	It does not that's only 2.4 gigahertz
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:27,456	| IOT152 |	Band for Wi-Fi and so
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:31,552	| IOT152 |	It would basically whenever my network was like you should try to fight it
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:32,832	| IOT152 |	Just drop off the den
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:35,136	| IOT152 |	It was intermittent and pain
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:38,208	| IOT152 |	I know you can't see me but I'm shaking my head back and forth
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:41,536	| IOT152 |	In frustration because so many of these types of devices are
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:43,072	| IOT152 |	Single bands and the
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:43,840	| IOT152 |	Do not
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:45,120	| IOT152 |	They were not designed with Mesh networking
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:47,424	| IOT152 |	It is very frustrating for you.

EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,968	| IOT152 |	This week's
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:32,736	| IOT152 |	Question
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:33,760	| IOT152 |	IStation Kevin
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,832	| IOT152 |	Questions /
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:38,880	| IOT152 |	Is
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:43,744	| IOT152 |	How in my case with multiple Google home devices in Android device
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:46,816	| IOT152 |	Don't have an iPhone
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:47,584	| IOT152 |	Courtesy of work
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:49,632	| IOT152 |	Not wanting to carry two phones
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:51,936	| IOT152 |	Really trying
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:52,960	| IOT152 |	Transition
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:55,776	| IOT152 |	2 using iPhone with all these other devices
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,800	| IOT152 |	And it's a struggle
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,592	| IOT152 |	Similar to Stacy's
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:00,896	| IOT152 |	Switch from Alexa
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,408	| IOT152 |	2
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,968	| IOT152 |	Any tips on
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,992	| IOT152 |	Interacting better
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:06,784	| IOT152 |	Appreciated
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,600	| IOT152 |	Thanks Kevin
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:11,648	| IOT152 |	That is an excellent question
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:16,768	| IOT152 |	Better question for our very own Kevin to answer because he actually lives in a house
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:17,792	| IOT152 |	Acts like what you're describing
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:23,936	| IOT152 |	Exactly exactly how use just for reference I'm generalizing a Google pixelbook
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:25,216	| IOT152 |	For my main computer
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:25,984	| IOT152 |	I have
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:29,056	| IOT152 |	Google homes in here various sizes and kinds
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:31,616	| IOT152 |	I have an Android TV
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:35,968	| IOT152 |	Which is also Chromecast capable and so I answered in the same boat
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,552	| IOT152 |	And it might be challenging during the transition
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:40,832	| IOT152 |	Kevin but I don't think it's
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,880	| IOT152 |	Long-term an issue and then here's what I say that
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,952	| IOT152 |	Just about everything I do from a voice standpoint
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:50,304	| IOT152 |	I'm signed into my Google account so the Google homes work obviously just fine the iPhones not affect
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:52,352	| IOT152 |	You can install the
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:55,936	| IOT152 |	Google home app on your iPhone to manage it and so on so that's useful
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:29:02,848	| IOT152 |	One trick is to install the Google assistant app for iOS on my iPhone
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:04,128	| IOT152 |	That will give you a piece lyrics
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:08,480	| IOT152 |	System capabilities with the easiest way that I found to get to that since you can't make that a default
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:09,504	| IOT152 |	Listening agent
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,528	| IOT152 |	An iPhone
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:13,856	| IOT152 |	Is to install the widget on your iPhone
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:15,136	| IOT152 |	And what that does is
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:20,768	| IOT152 |	Simple slide over from your home screen and you can just tap the microphone button and then say the hot word for Google
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:23,584	| IOT152 |	And there you go you have access to
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:25,376	| IOT152 |	Ashlee Simpson everything from an iPhone
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:29,472	| IOT152 |	As far as other information I mean I can Chromecast things from
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,824	| IOT152 |	Generally not a problem some apps.
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:35,872	| IOT152 |	Still supported the most of them do
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:39,200	| IOT152 |	So it's really not too bad again ice cream from
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:42,016	| IOT152 |	Play iPad to an Android TV with no problem so
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:47,904	| IOT152 |	It might seem frustrating because you can't make Google Assistant the primary listening agent on your phone
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:49,952	| IOT152 |	But you can always do the widget after install the app
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:51,488	| IOT152 |	I'm going to say yes
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,280	| IOT152 |	Because I do not have an iPhone
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:56,096	| IOT152 |	What he said
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,120	| IOT152 |	Kevin Spacey
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:58,400	| IOT152 |	That's why he's on the show
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:59,168	| IOT152 |	All right
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:00,448	| IOT152 |	Well

EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:20,832	| IOT152 |	I'm great thanks Daisy
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:24,928	| IOT152 |	Man I could ask for this
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:26,976	| IOT152 |	We are going to talk about
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:28,000	| IOT152 |	Digital ID
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,328	| IOT152 |	It's the new new thing
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:32,864	| IOT152 |	The new old thing
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:39,520	| IOT152 |	You think I don't know it's been around for a while but it is getting increasingly complicated which is what we are going to talk about
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:40,288	| IOT152 |	So
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:41,056	| IOT152 |	Quick
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:43,104	| IOT152 |	Talk to me about your background
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:44,384	| IOT152 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:44,896	| IOT152 |	Digital identity
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:49,248	| IOT152 |	Absolutely so you know I've actually been doing digital identity and
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:52,576	| IOT152 |	Access management forano 15 plus years
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,112	| IOT152 |	Used to be about
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:58,976	| IOT152 |	Web applications and then we entered the API economy
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:02,048	| IOT152 |	When it was all about mobile applications and getting them to work
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:04,608	| IOT152 |	And now in the iot economy
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,888	| IOT152 |	Which grew out of the API
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:06,656	| IOT152 |	Economy
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:08,960	| IOT152 |	It's more important than ever because we have to worry about
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:09,728	| IOT152 |	Device identity
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:14,592	| IOT152 |	And application identities and identities of piles of data
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:17,152	| IOT152 |	And identities of people all interacting
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:18,688	| IOT152 |	Each other
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,456	| IOT152 |	Let's
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,736	| IOT152 |	Talk about
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:22,528	| IOT152 |	This concept of personas
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:23,296	| IOT152 |	Because this is
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:25,088	| IOT152 |	This is what I run into
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:26,112	| IOT152 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:30,976	| IOT152 |	I have devices that I a certain people before the internet of things this was even be
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:33,536	| IOT152 |	An issue which is I have
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,816	| IOT152 |	My sense of self
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:36,352	| IOT152 |	Like IM Stacy and I am always stays
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:40,192	| IOT152 |	Actually I'm not always Stacy when I'm
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:41,984	| IOT152 |	At work versus what I'm hanging out with me
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,264	| IOT152 |	Prince and so
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:45,312	| IOT152 |	We think about that as personas
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:49,152	| IOT152 |	Talk to me about the different kind of personas that people can have
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:51,968	| IOT152 |	And then we'll kind of talk about how we should be thinking about dealing
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:53,760	| IOT152 |	Yeah indeed
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:55,040	| IOT152 |	So
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:33:00,672	| IOT152 |	There's some advocates in the world of digital identity and gentlemen vendors for example
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:05,792	| IOT152 |	Google say well you should really have it exactly one identity digital identity that you bring
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:07,584	| IOT152 |	To every digital service
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:09,120	| IOT152 |	Every device
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:09,888	| IOT152 |	PetSmart
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:14,240	| IOT152 |	We do live our lives presenting different facets of ourselves
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:15,264	| IOT152 |	Two different
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:17,312	| IOT152 |	Circles of people and different services
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:19,616	| IOT152 |	So you know you have a work-life
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:20,896	| IOT152 |	I found home life and you might not
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:22,944	| IOT152 |	Sail the same thing
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:24,224	| IOT152 |	Stall those same circles
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:27,552	| IOT152 |	In fact it was quite revolutionary when Facebook started
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:33,696	| IOT152 |	And try to get everybody to present the same face to everybody in there some researchers that kind of proved there was an article about this
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:36,256	| IOT152 |	Pointing out that researchers proved
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:40,096	| IOT152 |	That it's maybe not such a good idea to present the same face to everybody in
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:44,192	| IOT152 |	Maybe even reuse your Facebook login account your identity
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:45,216	| IOT152 |	To every other server
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:47,008	| IOT152 |	This is what we call social sign in
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:48,544	| IOT152 |	Now where you can reuse
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:49,568	| IOT152 |	A social
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:51,616	| IOT152 |	Identity provided by Facebook
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:52,896	| IOT152 |	Forever
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:54,176	| IOT152 |	At other services
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:55,712	| IOT152 |	Although it's quite convenient
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:56,992	| IOT152 |	Pattern to reuse
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:59,040	| IOT152 |	Your social login elsewhere
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:00,064	| IOT152 |	Leveraging it
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:01,344	| IOT152 |	At these other services
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:05,952	| IOT152 |	Means that you're actually sharing is not just sharing a credential as we just defined it
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:07,744	| IOT152 |	But you're shining quite a lot of data
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:09,024	| IOT152 |	That comes with that
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:13,888	| IOT152 |	With that relying party service
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:17,728	| IOT152 |	Fraid so yeah but not privacy-preserving so much
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:20,288	| IOT152 |	So right so it's not just that
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:22,592	| IOT152 |	Like oh my gosh I want a different
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:24,640	| IOT152 |	My boss doesn't see me partying on the weekend
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,920	| IOT152 |	But it's also
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:32,320	| IOT152 |	That maybe I don't want Facebook to have access to like every recipe that I've downloaded using my Facebook identity is
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:33,856	| IOT152 |	Login for that site or
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:38,976	| IOT152 |	And their real-world consequences I mean I actually know somebody who was
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:42,304	| IOT152 |	You know considering taking a job with being considered for a job
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:44,352	| IOT152 |	Add a health-related company
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:45,888	| IOT152 |	And when they saw that he like
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:46,912	| IOT152 |	Posting recipes
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:48,448	| IOT152 |	Cocktail which is very good at
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:50,240	| IOT152 |	They actually we're not so interested in
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:53,056	| IOT152 |	Which is kind of creepy if you think about it
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:53,824	| IOT152 |	Yes
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:54,848	| IOT152 |	Especially
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:56,640	| IOT152 |	Recipes
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:57,408	| IOT152 |	It's really means
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:35:02,784	| IOT152 |	Doesn't prove how much you drink even but if you're over a certain age
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:04,320	| IOT152 |	Okay
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:06,112	| IOT152 |	Maybe he shouldn't work
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:07,392	| IOT152 |	Actually
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:10,464	| IOT152 |	Shut up
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:11,488	| IOT152 |	Okay
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:13,280	| IOT152 |	So there's fat ass
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:15,328	| IOT152 |	And now let's take it to
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:16,352	| IOT152 |	The device level
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:17,120	| IOT152 |	Because
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:20,448	| IOT152 |	What's nice about Facebook is it is my Facebook
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:22,496	| IOT152 |	But when I start
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:24,288	| IOT152 |	Dealing with shared devices like
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,824	| IOT152 |	My car
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:28,896	| IOT152 |	If I have other people in my household use it or let a friend borrow it
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:31,200	| IOT152 |	Tickets to devices it gets a little weird
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:35,040	| IOT152 |	So what does that look like now and how should we start
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:37,856	| IOT152 |	This is where
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:39,392	| IOT152 |	We start thinking about
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:42,208	| IOT152 |	Call identity relationship management
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:42,976	| IOT152 |	Talked about
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:47,328	| IOT152 |	That there are no people identities and there are actually
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:49,120	| IOT152 |	Mobile device identity
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:51,168	| IOT152 |	You know my phone actually has a unique ID
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:52,960	| IOT152 |	And they're actually identities
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:55,008	| IOT152 |	For each of the applications on my phone
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:55,776	| IOT152 |	And
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:58,336	| IOT152 |	Your average car has a lot of identities
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:00,128	| IOT152 |	The car itself has an identity
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:01,152	| IOT152 |	Each of the sensors
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,688	| IOT152 |	In a connected car
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:04,480	| IOT152 |	And there's a lot of them
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:05,760	| IOT152 |	Has a unique identity
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:06,528	| IOT152 |	And
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:07,808	| IOT152 |	An owner of a car
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:08,832	| IOT152 |	Has one identity
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:10,368	| IOT152 |	Each of the drivers of a car
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:16,512	| IOT152 |	Cookie money has my identity each of the passengers of the car and when you talk about the scenarios today of
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:18,560	| IOT152 |	Let's say somebody driving down the highway
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:20,608	| IOT152 |	And having your average
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:22,912	| IOT152 |	You know EZ Pass or something like that
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:28,032	| IOT152 |	Which is connected with a payment instrument so that they can you know easily get charged tolls
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,312	| IOT152 |	Well
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:31,872	| IOT152 |	Now you've got somebody being surveilled on the highway
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:35,968	| IOT152 |	Or you have a fleet vehicle and you've got a police officer
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:38,272	| IOT152 |	Has been assigned a fleet vehicle for their shift
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:39,040	| IOT152 |	And you have another voice
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:40,576	| IOT152 |	Are coming onto the next shift
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:43,648	| IOT152 |	Neither real life scenarios pretty much today
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:48,512	| IOT152 |	You want to have the right data being generated about them or the right payments flowing about them
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:50,816	| IOT152 |	For each time that you have
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:52,352	| IOT152 |	Particular driver
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,120	| IOT152 |	Store owner
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:55,168	| IOT152 |	Associated with the car
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:56,448	| IOT152 |	That period of time
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:58,240	| IOT152 |	And then a disassociation
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,008	| IOT152 |	To happen
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:00,288	| IOT152 |	At the right time again
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,568	| IOT152 |	So this is why I talked about
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:02,336	| IOT152 |	Identity
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:03,872	| IOT152 |	Relationship management
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:05,664	| IOT152 |	So that there's a bringing together
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:06,944	| IOT152 |	OD identities
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:08,224	| IOT152 |	Practical purposes
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:10,272	| IOT152 |	Angular use cases at the right time
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:11,040	| IOT152 |	I'm going to disassociate
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:14,112	| IOT152 |	Okay and we just saw the disassociation
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:15,136	| IOT152 |	When is failing
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:17,696	| IOT152 |	International Airport in February
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:20,000	| IOT152 |	Talking about how right now when
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:20,768	| IOT152 |	Peopleconnect
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:24,096	| IOT152 |	Their phones to their rental cars basically all that.
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:24,864	| IOT152 |	Just stays there
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:28,192	| IOT152 |	Is no one on your rental car takes it away
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:29,216	| IOT152 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:32,032	| IOT152 |	So that's just an example of
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:33,312	| IOT152 |	The lack of disassociation
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:34,592	| IOT152 |	How should that
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:37,920	| IOT152 |	Happen where does The Purge from the device and the backend servers
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:41,760	| IOT152 |	Well one of the ways that I think would be
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:45,344	| IOT152 |	Super powerful to do this is actually and I talked about relationships
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:48,416	| IOT152 |	Sometimes the best way to think of this is to actually look at
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:50,208	| IOT152 |	Technology like graph databases
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:52,768	| IOT152 |	And you know that's actually a very
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:53,792	| IOT152 |	Powerful
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:55,584	| IOT152 |	And performant way to manage relations
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:57,632	| IOT152 |	I'll give an example
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:37:59,424	| IOT152 |	Thinking about smart home devices
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:00,448	| IOT152 |	Let's say you got
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:07,872	| IOT152 |	Now you're smart dishwasher and you kaieteur smart light bulbs and you got a whole bunch of things made by a bunch of different manufacturers
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:11,712	| IOT152 |	You might have a part of your home that you rent out
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:13,248	| IOT152 |	2 something like Airbnb renters
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:15,296	| IOT152 |	And you got family members
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:18,624	| IOT152 |	She's got somebody coming to the family cuz they married in something like that
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:20,160	| IOT152 |	And what you want to do is
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:21,184	| IOT152 |	What we would call
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:22,976	| IOT152 |	Constrain delegated Act
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:23,744	| IOT152 |	Access
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:25,280	| IOT152 |	To certain parties
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:26,048	| IOT152 |	Like
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:27,584	| IOT152 |	Cruising Airbnb renter
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:28,864	| IOT152 |	Today
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:29,632	| IOT152 |	And
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:30,400	| IOT152 |	Kruse family
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:35,520	| IOT152 |	So those are relationships that could start to sort of creeped out into the world and
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:36,544	| IOT152 |	Get complicated
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:38,080	| IOT152 |	What you want to do is share access
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:40,128	| IOT152 |	To those home associated
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:40,640	| IOT152 |	Things
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:42,688	| IOT152 |	Only with
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:44,224	| IOT152 |	Family members
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:49,344	| IOT152 |	Only who hasn't been divorced yet maybe and married him
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:53,440	| IOT152 |	And only with those currently in the Airbnb rental relationship
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:54,208	| IOT152 |	With me
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:57,024	| IOT152 |	Those things can expire what you want to do is have them
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:39:03,168	| IOT152 |	Actually go along with who's in that fuzzy boundary relationship with you and have them expire naturally
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:06,240	| IOT152 |	That sounds lovely but how does that happen
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:12,384	| IOT152 |	Well it can't happen so you know one of the things that I think you and I talked briefly about the past
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:14,432	| IOT152 |	Is a standard called user managed
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:21,600	| IOT152 |	Which is based on technology called or which of the standard around authorization of permissioning and consent
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:23,904	| IOT152 |	And there's actually a growing
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:25,440	| IOT152 |	Number of standard
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:26,208	| IOT152 |	Around
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:28,512	| IOT152 |	Security and consent and privacy
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:29,792	| IOT152 |	And
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:31,072	| IOT152 |	Authorization
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:32,608	| IOT152 |	It comes from
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:35,936	| IOT152 |	Well the API economy from the old web
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:39,520	| IOT152 |	World it's actually starting to be more and more applicable
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:40,800	| IOT152 |	To the iot world
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:42,848	| IOT152 |	That's quite exciting to me because
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:45,152	| IOT152 |	It's funny that you know the web world is actually more of a
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:46,688	| IOT152 |	Mature in this respect
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:48,224	| IOT152 |	But it's more applicable
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:52,576	| IOT152 |	Does new world and username to access is actually a standard
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:53,856	| IOT152 |	That allows you to
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:56,160	| IOT152 |	Delegate constrained access
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:59,488	| IOT152 |	Basically any API along lines like this
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:01,792	| IOT152 |	So that looks like
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:04,608	| IOT152 |	Is that like what I sign into my nest and I'm like
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:07,680	| IOT152 |	I'm attaching this device emulator on an app and like
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:09,984	| IOT152 |	I no longer own this device I'm going to detach
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:11,264	| IOT152 |	Kit to make this a whole account
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,056	| IOT152 |	It is
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:15,104	| IOT152 |	Possible to apply to those patterns
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:16,896	| IOT152 |	It's now I would love to be in a position
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:19,712	| IOT152 |	Listen to talk to Nest about these patterns cuz what we see now is
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:22,016	| IOT152 |	You have to implement those patterns
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:24,064	| IOT152 |	1byone like sulfur example
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:24,832	| IOT152 |	I downloaded
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:25,600	| IOT152 |	Kevo app
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:29,440	| IOT152 |	Because you know might I know some people who have Smart locks on their homes and they
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:33,024	| IOT152 |	Invited me to get access to their homes and you know this is how we do it
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:34,816	| IOT152 |	So I think you know one by one
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:37,120	| IOT152 |	These smart devices
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:39,936	| IOT152 |	I've had to implement the pattern of sharing access with others
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:41,216	| IOT152 |	A way to do it
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:45,568	| IOT152 |	In a Multi-Device multi manufacture environment
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:47,616	| IOT152 |	Would be to be able to
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:53,248	| IOT152 |	Add share buttons and add access approval Loops in a more standardized fashion and this would be a way that you
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:54,528	| IOT152 |	How to do it
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:57,088	| IOT152 |	Oh so this is like my dream of one app to
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:57,600	| IOT152 |	Control my home
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:58,880	| IOT152 |	And then I can just
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:40:59,392	| IOT152 |	Deal with it
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:04,256	| IOT152 |	It enables you to have a kind of a dashboard of who you've allowed access to what
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:08,864	| IOT152 |	Okay and we kind of Gliding Over this but I think it's an important thing especially
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:09,632	| IOT152 |	Example with
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:12,192	| IOT152 |	Your family of divorce in Airbnb
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:13,472	| IOT152 |	I don't know what happened
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:15,520	| IOT152 |	But
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:16,800	| IOT152 |	It's the idea of
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:18,336	| IOT152 |	Rights that go along with
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:21,664	| IOT152 |	And so it's not just enough to say Hey you have asked
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:22,432	| IOT152 |	Cespedes
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:23,712	| IOT152 |	But we also have to make
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:24,224	| IOT152 |	Provisions for
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:25,760	| IOT152 |	Hey you have access to
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:26,784	| IOT152 |	Despite
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:32,416	| IOT152 |	I don't actually want you turning my thermostat in the winter up to anything about 70
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:34,464	| IOT152 |	Because that's just absurd
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:39,840	| IOT152 |	Or turning off the entire interface of the Smart Lock so that I can't see
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:42,400	| IOT152 |	You know who's coming to my door even if I'm out of town
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:43,168	| IOT152 |	Yes
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:45,472	| IOT152 |	So how do we are there Provisions for managing
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:47,008	| IOT152 |	Access
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:48,288	| IOT152 |	Right now I feel like
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:49,056	| IOT152 |	Probably half
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:49,568	| IOT152 |	Access my devices
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:50,592	| IOT152 |	Do consider
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:52,128	| IOT152 |	And then the other half
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:53,663	| IOT152 |	Durka durka
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:57,759	| IOT152 |	Can do it and some of them don't even let anyone else
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:41:59,039	| IOT152 |	It's only
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:41:59,551	| IOT152 |	One app
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:04,671	| IOT152 |	Right well it's all as it starts with a matter of what
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:06,463	| IOT152 |	Granularity does the API
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:09,791	| IOT152 |	You want to start with you know some good granularity there be
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:13,631	| IOT152 |	Because apis are about making money now and it's sort of
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:15,679	| IOT152 |	The host of the API gets
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:19,007	| IOT152 |	First right of refusal on what Granite has and you want
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:24,639	| IOT152 |	Those to be respectful of what the buyer of advice can do but at that point it starts to get really into
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:25,919	| IOT152 |	Especially
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:27,455	| IOT152 |	I know you've been talking about
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:29,503	| IOT152 |	General data protection regulation
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:30,783	| IOT152 |	In your podcast
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:31,807	| IOT152 |	And in your newsletter
EDL	00:42:31,807	00:42:32,831	| IOT152 |	And this is where it gets
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:37,439	| IOT152 |	Kind of exciting for people who are in the position to buy devices because
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:38,975	| IOT152 |	They're starting to have more rights
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:39,743	| IOT152 |	And
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:46,143	| IOT152 |	Framework for how they can get more rides and we're granularity is basically coming for those who either are EU citizens
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:48,703	| IOT152 |	Indoor travel to the EU and a services
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:52,287	| IOT152 |	And you know services in front of devices are going to need to start respecting
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:54,591	| IOT152 |	Yes if you buy devices from
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:56,127	| IOT152 |	People who are based in the EU guys
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:42:57,919	| IOT152 |	This could come to you soon
EDL	00:42:58,431	00:42:58,943	| IOT152 |	Yes
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:00,223	| IOT152 |	Okay so what does
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:04,319	| IOT152 |	So I've been mentioning you have access Uma
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:08,927	| IOT152 |	And a fact of the folks who work on the samba standard on the cheap Amana Therrien
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:10,975	| IOT152 |	We've started to develop a legal framework
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:12,255	| IOT152 |	Where you could actually
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:13,023	| IOT152 |	Start to have
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:17,119	| IOT152 |	Kind of standard contracts and even licensing Frameworks
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:18,399	| IOT152 |	4
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:21,727	| IOT152 |	How you roll out your terms and conditions and how people can set up
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:22,751	| IOT152 |	Policies
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:24,543	| IOT152 |	Around what they share with others
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:28,383	| IOT152 |	And it could even extend to well if you want to make available data
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:29,919	| IOT152 |	Coming off the devices
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:32,223	| IOT152 |	To Let's a marketing company
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:34,527	| IOT152 |	Then that should be possible
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:36,575	| IOT152 |	With a kind of privacy preserving bent
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:40,415	| IOT152 |	And let's go into one of my favorite favorite topic
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:41,183	| IOT152 |	Switches
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:42,463	| IOT152 |	Kids and I
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:43,999	| IOT152 |	Because
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:44,511	| IOT152 |	I have kids
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:50,143	| IOT152 |	And my child is 11 which means in the US she is governed by
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:50,911	| IOT152 |	Copa
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:51,423	| IOT152 |	Which state
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:55,007	| IOT152 |	Child online privacy protection act
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:57,055	| IOT152 |	And basically
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:58,335	| IOT152 |	Companies can't collect data
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:01,151	| IOT152 |	Which right now in my smartphone
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:02,687	| IOT152 |	Come means that she's like
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:05,503	| IOT152 |	Yeah
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:07,551	| IOT152 |	Difficult doesn't it
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:12,159	| IOT152 |	She can't get her voice recognized by things she can't there's a lot she can't do
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:14,975	| IOT152 |	Can I get why this is there but let's talk about
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:16,255	| IOT152 |	Identities I guess you
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,791	| IOT152 |	Parent-child
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:18,559	| IOT152 |	Queso
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:20,351	| IOT152 |	I feel like I have no identity
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:21,119	| IOT152 |	It's just
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:22,399	| IOT152 |	Stacy who controls
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:22,911	| IOT152 |	Rosanna's account
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:25,215	| IOT152 |	Yasso
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:29,055	| IOT152 |	Yeah in a lot of the laws in oh this is where I talked about you know this is
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:32,127	| IOT152 |	Especially sensitive data and gdpr has a whole set
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:33,919	| IOT152 |	Section for it and a really odd thing is
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:34,943	| IOT152 |	Under capitalized
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:38,527	| IOT152 |	That the age of majority is 13 under gdpr
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:40,831	| IOT152 |	It's largely 16 +
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:42,623	| IOT152 |	Four different kinds of data
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:48,767	| IOT152 |	You find it on every state in the Union you'll find slightly different laws about which kinds of data there's different age
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:50,815	| IOT152 |	Actually even more
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:51,327	| IOT152 |	NetSpend
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:53,887	| IOT152 |	So imagine that there's different kind of
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:55,167	| IOT152 |	Clinical devices
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:56,703	| IOT152 |	Is farina generating
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:57,727	| IOT152 |	Different kinds of
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:44:59,263	| IOT152 |	Miti Behavioral Health Data
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:01,311	| IOT152 |	Or you know pregnancy
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:02,591	| IOT152 |	Testator for example
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:04,639	| IOT152 |	And you know not to scare you
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:05,663	| IOT152 |	Age 11
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:06,943	| IOT152 |	Hopefully way too young
EDL	00:45:06,943	00:45:13,343	| IOT152 |	But there's no different ages of consent in ages of majority for all these different kinds of data and you know every state and every
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:15,391	| IOT152 |	Jurisdiction has a different ages in his nuts
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:16,159	| IOT152 |	So
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:17,439	| IOT152 |	Can I see a wrinkle in there
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:20,255	| IOT152 |	I'm going to make it even more
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:22,047	| IOT152 |	There's also like
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:23,327	| IOT152 |	F13
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:26,143	| IOT152 |	I'll child protection under like Google for exam
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:26,911	| IOT152 |	Apple for a while
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:28,447	| IOT152 |	What's 0 / 13
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:32,031	| IOT152 |	No parent protection
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:33,823	| IOT152 |	What you doing
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:40,223	| IOT152 |	Want necessarily kind of ignores the fact that I want my kid to have access to something
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:41,247	| IOT152 |	Then they can
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:42,015	| IOT152 |	Get further access
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:43,551	| IOT152 |	Okay so that's my
EDL	00:45:45,855	00:45:50,207	| IOT152 |	You did what kind of a sliding scale if you're to be a responsible parent and yet it
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:53,791	| IOT152 |	Brightline is for the easiest so maybe some of these things words
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:57,119	| IOT152 |	Different age of majority for different things is more reasonable
EDL	00:45:57,119	00:45:58,399	| IOT152 |	Because it kind of admit
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:02,239	| IOT152 |	Set a responsible parent wants to have a role in their child's life
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:03,263	| IOT152 |	For certain things
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:04,031	| IOT152 |	So
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:05,567	| IOT152 |	I do only what you want to have
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:06,079	| IOT152 |	Is
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:08,127	| IOT152 |	An ocean of some
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:09,407	| IOT152 |	Management
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:09,919	| IOT152 |	Over
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:11,967	| IOT152 |	What a child can do
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:12,735	| IOT152 |	In a
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:13,759	| IOT152 |	Responsible
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:15,039	| IOT152 |	So
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:20,927	| IOT152 |	Typically what you would want to do in the view of digital identity Solutions is an ocean of
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:23,487	| IOT152 |	Accounts
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:24,255	| IOT152 |	And this
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:26,559	| IOT152 |	Shouldn't be I mean that the solutions that you been
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:28,095	| IOT152 |	I think we're just know they're not
EDL	00:46:28,095	00:46:29,887	| IOT152 |	Taking advantage of as possible
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:31,935	| IOT152 |	So here is what we typically see
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:32,959	| IOT152 |	In my world
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:34,751	| IOT152 |	It's the notion of
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:37,567	| IOT152 |	A full identity account
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:42,687	| IOT152 |	For a parent or Guardian so you know in law and might be somebody's not a parent but a guardian
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:44,479	| IOT152 |	Cancer kind of the proxy
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:45,503	| IOT152 |	Freedom child
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:46,015	| IOT152 |	And that
EDL	00:46:46,527	00:46:47,551	| IOT152 |	Full account
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:50,879	| IOT152 |	Would be able to for example set up the account
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:53,695	| IOT152 |	A person could set up the account on their own so let's say it's
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:55,743	| IOT152 |	You know Alice that's pickle
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:58,815	| IOT152 |	In my world is Alice and Bob and Alice wood
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:01,631	| IOT152 |	Set up an account on her own should have a process where she
EDL	00:47:01,631	00:47:03,167	| IOT152 |	Proves that she's a beige
EDL	00:47:03,167	00:47:05,727	| IOT152 |	The permissions on the account would be.
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:07,263	| IOT152 |	She can do lots and lots of things
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:10,591	| IOT152 |	The schema governing the information
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:13,151	| IOT152 |	That's stored associated with the account
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:14,943	| IOT152 |	Would be very full with lots of
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:16,223	| IOT152 |	Information so that
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:20,575	| IOT152 |	It's not blinding certain things it's not disallowing certain information from being stored
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:22,111	| IOT152 |	And then
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:23,135	| IOT152 |	You would be able to
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:23,903	| IOT152 |	Set up
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:24,671	| IOT152 |	Alice would be able to
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:26,207	| IOT152 |	On behalf
EDL	00:47:26,207	00:47:32,607	| IOT152 |	Of her child little Susie or even younger Johnny knows maybe two years old and can't operate any devices or
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:33,631	| IOT152 |	Or services
EDL	00:47:33,631	00:47:35,423	| IOT152 |	And little Johnny would have
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:35,935	| IOT152 |	A managed
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:39,519	| IOT152 |	And a managed account is very constrained and what it can do
EDL	00:47:40,031	00:47:43,871	| IOT152 |	It has a limited schema with a very simple set of data
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:50,271	| IOT152 |	That would adhere to you know that the applicable laws and the jurisdiction and it had very limited permission
EDL	00:47:50,271	00:47:51,807	| IOT152 |	Effectively be
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:52,319	| IOT152 |	Change
EDL	00:47:52,831	00:47:54,111	| IOT152 |	To Mom analysis
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:56,671	| IOT152 |	Now what are the things that you can
EDL	00:47:56,671	00:47:57,439	| IOT152 |	Excitingly
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:48:01,535	| IOT152 |	You do with the notion of identity relationship management is
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:02,303	| IOT152 |	Reflect
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:03,071	| IOT152 |	The fact that they
EDL	00:48:03,071	00:48:05,375	| IOT152 |	I have a parent or guardian and child
EDL	00:48:05,375	00:48:06,399	| IOT152 |	Relationship
EDL	00:48:06,399	00:48:08,447	| IOT152 |	And if you know Little Johnny's age
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:11,007	| IOT152 |	You know when he times in
EDL	00:48:11,007	00:48:13,055	| IOT152 |	To certain ages of majority
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:14,591	| IOT152 |	And start to give him full rights
EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:15,871	| IOT152 |	Under
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:17,151	| IOT152 |	The jurisdiction
EDL	00:48:17,151	00:48:18,431	| IOT152 |	Kinds of data
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:20,223	| IOT152 |	You can start to collect more data
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:23,039	| IOT152 |	And you can start to be able to build
EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:24,063	| IOT152 |	Amore Digital Life for
EDL	00:48:24,831	00:48:27,391	| IOT152 |	With the with the notion of a digital twin if you will
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:28,159	| IOT152 |	And then the
EDL	00:48:28,159	00:48:29,439	| IOT152 |	The eventual idea
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:30,207	| IOT152 |	OBD2
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:31,743	| IOT152 |	Transfer the account
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:33,279	| IOT152 |	I'm kind of like co-signing on a
EDL	00:48:33,791	00:48:35,839	| IOT152 |	Car loan goes on your credit report with
EDL	00:48:35,839	00:48:37,631	| IOT152 |	Your parents with you and then eventually be
EDL	00:48:37,631	00:48:38,655	| IOT152 |	Becomes part of yours and you
EDL	00:48:38,655	00:48:39,423	| IOT152 |	You go off into the world
EDL	00:48:39,935	00:48:45,055	| IOT152 |	Exactly it's sort of like he starts with a thin file in credit language and then he starts
EDL	00:48:45,055	00:48:48,383	| IOT152 |	How to build more of a file as he reaches age of majority
EDL	00:48:48,383	00:48:49,663	| IOT152 |	For certain kinds of data
EDL	00:48:50,943	00:48:52,991	| IOT152 |	And it feels like the Enterprise has
EDL	00:48:52,991	00:48:54,015	| IOT152 |	How to unlock more
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:49:00,671	| IOT152 |	How are we going to see this coming to the consumer World anytime soon cuz it feels like we're years behind him
EDL	00:49:00,671	00:49:01,183	| IOT152 |	Desperately
EDL	00:49:01,695	00:49:02,463	| IOT152 |	Better
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:02,975	| IOT152 |	Options here
EDL	00:49:03,487	00:49:05,791	| IOT152 |	You know I think so I mean this is where
EDL	00:49:05,791	00:49:10,399	| IOT152 |	Consumer scale I almost done with a consumer it's just there's a Sturm Scion with stance
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:12,703	| IOT152 |	Customer consumer Inc
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:14,751	| IOT152 |	Were there we've been there actually for a while
EDL	00:49:15,263	00:49:16,031	| IOT152 |	Has certain properties
EDL	00:49:16,543	00:49:17,055	| IOT152 |	Scale
EDL	00:49:17,567	00:49:18,079	| IOT152 |	And
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:19,359	| IOT152 |	Performance
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:20,639	| IOT152 |	That requires
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:21,407	| IOT152 |	Over and above
EDL	00:49:22,175	00:49:24,479	| IOT152 |	Employee I am world
EDL	00:49:24,479	00:49:26,783	| IOT152 |	And house for a while now so it different is
EDL	00:49:26,783	00:49:28,575	| IOT152 |	In quality and quantity
EDL	00:49:29,087	00:49:33,183	| IOT152 |	From what we had to do for the employee or the greater employee population
EDL	00:49:33,183	00:49:34,207	| IOT152 |	For a long time now
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:35,743	| IOT152 |	Employees and partners
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:37,023	| IOT152 |	Of the Enterprise
EDL	00:49:37,023	00:49:39,583	| IOT152 |	Because you know a lot of those
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:42,399	| IOT152 |	Big companies have or even small companies will have
EDL	00:49:42,399	00:49:44,191	| IOT152 |	1000000 or 10 million
EDL	00:49:44,191	00:49:45,215	| IOT152 |	Or a hundred million
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:47,263	| IOT152 |	Customers or end-users
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:49,055	| IOT152 |	And when it comes to devices
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:51,615	| IOT152 |	That they might use will you know
EDL	00:49:51,615	00:49:52,639	| IOT152 |	Multiply it by
EDL	00:49:53,151	00:49:57,247	| IOT152 |	Another 10 factor or a hundred factor or if you start looking for sensors
EDL	00:49:57,247	00:49:59,039	| IOT152 |	And I'll keep multiplying
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:50:02,367	| IOT152 |	I don't have to be in a relationship again just keep multiplying
EDL	00:50:02,367	00:50:03,391	| IOT152 |	Bright but I wanted
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:04,671	| IOT152 |	Call my relationship
EDL	00:50:05,183	00:50:06,719	| IOT152 |	Things in this case not have
EDL	00:50:06,719	00:50:09,535	| IOT152 |	Company and that's there's no real framework right now
EDL	00:50:10,303	00:50:10,815	| IOT152 |	Does that
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:13,119	| IOT152 |	I mean we are seeing
EDL	00:50:13,119	00:50:13,887	| IOT152 |	That
EDL	00:50:13,887	00:50:15,935	| IOT152 |	Not only the standards that I was mentioning
EDL	00:50:16,447	00:50:17,727	| IOT152 |	Do account for that
EDL	00:50:17,727	00:50:18,751	| IOT152 |	But I mean
EDL	00:50:18,751	00:50:22,079	| IOT152 |	This framework is very real for what I see everyday
EDL	00:50:22,079	00:50:23,103	| IOT152 |	What we do everyday
EDL	00:50:23,615	00:50:24,895	| IOT152 |	And this is where
EDL	00:50:24,895	00:50:26,943	| IOT152 |	Particularly that graph database
EDL	00:50:26,943	00:50:27,711	| IOT152 |	Slayer
EDL	00:50:27,711	00:50:28,479	| IOT152 |	Does
EDL	00:50:28,479	00:50:29,247	| IOT152 |	Managed
EDL	00:50:29,247	00:50:30,015	| IOT152 |	Tackle
EDL	00:50:30,527	00:50:34,111	| IOT152 |	Performance needs of you know what an individual person has to
EDL	00:50:34,623	00:50:39,231	| IOT152 |	Deal with any one individual person I mean how many if you imagine that you're sitting policies
EDL	00:50:39,231	00:50:40,511	| IOT152 |	For who I want to share with
EDL	00:50:40,511	00:50:43,071	| IOT152 |	You know Our Brands tend to explode if we
EDL	00:50:43,071	00:50:44,863	| IOT152 |	We have to jump higher than
EDL	00:50:44,863	00:50:47,423	| IOT152 |	527 anything's at one time
EDL	00:50:47,423	00:50:53,823	| IOT152 |	So I think that that that notion is probably pretty well accounted for but the Frameworks of the kind of Technology
EDL	00:50:53,823	00:50:55,103	| IOT152 |	They were talking about I think
EDL	00:50:55,103	00:50:55,871	| IOT152 |	I think it exists
EDL	00:50:55,871	00:50:57,919	| IOT152 |	It's stuff that can be done
EDL	00:50:57,919	00:50:59,199	| IOT152 |	So then the question is
EDL	00:50:59,199	00:51:00,223	| IOT152 |	You need a business model
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:02,527	| IOT152 |	This because yeah
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:03,551	| IOT152 |	So
EDL	00:51:04,063	00:51:06,879	| IOT152 |	I think about my digital identity who would I trust
EDL	00:51:06,879	00:51:07,391	| IOT152 |	A
EDL	00:51:07,903	00:51:08,671	| IOT152 |	To have all of
EDL	00:51:09,439	00:51:11,999	| IOT152 |	In feet what I pay for it
EDL	00:51:11,999	00:51:15,071	| IOT152 |	And how am I going to pay for it out of pocket cuz right now I pay for it like
EDL	00:51:15,583	00:51:17,887	| IOT152 |	You know a lot of people trust apple and they have a lot of
EDL	00:51:17,887	00:51:18,911	| IOT152 |	Digital identity associate
EDL	00:51:19,679	00:51:20,703	| IOT152 |	And they pay for it
EDL	00:51:20,703	00:51:21,471	| IOT152 |	Face painting
EDL	00:51:21,471	00:51:21,983	| IOT152 |	Exorbitant
EDL	00:51:22,751	00:51:23,519	| IOT152 |	Devices
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:29,151	| IOT152 |	So you see like a breakthrough possibly happening there especially as we have so many more things
EDL	00:51:29,919	00:51:34,527	| IOT152 |	So you're asking a question you know how many digital identities should we
EDL	00:51:35,295	00:51:35,807	| IOT152 |	And
EDL	00:51:36,319	00:51:39,903	| IOT152 |	It's so tough being so I use a password manager so I can certify
EDL	00:51:39,903	00:51:42,975	| IOT152 |	Count how many logins I have and it's not pretty
EDL	00:51:42,975	00:51:43,743	| IOT152 |	Who have hundred
EDL	00:51:44,255	00:51:48,095	| IOT152 |	And you know the average person to do any studies an average person has in Odessa
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:48,863	| IOT152 |	A dozen
EDL	00:51:48,863	00:51:50,143	| IOT152 |	Or several.
EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:56,543	| IOT152 |	They're lying there totally lying I'm really counting them up and you know I do think more people are using password managers for the
EDL	00:51:56,543	00:51:58,079	| IOT152 |	Still in that going to probably
EDL	00:51:58,079	00:51:59,103	| IOT152 |	Low
EDL	00:51:59,615	00:52:00,383	| IOT152 |	Doesn't
EDL	00:52:00,383	00:52:01,663	| IOT152 |	Percent something like that
EDL	00:52:01,663	00:52:02,943	| IOT152 |	Did the right answer isn't one
EDL	00:52:03,455	00:52:04,735	| IOT152 |	We're talking about persona
EDL	00:52:05,247	00:52:07,295	| IOT152 |	The right answer isn't one because
EDL	00:52:07,295	00:52:07,807	| IOT152 |	Then
EDL	00:52:08,575	00:52:09,343	| IOT152 |	Song
EDL	00:52:09,855	00:52:11,903	| IOT152 |	Identity provider node
EDL	00:52:12,415	00:52:12,927	| IOT152 |	Everything about
EDL	00:52:13,439	00:52:14,207	| IOT152 |	And there's
EDL	00:52:14,207	00:52:15,999	| IOT152 |	There's a theory now about self
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:17,023	| IOT152 |	Sovereign identity
EDL	00:52:17,023	00:52:22,143	| IOT152 |	That you're going to somehow hold all the information about you on let's say a mobile app
EDL	00:52:22,143	00:52:25,983	| IOT152 |	On your client device and then somehow you'll hold out by Disney information about you
EDL	00:52:25,983	00:52:27,775	| IOT152 |	And you'll be in entire control
EDL	00:52:27,775	00:52:29,567	| IOT152 |	And the reason I don't think
EDL	00:52:29,567	00:52:30,847	| IOT152 |	At the end of the day that's
EDL	00:52:30,847	00:52:32,383	| IOT152 |	Harley viable is that
EDL	00:52:32,895	00:52:33,919	| IOT152 |	Anybody who needs
EDL	00:52:33,919	00:52:38,783	| IOT152 |	No information about YouTube get Services going and have you know offer you into
EDL	00:52:38,783	00:52:39,807	| IOT152 |	Sting services
EDL	00:52:39,807	00:52:43,135	| IOT152 |	They need some of that information Vital Information about you to be
EDL	00:52:43,135	00:52:44,415	| IOT152 |	Asserted by third-party
EDL	00:52:44,927	00:52:48,255	| IOT152 |	Like there's not going to trust you to say well I'm a citizen of
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:49,023	| IOT152 |	Country
EDL	00:52:49,023	00:52:50,303	| IOT152 |	They're going to rely on
EDL	00:52:50,303	00:52:52,863	| IOT152 |	Next country to say who you we are citizen of
EDL	00:52:53,631	00:52:55,935	| IOT152 |	So it's got almost a lot of things
EDL	00:52:55,935	00:52:59,007	| IOT152 |	To come from third-party so those third parties count as
EDL	00:52:59,007	00:52:59,775	| IOT152 |	Multiple sources
EDL	00:53:01,311	00:53:02,079	| IOT152 |	So
EDL	00:53:02,079	00:53:03,871	| IOT152 |	It's a multifarious problem
EDL	00:53:03,871	00:53:07,711	| IOT152 |	So between all of us has multiple sources does that mean we're still stuck with
EDL	00:53:07,711	00:53:08,735	| IOT152 |	That many logins
EDL	00:53:09,503	00:53:10,015	| IOT152 |	Zoe's
EDL	00:53:16,415	00:53:17,695	| IOT152 |	But I think
EDL	00:53:17,695	00:53:19,999	| IOT152 |	Here's where I think that we might
EDL	00:53:19,999	00:53:25,631	| IOT152 |	Be able to consolidate I'll give you a little olive branch of hope we may not be able to consolidate source
EDL	00:53:25,631	00:53:26,143	| IOT152 |	Identity
EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:28,959	| IOT152 |	But I think ultimately someday
EDL	00:53:28,959	00:53:30,239	| IOT152 |	Maybe someday soon
EDL	00:53:30,239	00:53:31,519	| IOT152 |	We can consolidate
EDL	00:53:32,287	00:53:33,311	| IOT152 |	To a short list
EDL	00:53:33,823	00:53:34,847	| IOT152 |	Baby County
EDL	00:53:34,847	00:53:36,127	| IOT152 |	You know one hand
EDL	00:53:36,127	00:53:36,895	| IOT152 |	Of
EDL	00:53:36,895	00:53:38,687	| IOT152 |	Places where we can manage
EDL	00:53:38,687	00:53:40,223	| IOT152 |	Our preferences for
EDL	00:53:40,735	00:53:41,759	| IOT152 |	Could we share with
EDL	00:53:41,759	00:53:46,111	| IOT152 |	So you know any user managed access Lan we would call that an authorization server you know
EDL	00:53:46,111	00:53:48,159	| IOT152 |	Maybe the dashboard the privacy.
EDL	00:53:49,439	00:53:49,951	| IOT152 |	Because
EDL	00:53:50,463	00:53:51,487	| IOT152 |	Ultimately
EDL	00:53:51,999	00:53:53,023	| IOT152 |	What preference is we
EDL	00:53:53,535	00:53:54,047	| IOT152 |	What
EDL	00:53:54,559	00:53:57,631	| IOT152 |	Authorization policy we have what privacy settings we have
EDL	00:53:58,143	00:54:00,191	| IOT152 |	Our only source for that should be us
EDL	00:54:00,191	00:54:03,263	| IOT152 |	Like if your preference is smoking or non-smoking or
EDL	00:54:03,263	00:54:04,799	| IOT152 |	Aisle vs. window
EDL	00:54:04,799	00:54:07,615	| IOT152 |	Can you trust anybody else for that other than yourself
EDL	00:54:08,895	00:54:09,919	| IOT152 |	Like I've trained my husband
EDL	00:54:10,687	00:54:11,711	| IOT152 |	He knows that I get the Isle
EDL	00:54:12,991	00:54:16,063	| IOT152 |	Exactly it's I mean you can store it someplace else
EDL	00:54:16,063	00:54:18,111	| IOT152 |	But it has to be self-assertive
EDL	00:54:18,623	00:54:19,647	| IOT152 |	Well this is
EDL	00:54:20,671	00:54:21,439	| IOT152 |	Again
EDL	00:54:21,439	00:54:22,719	| IOT152 |	That's a small Olive
EDL	00:54:22,719	00:54:23,487	| IOT152 |	French meadow cafe
EDL	00:54:23,487	00:54:24,255	| IOT152 |	And
