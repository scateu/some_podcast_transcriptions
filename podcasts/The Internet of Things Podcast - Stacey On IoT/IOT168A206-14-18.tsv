EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,256	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:10,048	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Let's kick it off with
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:15,680	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	We're kicking it off with industrial news you guys which I know some of yall might be like I don't know
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:17,216	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But it's a big deal
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:18,240	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Rockwell Automation
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:22,080	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They have entered into the Strategic partnership with
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,616	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	PTC
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,920	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	For industrial in a
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,688	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Station
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:30,784	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Mptc you may remember they are a company that used to do
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:36,928	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Design and Manufacturing software and then they started buying up iot companies like thing works actually Bots Lively witch
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:38,208	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Clock me in
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:40,512	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Mommy and Dively and then sold that but they
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:46,656	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Are doing really cool stuff with things like AR & VR I talk to the CEO Jim heppelmann a couple times
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:51,008	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	As part of this partnership Rockwell Automation is making a billion-dollar Equity investor
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,312	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And there's
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:55,104	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	CEO and chairman will join the board of pt
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:03:00,992	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	This is going to be a really deep partnership they're going to integrate their smart Factory Technologies they're going
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:06,112	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	PTC has thingworx kepware all of that's going to go in with Rockwell Automation
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:06,624	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Factory song
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,952	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So my question about this is
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:10,976	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Where does that leave
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,768	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Other companies like Johnson
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,536	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Controls
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:14,304	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Cement
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,072	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Compete with raw
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:15,840	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Rockwell Automation
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:16,864	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And I don't know how exclusive
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,400	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Pussy
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:25,312	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I think to answer your question but I don't know the exact answer but to answer your question I think it's going to depend on pricing because
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:28,384	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Where is subscriptions
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,408	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It is
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:34,528	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	In which case it's going to come down to like in any Enterprise
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:40,928	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It area how much is it going to cost me so if those other competitors can still provide similar services
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:45,024	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	At a lower subscription price that may help those little guys
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:48,608	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It might it actually I'm talking to Jim heppelmann
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:50,656	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Later on this week so you'll see more about the
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:51,168	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Send the newsletter
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,192	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But it's
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,984	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Pretty big freaking deal so
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,520	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	We're talking about here
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,288	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Arm
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,568	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The semiconductor license
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,616	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Company that you all know and love
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,152	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They make the designs that
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,432	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Make yourself own chips
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:03,712	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Other chip
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,760	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Like the tiny little chips
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:06,784	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Surrender SmartWatches
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:09,344	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They have bought a company called stream
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,368	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Technology
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,648	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,184	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Their goal here
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:14,464	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Is
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:17,280	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Extreme Technologies does device management and
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,071	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Iot connectivity
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:23,167	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	This is a little weird because arm is a
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:23,679	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Chip design
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:26,751	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But what's happening is they really focused
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:30,079	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Hard on their mbed OS and they launched
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:33,151	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Probably a year-and-a-half ago I feel
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:35,455	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Cloud offering for iot so
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:37,247	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They're actually trying to
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,015	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	To build
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:40,319	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The same sort of cloud offering that
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,599	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Amazon
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,111	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And others have
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:45,439	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	To help their customers basically offer
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:47,487	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	God I hate saying these words end to end
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:52,095	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Cloud iot offering so basically
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:57,215	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They need a lot more though they can't they can't compete with like an Azure and AWS
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:01,055	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It got the basics down which is getting your devices online and then managing
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:11,039	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	No I don't think it is I don't think it is because our magic says they chip designer they don't manufacture
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:14,111	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Nitro chips instead they license their designs to
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,903	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Apple Samsung
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,951	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Mediatek
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:19,231	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Qualcomm etcetera
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:24,351	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And there's only so much more growth left in the mobile devices that
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:29,471	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Run on those chips that yes there are newer types of devices and some iot devices will need these
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:30,751	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Smart as well but
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:34,079	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They can't rely on the big growth
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:35,103	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	From their biggest
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:39,967	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Revenue generator these days they have to do something more than just be a chip designer that
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:43,039	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Puts out intel processors basically
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,319	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So I don't think it's all that
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,087	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That weird
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:51,231	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Okay I know that this is like I get it and I know that they're in this position
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,767	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But I think it's
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:54,303	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Crazy for them to think they can come
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,143	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I guess is where I'm going
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,423	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	SA
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,447	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I get why they're doing it
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:01,727	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:09,151	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I just want to be successful either I'm not saying that at all but
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:11,967	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	At least they're giving themselves a chance in a new market
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:15,039	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Is right now without this and I think they made one other
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:20,671	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	What was the reason I thought was weird acquisition last year I don't recall what it was but
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,463	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Really why are they doing that now
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,487	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They have to
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:26,559	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They just have to otherwise where's the growth going to come
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:29,375	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So I I get this in
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:30,399	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You know arm
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,703	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Has done a lot actually
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,471	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Advance fee
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:36,031	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Try to advance the overall iot Market
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:37,567	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Easier
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:41,919	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So a couple years ago they launched in bed which is their OS for it's their real time
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:47,039	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And they did that because everybody else had their own OS is it part of
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,575	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I called the chip fenders
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,111	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	License
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:50,623	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Iris designs
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,159	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They had their own
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:52,927	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Operating
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,719	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And it was terrible because you
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:58,047	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	As a developer if you wanted to build an iot device
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,583	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You had to learn like
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,143	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	A variety of embedded operating so
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:08,287	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's basically so they were like hey let's have them all learn mbed OS and that'll be easier and then that'll work on
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,055	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Rochester
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:12,895	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That hasn't embed has not the adoption curve has not
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,919	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Gone the way we thought it
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,479	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Doubtful but
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,783	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Only according to an eclipse
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:21,343	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Iot developer survey that came out in April
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,623	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	48.8
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,391	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	8% of
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:24,671	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Developer survey
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:26,719	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Actually use mbed OS
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:28,255	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Compared to
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,559	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I'm a 72% using Linux
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:31,583	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And then
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:34,143	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	About 20.4% using
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:34,655	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Free artist
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,935	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Just be
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:36,447	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Most pop
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:37,727	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Artaste
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,519	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Set Linux
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,031	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Too fat for life
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:46,687	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And Amazon bought free art Osso Amazon right now has that same
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,223	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And they didn't buy free
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,247	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Asset open source
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:54,879	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I don't know how to phrase that properly
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,671	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Anyway so now they've got this
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:59,743	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	End-to-end kind of system
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:02,815	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Really interested to see what Amazon does
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,095	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Too deep in that
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:06,399	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Meanwhile arm just feels like it's really far behind
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,703	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So there's there's art
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:10,751	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	In other
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:14,335	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Is it industrial it's just kind of catching up with p
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,103	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	People V
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:15,871	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Red group
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,151	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I remember them
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,967	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The thread group they're using
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:23,551	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Iot standard for
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,831	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The radio
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:28,927	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's mesh Network base it uses 802. 15. 4
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:29,695	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,463	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The same thing is it
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:32,511	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Same radio underneath
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,815	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And then they connect directly to IP
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,327	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	IPv6 switch
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:38,399	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Unique about it so they did a milestone release
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,423	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	This week
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,215	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's worth mentioning that
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:45,055	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Nordic joined which they actually announced way back in
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:45,567	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	February
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:50,943	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Zeidman's also joined which means thread could actually find some
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,991	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Some credibility in the industrial space
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:53,503	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Face which I thought was
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:54,783	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Worth mentioning
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,343	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Thread still does have
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:57,855	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Definition
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,903	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The issue is with
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:03,999	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Google and Nest they actually were one of the founding members of
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:10,399	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They built a version of it that is not actually certified by the thread of life
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,191	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So they have there
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,727	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Own
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:14,495	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Thread
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,519	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Lamentation
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:24,735	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The group that's in or the companies that are part of thread group right now I'm in with all the Heavy Hitters are in there if Samsung are
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:27,551	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	We just talked about Qualcomm nxp
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,831	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Somfy osram
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:29,855	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Evendale
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,391	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Even yeah
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:37,791	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Even you got out a lot company and don't forget
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:41,375	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Say it the big butt Fan Company
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,703	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So that's that's kind of the thread stuff there's
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,239	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Lots happening there
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:47,519	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yay
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:54,687	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I'm actually might my goal is in the next week or two to take a look at
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,711	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Both red
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:57,759	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The open connectivity Foundation
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,551	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Because
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,575	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It feels like
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,855	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	There's a lot of nothing happening in
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:06,975	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	If I remember correctly The Nest connect when it came out
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:11,327	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Was there was a mention of thread and this kind of gets to that dichotomy of
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:18,239	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Using full thread and knot thread in fact I remember we asked a grant Erickson president of the thread group about this
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:23,359	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And I said I was quote right for me nasty text relies on threads low-power architecture
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:27,711	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Place for long periods of time A-1 Battery Nest connect is a thread router
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,015	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Which seamlessly extends
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,807	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Bo3 cheat activate a thread Network
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:36,671	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I think we later found out that it doesn't use the full
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,951	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Angered
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,231	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It uses what
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:40,767	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They call thread
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:41,535	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Ready
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:42,047	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	In what
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:44,095	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Google has open source
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:44,863	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Has open
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:50,239	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yes and that is exactly
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,543	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	A challenge that the thread group faces which is that
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,847	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They basically let Google
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:55,871	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Google nest
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:56,639	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Use
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:58,943	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The version of thread that they built in the very big
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,223	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Beginning for all of their stuff
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,271	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Right is not actually
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,039	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Compatible
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:04,319	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	With the thread certify
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:05,855	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's just thread ready
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,647	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's a little bit of a
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:11,487	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And that could be why we have
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,535	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Not heard much lately
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,815	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Indeed
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,583	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	All right
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,607	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So Kevin
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,631	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Hard question for you
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:21,215	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Do you pay for a Wi-Fi subscription
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:23,007	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Or an add-on to your
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:25,055	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Listing of a service on top of your Wi-Fi
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:29,407	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I do not my family pays me because I am the IT service guy for the network
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,687	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:34,527	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So plume which we talked about in the past there the company that has the
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,575	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Plume pods they're little
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,343	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Hexagon shape
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,111	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Pods that you can
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:38,623	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Just plug in
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:39,903	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And they actually
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:42,207	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Dynamically control
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:42,719	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Your network
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:44,255	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	In the cloud
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:47,839	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So you plug these in wherever you need in your house and then they start to
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:51,167	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Understand what's happening on your network and then
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:51,679	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,215	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Kelly
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:53,727	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Pod what to
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:56,543	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Describe that
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:12:02,687	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's kind of like Mesh networking yet all the intelligence is done the cloud as opposed to local
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,455	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Right
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,223	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:06,015	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They now are charging
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,831	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	When you buy a plume pods they're going to charge you
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,367	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	60 bucks a year
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,647	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	4
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:14,207	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Wi-Fi service
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,487	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Literally
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:17,279	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Or $200 for a lifetime membership
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,071	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:21,887	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Where do you buy this though you get reduced pricing on plume sweater
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:23,679	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And a warranty for each year that
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,727	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Sew in
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,751	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The lifetime is 5 years
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:29,567	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	With a subscription you get a 3-pack
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:30,591	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	For $40
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,383	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You can't buy them without us
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:36,735	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Used to be it was $180 for the bathroom
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,015	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,551	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	179
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:41,855	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	If you
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,647	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Don't have the subscription
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,183	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You can't use them
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,463	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Right
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:49,535	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And said they accept if you already had
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:52,351	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	If you have already bought your plume pods previously
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:54,655	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You can still yeah you're fine
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,935	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Flights going forward
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:58,495	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But going forward you're going to have to pay 60 bucks a year
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:03,615	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I am actually okay with this they offer the discount on Hardware
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:07,455	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You also get parental controls security stuff
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:09,503	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The collective management
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,039	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Describe what the
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:14,623	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	What does is basically saying
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,159	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Hey Wi-Fi in your home
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,463	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Is no longer going to be
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,231	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Hardware base
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:19,999	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	This is going to be a service
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:26,399	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I'm kind of okay with that given how much drama I have over my Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:26,911	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	In my house
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:28,703	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It was all of my connect
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:32,287	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	If that gives the company accountability
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,335	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	For actually
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:36,639	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Solving some of the problems I have with my devices
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:38,687	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And it makes them update
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:39,711	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Things that
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:40,991	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Might like
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,271	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Any issues with my router
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:43,295	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You know
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:44,575	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That's kind of worth it
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:49,951	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I think for some people yes it is I'm not going to dispute that
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:56,095	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	For me personally I have all those features
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,399	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	In my current router setup
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:01,983	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Parental controls guest networking
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:08,895	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You know being forming at the right place and time so that the signals going to the right devices I can prioritize devices
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,663	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Search for Wi-Fi
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:12,735	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I'm not I'm not paying for that
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:15,295	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Unless unless I have no choice in which case
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:17,599	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That would mean all of the vendors in this space to do this
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:24,255	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And that's going to be the big question so what it what we do see in the space right now is companies like Eero offer
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,583	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	A subscription option
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,095	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:30,399	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I could pay 04
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:32,703	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Additional parental management
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,471	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Additional
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:33,983	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Security
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:38,079	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	A VPN password manager all attached to the
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:38,591	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	In a security office
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:43,455	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I have not paid for it yet even though I was actually like thinking about it I just
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,735	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Justin get to it in time before it
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:45,503	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Expired
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,527	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:50,367	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I don't know I and I really
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:56,767	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I also question how many people buy their routers at retail so plumes big business is actually still going to
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:57,535	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	To be through
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:02,399	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Isps so things like the Comcast deal and Comcast is not charging people
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:04,703	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	11 bucks a month for a router
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:05,727	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Which is said to be insane
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:08,031	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Here's the thing
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:11,871	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I don't have a problem with subscription for
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,407	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Extra services
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:19,039	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But I don't even have the option with this one the option is to not buy this one and buy a different
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,319	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Router brand
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:23,391	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yes I'd rather see it as an add-on option
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:26,719	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Look at it this way this is hardware this is
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,231	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Just a little bit
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:31,583	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And I'd rather be part of the hardware
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:36,191	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Because that's at least a sustainable business model like you
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:37,727	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I mean again
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:40,287	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	If this was the only choice out there I'd be like
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:46,175	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And I know a lot of people very much a lot of our audience is probably like Stacy you're so crazy
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,711	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I can do this myself
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:51,295	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They're going to be people like you Kevin and I respect that but
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:54,111	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I think this will be interesting to watch to see if
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,135	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Accompany
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:55,903	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Actually
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:59,487	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Move from a product model to a Services model
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:01,535	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Keep an eye on it
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:03,583	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,631	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Google home has a new skill
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:09,215	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Where does it where does it
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:14,335	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yeah so remember I wasn't but a couple
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:16,639	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	How to say we should probably months ago
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:19,455	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They enabled the ability to use a Google home with
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,735	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Multiple commands in
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:25,087	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	In one sentence speak one sentence and have two things happen
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:28,415	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Apparently now you can do it with
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:29,439	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Three things
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:30,719	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Google
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:32,511	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It tweeted something about this
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:34,559	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And then pulled the tweet
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:39,423	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And if I go to the support page at they've linked to in the poultry it's still just shows two things
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:43,007	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	However some people are saying that it still works at 3
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:47,871	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So we've actually tested this booth on our respective Google
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:53,759	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Devices and has not yet work for us so I don't know if it was a rolling kind of thing where it's coming
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:57,087	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	We just don't have it yet or maybe Google pull the toys because
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:59,135	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's just not ready for anybody yet don't know yet
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:02,207	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The mystery will not be solved today
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:09,119	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Okay let's work at home security there are two notable stories here the first is the nest security system is
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,959	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	399 so $400 this is
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:15,519	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	This is a reduction in price by a hundred
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,287	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Box so
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:19,103	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Annie's get YouTube
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,639	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Presence fobs
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:24,479	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Security sensors that are multi-purpose sensors and
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,783	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Round thing that you
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,391	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And the keep
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,159	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Is there a
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:35,487	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You know it's built into the Top of the Hub
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:37,023	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	A little funky design
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:40,607	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Right
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:42,399	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Your father over it to arm and disarm it it's
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:45,471	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	When is it still thread ready
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:47,519	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,543	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That is
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,567	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Notable
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:53,151	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Because people liked the security system they hated the fact that it
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:53,663	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Cost so much
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:54,943	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:56,479	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Perhaps
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:57,759	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	There's a reason to this
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,527	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Which is
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:01,855	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Rings home security system is going to launch
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,135	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Next month
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:05,951	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And when it launches
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:08,255	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's going to be
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:10,047	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The 99.
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:14,143	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Remember ring was purchased by Amazon
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:15,679	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	December
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,191	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,215	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	This is
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:18,751	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Ring / Amazon
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:22,079	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And it will include
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:23,615	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	A single motion sensor
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,919	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Single door window sensor
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,711	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	+ 8
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,223	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Keypad
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:32,319	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And this this one you should melt to a wall I would think
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,599	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I guess you can have it
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,647	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	On a table but I don't know
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,695	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And it's got this weird iPod
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,463	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Click wheel looking device
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:43,071	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:47,167	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I don't know about that either but that's okay I mean it's sticking out $200 less
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,703	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	$200 list
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:51,519	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I'm in the centers are relatively cheap you buy a motion sensor
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,055	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Next door windows
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:19:01,247	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Are you surprised I mean we knew this was coming because of something else last year but then they were lawsuits until when I think this was
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:04,319	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Back in October was supposed to be out for was announced back then
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:10,719	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Are you surprised because since then Amazon has purchased ring that there's no Amazon branding no
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:11,487	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	No
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:14,559	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Bundling with a Amazon camera ring like that
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:16,607	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	No I'm not actually surprised because
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:18,655	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Does Amazon has
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,423	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They fought
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,191	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Plenty of companies in
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:21,471	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Twitch
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,519	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Zappos
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,823	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Some of their bigger Acquisitions that kept alone
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:27,871	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And bring has a great brand record
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,383	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Ignition in in
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:30,175	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:31,711	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It makes total sense to me
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:34,271	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That people might buy ring
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:35,039	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Not realizing
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:38,111	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I would like to see
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:39,647	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You know
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:42,463	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Ring has the doorbell camera that have outdoor cameras
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:45,279	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I would like to see a package that includes some of that be
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:45,791	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Because I think it
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,071	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You know
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,351	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It will take
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:50,655	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But I wonder if we are not seeing it be
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,167	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Because
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,471	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Amazon also bought a company called
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:55,775	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Link and they have some really good video Pro
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:57,311	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Processing technology very low power
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:00,383	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So I'm wondering if we'll see a new camera soon
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,175	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That goes with
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:04,479	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The Amazon key system or the
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:06,015	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Ties into this that uses
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:07,295	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That hard
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,319	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:13,439	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That's a good point and possibly need doorbell cuz I believe the blink doorbell
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,487	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yes they're still planning to make that
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:16,511	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Right
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:17,535	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Right
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:19,583	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So you don't maybe they'll have a
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:22,911	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	A higher antenna Lauren like amazonbasics
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:25,471	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I don't know
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:28,031	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:31,359	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Other final two little stories worth mentioning
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:31,871	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	1
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,407	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Microsoft hololens
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:34,943	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Is coming next
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,223	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Your whole inspiration
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:36,735	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	2
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:39,295	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And I put this in here because
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:44,927	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The Holland is really interesting for a R&B are in industrial settings there's a couple companies
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:45,695	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Already using it
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,535	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I know it's a little weird
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:51,327	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I'll be honest you know that's not
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:53,119	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	For us but I have it
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,631	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Several
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,679	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Industrial
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:57,727	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Iot events I've actually done some
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:00,287	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Repairs in VR
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:02,847	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	For like industrial process control systems
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:03,871	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Guided by you know
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,687	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I put on the hololens and they would guide me through the steps
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:10,271	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I can see how this would be really useful
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:11,551	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And that sort of setting
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:16,159	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	For that for emergency services all kinds of
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:18,720	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	On the field types of activities yes
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:19,488	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:21,024	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I know and you know
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:25,632	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's a beauty good experience the hololens is actually.
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:27,424	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Cool
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:28,192	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	There we go
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,728	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And then finally
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:34,336	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Hans vestberg is now Verizon's new CEO replacing Lowell McAdam
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:37,920	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And I brought this up because I have known Hans
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:41,760	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	For years because he was the CEO of Ericsson
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,296	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	After being
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:46,880	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Kicked out of his CEO role at Ericsson in 26
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,648	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	16
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:50,720	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	He popped up last year as a CTO at Verizon
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:51,744	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:57,632	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	This was a surprise to Wall Street this was a surprise to pretty much everyone when Verizon announced him it is
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:59,424	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	In this role a couple analyst for like
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:02,496	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yeah it wasn't that great over at Ericsson
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:03,520	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	However
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:04,800	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I will say
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:07,616	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But he was very Visionary about the Internet of Things
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:11,968	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Turning Erikson's product-based business into a Services business
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:12,992	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:14,784	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	He knows a lot about 5.
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:16,064	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:18,624	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I think those are really good reasons to put him in
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,416	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	A Verizon I think
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:25,280	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	With Erickson originally he was trying to turn around a company
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:29,376	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	When the Telco equipment Market just
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:29,888	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It was
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:31,168	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Killer it was
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:33,216	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Broken
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:36,800	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And he was really pushing 5G a little too early
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:37,824	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	In
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,360	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That the market
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:40,896	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Fertel, equipment hits
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:41,664	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Consolidated
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,176	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Tremendously
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,456	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Martinsville
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,224	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	West End
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:44,736	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And he just
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:47,296	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's a little too early on iot and 5G
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:52,672	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That's that's my take on his tenure there so having him at Verizon
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:56,256	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	We're there already investing in 5G
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:59,840	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They need that Visionary plan for how to build services around it
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:01,632	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I think he's actually a good
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:06,240	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That's that's my take on that I wish him the best of
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:07,520	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	If you want to hear
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,312	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Vim Hans
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:11,104	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Hans was on the podcast in
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:15,200	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	2016 before he was kicked out of his job at Eric's
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:15,968	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Senso
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:19,808	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	What episode number 56 you can actually hear him talk about iot and
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:20,320	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And what matters
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,112	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And that
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:27,232	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	No that doesn't include our show today
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:31,328	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I was I was all excited but know we're going to talk about the wyze pan cam
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,352	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Which is
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:33,376	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	My new toy
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:37,216	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	This is a
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,264	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	2999
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:39,776	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Camera
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:42,080	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You do pay shipping and handling
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:42,592	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Think so
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:45,920	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But cheap camera
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,224	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Lot of fun
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:51,040	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	All the functions of the wise to camso it
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,832	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	7 sorry
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:54,112	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	720 or
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:56,672	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	1080 HD
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,464	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And it moves
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:03,584	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It moves 93° up and down and it moves 360 degrees on the horizontal
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:06,144	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It doesn't go around in a full circle it goes
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:07,424	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Around all the way and then
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:08,704	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Comes back the other way
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:10,240	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:13,312	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The daytime video is about 15 frames per second
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,080	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So it's
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:15,360	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's a little choppy but
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:17,152	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Night vision
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:17,920	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	10 frames per second
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:18,944	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Awesome night
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,992	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And two way
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:21,504	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Audio
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,296	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Plus
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:24,320	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	14 days
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:25,344	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Alert videos
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:27,136	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So that's 14 days for free
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:28,672	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yay
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,464	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:31,488	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The stuff is
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:32,768	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Independent
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:33,280	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Caption
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:34,816	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They do use AES when
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:37,376	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So it's not quite Bankrate
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:38,656	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But pretty good
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:45,312	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And there was question about where the data is stored where it goes I remember some
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,872	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Listeners asking about that
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:51,712	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And I think originally wise was working with a sum
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:53,504	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Vendors in China but now
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:59,648	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	From a cloud perspective the date is all kept in the US the cameras are manufactured in China
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,696	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And the
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:04,768	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Why is people are really focused on the software experience their use
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,304	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Razor thin margin
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:09,376	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	My stuff in the cloud stuff is hosted in
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:10,912	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Aw
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:13,216	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So these guys are former Amazon
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,264	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Some software is built here
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:16,544	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Stuff is hosted here
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:17,568	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Karim rashid
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:19,360	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:21,152	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That is
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,688	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Really I mean
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,224	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The overall
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,272	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Experience with this is
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,296	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Really good
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,576	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But you can set it to track
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:30,880	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Motion so
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:33,952	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The camera will like pan wherever it sees motion which
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:34,720	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Just totally
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:35,488	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Be creepy
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:37,024	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Just walk around your house
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:41,632	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I'm some people did ask how loud the motor is
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:42,144	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It is not that
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:43,936	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:47,008	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The downside is this only works with wise and if
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:48,800	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Services
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:49,824	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:52,128	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	This is not like a homekit thing this is
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:54,688	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	With anything else it's just those things right now
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:55,712	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:26:02,880	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yeah and then the same applies to the non pan-and-tilt version which is $10 less expensive
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:04,160	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Which is the one I bought so
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:06,720	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Very similar just you're getting
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:10,048	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That creepy but cool tracking with the pinto
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:13,632	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yes and you can also set it up so it'll actually go through
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:14,144	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Through
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,704	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Traumatologist like
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:19,264	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Goes around hits all four points
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:20,544	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Of the circle
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:22,592	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And you can actually set custom point
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:23,872	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:26,944	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	If there's something like in the way like a pillar if you can actually set your point
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:28,480	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	To not stop at the
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:28,992	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Pellerin stop
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:35,904	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So with a battery pack and a Roomba I could actually make a little robot that
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:37,184	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Scans around the house
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,976	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yes this is wired so you plug it in
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,256	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,536	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It can take an SD card
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:43,584	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So you can store your stuff
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,376	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	On an SD card should you
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:47,680	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:51,776	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That's the product I like it if you're in the market for a camera
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:53,312	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I would say
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:58,432	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	This is really cheap it's really easy it doesn't do facial recognition or anything fancy but
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:02,784	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	30 minutes
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:05,344	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So or 20 if you want the smaller one
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:06,880	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Are the non moving
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:08,160	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The non-motorized one
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:10,208	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	All right and now

EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:14,976	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	This week's question comes from a nameless individual and covers for alarm system panel from quality
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:18,304	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Hey want to know what you guys think of the
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:20,352	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Qolsys IQ panel
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:21,120	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They both
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:22,400	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	A lot of
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:24,448	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Z-Wave and
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:28,032	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Security compatibility yunnan compatibility for things like
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:29,312	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Blood Centers in
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:31,360	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Security sensors in
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:33,152	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You know everything in addition to
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:37,504	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Email to connect with alarm.com to do cameras and doorbell video cameras and
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:42,368	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	CCD getting a lot of attention but wanted to know your thoughts on it
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:44,160	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Okay
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:44,672	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Heaven
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:45,952	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:48,000	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Should we talk about her suspicions first
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:52,864	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Well I do find it interesting that there's no caller name and the
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:58,752	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Phone area code comes from the same area code where qolsys is marketing department is it
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:05,664	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yeah it's still a good question and I learned a little bit about this panel which I have not heard about before you have though this is the IQ
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:06,432	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	IQ panel 2
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:11,808	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yes so there's two qolsys panels there's the first generation IQ panel and then there's the IQ panel
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:13,856	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's a good product
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:15,648	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I'm I'm not going to say that it is not
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:16,928	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	A good product
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:17,952	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	There's a lot of caveat
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:21,280	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But let's talk about some of the cool things about it the software looks
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:22,816	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Really good it works with
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:23,840	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Z-Wave stuff
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:25,376	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And it also works with it
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:26,912	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Proprietary line of sight
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:28,448	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Take their
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:30,240	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Has cellular backup
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:31,520	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So yay
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:34,592	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And it has Bluetooth disarming so
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:36,384	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You can leave your phone in your pocket and
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:37,408	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Disarm
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:39,456	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So you don't have to enter your code
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:41,760	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That sounds like a camera so you can see pictures
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:42,528	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The people who try to
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:45,856	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	These are really nice feature
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:47,648	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:48,416	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	There's some
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:48,928	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	There's something
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:49,952	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	We don't love them
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:50,976	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Such as
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:57,888	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Will you have to choose your wireless service provider for the LTE backup in advance
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:30:01,728	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I'm so if you ever change providers that's obviously an issue
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:05,056	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So you can go three or four models one that works with Verizon
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:07,616	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	One that works with AT&T and one with Telus
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:13,248	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Also you can install this as a DIY but you're going to need a service contract
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:14,272	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	For this to work
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:17,600	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	There's no actual app for this that we could find
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:18,880	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So you
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:20,672	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Send you actually to the alarm.com app
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:21,184	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Which makes
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,464	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Because alarm.com
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:23,744	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Large.
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:25,536	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Of
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:26,048	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Monitor dolar
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:27,584	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:28,864	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Probably your ideal forever
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:34,240	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Can I get the business model they work with Distributors and dealers in
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:37,568	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Service providers such as alarm.com and I'm so
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:40,640	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	My first thought of my always feels on Android
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:45,504	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's got Z-Wave it's got LCD Wi-Fi Bluetooth on like this could be My Hub
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:49,856	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I went that's when we went searching for the app and found there's really no app for it you have to
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,136	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	UC
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:55,232	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You know an alarm.com app and I have a subscription to that and so on so forth so
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,000	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	This is
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:31:00,096	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I wouldn't self-install at this point because I can't do anything once I install it
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:03,680	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's a good Hub I have actually
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:04,960	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The two
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:06,496	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's a it's a similar
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:07,520	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Panel hub
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:08,032	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Called
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:09,312	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	2gig
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:10,848	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:11,616	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And I never used
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:12,384	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Is it at all because
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:13,152	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Cuz I don't have
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:13,664	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Amana turtle
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:16,224	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	There's another tub

EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:27,488	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And that actually has its own app
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:30,304	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's about three hundred and eighty bucks
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:31,328	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:33,888	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You know that might be a better option if

EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,552	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I'm even while Stacy how are you
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:32,160	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Super great thank you so much for coming on the show I remember the
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:33,184	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The formation of
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:34,464	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Current way back
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:35,488	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	My gosh was it
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:42,144	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That's right yeah we're we're coming up on three years here
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:45,984	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Okay so before we get started let's tell everybody
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:46,496	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	What it is
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:47,776	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Set current
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:56,224	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Show current is a the business within GE we're born of our lighting businesses
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:58,528	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Transition to an LED business
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:04,928	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I so we use LEDs as an opportunity to lead into our customers
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:11,072	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And follow that very quickly with a digital offering to create what we call and intelligent environment
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:13,376	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Okay that sounds super exciting
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:14,656	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Let's drive a little bit deeper in
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,472	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	When you guys formed
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:18,240	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Current
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,008	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It was a
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:21,056	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Understanding that both lighting
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:22,592	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Easy way to get into
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:23,872	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Businesses
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:24,640	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Because everyone was
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,408	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Transitioning over to
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:27,712	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But also
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:30,528	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Opportunities
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:31,040	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Not just
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:32,320	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Lighting
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:35,136	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Power generation
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:35,904	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And other services
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:36,928	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	SoCal
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:39,744	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	How all of that works
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:40,256	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Together is part of
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:42,816	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:44,608	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So we find
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:48,960	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Our conversations with our customers often times most the time I would say
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:51,264	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Really start with LEDs
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:54,848	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Which is a great way to get in and save about
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:56,640	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Your electricity cost
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:57,920	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	As it relates to lighting
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:04,832	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So that is a really good starting point for conversation with a customer around energy energy
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:10,464	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Efficiency Energy savings the carbon emissions associated with that and what we do very quickly from there
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:14,560	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Transition the conversation from one Focus solely on lighting
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:17,632	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The one that's looking really more holistically at
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:24,032	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Complete building envelope so being able to access monitor and improve the efficiency of the
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:29,664	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Operations of all building subsistence are going from lighting and hcac to plug load
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:30,432	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And so forth
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:37,856	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So we do that in a really interesting way so we'll go in and as I said we lead with lighting from there
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:43,232	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	People then get pretty interested in managing the rest of their building subsystem
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:46,048	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And so what we do is put in place
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:51,680	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Edge technology that allows us to tap into the different assets that exist
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:54,752	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Ennis in a particular customers environment
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:57,056	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Or to go in and augment
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:57,824	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That environment
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:01,920	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And so often times a place that people start is with lighting controls
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:06,784	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	We need use a monitor describe our architecture
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:10,112	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Call that we refer to as open on the top and open on the bottom
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:16,768	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And if we really start with that open on the bottom concept the key word there is really interoperability
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:23,680	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So we can go in and leverage whatever type of edge infrastructure investment our customers have made
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:27,520	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	If they have existing sensors or controllers and place
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:29,824	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	We can reuse those
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:35,200	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	If they don't have existing infrastructure we can certainly put that in as as part of the
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:35,968	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Appointments
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:42,368	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Sweet hurry holistically sense and control does building environments to drive energy
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:44,160	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Efficiency musing are all Sites
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:48,512	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Application is a cloud-based application
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:53,376	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Idolizes to not only gain insights but to develop
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:54,912	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Optimization
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:37:01,056	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Strategies as well as been pushed control back to the edge across an entire Enterprise portfolio
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:03,104	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And it seems like this came along
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:04,640	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Just the right time
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:06,944	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Using
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:07,456	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Lightning is away
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:08,992	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Control
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:10,784	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Thanks and I say this
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:13,344	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Because LEDs are so efficient
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:15,392	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Any company that was making lights
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:16,672	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Suddenly had this
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,696	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Moment of life
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:21,792	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Holy cow we're selling these bulbs that are going to last forever and now we've got a
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:23,584	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Switch our business model.
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,632	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Cuz selling light bulbs that died
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:26,912	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Every
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:27,424	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	20 years
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:31,264	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's very different
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:35,104	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Was partially a response to turning
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:36,384	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Product business
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:36,896	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Listen to a service
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:44,832	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yeah that's right and I think you're exactly right LEDs have really turned
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:51,232	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It really changed the the industry so they're really great for people like you and I infer for our customer
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,280	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	What are there cities or building
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:59,680	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Have you said they use 50% less energy but they do tend to last quite a bit longer which is a big part of the volume
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:06,080	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Position in addition to the Energy savings that did put us down the path of trying to reimagine what can we
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:12,480	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Now I think LED is is in a good spot you know when we talk about the LED conversion process that's happening
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:13,760	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Out there the industry today
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:19,136	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	We like to say we're somewhere in the second inning so I think there's still a lot of Runway left
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:25,536	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	As it relates to getting in there and helping customers have better Energy Efficiency better lighting solutions through LED
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:29,632	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's certainly as we start to look at the evolution of our business model
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:35,264	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Digital is played a big role in that so we talked a bit about the Energy Efficiency components
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:37,568	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That are part of the business model
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:43,968	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	What we're now doing the same that's a really good place to start but there's a lot more that we can do to add value
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:44,992	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Due to our customers
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,528	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	If we think about using
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:52,672	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That digital infrastructure that I described earlier as a way to deliver energy-efficiency
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:56,512	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You can also flip that into live there other types of business
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:57,792	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Productivity outcomes
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:39:01,376	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	For our customers using that same infrastructure
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:03,936	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The way that we do that
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:09,824	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Insta take all of that data all those insights that were capturing in generating created
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:13,408	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Stream those out to a 3rd party ecosystem
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:19,808	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So we've recognized our customers of recognize the value of that data coming back to that idea
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:25,696	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Open on the top and look on the bottom is open on the top really means that the data that were capturing
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:26,464	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Is
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:30,816	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Readily accessible by our ecosystem or directly by our customers
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:37,216	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And that opens up tremendous opportunity for customers to go and do things like space utilisation or
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:39,008	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Retail Analytics
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:44,640	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Or workflow management in industrial environment really a preamble set of opportunities
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:46,432	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I know it's so cool
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:50,272	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So when your customers start understanding
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:52,320	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	What they can do with this
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:53,344	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Are they doing it
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:55,904	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You guys are they doing it is a
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:56,416	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Pull from
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:57,952	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Other platform
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:58,464	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Azar software
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:00,768	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Cuz this gets into this
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:02,048	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Iot is an ecosystem
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:03,584	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And I feel like
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:05,632	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's such a vast ecosystem right now.
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,936	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	People are unaware of the
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:08,448	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Potential of some
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:09,984	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The things they can
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:11,520	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	What they can do
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:13,312	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So how do you guys cut
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:14,592	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Market
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:15,104	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	To that
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:16,384	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	With your partner's out
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:25,600	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yeah so we approach it with our partners absolutely hand-in-hand and I think you hit on a couple of different trends
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:30,464	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Are happening out there that people are really starting to wrap their heads around about what they do about it
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:35,328	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So one of the really wonderful statistics out there in the world of Statistics is this
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:41,216	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	By 2020 you'll have about seven and a half billion connected business in points
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:46,848	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	In this whole iot world and that's growing at about a 33% kegger from today
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:50,432	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Which means there's a tremendous amount of intelligence
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:54,784	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's being created and I think our customers are starting to realize
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:41:01,184	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Hey this all of this data out there is really great but we actually have to be able to do something with it and so what we've
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:03,744	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Recognizing what we readily admit is this
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:10,144	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	We look at all of that data where we do a really good job of capturing it of transforming it of making it avail
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:13,728	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Edible and using it ourselves to our own software applications
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:15,520	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	To deliver Energy Efficiency
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:21,920	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	We recognize though that the opportunity so that data to deliver other types of outcome is is real
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:23,968	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Satan bound
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:30,368	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	We go hand-in-hand with our partners in our ecosystem to go to our customers to help highlight
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:32,416	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Like the opportunity of leveraging
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:37,280	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	A single digital backbone to create not on the Energy Efficiency opportunities
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:39,584	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It also business productivity opportune
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:43,680	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And the way that I see the market evolving right now is that
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:47,776	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You have customers who understand that value proposition that this whole
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:54,431	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Connected in points the the growing iot space is going to create lots of opportunities for the
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:42:00,831	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Historically for customers that have been forward-looking and and and identify that opportunity
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:03,391	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They really put in place Point Solutions
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:08,255	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The cast of the data to power the individual applications at their interest in pursuing
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:11,583	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	What we do though is something that's quite a bit different
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:13,375	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So think of it almost feels like
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:20,287	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The mobile phone for your building or the mobile phone for your city and you've got a single set of Interest
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:22,079	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Structure that can be leveraged the power
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:24,127	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Any number of
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:29,759	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Actual software applications to deliver different types of outcomes to our customers and so
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:36,671	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	We absolutely do that hand in hand with the with our partners that leverage that data to deliver those other types of business
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:37,439	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Productivity outcomes
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:40,767	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Okay and you mentioned that you got you think that
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:41,535	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That lighting
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:42,559	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Is it second in
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:44,607	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So I'm very curious
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:46,143	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Where you see
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:47,423	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	This going
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:48,959	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And how far baby
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:51,519	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	A part of this
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:52,031	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Throw in there
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:54,079	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Some of your competitors in
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:54,591	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Lighting space
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:55,615	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Also
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:57,151	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Just made some
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:57,663	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Acquisition
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:00,991	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Osram body

EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:05,087	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Enlighted
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:06,111	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Both of these
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:10,463	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They seem to be catching on to this trend and so
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:12,255	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Where do you see it
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:12,767	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It going
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:14,815	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Where We Are
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:23,519	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yeah so I think the market is really going to evolve pretty rapidly I think it's in the next couple of years where we
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:28,639	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Reduce the other people identifying this opportunity which would take it as a great compliment
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:35,039	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	We did our own acquisition of daintree which was at its core a
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:39,647	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Serves as the foundation for our intelligent building
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:42,975	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Portfolio particularly to the edge technology
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:46,303	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It was really born out of a lighting controls play
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:50,911	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But it allows you to tap into hundreds and hundreds
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:57,311	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Literally thousands of types of devices out there to deliver whatever type of outcome someone's interested in whether that's like
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:44:00,127	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Controls HD AC controls or
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:01,151	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	People counting
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:07,551	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And I think we start to see more of our competitors going in that direction as well
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:12,415	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Well I think one of the really important parts as this industry evolved
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:14,975	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Other people are going to identify as
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:17,791	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It needs to be an interoperable
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:24,191	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Open system to be able to take advantage of all of the new innovation all the new technology
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:27,007	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Whether that's a new sensor type whether that's a
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:28,799	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	A new software application
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:32,383	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The making sure that from an in customer perspective
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:33,663	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	They have a single
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:40,575	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Digital backbone that they'll be able to leverage into whatever type of business outcome they ultimately wanted to cheat with
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:42,623	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Whether that's something they want to do today
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:47,487	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Next year or five years from now they've got to make sure that they've got a system
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:52,095	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	To allow them to flex and grow as we all discover what the future brings
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:53,375	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Okay
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:54,911	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:55,679	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	How you guys
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:57,215	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Pair for that
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:57,727	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	On the business side
EDL	00:44:58,239	00:44:59,775	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You are a chief digital officer
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:01,055	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	When current
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:01,823	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	First came out
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:03,359	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It was a slightly different
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:04,383	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Opposition
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:05,919	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	There's talk about price
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:06,943	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Things based on
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:08,735	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The Energy savings off
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:10,783	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And I feel like it's
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:11,295	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It shifted
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:17,183	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Bearden ever-changing world so that makes sense so where are you guys
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:18,207	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Today when it come
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:19,231	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Pricing
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:20,767	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Where do you think
EDL	00:45:21,279	00:45:21,791	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Could want
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:29,215	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yasso current has been a story of evolution and transformation absolutely when we
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:35,615	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Said the company was really very much focused almost exclusively around the energy play
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:42,015	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Which was really interesting and you started to think about some really far Out Concepts as it relates to Birch
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:42,783	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Power plants
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:49,183	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Peer-to-peer energy trading and how do you pull in things like that how do you price those types of offerings
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:52,255	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Switch because not a lot of time talking about that
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:56,607	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	By itself I think we're wheelsamillion landed was that those types of markets
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:58,399	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Are going to be a little bit
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:00,703	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Farther Along before they fully mature
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:06,591	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Which is fine I think we're positioning ourselves really nicely to be the behind-the-meter in points
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:11,711	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	To play in those types of business models in this hexoskin does Market opportunities
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:13,503	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	When they come to fruition
EDL	00:46:13,503	00:46:19,903	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But in the interim we're running the are intelligent environments play which is also an interesting time
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:26,303	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Business modeling and pricing scheme so are we mentioned that you have a mobile phone as
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:31,167	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It is an analogy for how our model works and I come back to that n**** just
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:32,703	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I'm break it down a little bit more
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:39,103	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Where if you think of the mobile phone is as your Edge Hardware that's something that people are used to consume and then
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:45,503	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Game 4 and they buy it they own it it's it's their phone or in our case it's it's our sensors controls Gateway
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:51,903	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So far the service is pisto that sits on top of that I think is where it starts to become really interesting and
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:55,743	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You know if you would step back and just look at technology Evolution over the last
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:58,047	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And yours are so I think we're not in a spot where
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:47:04,447	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	People are very comfortable with with service offerings in particular software-as-a-service so when we think about the business
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:07,519	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's fine that we now all the sudden have
EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:10,079	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	A recurring annuity that gets put in place
EDL	00:47:10,079	00:47:16,479	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I'm with the different applications that are being purchased for those are things that we built ourselves like also
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:21,343	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Whether there's a partner applications that our customers are going to ultimately be consuming
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:23,903	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	In this model I'm going to test how far we can take
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:24,415	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Take this analogy
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:26,975	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	If I am a building owner and I buy
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:28,511	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Relating to Center
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:29,279	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Where's the Gateway
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:31,327	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	In many cases this is technology
EDL	00:47:31,327	00:47:31,839	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It's going to be bought
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:36,191	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Two maybe three
EDL	00:47:37,471	00:47:39,263	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So think about it from that in
EDL	00:47:39,775	00:47:42,335	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	There is some replacement Happening Here
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:43,871	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But it becomes much more
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:45,151	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	For you to also have
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:47,199	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Something on the services side
EDL	00:47:48,479	00:47:48,991	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The business
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:56,671	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yeah that's right I think swing back to that the hardware piece of then we can go Services next
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:48:03,583	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I think I'm Hardware side the nice thing about it is that you're not just buying a single iPhone and stick in your building
EDL	00:48:03,583	00:48:09,983	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Replace it when the next iPhone comes out what's really nice about having the open architecture is that you can
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:10,751	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Upgrade
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:17,151	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Your Edge hardware for the building you can upgrade the quote-unquote mobile phone for your building as new techno
EDL	00:48:17,151	00:48:23,551	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Knology comes online so you're essentially future proofing your Edge architecture by putting in place.
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:24,575	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Interoperable
EDL	00:48:24,575	00:48:25,599	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:27,647	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	In-N-Out on the services side
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:34,047	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	There's going to be continued Innovation as it relates to the different types of applications that come
EDL	00:48:34,047	00:48:39,423	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I'm online and leverage. Data whether that's the date of this being created and generated today
EDL	00:48:39,423	00:48:43,007	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Or if you look forward you know couple years down the road when
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:47,615	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The new whiz-bang sensor comes online that nobody's even thought of today
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:54,015	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I ain't coming back to you if you've got an interoperable open Edge platform that can take that in
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:57,599	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Consume it now all the sudden you can access that new type of data
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:49:00,159	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Let's go into this
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:02,719	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The idea of increasing size
EDL	00:49:02,719	00:49:03,487	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Occasionally
EDL	00:49:03,487	00:49:05,023	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	What kind of flight current started out
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:06,815	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Because
EDL	00:49:06,815	00:49:08,095	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I loved it cuz I'm a journal
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:10,655	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I love that it was so forward
EDL	00:49:11,423	00:49:14,239	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Cool and like all my God is amazing I can see the future
EDL	00:49:15,007	00:49:16,543	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I can see why people were like
EDL	00:49:17,567	00:49:18,591	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So how do you
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:19,359	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Get the market
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:19,871	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Get ready for that
EDL	00:49:20,383	00:49:21,151	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	How do you know
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:23,199	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Time and do you have a
EDL	00:49:24,223	00:49:25,247	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Evolve what you sell
EDL	00:49:26,015	00:49:26,527	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Into some
EDL	00:49:27,551	00:49:28,063	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Like that
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:29,855	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	That's a lot of questions of
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:31,391	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	But it's basically how do we get for
EDL	00:49:31,391	00:49:32,415	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	From here which is in a
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:33,951	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	2
EDL	00:49:34,975	00:49:35,743	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Crazier in
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:43,935	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So I'm glad you agree I think we're crazy cool what's happening now and I think
EDL	00:49:43,935	00:49:47,519	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Even brighter
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:53,663	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Is simply Market preparedness and bringing customers along with the journey and
EDL	00:49:55,199	00:49:56,479	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Evolution
EDL	00:49:56,479	00:50:00,319	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	A couple years ago if you were to go into a customer and you'd say
EDL	00:50:00,319	00:50:06,719	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Okay are we going to do an LED retrofit you know half the time the customer would say well I'm not so sure
EDL	00:50:06,719	00:50:13,119	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And now when you go in everybody recognizes hey doing LED is no brainer and saves 50% of my
EDL	00:50:13,119	00:50:16,447	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	My lighting energy it's got a tutu for your payback
EDL	00:50:16,447	00:50:19,007	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And it makes a ton of sense to go do
EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:23,871	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I would say we're in a similar point where the LED Market was a couple years ago
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:27,711	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Today as a relates to the digital adoption cycle where
EDL	00:50:28,223	00:50:34,623	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Not every customer is convinced it's something that they need to do that said I think we'll give this a bit of an advantage and
EDL	00:50:34,623	00:50:37,439	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Co-op from a market adoption perspective is it
EDL	00:50:37,951	00:50:40,255	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Number of the types
EDL	00:50:40,255	00:50:44,863	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Solutions as a relates to the software applications that we want to enable
EDL	00:50:44,863	00:50:47,935	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Are out there today and people are consuming them
EDL	00:50:47,935	00:50:54,335	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	What we're doing is giving them the real-time data that makes those Solutions even more powerful even more
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:55,871	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	More valuable to our customers
EDL	00:50:56,639	00:50:58,175	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And do you think you'll ever
EDL	00:50:58,175	00:50:58,943	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Reach that
EDL	00:50:58,943	00:50:59,711	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Partnership
EDL	00:50:59,711	00:51:00,479	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	What kind of role
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:01,247	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Where you're sharing
EDL	00:51:02,527	00:51:04,831	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Swear you're actually really moving the needle
EDL	00:51:07,135	00:51:07,647	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Consumption
EDL	00:51:11,231	00:51:17,631	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Yeah you know I think the other all of these ideas around as a service models that will pop up
EDL	00:51:17,631	00:51:24,031	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Which I think fits into a little bit what you're talking about there but do you think about energy as a service or space suit
EDL	00:51:24,031	00:51:25,055	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Realization of the service
EDL	00:51:25,567	00:51:31,199	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	There's a lot of really interesting models that are coming up and is part of those new models are coming online
EDL	00:51:31,967	00:51:38,367	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Customers are looking at shared-risk models to go along with it so you know as an example of
EDL	00:51:38,367	00:51:40,159	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Are there a lot of s goes out there
EDL	00:51:40,671	00:51:42,463	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Energy Services companies
EDL	00:51:42,463	00:51:48,863	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It will go in and and their business model is to take a portion of the savings energy saver
EDL	00:51:48,863	00:51:51,167	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The day enable for their customers
EDL	00:51:51,167	00:51:53,983	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Not today that's not a model that we are are
EDL	00:51:54,495	00:51:58,847	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Lighting you're pursuing it's really something that we've taken a look at and I think
EDL	00:51:58,847	00:52:04,223	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And we'll have to see how the market evolves in terms of where is that right balance
EDL	00:52:04,223	00:52:07,039	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Perspective simply
EDL	00:52:07,551	00:52:13,695	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Giving the tools and enabling the capabilities but ultimately up to the customer to achieve their own outcome
EDL	00:52:14,207	00:52:17,023	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I or will it evolve into something where
EDL	00:52:17,023	00:52:20,351	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Your service is really starts take over and it's
EDL	00:52:20,351	00:52:25,471	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The outcome that's being delivered as opposed to the tools to do it it's going to be interesting to see how eyeballs
EDL	00:52:26,239	00:52:27,519	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Man is it I am excited to see
EDL	00:52:28,031	00:52:28,543	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	IFit app
EDL	00:52:29,055	00:52:31,359	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	You and me both
EDL	00:52:31,359	00:52:33,151	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I would be remiss if I did not ask you
EDL	00:52:33,663	00:52:34,943	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Cuz GE right now
EDL	00:52:35,455	00:52:36,479	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Is in the headlines
EDL	00:52:36,991	00:52:38,015	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	With all kinds of
EDL	00:52:38,783	00:52:40,063	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Selling assets left and right
EDL	00:52:41,343	00:52:43,903	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Kinds of drama and a lot of that seems associated with it
EDL	00:52:43,903	00:52:44,927	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Digital transformation
EDL	00:52:45,439	00:52:46,207	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And so
EDL	00:52:46,207	00:52:47,999	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	GE lighting and
EDL	00:52:47,999	00:52:49,279	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Current are both
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:50,047	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	For sale
EDL	00:52:50,047	00:52:51,327	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So I just wanted to find out
EDL	00:52:51,839	00:52:52,607	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	From you
EDL	00:52:52,607	00:52:54,143	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Where that process is
EDL	00:52:54,911	00:52:56,191	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And understand
EDL	00:52:56,191	00:52:57,983	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Did ge's transformation is that
EDL	00:53:00,543	00:53:01,055	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Formation of
EDL	00:53:02,079	00:53:06,943	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Well I'd say a couple of things no one right now GE is really needing to
EDL	00:53:06,943	00:53:09,759	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	To go through eye refocusing exercise
EDL	00:53:10,271	00:53:16,671	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	And where they've landed is to say there are going to be three core businesses for GE going for lb 80
EDL	00:53:16,671	00:53:18,207	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Jason Aldean
EDL	00:53:18,207	00:53:23,327	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Healthcare in OB power and current today doesn't fit into that
EDL	00:53:23,327	00:53:25,119	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Inside configuration
EDL	00:53:25,119	00:53:31,519	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	So we're going out on our own as it works income will be finding new home over the next couple of court
EDL	00:53:31,519	00:53:33,823	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Which were excited about
EDL	00:53:33,823	00:53:40,223	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	I think she is got to focus right now they don't have time and effort and resources to focus on current so will be
EDL	00:53:40,223	00:53:41,247	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Going to a place
EDL	00:53:41,247	00:53:47,647	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	It does have that capability and capacity in uniform it from a digital transformation perspective I think
EDL	00:53:47,647	00:53:52,255	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Is really led the way for GE we are the first
EDL	00:53:52,255	00:53:58,655	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Truly digital industrial business with Angie's portfolio where we are enabling new types of
EDL	00:53:58,655	00:54:00,959	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Outcomes by combining both
EDL	00:54:00,959	00:54:07,359	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	The historic Hardware business in this case lighting and augmenting that to create new types of business model
EDL	00:54:07,359	00:54:13,759	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Those with the digital capabilities that we've been discussing their so we're really a first in that regard and we're really excited about
EDL	00:54:13,759	00:54:15,551	| IOT168A206-14-18 |	Stop taking that Ford in a new device
