EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:20,863	| IOT146 |	I would still like it
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,959	| IOT146 |	It seems like a lot of
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:28,031	| IOT146 |	Voice Services position as Solutions
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:29,567	| IOT146 |	4
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,359	| IOT146 |	Car manufacturer example
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,639	| IOT146 |	Just an all-in-one solution
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,783	| IOT146 |	Which of the Samsung company
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,575	| IOT146 |	Shut off their vision and
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,855	| IOT146 |	It wasn't you the voices
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,367	| IOT146 |	You just messing
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,695	| IOT146 |	Alright let's talk about Bixby
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:48,511	| IOT146 |	Because I mean other than I should say we talked
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:49,791	| IOT146 |	People
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,583	| IOT146 |	In one of the things I found really interesting
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:57,727	| IOT146 |	That the retail channel so the Best Buy's of the world are actually asking smart
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,495	| IOT146 |	Homemakers
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,519	| IOT146 |	Adwerx
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,151	| IOT146 |	Shelf space that way
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,711	| IOT146 |	And so if you don't have that
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:08,223	| IOT146 |	They're kind of like
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,551	| IOT146 |	Which I thought was pretty
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,855	| IOT146 |	Not smart because
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,903	| IOT146 |	Consumers are in the Best Buy in LA
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:21,791	| IOT146 |	System test taking time away from something else that person
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:25,119	| IOT146 |	EXO
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:29,727	| IOT146 |	Packaging that explains all this
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,519	| IOT146 |	Yes and
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:35,615	| IOT146 |	It's basically ended the standard
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:38,687	| IOT146 |	Forever
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:40,991	| IOT146 |	Nobody cares if it works with Madam
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,831	| IOT146 |	So like we said
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:48,159	| IOT146 |	Seaford over all of that underlines
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,463	| IOT146 |	We're done with that you guys
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:56,095	| IOT146 |	Is a lot more work for
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:01,471	| IOT146 |	Honeywell integrating with whirlpool
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,775	| IOT146 |	And getting these like silly features
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,615	| IOT146 |	Custom integration
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,895	| IOT146 |	Tens device by device
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,831	| IOT146 |	They're everywhere
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,415	| IOT146 |	Talk about Samsung
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:29,631	| IOT146 |	You and I were at the Samsung president
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,911	| IOT146 |	3 years ago
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:35,007	| IOT146 |	Laughing a lot
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:39,359	| IOT146 |	It was precy at 3 Oliver coyote craziness it was right after the Bots
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:41,407	| IOT146 |	And oh my gosh
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,199	| IOT146 |	Everything
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,503	| IOT146 |	Work together
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,879	| IOT146 |	Do you remember what it was
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:56,511	| IOT146 |	Did you hear anything
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,303	| IOT146 |	Mention
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,839	| IOT146 |	In the Press event
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:01,375	| IOT146 |	45
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:03,935	| IOT146 |	And I would say
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,983	| IOT146 |	35 minute timer
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,431	| IOT146 |	Very different
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,455	| IOT146 |	For us and our listeners
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,831	| IOT146 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:22,111	| IOT146 |	Bixby
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:24,927	| IOT146 |	So it seems to me and I have not been able to
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:27,231	| IOT146 |	Samsung
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:37,727	| IOT146 |	And you know what good for them for realizing it when they have
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,335	| IOT146 |	Netflix.
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:46,175	| IOT146 |	Stihl brand
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,455	| IOT146 |	And that's what it was
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,223	| IOT146 |	They are
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:50,271	| IOT146 |	Coming out with things on their watches
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:03,583	| IOT146 |	Which I think is
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:06,911	| IOT146 |	Great for them and make it award
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:13,311	| IOT146 |	They probably will because
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:18,687	| IOT146 |	Message. And other people
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,967	| IOT146 |	Washers that still work
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:23,807	| IOT146 |	I would expect them to you as well my take on it is
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,087	| IOT146 |	If it works with smart
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:25,855	| IOT146 |	Things today
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:28,159	| IOT146 |	It still will work on forward
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,183	| IOT146 |	I don't think they're going to
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:29,695	| IOT146 |	Limit.
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,255	| IOT146 |	Underlying
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:34,047	| IOT146 |	Federer
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:37,887	| IOT146 |	Did not know it was another thing I was waiting for them to
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,167	| IOT146 |	But that's good
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:44,799	| IOT146 |	As consumers don't care about that you know
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,103	| IOT146 |	Everett tweakers
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:47,615	| IOT146 |	I just want to
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,455	| IOT146 |	You think together
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:53,759	| IOT146 |	And that was really promising to hear
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:57,599	| IOT146 |	I mentioned Bixby in the car that has Harmon showing of 13
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,367	| IOT146 |	Autonomous cars
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,647	| IOT146 |	Disable Bixby
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,439	| IOT146 |	Drive me to 7 South
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:06,047	| IOT146 |	Their clients as well they showed their start fresh again
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,327	| IOT146 |	Expedient
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:11,423	| IOT146 |	It would recognize two different people voices together different morning briefing
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:13,471	| IOT146 |	Stop that we have with others
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,495	| IOT146 |	Nice to see them
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,103	| IOT146 |	War
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:25,247	| IOT146 |	Because I'm a
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,271	| IOT146 |	Industrial iot
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:31,903	| IOT146 |	Memes
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:33,695	| IOT146 |	You guys are like what
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,231	| IOT146 |	These are basically like analog
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:39,071	| IOT146 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:49,567	| IOT146 |	So they had
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,591	| IOT146 |	Really low
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,871	| IOT146 |	Power accelerometer
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,479	| IOT146 |	But this guy
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,527	| IOT146 |	Microwatts
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:00,319	| IOT146 |	Which is so small
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:07,231	| IOT146 |	Tracking
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:13,375	| IOT146 |	Instead of using magnets
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,799	| IOT146 |	So you start
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,567	| IOT146 |	See you later
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:25,919	| IOT146 |	It's not just what the sensor measures but also like
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,991	| IOT146 |	Inference
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:33,087	| IOT146 |	Really. So I'm excited to see what people might
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,391	| IOT146 |	That's the other thing that I thought it was
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,159	| IOT146 |	Wicked cool
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:37,183	| IOT146 |	Was they have a memes
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:40,255	| IOT146 |	What is
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:46,655	| IOT146 |	Zoom in and out with a projector HD
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,543	| IOT146 |	How to do it
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:56,127	| IOT146 |	And it's small enough
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,663	| IOT146 |	30
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,175	| IOT146 |	7
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,455	| IOT146 |	Millimeter
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:03,807	| IOT146 |	Fit inside like an Amazon Echo
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:07,135	| IOT146 |	Semiconductor
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:11,487	| IOT146 |	Because they
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:13,791	| IOT146 |	Chauffeur
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,303	| IOT146 |	New display
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,375	| IOT146 |	Especially when
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:22,239	| IOT146 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,775	| IOT146 |	Z-Wave ships out there I should talk to
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:26,847	| IOT146 |	They offer
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,383	| IOT146 |	Your battery life
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,407	| IOT146 |	Z-Wave sensor
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,991	| IOT146 |	So awesome
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,319	| IOT146 |	Used
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:39,391	| IOT146 |	You can color better managers sleep basic
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,719	| IOT146 |	So those are coming out
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:43,231	| IOT146 |	Andrea
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,047	| IOT146 |	Crazy low-power in r
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:50,399	| IOT146 |	And speaking of Z
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:12:02,431	| IOT146 |	Which I really like that does like my WeMo Insight switch to your energy
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,223	| IOT146 |	We also have a USB
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:06,527	| IOT146 |	Something else
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:09,855	| IOT146 |	So I don't have to go by the
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,207	| IOT146 |	Not only that but
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,999	| IOT146 |	Energy
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,023	| IOT146 |	Drawn that us
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,727	| IOT146 |	Sbarro
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,519	| IOT146 |	It got me thinking about
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:29,567	| IOT146 |	Use cases for
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:30,079	| IOT146 |	Devices
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,991	| IOT146 |	But when
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,015	| IOT146 |	You turn on your
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:40,063	| IOT146 |	Bedroom light in the morning if your lamp
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,599	| IOT146 |	Waking up before the sun comes up
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:44,927	| IOT146 |	Power draw that's now being modern
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,231	| IOT146 |	Good morning
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:51,071	| IOT146 |	I never thought of using power fluctuation as
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:57,983	| IOT146 |	Everything in my
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:02,079	| IOT146 |	They don't like using voice that's fine
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:14,879	| IOT146 |	I do I do
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:19,487	| IOT146 |	His voice is not the right contacts at 1
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:20,511	| IOT146 |	Good morning
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,839	| IOT146 |	I know she's not a new
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:27,423	| IOT146 |	Probably going to be tomorrow
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:28,191	| IOT146 |	Jester
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:34,847	| IOT146 |	Describe that a little bit better so what is the fibaro gesture thing Hill
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:38,431	| IOT146 |	I forget the exact it looks like a small
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:38,943	| IOT146 |	Picture frame
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:45,343	| IOT146 |	Just Chester like the other four stroke oil it uses
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:49,183	| IOT146 |	Some kind of radio waves and by using your hand
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:53,535	| IOT146 |	And that's how it knows what the gesture is I think is about 6 different chest
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,863	| IOT146 |	Swipe the magic
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:59,167	| IOT146 |	Albus White
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:04,799	| IOT146 |	Because that
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:06,591	| IOT146 |	Situation
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:11,455	| IOT146 |	Whatever is going to sleep you know I tell that I made a gym
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,735	| IOT146 |	I can just
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:15,551	| IOT146 |	Wave my hand over this thing one way and dim the lights
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,063	| IOT146 |	I can
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,463	| IOT146 |	It is also
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,511	| IOT146 |	Howard or white
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:31,423	| IOT146 |	Because that leads into where I might actually put it
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:35,007	| IOT146 |	I may I have a little
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:40,639	| IOT146 |	This actually works to wake up to an inch of almost any
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:51,135	| IOT146 |	I just literally wave my hand one of six different ways over my little table and
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:57,279	| IOT146 |	I need to get out of the voices for everything
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,047	| IOT146 |	Because it is
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,911	| IOT146 |	Exactly and that's why I took
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:04,703	| IOT146 |	Coveted
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:05,727	| IOT146 |	The challenge
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,055	| IOT146 |	Doesn't work
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:10,847	| IOT146 |	Call hubs
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:13,407	| IOT146 |	Right we did chat about that
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:17,247	| IOT146 |	If you're going to use for bar prices
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,015	| IOT146 |	Probably better off
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,039	| IOT146 |	With a SmartThings Hub
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:29,279	| IOT146 |	USB device anyway
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,119	| IOT146 |	Which has three different options
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,655	| IOT146 |	Shoes that just came out
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,239	| IOT146 |	D-box
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:41,823	| IOT146 |	Sbarro
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,871	| IOT146 |	In your house
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,663	| IOT146 |	I think Evans
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:50,527	| IOT146 |	Check this out homework for Kevin it's been awhile it's been awhile
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:58,719	| IOT146 |	All right
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,487	| IOT146 |	Hbase is
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,279	| IOT146 |	Skybell is
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:02,559	| IOT146 |	Ring for patent
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:04,863	| IOT146 |	Frenchman on video doorbell
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:09,471	| IOT146 |	I feel like this year 2018 is going to be
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:14,079	| IOT146 |	2
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,359	| IOT146 |	We all need to get to
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:16,639	| IOT146 |	What year
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:17,663	| IOT146 |	You're probably a start sooner
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:19,711	| IOT146 |	Scribe
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:20,735	| IOT146 |	So this is
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:21,759	| IOT146 |	Not surprising
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:24,575	| IOT146 |	First loss
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:28,671	| IOT146 |	They're suing them over their security system
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:32,767	| IOT146 |	Stole some ideas from them
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:34,047	| IOT146 |	Tired vazzana
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:41,471	| IOT146 |	This actually reminds me of the Apple Samsung lawsuit
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:44,031	| IOT146 |	You know I
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:47,103	| IOT146 |	Let's be honest
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:49,663	| IOT146 |	Anybody here
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:51,199	| IOT146 |	As I look at this from
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:53,503	| IOT146 |	Video doorbell as
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:55,551	| IOT146 |	Scott
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:57,343	| IOT146 |	Chicano speaker wiring
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,135	| IOT146 |	Speaker
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,439	| IOT146 |	I just hate to see this
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:02,463	| IOT146 |	I'm with you
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:08,607	| IOT146 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,311	| IOT146 |	Look at you
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,455	| IOT146 |	Text more in this market
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:30,623	| IOT146 |	PetSmart
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,135	| IOT146 |	Bathroom
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,951	| IOT146 |	This is an extension of the smart kitchen so
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,719	| IOT146 |	One of the coolest things
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:37,023	| IOT146 |	Is a
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:40,607	| IOT146 |	Delta faucet Kohler also excuse the feature to
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:41,119	| IOT146 |	And
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,679	| IOT146 |	Jackson talks to matamata
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,983	| IOT146 |	Cast metal
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:48,031	| IOT146 |	Turn on my faucet which
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:50,591	| IOT146 |	Could be handy but it's probably not that great
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:51,615	| IOT146 |	You can also tell if
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,383	| IOT146 |	Feel something up
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:56,479	| IOT146 |	2 cups of water in it and it'll just dispense that
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:59,039	| IOT146 |	Stun
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:01,343	| IOT146 |	To fill up so like I have a big spaghetti pot
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:03,647	| IOT146 |	Spaghetti pie
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:07,999	| IOT146 |	Oh my spaghetti pie
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:08,511	| IOT146 |	That will happen
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,631	| IOT146 |	So this
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:15,679	| IOT146 |	Is awesome I'm sorry you guys
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,447	| IOT146 |	Is super awesome
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:18,239	| IOT146 |	Because these are like
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:19,263	| IOT146 |	Intelligence
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,543	| IOT146 |	Remote connectivity
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,639	| IOT146 |	So color also
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:28,223	| IOT146 |	Makeup mirror with a
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,551	| IOT146 |	Feel like shower something
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:37,439	| IOT146 |	The smart bathroom which I'm not actually sure I'm ready
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:41,279	| IOT146 |	Ready or not

EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:19,935	| IOT146 |	Actually the market to buy my first home and finally stopped print
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:22,239	| IOT146 |	And I was wondering what
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:25,311	| IOT146 |	Kind of iot solutions should I be looking at
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:27,359	| IOT146 |	Kind of an iot Lube right now
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:30,431	| IOT146 |	Basically I'm just still into the
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,967	| IOT146 |	Anime
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:32,735	| IOT146 |	Some with

EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:42,975	| IOT146 |	I was wondering
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:46,047	| IOT146 |	Where should I start looking and start doing my research
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,583	| IOT146 |	Two iot of Phi my house
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:48,863	| IOT146 |	Also
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:53,215	| IOT146 |	My real estate agent got me thinking when he was talking about one of his former clients
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:56,031	| IOT146 |	That had moisture sensors in the bathroom
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:57,567	| IOT146 |	So when the Marshall ever got
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:59,871	| IOT146 |	Hi it would automatically turn on the vent
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:01,151	| IOT146 |	I was wondering
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,943	| IOT146 |	Are there sensors that
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,479	| IOT146 |	Can determine
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:06,271	| IOT146 |	Almost like a
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:10,111	| IOT146 |	The stinkiness level ntaganda fan to vent out the smell
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,135	| IOT146 |	Just wondering
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:11,903	| IOT146 |	Love the podcast
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:19,327	| IOT146 |	Okay Kyle that wasn't a different direction that I thought I was ready for like hey I've got an anime in what do I buy it
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:24,191	| IOT146 |	Interesting use case
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:26,239	| IOT146 |	Smarter we always suggest starting with e
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,007	| IOT146 |	Please case
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:30,079	| IOT146 |	A couple different ways
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:32,127	| IOT146 |	And we can partially stop it
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:34,687	| IOT146 |	Another way
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:37,247	| IOT146 |	Right there are
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:40,831	| IOT146 |	There are bathroom fans that has built-in sensors
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:43,135	| IOT146 |	Running until
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,927	| IOT146 |	Humidity level drops
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:50,047	| IOT146 |	That's a non-smart
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:52,351	| IOT146 |	Doesn't communicate with anything other than
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:57,215	| IOT146 |	I'm going so you could do that
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:01,311	| IOT146 |	Home Depot
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:03,359	| IOT146 |	I thought we put it in
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:07,711	| IOT146 |	Probably want to get a switch
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:12,575	| IOT146 |	Wifi switch would probably
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,855	| IOT146 |	Just Finance
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:15,647	| IOT146 |	Tp-link make slime soda
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:21,280	| IOT146 |	Spine
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:22,304	| IOT146 |	And
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:26,912	| IOT146 |	Like there's plenty of humidity sensors
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:29,472	| IOT146 |	As far as smell sensors that's a little tricky
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:31,008	| IOT146 |	Yes so
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:34,080	| IOT146 |	Kevin and I had a lively debate over
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:34,848	| IOT146 |	What makes a bath
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:38,432	| IOT146 |	Consensus appears to be
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:40,224	| IOT146 |	Hydrogen sulfide
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:43,040	| IOT146 |	And I was thinking about you as well
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:46,880	| IOT146 |	No no
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:48,160	| IOT146 |	You know I was talking
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:50,720	| IOT146 |	Actually someone from
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:52,768	| IOT146 |	And they actually had in a where
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:54,816	| IOT146 |	AWA
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:55,584	| IOT146 |	Sensor
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:57,120	| IOT146 |	Next to their cat litter box
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:22:00,704	| IOT146 |	They would trigger an apple
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,728	| IOT146 |	Turn on the smart outlet
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:07,360	| IOT146 |	The concepts are similar shows some sense
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:10,688	| IOT146 |	We just Alaska measure vocs
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:12,736	| IOT146 |	I don't know if hydrogen sulfide is a Voca
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,272	| IOT146 |	You can buy a Hydra
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:16,064	| IOT146 |	Gas sniffer for like
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:20,928	| IOT146 |	Internet status
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:24,000	| IOT146 |	It doesn't feel like something
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:25,536	| IOT146 |	Be excited about
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:26,560	| IOT146 |	If you guys
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,584	| IOT146 |	Anyconnect
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:30,656	| IOT146 |	Nobody advertisers
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,936	| IOT146 |	This particular

EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:35,520	| IOT146 |	Worst case scenario
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:37,824	| IOT146 |	Smart Switch
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:38,848	| IOT146 |	Could always do
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:40,128	| IOT146 |	Do something where
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:41,408	| IOT146 |	Seether Set It Off
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,944	| IOT146 |	With a motion detection
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:46,784	| IOT146 |	Stop
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,856	| IOT146 |	Determine what that time is that
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:51,648	| IOT146 |	Or
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,720	| IOT146 |	$30 bottle of
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:55,744	| IOT146 |	Which is
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:59,840	| IOT146 |	Recommendation this is a little
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:00,608	| IOT146 |	Into the toilet
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:01,888	| IOT146 |	Chris is oil film on top
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,448	| IOT146 |	Trade It
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:06,752	| IOT146 |	Actually
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:08,544	| IOT146 |	There is a
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,056	| IOT146 |	Really big
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:10,848	| IOT146 |	So if you didn't want to connect
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:12,640	| IOT146 |	Lowe's for your
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:14,176	| IOT146 |	Humidity sensing fan

EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:20,320	| IOT146 |	A little vial of free
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:25,184	| IOT146 |	As far as other things for a new house and just getting started I think
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:29,024	| IOT146 |	You don't have to do more switches unless you want to
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,072	| IOT146 |	In a thermostat
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:35,936	| IOT146 |	Should you get certain thermostats Plus

EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:58,976	| IOT146 |	And now
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,024	| IOT146 |	Conversation
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,560	| IOT146 |	Simon segars
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:05,632	| IOT146 |	The CEO of arm
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:12,032	| IOT146 |	Hey everyone we're taking a break from this week's iot podcast from our sponsor this week
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:14,848	| IOT146 |	Lux products we have robbed
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:20,224	| IOT146 |	Here to talk about thermostat
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:22,528	| IOT146 |	And how it works in the smartphone
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,296	| IOT146 |	So Rob
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:24,832	| IOT146 |	Can you tell her
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:25,600	| IOT146 |	A little bit
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:27,904	| IOT146 |	We are a
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:30,720	| IOT146 |	Proud bunch of philadelphia-based innovators of
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,488	| IOT146 |	HVAC
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:32,256	| IOT146 |	Controls
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:34,304	| IOT146 |	We've been around for over a hundred years
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,584	| IOT146 |	Our most recent launch
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:39,424	| IOT146 |	The Lux Kono smart thermostat is a product chock-full of
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:40,960	| IOT146 |	Smart features it has
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:44,032	| IOT146 |	At the core element with Decor snap cover so it can match
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:46,848	| IOT146 |	Any environment and it works with all the voice assist
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:51,712	| IOT146 |	Which is a pretty competitive price
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:56,064	| IOT146 |	Animation was a big deal at CES this year
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:59,392	| IOT146 |	Bunch of devices we're still focused on
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:02,208	| IOT146 |	A big thing was everything that had to work with one another
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:03,232	| IOT146 |	How did you guys attack
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:06,560	| IOT146 |	We stay in the channel that were in
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:07,328	| IOT146 |	Sandwiches
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,096	| IOT146 |	HVAC
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:10,912	| IOT146 |	And so we know that we have to be able to come
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:11,680	| IOT146 |	Communicate
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:13,216	| IOT146 |	With all the major voice
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:13,984	| IOT146 |	Assistance
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,776	| IOT146 |	Because we view that as the
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:17,568	| IOT146 |	The glue of the Smart Home
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,336	| IOT146 |	So
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:20,128	| IOT146 |	Coming out of the gate we have the big three
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:22,688	| IOT146 |	Google Apple and Amazon
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:26,784	| IOT146 |	We work seamlessly with those so we can be part of each of those ecosystem
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:30,368	| IOT146 |	And right now you guys offer three generations of Kinect
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,136	| IOT146 |	Two products
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:32,672	| IOT146 |	How do each of those fit
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:33,696	| IOT146 |	Within the home automation
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:35,488	| IOT146 |	That's a great question
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,256	| IOT146 |	We started our
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:40,096	| IOT146 |	Smart thermostats with the Lux Geo in 2015
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:42,144	| IOT146 |	And it's feature is that it is
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:44,704	| IOT146 |	Battery operated Wi-Fi products
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:45,728	| IOT146 |	So it works off of
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:46,752	| IOT146 |	2 lithium
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:51,616	| IOT146 |	Double a batteries or of course with the famous C wire and
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,896	| IOT146 |	Parnu power Bridge
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:54,944	| IOT146 |	Which makes it have connectivity forever and ever
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:58,272	| IOT146 |	Second generation was more of a pro product
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:59,552	| IOT146 |	We called the g o x
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:01,088	| IOT146 |	And that has
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,880	| IOT146 |	Superior humidification
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:03,648	| IOT146 |	Control
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:05,184	| IOT146 |	And of course the most recent
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:06,720	| IOT146 |	Our third generation is
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:08,512	| IOT146 |	Dacono smart and
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,792	| IOT146 |	We've just launched the
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:10,560	| IOT146 |	Kono
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:13,376	| IOT146 |	Smart zigbee version which weave Julie named
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:14,656	| IOT146 |	Konigsee
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,192	| IOT146 |	Excellent
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:21,312	| IOT146 |	Having all of this experience what are some things that you think manufacturers need to
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:22,080	| IOT146 |	To remember
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:23,104	| IOT146 |	Moon embracing the Sun
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:26,176	| IOT146 |	What are the things that we differentiate on
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,456	| IOT146 |	For the Hub basis
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:30,272	| IOT146 |	I'm with or zigbee product is that we
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:32,064	| IOT146 |	Are a thermostat company
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:32,832	| IOT146 |	May 1st
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:39,744	| IOT146 |	So when we designed or zigbee product for the hubs we made sure that you happen to lose connectivity to the hub
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:46,144	| IOT146 |	You're still going to have your thermostat working on a schedule keeping the house comfortable and even if you had
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:47,168	| IOT146 |	Two for those devices
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:54,080	| IOT146 |	You can put a schedule in at the wall on the device which is something that other people that are in the smart products
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:55,104	| IOT146 |	Business first
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:27:01,504	| IOT146 |	Thermostat 2nd don't think about we've been through this a lot for the past 30 years we have over 15 million
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:04,320	| IOT146 |	Thermostats on the wall we know exactly what to do.
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:04,832	| IOT146 |	Keep the home com
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:07,136	| IOT146 |	Alright Rob that sounds great
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,672	| IOT146 |	Where can we go to find out
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:11,232	| IOT146 |	What we'd love to have everyone come to Lux
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:17,632	| IOT146 |	Products.com there's plenty to read there and if you want to learn more about the Kono smart thermostat you can stop by your
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:23,776	| IOT146 |	Local Home Depot store or shop online
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:31,968	| IOT146 |	Everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:33,248	| IOT146 |	Who is the CEO of
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:36,320	| IOT146 |	Our assignment how are you doing today
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:40,672	| IOT146 |	I'm so excited and as you guys all know
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:41,952	| IOT146 |	I love semiconductors
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,976	| IOT146 |	I love Arm
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:48,096	| IOT146 |	It'll make semiconductors they just make the brains the instruction set and then the license about every
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:50,400	| IOT146 |	So in my brain
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:52,192	| IOT146 |	Simon knows everything that's going to happen
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,472	| IOT146 |	For the next 5 years
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:04,480	| IOT146 |	I like to think that's the way we was way we develop a technology that way we were upon us
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:08,832	| IOT146 |	Us to have some insight of where at least of all the processing you've got
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:12,416	| IOT146 |	Can you snort see devices
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:17,024	| IOT146 |	CSG seeing exactly what everybody else with the technology
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:19,072	| IOT146 |	You think about the supply chain with rain
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:25,472	| IOT146 |	Developing processes and everything else people used to build chips we license them to chip companies they design those into
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:27,008	| IOT146 |	Play put the rain stop around it
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:31,872	| IOT146 |	He's on it into an end product eventually get ships that is a really long time gap between
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:36,736	| IOT146 |	Ostomy. Especially in the very early days of new technologies and it ending up in a real Pro
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:41,088	| IOT146 |	You make it sound like a takes a long time but it's actually gotten a lot shorter so
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:44,672	| IOT146 |	Point in time that you guys start designing a chip for your
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:46,976	| IOT146 |	Oh my gosh I think we need voice recognition
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:49,024	| IOT146 |	How long do those
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:50,560	| IOT146 |	Jimmy Walker audience may not be
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:52,608	| IOT146 |	This process through house
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,424	| IOT146 |	If we are
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,448	| IOT146 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:59,520	| IOT146 |	New architectural features then that's fine from
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:04,640	| IOT146 |	First thing about what we might need two products shipping in a store that you can actually go by
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:06,432	| IOT146 |	Could be Chinese
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:11,808	| IOT146 |	Play Somebody architectural features that all shipping now in smartphones by small V8 technology
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:13,088	| IOT146 |	Another word come that happens
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:14,368	| IOT146 |	Probably 10 years ago
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:16,672	| IOT146 |	So in some places
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:17,952	| IOT146 |	Light radiates how long time
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:23,072	| IOT146 |	Thinking about maybe it's Origins on top of that specific
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:23,584	| IOT146 |	Processes
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,376	| IOT146 |	4 different Performance Point
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:26,656	| IOT146 |	Applications
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:29,728	| IOT146 |	If that can be for male product concept 2
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:30,496	| IOT146 |	A ship
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:34,336	| IOT146 |	Products can be anything from to use to
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,616	| IOT146 |	4 years
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:38,432	| IOT146 |	It is you guys must be really smart
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:39,456	| IOT146 |	Having to take about this stuff
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:41,760	| IOT146 |	Let's think about
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:43,296	| IOT146 |	You and I first met
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,320	| IOT146 |	ORD a half years ago when
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:45,856	| IOT146 |	Chicago CEO job
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:52,512	| IOT146 |	When I asked you what you were excited about what you're going to do next week
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:57,632	| IOT146 |	Internet servers and you didn't really give me much more than that so
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:59,424	| IOT146 |	Looking back on that now
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:01,216	| IOT146 |	Do you recognize that is like a transition
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:01,984	| IOT146 |	. what did
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:03,520	| IOT146 |	You guys where do you guys see our
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:05,824	| IOT146 |	I see what you look like that.
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:09,152	| IOT146 |	And if you took to anyone in this kind of semiconductor industry
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:14,016	| IOT146 |	Huge amount of semen
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:14,784	| IOT146 |	Comes in
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:16,832	| IOT146 |	Huge amount of R&D huge amount of economic value
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:21,184	| IOT146 |	The growth rates for mobile was going to slow down
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:22,976	| IOT146 |	Everyone was thinking about snakes
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:24,256	| IOT146 |	And it really wasn't clear and
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:26,560	| IOT146 |	Yeah I talked to a lot of CGI was in this industry
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:29,888	| IOT146 |	Franklin
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:31,680	| IOT146 |	Now United
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:32,448	| IOT146 |	That the
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,984	| IOT146 |	Technologies of iot
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:37,568	| IOT146 |	The price is incapabilities Academy nivel artificial intelligence
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:38,592	| IOT146 |	These are
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:41,152	| IOT146 |	Cherokee building blocks that can get deployed in Lutsen
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,432	| IOT146 |	Different wines weather
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:44,224	| IOT146 |	Self-driving cars
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:45,760	| IOT146 |	Recognizing your voice and ordering
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:49,600	| IOT146 |	Pizza for you or making the lights in the room go off a few
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:53,184	| IOT146 |	Workout
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:56,512	| IOT146 |	So I've learned looking
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:59,328	| IOT146 |	Had this idea that these Technologies would going to be useful
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:07,520	| IOT146 |	We starting to see the first deployments of them in
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:08,288	| IOT146 |	Real products
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:09,824	| IOT146 |	I think we just going to Seymour MO
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:11,872	| IOT146 |	So some of the features that
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:12,896	| IOT146 |	We talked about
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:16,224	| IOT146 |	I don't know if this has Hardware implications for you guys
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:17,248	| IOT146 |	Voice
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:18,784	| IOT146 |	Computer vision
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:19,808	| IOT146 |	Which I feel is still kind of early
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:21,856	| IOT146 |	Machine learning at the edge
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,416	| IOT146 |	What else is there
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:25,952	| IOT146 |	There's some communication
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:29,536	| IOT146 |	Everything is low power
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:35,936	| IOT146 |	Hear what we're trying to do is cry Wolfe Ali I'd like to either and when you went to Gracie that was really well together a suspicion is that
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:36,448	| IOT146 |	Energy efficient
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:41,312	| IOT146 |	Teen memory in the Danbury Mall pal
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:45,152	| IOT146 |	Black people forget together
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:48,992	| IOT146 |	Integrated technology
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:53,600	| IOT146 |	Is Seattle a few years we've seen things like voice
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:55,136	| IOT146 |	Things like visions.
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:56,672	| IOT146 |	Yum yum application
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:57,696	| IOT146 |	Want to use because it said
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:58,720	| IOT146 |	Cancel them
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:05,120	| IOT146 |	There are new features that we need to develop you look at the algorithms using to to machine
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:06,912	| IOT146 |	Learning processes
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:11,008	| IOT146 |	Run them prices for the Run even more efficiently and other types of
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:12,544	| IOT146 |	Accelerator new starting to CP

EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:19,968	| IOT146 |	People using gpus Bigler developing a custom acceleracers
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:22,272	| IOT146 |	This whole Space is very alive at the moment because he's
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:24,576	| IOT146 |	You the hours of the changing the oven
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:25,856	| IOT146 |	Being developed
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:26,624	| IOT146 |	And I think you know
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:28,928	| IOT146 |	Cigarette another phone off use time
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:31,232	| IOT146 |	Yeah you look at all of these Technologies
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,000	| IOT146 |	We producing
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:34,304	| IOT146 |	It will be addressing in a little
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:37,376	| IOT146 |	Okay it was me
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:38,912	| IOT146 |	Just a moment ago
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:41,472	| IOT146 |	You guys are recent just by SoftBank
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:43,008	| IOT146 |	And massage
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:49,408	| IOT146 |	Has this big vision for a trillion connected devices everywhere
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:49,920	| IOT146 |	You doing
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:51,968	| IOT146 |	Vision board
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:56,576	| IOT146 |	What Master is doing with the SoftBank group is creating a an ecosystem
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:57,856	| IOT146 |	Square
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:00,672	| IOT146 |	Really want to lose them all together is Taissa
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:06,304	| IOT146 |	Investments that they making their businesses which can use data to glean insights for the Racine
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:08,096	| IOT146 |	How people use Office Space how people
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:08,864	| IOT146 |	Omega rounds
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:12,960	| IOT146 |	Status is going to be guided by
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:14,240	| IOT146 |	Iot devices is going to be
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:16,032	| IOT146 |	Leaves across the network
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:17,312	| IOT146 |	Process
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,592	| IOT146 |	Some of that in the age of Summer
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,360	| IOT146 |	The Clown
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:20,128	| IOT146 |	The network
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:21,664	| IOT146 |	Who was that relies on
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:23,712	| IOT146 |	Efficient energy efficient semi.
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:24,480	| IOT146 |	What's devices
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:26,528	| IOT146 |	I'm weak right in the building box for that
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:29,856	| IOT146 |	So you only view what we doing now is really at the house
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:32,928	| IOT146 |	Hope everything Master is trying to achieve cuz he's all that data
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:34,208	| IOT146 |	Capturing it moving it
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:37,024	| IOT146 |	Using it process again getting the inside from it
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,840	| IOT146 |	In that kind of vein of data
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:41,376	| IOT146 |	Machine learning
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:43,424	| IOT146 |	Specifically
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:48,032	| IOT146 |	I'm super excited about this cuz it's been awhile since there's been a lot of chips
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:48,800	| IOT146 |	He's running around
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:51,104	| IOT146 |	There are several of those is that something you guys might look
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:52,384	| IOT146 |	Acquisition
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:55,968	| IOT146 |	Is snow something out have a rule out there a little C
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:58,272	| IOT146 |	Chip companies are getting building
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:59,296	| IOT146 |	Pictures
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,064	| IOT146 |	Pakistan
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:04,416	| IOT146 |	We're Young once we have activities
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:06,720	| IOT146 |	Ian Axel starting point is more th
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:10,560	| IOT146 |	Machine learning algorithms applied in
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:13,120	| IOT146 |	It's devices in this microphone
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:16,192	| IOT146 |	In it devices
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:18,496	| IOT146 |	Lots and lots of a processing he's going to start
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:20,800	| IOT146 |	And we see that was a huge
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:22,848	| IOT146 |	Where dementia security
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:24,128	| IOT146 |	And specifically
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:25,408	| IOT146 |	Everybody's big panic
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:26,688	| IOT146 |	Spectre & meltdown
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:29,504	| IOT146 |	Initially arm-based processors
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:30,272	| IOT146 |	We're not
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:33,088	| IOT146 |	But now it turns out they are
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:34,880	| IOT146 |	So can you talk to us about what you guys are
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:42,048	| IOT146 |	So when the this particular type of responsibility cup discovered a bunch of research is over Google
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:45,376	| IOT146 |	They contacted us then I contacted Intel and AMD
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,144	| IOT146 |	Because
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:47,168	| IOT146 |	Any processor
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:50,240	| IOT146 |	That uses advanced phone to speculations
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:51,776	| IOT146 |	High performance
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:52,544	| IOT146 |	He's potentially
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:56,128	| IOT146 |	In this way what we did was going to analyze our products
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:57,664	| IOT146 |	Because she is typos
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:58,432	| IOT146 |	Attack
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:34:59,200	| IOT146 |	Is brand new
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:00,224	| IOT146 |	And it really is
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:02,016	| IOT146 |	Very sophisticated very calm
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:06,112	| IOT146 |	Flex and utilizes features which nobody could ever
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:07,392	| IOT146 |	Utica security
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:10,976	| IOT146 |	So we spent on analyzing that was ever a time when
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:15,328	| IOT146 |	Affected over there they all because it when this news broke
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:16,608	| IOT146 |	Yeah we were very much out
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:17,888	| IOT146 |	Public very rapidly
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:23,520	| IOT146 |	With ears are analysis and situations of the Saints of all communication with our partners about
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:29,664	| IOT146 |	Which products are affected with y'all and we've been probably taken out streaming issues and fixes that are required and working Pro
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:34,784	| IOT146 |	You guys are in a little bit of the unique spot because
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:35,296	| IOT146 |	Licensing a
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:38,112	| IOT146 |	The check to somebody else who sells
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:39,136	| IOT146 |	In products
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:40,928	| IOT146 |	How do you insurance
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:44,000	| IOT146 |	Asbury Broadway
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:45,536	| IOT146 |	How do you ensure that
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:46,048	| IOT146 |	What year did
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:47,072	| IOT146 |	To solve the
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:48,352	| IOT146 |	You're it
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:49,120	| IOT146 |	All the way up
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:55,520	| IOT146 |	It controls you say we're in a supply chain away quite a long way down it but
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:56,800	| IOT146 |	Web developer roles
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:58,848	| IOT146 |	The architectures developer
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:35:59,616	| IOT146 |	Princesses
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:00,384	| IOT146 |	Using
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:02,688	| IOT146 |	We spent a lot of time thinking about the subway that's going to run on
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:05,504	| IOT146 |	Even if we don't end up shipping
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:07,552	| IOT146 |	So we do a little work in open source
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:09,344	| IOT146 |	Kali Linux kernel
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:14,464	| IOT146 |	I'm subbing this issue particularly we spend time making sure they will pass useful Linux
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:16,256	| IOT146 |	Are we would sleep on his online
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:17,792	| IOT146 |	We make sure that was available week
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:21,120	| IOT146 |	EOS fenders
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:24,448	| IOT146 |	To understand how these Thunder abilities do pertain to
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:24,960	| IOT146 |	Kohl's in
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:30,080	| IOT146 |	So you really refuse all relationships up and down the street to
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:33,664	| IOT146 |	Try and get everybody doing the right thing and being ready for the day when this take their life
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:36,224	| IOT146 |	So is my phone going to run slower
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:38,016	| IOT146 |	Since
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:44,416	| IOT146 |	That really does remind to be seen but one thing I would advise you to do absolutely is
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:47,488	| IOT146 |	When the path gets pushed to you download it and install it
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:48,768	| IOT146 |	The only thing I say is
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:50,304	| IOT146 |	What is security issue like
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:51,840	| IOT146 |	Oh my soul
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:57,984	| IOT146 |	Can I get exploit III malware on your device sorry if ever there was a time to be worried about your no kind of that Dodie website
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:03,104	| IOT146 |	Accepting my email that doesn't quite look right now is the time to
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:04,384	| IOT146 |	Really really be
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:05,664	| IOT146 |	Aware of that
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:06,944	| IOT146 |	The boss in the first place
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:10,528	| IOT146 |	So yeah I do the software patches and continue to practice Can I have
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:12,064	| IOT146 |	Safe cyber security
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:15,648	| IOT146 |	Good hygiene okay
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:16,160	| IOT146 |	Spectrum
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,184	| IOT146 |	Actually
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:23,328	| IOT146 |	Was it just like it was
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,704	| IOT146 |	Thought about
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:30,496	| IOT146 |	How do we try to
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,520	| IOT146 |	About security
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:32,544	| IOT146 |	And then also implements
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:34,592	| IOT146 |	Going forward as we
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:36,896	| IOT146 |	More and more really important stuff
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,480	| IOT146 |	Yeah they wanted
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:41,248	| IOT146 |	Really important
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:42,016	| IOT146 |	Concept
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:44,320	| IOT146 |	Head around is the insecurity isn't
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:45,088	| IOT146 |	Are you saying
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:46,368	| IOT146 |	That you saw
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:51,232	| IOT146 |	They have social security forever because people will find you why he's all second
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:52,000	| IOT146 |	Writing systems
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:53,024	| IOT146 |	Spectre meltdown
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:55,584	| IOT146 |	I said I all abusing
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:58,912	| IOT146 |	Take me to the pin used in micro processes for decades
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:00,960	| IOT146 |	And what everybody considered
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:01,728	| IOT146 |	Asakusa
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:04,288	| IOT146 |	Hawaii
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:05,568	| IOT146 |	You do speculation
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:07,616	| IOT146 |	If it turns out you should have done it saying
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:08,896	| IOT146 |	No 6 States
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:10,944	| IOT146 |	In the process of
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:12,992	| IOT146 |	What turns out they're awesome side effects
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:13,504	| IOT146 |	Texan eye side effects
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:14,784	| IOT146 |	Explosive
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:20,928	| IOT146 |	What's it all for 27 years. A lot of people with a lot of experience in my compressor is on everywhere and I was looked at this has just been
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:23,744	| IOT146 |	This technique
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:24,512	| IOT146 |	To get exploited
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:26,304	| IOT146 |	There are going to be more things like that
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:27,840	| IOT146 |	Insecurities an ever-moving
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:32,448	| IOT146 |	And as we move toward us billions of connected devices
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,216	| IOT146 |	Benny
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:34,752	| IOT146 |	Gazillions of art things
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:36,288	| IOT146 |	New ways to attack
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:37,824	| IOT146 |	That will come about
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:39,872	| IOT146 |	So we have to consider that security
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:41,664	| IOT146 |	Lewes Ferry on the lookout
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:42,432	| IOT146 |	Elsa shoes
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:44,224	| IOT146 |	We going to have ways to fix issue
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:45,504	| IOT146 |	The come up
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:46,528	| IOT146 |	Redis Spectre meltdown
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,576	| IOT146 |	Fixing to haul away
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:51,648	| IOT146 |	Many many Display Devices yet ready is announced
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:57,536	| IOT146 |	Fortunately you don't need to because the software mitigations do work and I all the right way of approaching other selling a tissue
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:38:59,072	| IOT146 |	In a world of iot
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:01,888	| IOT146 |	Are many things you can buy to die OTC things
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:03,424	| IOT146 |	Connected devices for your house
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:04,704	| IOT146 |	Don't have any way to have to suffer
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:08,288	| IOT146 |	It is good. Most Computing devices that are
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:09,824	| IOT146 |	Spectrum
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:12,128	| IOT146 |	Call Ricky end of an operating system
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,944	| IOT146 |	I see devices logged in many devices
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:18,016	| IOT146 |	I have a run is in it when it leaves the factory
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:20,064	| IOT146 |	New software
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:22,368	| IOT146 |	That might be okay but I think
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:24,416	| IOT146 |	Actually the word loyalty is going.
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:26,464	| IOT146 |	That's those devices can be managed
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:28,256	| IOT146 |	And of the software can change of the lights
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:29,792	| IOT146 |	The securities
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:32,352	| IOT146 |	Depressing
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:35,168	| IOT146 |	Depend on something a little bit more cheerful
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:37,472	| IOT146 |	Let's talk about we are here at CES
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:40,800	| IOT146 |	I know you haven't traveled the show floor possibly as much but
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:42,336	| IOT146 |	What are you looking for what
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:44,896	| IOT146 |	The most excited about your head for technology
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,176	| IOT146 |	Every year
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:48,992	| IOT146 |	Is just extra
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:52,832	| IOT146 |	Check on the Rapture of how old is technology is used in put into
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:53,856	| IOT146 |	Cole consumer products
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:57,184	| IOT146 |	And we spend our lives going to be in the transistors thinking about
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:39:58,720	| IOT146 |	Chinese down the road
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:40:00,768	| IOT146 |	How much compute performance you can be needed in
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:01,536	| IOT146 |	Seems generally
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:04,352	| IOT146 |	When I come to see yes I see how people actually use them
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:05,120	| IOT146 |	I put them in
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:06,912	| IOT146 |	Ayala glossies or
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:11,264	| IOT146 |	Drones for the weather this week that the demo of a
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:13,312	| IOT146 |	What time is TC to drive out there
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:17,664	| IOT146 |	Zerorez technology
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:18,432	| IOT146 |	Presets UC
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:20,224	| IOT146 |	Jesse's mom's every year
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:23,040	| IOT146 |	And every year she was like a race of his own son is fosta
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:28,416	| IOT146 |	And that's because the cost of accessing the technology goes down and down and down and mow people can experiment with it
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:30,208	| IOT146 |	And you just get more Innovations results
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:33,536	| IOT146 |	Awesome thank you Simon
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:37,376	| IOT146 |	That's it for this week thanks so much for listening
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:39,680	| IOT146 |	I remember if you'd like more iot
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:41,216	| IOT146 |	Sign up for my newsletter
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:44,800	| IOT146 |	Stacey on iot cam will see you next week
