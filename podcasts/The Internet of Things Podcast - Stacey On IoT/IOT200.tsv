EDL	00:00:58,368	00:00:59,136	| IOT200 |	And a
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:04,000	| IOT200 |	Fun service that's like it's on steroids that Kevin has recently rediscovered
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:06,816	| IOT200 |	And I wrote about so many years ago and it's
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:07,328	| IOT200 |	It's a really cool
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:11,680	| IOT200 |	Anastasis way of saying Kevin really needs to read Stacy stuff more often
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:12,448	| IOT200 |	Basically
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:13,472	| IOT200 |	Yes that's a gentle

EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:14,656	| IOT200 |	Dot IO
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:16,704	| IOT200 |	All right
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:17,216	| IOT200 |	Kevin
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,520	| IOT200 |	Let's kick it off this week with
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:20,288	| IOT200 |	Some tweets
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:22,848	| IOT200 |	I don't know if you've seen this but
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:23,872	| IOT200 |	So Leslie Carhartt
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,408	| IOT200 |	Is it at
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:26,688	| IOT200 |	Hacks for pancakes
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:29,504	| IOT200 |	What's a numeral for tweeted last week about
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:30,784	| IOT200 |	Having to move
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,576	| IOT200 |	Because she is getting a smart
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:33,856	| IOT200 |	In her
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:34,624	| IOT200 |	Apartment building
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:36,416	| IOT200 |	However it is not just
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,184	| IOT200 |	Smart Lock
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:38,208	| IOT200 |	It is also a
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:40,000	| IOT200 |	Iot hub
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:40,768	| IOT200 |	And I
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:41,536	| IOT200 |	Connected thermostat
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:44,096	| IOT200 |	And all of this has to be connected to
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:44,864	| IOT200 |	Broadband and
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:47,424	| IOT200 |	Apparently she doesn't have a way to opt
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:48,192	| IOT200 |	Out
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:51,008	| IOT200 |	So this was an interesting thread we will link to
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:53,824	| IOT200 |	But basically Carhartt is a
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,848	| IOT200 |	Security professional
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:56,384	| IOT200 |	And she looked at this
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:56,896	| IOT200 |	And was like
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:59,200	| IOT200 |	Hello
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,992	| IOT200 |	This is a big risk
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,784	| IOT200 |	I reached out to talk
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:05,856	| IOT200 |	To her about this but she said she did not feel comfortable
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:06,880	| IOT200 |	Because of
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:09,696	| IOT200 |	She's in the middle of this and there might be legal or other rabbit
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,488	| IOT200 |	I totally get that
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,256	| IOT200 |	That your butt
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:14,560	| IOT200 |	I did find out more about the system
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:17,632	| IOT200 |	That her apartment complex is using
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:19,168	| IOT200 |	It's mandating basically
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:22,240	| IOT200 |	It's mandating it's a system from a company called
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:24,544	| IOT200 |	Smart rent their basement Phoenix Arizona
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:26,080	| IOT200 |	They've raised 5 million in fund
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:28,640	| IOT200 |	Actually just as recently as November 28th
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:29,920	| IOT200 |	And
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:30,688	| IOT200 |	They
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,712	| IOT200 |	Are using
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,480	| IOT200 |	A couple
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,504	| IOT200 |	Devices now
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,784	| IOT200 |	This I did not get from Leslie
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:37,344	| IOT200 |	So it's possible that there
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,112	| IOT200 |	Pitching something
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:38,880	| IOT200 |	Completely new
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,160	| IOT200 |	But that seems
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:42,720	| IOT200 |	Unlikely because their website is full of this in
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:45,280	| IOT200 |	So they're pitching a
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,816	| IOT200 |	Hub made by zapato
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:48,608	| IOT200 |	It's a Chinese smartphone
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:50,144	| IOT200 |	Company they've actually
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,424	| IOT200 |	People ask me about their stuff at
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,216	| IOT200 |	Decent in there
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:56,544	| IOT200 |	Using a Yale lock that is for residential
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,056	| IOT200 |	Services
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,848	| IOT200 |	And then the
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,640	| IOT200 |	Modem inside the Hub is from Huawei
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,688	| IOT200 |	And there's a thermostat in
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:04,224	| IOT200 |	Leak sensor I'm not sure
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,016	| IOT200 |	Who makes the thermostat or the leaks
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:08,576	| IOT200 |	Let's dig into some of the issues
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:16,256	| IOT200 |	I mean cuz we talked about and we actually get many questions from renters about how that you know
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,024	| IOT200 |	Mayfair
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:17,791	| IOT200 |	Play smart
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:23,679	| IOT200 |	This is different in that the complex is mandating this is what you're going to use and you have
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,191	| IOT200 |	Have to have it
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,007	| IOT200 |	There are a lot of issues here
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,543	| IOT200 |	Yes the first issue I have is
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:29,567	| IOT200 |	It's not up
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,615	| IOT200 |	Writing that is a problem
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:32,895	| IOT200 |	A multitude of
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:35,967	| IOT200 |	Let's say even if it were opt out
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:37,247	| IOT200 |	I think there's actually some
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,271	| IOT200 |	Serious wedding issues
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:42,623	| IOT200 |	Happened here and there's also some questions I Think About by Billie
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:44,671	| IOT200 |	So let's talk about the issues first
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:46,207	| IOT200 |	Go into liability
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,743	| IOT200 |	So
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:48,511	| IOT200 |	The modem
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,559	| IOT200 |	That they're using inside this
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,607	| IOT200 |	And the fact that
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,887	| IOT200 |	Domodomo
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,399	| IOT200 |	A zebra
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,959	| IOT200 |	And it's been accused of being an attack vector
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,519	| IOT200 |	And there hasn't been
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,031	| IOT200 |	Patches
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:01,567	| IOT200 |	So
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:03,615	| IOT200 |	People who live in these
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:06,687	| IOT200 |	Their thermostats there leak sensor
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,967	| IOT200 |	Interlocks are going to
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:10,015	| IOT200 |	Connect to this thing but they actually
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:10,783	| IOT200 |	Don't own the house
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,831	| IOT200 |	Nor can they patch The Hub
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,111	| IOT200 |	I want to
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:16,415	| IOT200 |	So any time there's an issue
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,183	| IOT200 |	Vulnerability
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:19,487	| IOT200 |	Basically they're relying on
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:21,535	| IOT200 |	Smart rent
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:22,815	| IOT200 |	And zapato
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,351	| IOT200 |	Or the underlying
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,375	| IOT200 |	Hardware vendors
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:27,423	| IOT200 |	Providing service inside this
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,191	| IOT200 |	Zapato hub
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,471	| IOT200 |	Hatchet
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:31,007	| IOT200 |	And as we all know that doesn't all
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:34,591	| IOT200 |	Right and to be honest with me we kind of
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:37,407	| IOT200 |	Have the same issue to a degree in that
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:41,759	| IOT200 |	Like if my wink Hub has some kind of vulnerability I'm relying upon wings
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:48,159	| IOT200 |	But I also have the choice to say I'm ditching Wing because you guys don't pack your stuff and these folks won't have that option
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,719	| IOT200 |	Write in a real estate management
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,255	| IOT200 |	Who's installing this
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:54,047	| IOT200 |	They may be excellent

EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:58,399	| IOT200 |	Team management
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:05:59,423	| IOT200 |	Insofar
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,447	| IOT200 |	Nothing that they are
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,983	| IOT200 |	Inside out priority
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:02,495	| IOT200 |	For them
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,031	| IOT200 |	Necessarily to get this
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,079	| IOT200 |	Commend
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:06,847	| IOT200 |	Did you want it bad
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,871	| IOT200 |	Ashley to go to smart
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,919	| IOT200 |	And get them to lean on their van
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,967	| IOT200 |	Really long chain
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:15,039	| IOT200 |	And even aside from that I mean the fact that
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,831	| IOT200 |	The modem itself is
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:18,111	| IOT200 |	Huawei modem
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:21,695	| IOT200 |	Personally I'm not
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:22,719	| IOT200 |	Sold on
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:27,071	| IOT200 |	Using modems from Chinese companies as a major
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:29,119	| IOT200 |	But you're obviously it's a concern
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:31,679	| IOT200 |	Other people including the US government
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:33,983	| IOT200 |	And other countries governments to say
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,775	| IOT200 |	Don't be using these because
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:36,799	| IOT200 |	We found a lot of
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:41,663	| IOT200 |	Townhomes to China sending data and so on so forth so that's an issue right there is all the same device
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:44,735	| IOT200 |	Yeah I mean imagine if your a government employee
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:45,503	| IOT200 |	You're not supposed to
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,015	| IOT200 |	To take your work home
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,319	| IOT200 |	Care physician
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:50,623	| IOT200 |	But even if you're not in a highly secure position
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,671	| IOT200 |	You do have to question you know
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:55,231	| IOT200 |	Oh man is my modem doing something
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,255	| IOT200 |	And again
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,279	| IOT200 |	This is not something you choose
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,583	| IOT200 |	We also have
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:01,631	| IOT200 |	A GitHub
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:03,679	| IOT200 |	Repository on
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:04,447	| IOT200 |	A hack of this
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,727	| IOT200 |	Particular Hub so
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,007	| IOT200 |	There was a gentleman
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:11,103	| IOT200 |	Andrew McFerrin who's basically got this Hub in his house and he's like oh
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,639	| IOT200 |	This is neat but I don't want to use the
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:14,431	| IOT200 |	Smart rent software I want to use
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:14,943	| IOT200 |	Call my sister
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:16,991	| IOT200 |	So he basically created an empty
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,551	| IOT200 |	Bridge and brought all the device
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,575	| IOT200 |	Capabilities into his own
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:27,231	| IOT200 |	Which is great but I meant to say 99% of the renters in this complex are not going to do that
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:30,047	| IOT200 |	And now let's move to the door lock
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,327	| IOT200 |	This is actually where
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,351	| IOT200 |	ICD
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,631	| IOT200 |	Serious problems but also
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:35,167	| IOT200 |	A reasonable solution
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,191	| IOT200 |	Already exists
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:40,543	| IOT200 |	So smart when is apparently using a Gehl door lock that is for residential
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,311	| IOT200 |	Not for multi
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:45,151	| IOT200 |	And you guys maybe thinking a who cares but
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:46,175	| IOT200 |	Multi-family unit
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,199	| IOT200 |	Metso apartment building
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,735	| IOT200 |	Actually have different
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:51,295	| IOT200 |	Regulations around fire code and safety issues
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:56,671	| IOT200 |	So this is why a lot of us can't put smart locks in our apartment buildings because the
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:08:00,511	| IOT200 |	Apartment building has to have access and they have to be able to give the fire department access
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,279	| IOT200 |	Cyst every apartment
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:04,607	| IOT200 |	Write with these residential locks if you don't have centralized
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:05,887	| IOT200 |	Control
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:07,167	| IOT200 |	Is unclear if smart
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,191	| IOT200 |	Is actually providing that
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,727	| IOT200 |	You don't actually have
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,007	| IOT200 |	The capability to let
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,287	| IOT200 |	And and there's also
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,567	| IOT200 |	Surprisingly
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,335	| IOT200 |	Backups
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:16,383	| IOT200 |	So this product doesn't have a mechanical
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:20,223	| IOT200 |	Just as a father I guess like a Bluetooth file.
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:24,319	| IOT200 |	It has no physical it's a punch button or a phonak
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:29,439	| IOT200 |	So yeah recommends that used product in an environment where there additional entry points
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,743	| IOT200 |	That may not be the case in the park
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,791	| IOT200 |	In fact it's likely not the case
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,583	| IOT200 |	And also with the
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:38,655	| IOT200 |	Power goes out or the internet goes out the lock doesn't work
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,959	| IOT200 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:43,007	| IOT200 |	Yeah me and your keys are a big deal
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:45,311	| IOT200 |	You may not have it on you but at least a nap
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,079	| IOT200 |	Apartment building
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,103	| IOT200 |	You can go downstairs
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,407	| IOT200 |	A super I'll give you the key
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:50,431	| IOT200 |	So
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:51,967	| IOT200 |	That's a little issue
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,503	| IOT200 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,783	| IOT200 |	Those are some of the things
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,551	| IOT200 |	Ring's End
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,575	| IOT200 |	If you think about
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,855	| IOT200 |	Using Z-Wave
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:58,623	| IOT200 |	With
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,647	| IOT200 |	Apartment building
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,439	| IOT200 |	There is a possibility of interfere
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:04,255	| IOT200 |	There's also concerns about ADA Act
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:05,791	| IOT200 |	So American with
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,303	| IOT200 |	Disabilities Act
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:08,863	| IOT200 |	Says everything has to be accessible for people
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,655	| IOT200 |	And I'm not
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:12,447	| IOT200 |	100% clear on how this might
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:13,471	| IOT200 |	Affect people
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:16,031	| IOT200 |	But you know it's worth asking
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:16,799	| IOT200 |	The questions
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,079	| IOT200 |	Checking if you are blind
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,103	| IOT200 |	You can't punch in your
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:19,871	| IOT200 |	Keypad
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:20,639	| IOT200 |	You don't code
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:21,919	| IOT200 |	That's
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:24,991	| IOT200 |	Not usually do not have the ability
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,527	| IOT200 |	They light up butts
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:28,831	| IOT200 |	Real on them so that's an issue
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,599	| IOT200 |	And then
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:32,671	| IOT200 |	There's an interesting thing that I hadn't really thought a lot about
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,183	| IOT200 |	Shabbat
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:35,743	| IOT200 |	Follow
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:38,303	| IOT200 |	Shabbat which is resting on the Sabbath
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,071	| IOT200 |	Which is Saturday
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:39,583	| IOT200 |	And
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,119	| IOT200 |	In that time you
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:43,679	| IOT200 |	You can't use electricity you can't do a lot of
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,191	| IOT200 |	Xterra lots of
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,727	| IOT200 |	I've had a couple friends were
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:48,799	| IOT200 |	Ox and it's always really intriguing to learn about the
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:51,615	| IOT200 |	That's hardcore
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:54,175	| IOT200 |	So if you think about having an electronic lock
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,967	| IOT200 |	It may not be Shabbat
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:58,527	| IOT200 |	This is not Orange
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,551	| IOT200 |	Two people in the smart helmet
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,855	| IOT200 |	Actually Whirlpool has a Shabbat
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:04,671	| IOT200 |	Be sure on their connected washers and dryers
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,207	| IOT200 |	Which I thought was kind of neat
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:09,791	| IOT200 |	So I don't know if that's something the smart right people are thinking about but
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,583	| IOT200 |	It's something you have to
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,375	| IOT200 |	Think about especially if something's mandatory
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:18,495	| IOT200 |	Yeah this it's a unique situation because I've never heard of a mandatory
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:21,055	| IOT200 |	Smart apartment in Ohio
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:24,639	| IOT200 |	Cassidy and I totally understand where he's coming from because of that
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,431	| IOT200 |	Backer alone and I mean
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:31,039	| IOT200 |	She was kind of mommy she wasn't joking but I mean when she first told her that she's like I guess I have to move
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:34,367	| IOT200 |	And that's kind of what I thought of it I laughed and then
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:40,767	| IOT200 |	He brought this up again before the show and there's a really long it's right about this and like she serious she may have to move because she can't
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,815	| IOT200 |	What does not want to abide by this
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,607	| IOT200 |	Mandatory nature of
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,911	| IOT200 |	These devices these particular devices
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:49,471	| IOT200 |	What it would mean for our everyday usage
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:53,823	| IOT200 |	I guess she have to supply the power of the internet as well so she's paying for that
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:54,335	| IOT200 |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,895	| IOT200 |	Yeah and I will say
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,663	| IOT200 |	So
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,431	| IOT200 |	Looking at this
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,479	| IOT200 |	I talk to lots of smart
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,247	| IOT200 |	Apartment
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,783	| IOT200 |	Actually interview the CEOs of 2
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,551	| IOT200 |	To companies that
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:04,831	| IOT200 |	Provide smart
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,367	| IOT200 |	Capabilities for apartment building
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,647	| IOT200 |	Felicity Mormon who's
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,415	| IOT200 |	Stratus
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,695	| IOT200 |	And say Pike
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,719	| IOT200 |	Who is a Toyota
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,023	| IOT200 |	In Direction the ones who helped
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,303	| IOT200 |	Educate me many years ago
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:16,095	| IOT200 |	How about some of the requirements
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,375	| IOT200 |	Swift connected
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,655	| IOT200 |	Homes in apartment
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:20,447	| IOT200 |	It's in those are voluntary
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:22,239	| IOT200 |	And they do a lot
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,287	| IOT200 |	Like I had an hour-long conversation
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:25,311	| IOT200 |	About locks
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:29,663	| IOT200 |	This is not something that should be
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,687	| IOT200 |	Be taken lightly
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,455	| IOT200 |	And
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:33,247	| IOT200 |	This feels very ominous
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,015	| IOT200 |	It feels like
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,295	| IOT200 |	The beginning of a backlash
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,831	| IOT200 |	This could create a backlash against
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,855	| IOT200 |	Connectivity
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:38,623	| IOT200 |	Connected device
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,391	| IOT200 |	In general
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:41,183	| IOT200 |	If it's not rolled out the right way
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,719	| IOT200 |	And I will also say
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:47,327	| IOT200 |	And Titus back to what I saw at CES and even my interview with Mike Wolfe later on
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:52,703	| IOT200 |	We're actually seeing a lot of companies install de-facto Wi-Fi or connectivity in their products
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,775	| IOT200 |	There won't be a non-connected
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:56,287	| IOT200 |	Adoption
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:12:01,663	| IOT200 |	Are we holding back the future I don't know but we still have so many data in
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:05,247	| IOT200 |	Privacy and security issues that I think it's okay that people are like yeah I don't trust
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:07,295	| IOT200 |	You know it's not like a
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,319	| IOT200 |	To me it's not like a
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,087	| IOT200 |	But I ate
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,367	| IOT200 |	Knee-jerk let it react
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,671	| IOT200 |	Right now it's
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:14,975	| IOT200 |	There should always be an option for a non-smart
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:16,767	| IOT200 |	Device I mean even
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:19,071	| IOT200 |	In the future however far you want to take it out
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:21,631	| IOT200 |	No I mean you can't buy a car today without
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,143	| IOT200 |	You know certain
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:24,703	| IOT200 |	Electronic safety features in
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:25,215	| IOT200 |	Those
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,751	| IOT200 |	I need my mom is
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:27,519	| IOT200 |	Fairy
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:28,287	| IOT200 |	Anti
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:29,823	| IOT200 |	Digitization of cars
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:32,127	| IOT200 |	But you won't buy a new car right now because
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:33,151	| IOT200 |	She doesn't want all of them
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:33,919	| IOT200 |	Electronic features
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:37,503	| IOT200 |	True but I mean those are
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:39,039	| IOT200 |	Those are safety features
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:42,367	| IOT200 |	You know these are not safety features these are convenience features
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:43,903	| IOT200 |	Well some of them are and some of them
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:45,439	| IOT200 |	So a leak sensor icon
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,207	| IOT200 |	Seaway apartment
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,743	| IOT200 |	That I actually had
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:49,279	| IOT200 |	My apartment flooded because
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,559	| IOT200 |	The apartment above mine
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,583	| IOT200 |	And had a burst pipe
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:52,351	| IOT200 |	Any regrets
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:56,703	| IOT200 |	I can see a legitimate reason why apartment community might want that in the
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:59,775	| IOT200 |	But that's very different than men dating
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,055	| IOT200 |	Connectify
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:01,823	| IOT200 |	Or
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:02,847	| IOT200 |	How did the resident
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,895	| IOT200 |	So there are other ways
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,199	| IOT200 |	I'm with you
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:08,479	| IOT200 |	Alright so we're not going to solve this
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:12,831	| IOT200 |	But stay tuned because hopefully we'll find out a little bit more I reach out to
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,623	| IOT200 |	Smartvent and its investment team
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:16,159	| IOT200 |	To try to figure this out
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:16,927	| IOT200 |	And
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,695	| IOT200 |	Maybe
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,207	| IOT200 |	Maybe
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,023	| IOT200 |	Maybe she doesn't have to move
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:21,535	| IOT200 |	That would be nice
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,839	| IOT200 |	Breaking your lease is always a
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:25,887	| IOT200 |	Pain in the proving that you're not breaking your lease
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,655	| IOT200 |	Police terms
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:29,215	| IOT200 |	Change is always a pain
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,263	| IOT200 |	Okay that's how we feel about
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:32,799	| IOT200 |	So good luck
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,079	| IOT200 |	Good luck anyway
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:34,591	| IOT200 |	Who actually has
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,919	| IOT200 |	Actually if you have to do this you should drop us a line
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:40,991	| IOT200 |	Intelius cuz I'm very curious how these things are working out for
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:42,271	| IOT200 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:44,063	| IOT200 |	Speaking of
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:45,087	| IOT200 |	Marie kondo
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,111	| IOT200 |	Marie kondo
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:47,647	| IOT200 |	We haven't spoken to her yet I was going to say
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,463	| IOT200 |	I don't know what we're speaking of you guys I'm
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,767	| IOT200 |	Worst singer ever
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,815	| IOT200 |	Worst Segway ever speaking of that
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:55,583	| IOT200 |	This
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,863	| IOT200 |	We are actually last week
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:59,423	| IOT200 |	Was inspired by
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,447	| IOT200 |	The life-changing Magic
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:03,007	| IOT200 |	Tidying up in the Marie kondo show on Netflix
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:04,543	| IOT200 |	Todoist Gadget
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:08,383	| IOT200 |	I wrote about it in the newsletter but I'm going to give you the free thing
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,663	| IOT200 |	You guys know I'm moving in
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:10,943	| IOT200 |	Roughly six months
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:11,967	| IOT200 |	5 months now
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,991	| IOT200 |	And I was
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:15,551	| IOT200 |	We're about to put our house on the market and they're like
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:19,391	| IOT200 |	EBay what are you going to leave on the walls
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,159	| IOT200 |	So
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:23,231	| IOT200 |	I did the condo-style thing where I shoved all of my
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:26,047	| IOT200 |	Two devices or their boxes if they were installed in the
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:28,095	| IOT200 |	The wall and I shut them all in the couch
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:30,143	| IOT200 |	And I touch them and I said hey do you Spark
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,167	| IOT200 |	Do I actually
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,215	| IOT200 |	And
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:34,751	| IOT200 |	I decided which two
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,031	| IOT200 |	In which
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,823	| IOT200 |	I didn't want to keep it was really helpful.
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:40,383	| IOT200 |	Because of this I was trying to figure out what
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,663	| IOT200 |	Put in there and I just couldn't come up
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:43,967	| IOT200 |	System I kept waffling back and forth
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:45,247	| IOT200 |	I don't know
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:47,295	| IOT200 |	Do I want to keep this do I want to uninstall it
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:49,599	| IOT200 |	Put a new person coming into the house finest
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:51,647	| IOT200 |	Incredibly complicated and never use it
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,927	| IOT200 |	Columbia West End
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,695	| IOT200 |	Possibly a vulnerability
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:55,231	| IOT200 |	The results
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:58,559	| IOT200 |	Keeping the connected thermostat on the wall
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:00,095	| IOT200 |	So those will convey with the
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:03,423	| IOT200 |	My Lutron switches will convey with the
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:04,191	| IOT200 |	The house
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:05,727	| IOT200 |	Has will the Lutron hub
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:06,751	| IOT200 |	The monitor
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,031	| IOT200 |	What else
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,823	| IOT200 |	My beloved
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:10,847	| IOT200 |	Delta touch
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,871	| IOT200 |	To. O
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,407	| IOT200 |	With Madame a
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,943	| IOT200 |	Stalled is going to stick around
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:16,735	| IOT200 |	I know
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,783	| IOT200 |	I can't see a reason to like
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:19,551	| IOT200 |	I mean
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:22,111	| IOT200 |	Yeah you love that thing I do love that too
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:24,671	| IOT200 |	But I love it so much that in my new house
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:27,999	| IOT200 |	Not my rental house I'm going to be staying in for a year but in my new house
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:29,535	| IOT200 |	I will actually get one of those
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:33,119	| IOT200 |	So that stays in the house the MyQ
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:33,887	| IOT200 |	Who stays in the house
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,679	| IOT200 |	Chamberlain garage door
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:38,495	| IOT200 |	I will probably buy a new one
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,519	| IOT200 |	I even buy a new one of those
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:42,079	| IOT200 |	It's unclear cuz who knows what
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,383	| IOT200 |	What that situation will be
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:46,175	| IOT200 |	Going to take all my hue light bulbs with me
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:50,015	| IOT200 |	So that goes away and I'm probably going to install a Lutron
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,295	| IOT200 |	Switch actually where they
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,319	| IOT200 |	The Hue bulbs were
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,855	| IOT200 |	Just to make sure that
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:56,159	| IOT200 |	Are the main living room area the house has
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,183	| IOT200 |	Attractive light
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,743	| IOT200 |	Write paper be a consistent experience
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,279	| IOT200 |	I also have
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:03,583	| IOT200 |	A bunch of different connected lights in my house
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:06,655	| IOT200 |	And I'm getting rid of all of the ones that are not Lutron
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:08,703	| IOT200 |	Because I don't want somebody to have to like
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,263	| IOT200 |	Install Apache wraps basement
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,031	| IOT200 |	Here's the Leviton app
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:16,639	| IOT200 |	Remember when they come in they're going to bring their own mattimeo
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:18,431	| IOT200 |	Google or nothing
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:20,735	| IOT200 |	And the Lutron lights work
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:21,503	| IOT200 |	Even if you have nothing
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:23,039	| IOT200 |	They're still wonderful dimming light
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,575	| IOT200 |	It's just nice
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:27,135	| IOT200 |	And if they decide they want them to work with something else
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:27,647	| IOT200 |	They work with
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:29,695	| IOT200 |	Homekit Google matinee
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,231	| IOT200 |	P
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:31,999	| IOT200 |	Thermostats
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:34,047	| IOT200 |	The Nest will work
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:36,607	| IOT200 |	With Google and Madam a
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,631	| IOT200 |	Will not work with
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,167	| IOT200 |	Door lock
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:42,751	| IOT200 |	I didn't keep any of the connected door locks because my connect
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:43,775	| IOT200 |	The door locks are all Z-Wave
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:47,615	| IOT200 |	And one was an STL. But that was a review genocidas in the back
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:52,223	| IOT200 |	So I decided nothing Z-Wave or zigbee with stay because I don't want them to have to deal with the
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,015	| IOT200 |	And finally
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,807	| IOT200 |	The connected doorbell
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,855	| IOT200 |	I talk to my realtor
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:58,623	| IOT200 |	And
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:00,671	| IOT200 |	He said a connected doorbell with
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:05,791	| IOT200 |	Be good I had to get back the nest doorbell but I did reinstall my August doorbell
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:08,607	| IOT200 |	So they have that and then I left the normal doorbell
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,935	| IOT200 |	So that's basically what
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:12,703	| IOT200 |	Will convey with my
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:14,239	| IOT200 |	And
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:16,031	| IOT200 |	How I kind of came to that process
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:22,431	| IOT200 |	Yes or no like I said don't have like a more consistent cohesive experience because you've kind of outfit at the house
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:24,479	| IOT200 |	And leaving your leaving the house with Lutron
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:27,807	| IOT200 |	And everything else would work without a hub so
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:32,159	| IOT200 |	Let me know it's a nice selling point and yeah you love your play some things but hopefully it
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,183	| IOT200 |	Is Keeling
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,207	| IOT200 |	To potential buyer
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:39,839	| IOT200 |	Because in a couple wet in six months or so I'll be talking about hello here's how I outfitted my
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:40,351	| IOT200 |	Rachel house
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:44,191	| IOT200 |	And it's funny that you wrote this up
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,727	| IOT200 |	And took this Plunge
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:50,335	| IOT200 |	Which is actually similar to when you don't want to know about a year-and-a-half ago you read it here
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:52,895	| IOT200 |	Completely remember he went through all your devices
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,175	| IOT200 |	I did my other gadgets
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,967	| IOT200 |	I think it was
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:18:01,599	| IOT200 |	Yeah but the difference is you know it was what did you want to use versus now what are you going to leave behind
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:04,927	| IOT200 |	And you got me thinking of a subscription cleanse
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,951	| IOT200 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:08,767	| IOT200 |	And I've already started it because
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:09,535	| IOT200 |	I have
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:10,815	| IOT200 |	Have a nest
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:17,215	| IOT200 |	Camera in my front window of my home even though the door to my house that's on the side of the house cuz we have an end unit
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:18,239	| IOT200 |	In the Townhomes here
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:23,103	| IOT200 |	And it just looks out of the driveway and it's been well worth the subscription price because
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:24,895	| IOT200 |	When our car got hit last
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:28,735	| IOT200 |	Summer I guess it was we captured on video I had this
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:31,295	| IOT200 |	Social service and go back and look at all my video
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,319	| IOT200 |	And
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:34,111	| IOT200 |	You know I got $1,500
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:37,183	| IOT200 |	Switches what the repair bill was from the offending
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:39,487	| IOT200 |	Driver's insurance company no questions asked because
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:44,607	| IOT200 |	But I really need to pay like $10 a month for that
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:49,727	| IOT200 |	I don't think I do and this is not a solution to everybody would do and I totally get that but I'm like you know what
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:56,127	| IOT200 |	I'm just going to save that money and I'm going to throw an SD card or microSD card in a wyzecam which is a $20 camera
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:19:00,991	| IOT200 |	I don't need alerts for out there I only need that to see after the fact of something happened
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:03,551	| IOT200 |	I don't need a subscription for that was my thought
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:08,159	| IOT200 |	And I canceled the nest subscription on that camera and then actually
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:11,231	| IOT200 |	Added in a subscription set pretty much a wash and triple savings
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,279	| IOT200 |	On to the nest hello doorbell
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:19,679	| IOT200 |	Because I do want the history of that in case somebody like it is trying to mess with the front door or anything like that or package
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:25,823	| IOT200 |	I just get taken that's it out there so it's worth paying for that but for any area that I just want to
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:28,127	| IOT200 |	See after the fact and go back in time
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:30,943	| IOT200 |	I don't need a subscription with wyze Cam SD card
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:33,247	| IOT200 |	So I'm going to continue I think paint
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:35,807	| IOT200 |	Canary subscription because that covers multiple
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:39,135	| IOT200 |	Cameras and is kind of like if somebody breaks into the house and I can cash
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:41,695	| IOT200 |	Capture video from two different angles so
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:48,095	| IOT200 |	I'm really starting to take a hard look at that and I know how you feel we talked about subscriptions in the past I'm not a fan but you raise a good point from
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:50,655	| IOT200 |	Business continuity perspective for these companies
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:52,447	| IOT200 |	So not going anti subscription
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:55,775	| IOT200 |	But I'm trying to think about where does it make sense
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:20:02,175	| IOT200 |	Where must I have one where I was where do I really not even well in how many subscriptions as part of this cleanse did
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,711	| IOT200 |	Tally help how much you spend a month
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:07,039	| IOT200 |	Well at a higher level idea
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:08,831	| IOT200 |	But they were not your smart
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:12,415	| IOT200 |	Home subscriptions are also music and video services
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,463	| IOT200 |	If you have any of those
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:19,327	| IOT200 |	I didn't get rid of any however I have saved money B
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:20,607	| IOT200 |	Cause
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:24,447	| IOT200 |	Even though I am almost an AARP card number officially
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:28,543	| IOT200 |	I am back in school and now that I have an edu address
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:29,823	| IOT200 |	I'm getting
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:35,199	| IOT200 |	Hulu showtime and Spotify for $5 a month as a student
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,735	| IOT200 |	Which is far cheaper than
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:37,759	| IOT200 |	Elaine's
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,807	| IOT200 |	Yeah Spotify is it the family or individual
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,879	| IOT200 |	Individual that's okay
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:44,671	| IOT200 |	That's still like $20 savings right there
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:52,095	| IOT200 |	Outside I save on that and there's others subscription deals I'm looking at as a student as well
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:56,191	| IOT200 |	I'm just trying to figure out what you how much I really need to like outlay for
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:57,727	| IOT200 |	Things I must have from Subs
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,263	| IOT200 |	Description standpoint in general
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,287	| IOT200 |	I like it
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:01,311	| IOT200 |	All right
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:04,383	| IOT200 |	Well Keep On Keepin On my friend
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,431	| IOT200 |	We'll see let's go to
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:06,943	| IOT200 |	News
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:09,247	| IOT200 |	There are new logo
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,527	| IOT200 |	Power Wifi chips
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:11,807	| IOT200 |	Silicon labs
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:14,623	| IOT200 |	And this is exciting because I have
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:15,391	| IOT200 |	Happen
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:18,464	| IOT200 |	Skeptical that Wi-Fi can get to a low enough PowerPoint
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:20,256	| IOT200 |	We're talking for example of
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:22,048	| IOT200 |	Getting rid of Z-Wave and zigbee stuff
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:23,328	| IOT200 |	In my house and
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,864	| IOT200 |	One of the reasons is that requires a
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:29,472	| IOT200 |	But one of the reasons there are so prevalent is because they're super low power and they're mesh
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:30,752	| IOT200 |	So
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:32,032	| IOT200 |	They're extra resilient and they don't
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:33,824	| IOT200 |	Long battery life
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,104	| IOT200 |	So
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,896	| IOT200 |	I'm always excited about things like me
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,944	| IOT200 |	Bluetooth and now
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:43,040	| IOT200 |	Low-power Wi-Fi so this is half the power of existing Wi-Fi according to
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:46,112	| IOT200 |	Now there are a lot of caveat
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:48,160	| IOT200 |	Can we talk about radios and
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:48,672	| IOT200 |	Power consumption
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:49,952	| IOT200 |	There's things like
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:50,464	| IOT200 |	Hey
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:55,840	| IOT200 |	Is the RF environment really noisy that means like are there lots of devices trying to transmit be
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,864	| IOT200 |	Because that makes it
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:58,656	| IOT200 |	More power intensive to transmit
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:01,984	| IOT200 |	Or is it farther away from the Hub
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:03,008	| IOT200 |	Because that also require
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,824	| IOT200 |	It basically has two quote-unquote Shout
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,592	| IOT200 |	Louder
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,104	| IOT200 |	To be heard
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:09,920	| IOT200 |	So you got to think about all of those things
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,968	| IOT200 |	These are benchmarked
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:14,528	| IOT200 |	Ideal performance situations
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:15,808	| IOT200 |	So you're real mileage
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:18,624	| IOT200 |	Mayberry but we are seeing Wi-Fi
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:20,416	| IOT200 |	In battery-powered situations
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:22,464	| IOT200 |	Etsy yes we saw the new Schlage
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:24,512	| IOT200 |	WiFi powerlock Hampton products
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:27,328	| IOT200 |	Has their new Wi-Fi power array lock
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:29,376	| IOT200 |	So there's a lot Happening Here
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:31,424	| IOT200 |	And with these new chipsets
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:32,448	| IOT200 |	There should be
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:33,216	| IOT200 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:33,728	| IOT200 |	Even more
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:41,664	| IOT200 |	Yeah and I'm interested from a different perspective and at y'all probably being overly optimistic here I know these are for
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:43,456	| IOT200 |	Iot applications
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:45,248	| IOT200 |	But I still want to see
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:46,272	| IOT200 |	Li-fi
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:47,040	| IOT200 |	Headphones
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:49,344	| IOT200 |	That can connect to the cloud for assistant
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:53,696	| IOT200 |	Not this day I put an assistant in your ear that has to connect to your phone
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,720	| IOT200 |	Open Bluetooth
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:23:00,352	| IOT200 |	Yeah you keep dreaming my friend I know and I wanted hope AR 300
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,376	| IOT200 |	Episode will be talkin
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:03,680	| IOT200 |	That's two years away
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:04,960	| IOT200 |	Pirate
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:06,496	| IOT200 |	Microsoft they admit is
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:08,288	| IOT200 |	Defeat for court
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:12,896	| IOT200 |	They're pulling a big speak no no just kidding
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:16,224	| IOT200 |	Microsoft is interesting you know with the whole smart
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:17,248	| IOT200 |	Speaker space
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:20,320	| IOT200 |	We don't see too many speakers with Cortana in there
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:24,416	| IOT200 |	And I have a feeling we're not going to see him anymore and that's because
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:27,744	| IOT200 |	Satya nadella the CEO of Microsoft
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:29,024	| IOT200 |	Basically said that
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:34,400	| IOT200 |	We don't really see Cortana as a competitor to Madame a or the Google Assistant
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:35,936	| IOT200 |	We really think it should be a
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:36,704	| IOT200 |	Skill
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:39,008	| IOT200 |	That should work with those assistance
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,288	| IOT200 |	And that's
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,592	| IOT200 |	To me a small bit of tooth
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:44,128	| IOT200 |	Feet in terms of
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,664	| IOT200 |	The smart speaker space
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:47,456	| IOT200 |	It also means that they're going after work
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:48,224	| IOT200 |	More with
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:51,040	| IOT200 |	Google Amazon to do for their Integrations
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:53,856	| IOT200 |	With Cortana and Amazon actually has which is
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:57,952	| IOT200 |	Promising for them but I don't know I don't think it's going to have with Google
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:59,488	| IOT200 |	To me this is so fascinating
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,256	| IOT200 |	Because
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:01,024	| IOT200 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:04,096	| IOT200 |	Cloud level so it's Azure Cloud competes
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:05,888	| IOT200 |	Very heavily with
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:07,424	| IOT200 |	AWS and
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:09,472	| IOT200 |	Less so with Google Cloud cuz
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,240	| IOT200 |	Microsoft azure
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:11,264	| IOT200 |	Number two in the space
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,544	| IOT200 |	And I'm just like
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,568	| IOT200 |	Peso
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,080	| IOT200 |	Interesting
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:15,616	| IOT200 |	Dislike
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:17,152	| IOT200 |	Another word for inside another level
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:18,944	| IOT200 |	Peter Leahy
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:21,248	| IOT200 |	Yeah that's the way it is in this market
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:22,016	| IOT200 |	So
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:24,064	| IOT200 |	I will say goodbye to Cortana on devices
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,856	| IOT200 |	Possibly hello to
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:27,392	| IOT200 |	To telling matamata
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:29,696	| IOT200 |	Activate Cortana to do something on my
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,464	| IOT200 |	Windows
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,000	| IOT200 |	All right
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:33,024	| IOT200 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:34,816	| IOT200 |	Abode this is
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:35,328	| IOT200 |	The
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:37,120	| IOT200 |	Security system it's
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:37,888	| IOT200 |	Excellent
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:38,400	| IOT200 |	I have
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,680	| IOT200 |	Heard from
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:40,448	| IOT200 |	So many people
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:41,216	| IOT200 |	Who have this
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:41,984	| IOT200 |	But they love it
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:44,032	| IOT200 |	And this is the Abode gen1 but now
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:45,312	| IOT200 |	Thursday bojan
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,080	| IOT200 |	To Gateway
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,104	| IOT200 |	This will begin shipping next
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:48,640	| IOT200 |	And
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:50,176	| IOT200 |	It features 4G cellular back
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:52,224	| IOT200 |	Z-Wave in it
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:53,760	| IOT200 |	And those are the big new things
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:54,784	| IOT200 |	But Kevin
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:57,088	| IOT200 |	Will tell you a bit more about what the heck this
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:01,184	| IOT200 |	Yes so the above systems you haven't heard about it
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:04,000	| IOT200 |	It's really more of a it's a hub as well as like I said
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:05,536	| IOT200 |	Security type system because
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:07,584	| IOT200 |	They make motion sensors in
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,376	| IOT200 |	Door window sensors and such
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:12,704	| IOT200 |	So as you said it also has 40 backup so it's next
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:13,728	| IOT200 |	Next gen for them
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:18,080	| IOT200 |	People who bought the first gen which generally have been very happy with it
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:21,408	| IOT200 |	They don't have to pay the full price for it because the
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:25,248	| IOT200 |	Full price just for the basic bundle is 279
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:26,272	| IOT200 |	With the Gateway
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:29,600	| IOT200 |	And it goes up from there if you want to add like their Kinect bundle over there
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:31,904	| IOT200 |	Sakura bundle you can pay $360
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:33,952	| IOT200 |	But you can get the Gateway if your
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:34,976	| IOT200 |	Previous abode
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:39,328	| IOT200 |	Gen 1 hour for 199 so it's going to save you $80
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:41,632	| IOT200 |	You're not going to have a transition
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:44,448	| IOT200 |	From the old device to the new one in a sense because
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:49,056	| IOT200 |	You have to manually re-enroll all your connected devices so there's no
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:49,824	| IOT200 |	Automatic
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:51,872	| IOT200 |	Set up enforcement with a new one
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:54,432	| IOT200 |	If you have a gen 1 device and you love it
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:55,456	| IOT200 |	You don't have to
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:58,272	| IOT200 |	They're going to keep supporting both gen 1 and gen
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:58,784	| IOT200 |	Can two devices
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,320	| IOT200 |	Sense is true
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,088	| IOT200 |	This is true
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:03,904	| IOT200 |	They're bringing better Z-Wave connectivity to
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:10,304	| IOT200 |	The Gentoo so it would mean that's one possible reason you might want to upgrade and the 4G cellular backup is also in the
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,584	| IOT200 |	Another reason but if you don't need those
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:17,984	| IOT200 |	You can just stick with what you got unrelated note there's no announcement that they have homekit support
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:18,752	| IOT200 |	40 yet
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:19,520	| IOT200 |	With abode
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:20,800	| IOT200 |	They do say that
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:27,200	| IOT200 |	There's an apple and they plan to have additional news to announce soon as we continue to work with the Apple homekit
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:28,992	| IOT200 |	Getting so it sounds like a
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:30,784	| IOT200 |	A near certainty that's going to happen soon
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:32,832	| IOT200 |	Ring made similar nouns
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,880	| IOT200 |	And we've been waiting for a year-and-a-half on
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:37,440	| IOT200 |	Well they'll sign acquisition
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,256	| IOT200 |	Okay fine
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:44,096	| IOT200 |	Alright let's talk about quick news bits or more quick news bits
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,120	| IOT200 |	Airpod 2
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:46,400	| IOT200 |	With Rupert health
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:48,192	| IOT200 |	I am excited about the
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:49,984	| IOT200 |	Cuz I believe that
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:50,752	| IOT200 |	Well I don't just believe this
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,032	| IOT200 |	Proven fact
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,824	| IOT200 |	That you can get a lot of information
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:55,104	| IOT200 |	And from your ears
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:55,872	| IOT200 |	You can get
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:56,640	| IOT200 |	High quality
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,944	| IOT200 |	Brain data high quality
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:26:59,712	| IOT200 |	Heart rate data
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:00,736	| IOT200 |	High quality
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:02,272	| IOT200 |	Galvanic skin response
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:04,576	| IOT200 |	Stata big word
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:05,600	| IOT200 |	And
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:06,880	| IOT200 |	Did you take a
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,392	| IOT200 |	Skeptical
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:08,928	| IOT200 |	No doubt about it
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:13,792	| IOT200 |	And we have talked about this before you're bullish on this I'm kind of bearish on this because
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:15,840	| IOT200 |	I have an Apple Watch which has
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:20,704	| IOT200 |	All those types of sensors are most of them I do not have the Apple watch 4 with the ECG but
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:22,496	| IOT200 |	Don't want that so that's fine
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:28,384	| IOT200 |	So do you have the current airpod switch don't have any sensors whatsoever but I wear them when I run in the griefer
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,408	| IOT200 |	Stream music from iWatch
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:30,944	| IOT200 |	If I have the watch
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:33,504	| IOT200 |	I have no interest in airpod 2 with
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:35,808	| IOT200 |	Health Center Schoharie have the health center
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,832	| IOT200 |	Additionally
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:38,368	| IOT200 |	Emily Catherine data
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:44,768	| IOT200 |	When I wear the headphones it's not going to be like all day. Because you're not going to wear these all day so
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:46,304	| IOT200 |	Don't have an Apple Watch against
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:48,352	| IOT200 |	I just want to track
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:52,704	| IOT200 |	It's another way maybe to track like your runs or something if you don't want an Apple watch
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:54,752	| IOT200 |	Those are very expensive
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:58,592	| IOT200 |	You pop that your pots in to go running and you can grab data
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:00,640	| IOT200 |	I will also in I'm with you on the airpod
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:03,968	| IOT200 |	I'm kind of like a do we need that no but
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,992	| IOT200 |	Icees
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:05,760	| IOT200 |	Starkey
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:06,784	| IOT200 |	The hearing aid come
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:08,832	| IOT200 |	Actually showed off something
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:10,880	| IOT200 |	Really cool wish this their new Livio
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:11,904	| IOT200 |	Hearing aid
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,184	| IOT200 |	That has
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:15,488	| IOT200 |	A lot of sensors in it already
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:17,024	| IOT200 |	And they're actually tracking
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:19,584	| IOT200 |	Steps but they're also doing things like fall data
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:20,096	| IOT200 |	Text now with
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:23,168	| IOT200 |	A hearing aid is something that you actually leave in almost all
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:25,728	| IOT200 |	I thought that was
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:28,800	| IOT200 |	That's one of the reasons that I'm so delicious
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:31,616	| IOT200 |	Excited about this cuz I see a future where
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,640	| IOT200 |	We going to convergence
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:33,152	| IOT200 |	Earphones
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:34,688	| IOT200 |	And things like
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:35,712	| IOT200 |	Medical hearing device
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:37,504	| IOT200 |	And suddenly you have the
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:39,040	| IOT200 |	These things basically in your ear all the
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:41,600	| IOT200 |	The time in a performing a useful function
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:43,392	| IOT200 |	And having that battery life
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:43,904	| IOT200 |	We'll see
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:45,440	| IOT200 |	Multi
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:45,952	| IOT200 |	So
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:48,256	| IOT200 |	Taobao
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:54,656	| IOT200 |	Yes let's talk about node-red which I thought was a brand-new thing but Stacy correctly informed me
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:58,240	| IOT200 |	That she wrote about in 2013 and we talked about it at least once before the show
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:01,312	| IOT200 |	My favorite was the fact that we've had this conversation
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:02,336	| IOT200 |	Before like a year ago
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:05,152	| IOT200 |	Yeah
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:05,920	| IOT200 |	Oh it is
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:06,688	| IOT200 |	Awesome I have check
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:10,272	| IOT200 |	Memory upgrade
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:16,672	| IOT200 |	For those who don't remember such as many talking about node-red it is very interesting and worthwhile look if you go to no draw
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:17,696	| IOT200 |	Red. Org
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:19,488	| IOT200 |	It's basically
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:20,256	| IOT200 |	I call it
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:22,560	| IOT200 |	If this then that on steroids because
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:25,120	| IOT200 |	It has so many
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:27,936	| IOT200 |	He usage has so many integration points
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:31,520	| IOT200 |	It's rather technical support more technical than if this then that
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:35,616	| IOT200 |	And yet it's not at the same time because it's a drag and drop interface almost like
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:41,248	| IOT200 |	The MIT programming language
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:43,808	| IOT200 |	We keep old blocks into make me know to create program
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:48,672	| IOT200 |	He got a flowchart out what you want your devices to do how you want them to communicate
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:49,440	| IOT200 |	And
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:55,840	| IOT200 |	Send messages notifications and you can connect things to databases that mean that you could go hog-wild and the only reason
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:30:01,472	| IOT200 |	My radar again today is because somebody on the Reddit home automation subgroup
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:03,520	| IOT200 |	Had completely outfitted a
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:05,824	| IOT200 |	Many many devices entire home
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:09,152	| IOT200 |	With no dragon head always float charge and I was like oh this is
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:11,968	| IOT200 |	School so yes we have talked about it before no it is not
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:13,248	| IOT200 |	Specifically new
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:15,808	| IOT200 |	It's worth a look if you're looking for a
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:18,624	| IOT200 |	Different way to automate your
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:24,512	| IOT200 |	Home automation in your smart home and you can run it locally like on a Raspberry Pi or you can run
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:28,096	| IOT200 |	In the cloud through AWS Microsoft Azure Etc
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:29,888	| IOT200 |	So it's another option
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:30,912	| IOT200 |	And you can use it
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:31,424	| IOT200 |	With home assistant
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:33,728	| IOT200 |	So home assistant is one of those
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:34,496	| IOT200 |	Downloadable
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:36,032	| IOT200 |	It's like open have
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:37,312	| IOT200 |	Homebridge
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:38,592	| IOT200 |	Is it downloadable thing
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,640	| IOT200 |	Run another pie and run all your devices
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,176	| IOT200 |	And you can actually use node red on top of
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,992	| IOT200 |	Have an easier way to program your
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:45,504	| IOT200 |	Pair devices
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:48,320	| IOT200 |	So why should
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:49,600	| IOT200 |	Say it isn't just for this
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,392	| IOT200 |	It's actually very
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:54,464	| IOT200 |	Popular in becoming more popular in the industrial iot
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:58,560	| IOT200 |	So we're seeing some people in the OT World Maybe
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:01,376	| IOT200 |	More familiar with this type of user interface trying to
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:02,144	| IOT200 |	To adopt it
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:03,936	| IOT200 |	For setting rules around here
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:05,216	| IOT200 |	Smart buildings
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:06,240	| IOT200 |	And also
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:11,872	| IOT200 |	So this is I mean it's a pretty robust platform it was developed at IBM
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:13,152	| IOT200 |	Wayback
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:14,944	| IOT200 |	14 is Kevin said and it's
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:16,480	| IOT200 |	It's a good soft
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:17,760	| IOT200 |	I like it
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:21,600	| IOT200 |	I think that covers a lot of stuff
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:23,392	| IOT200 |	This week please run the gamut
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:27,488	| IOT200 |	Let's go now to Riot podcast listener hotline

EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,392	| IOT200 |	Interested
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:28,928	| IOT200 |	And your recommendation
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:30,464	| IOT200 |	Brightest
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,512	| IOT200 |	Normal bike

EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:36,352	| IOT200 |	What
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:37,888	| IOT200 |	150 watt type
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:38,912	| IOT200 |	Size bulbs
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:40,704	| IOT200 |	Seems to me
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:43,008	| IOT200 |	There's not too many very bright ones out there
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:45,312	| IOT200 |	Strictly shouldn't wenzhou
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:46,592	| IOT200 |	Hubless
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,384	| IOT200 |	Are Wi-Fi

EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,712	| IOT200 |	Cheats that most of
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:52,736	| IOT200 |	Topping out at
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:54,016	| IOT200 |	Seawater
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:56,064	| IOT200 |	Maybe 75-watt
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:56,832	| IOT200 |	Mange
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:58,112	| IOT200 |	Monkey looking back
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:33:00,672	| IOT200 |	I'm looking for a soft light dimmable
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:01,952	| IOT200 |	Situation
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:04,256	| IOT200 |	And I'm also curious if maybe it's
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:05,792	| IOT200 |	Smarter better
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:07,328	| IOT200 |	You get a c
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:07,840	| IOT200 |	Smart
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:10,144	| IOT200 |	And then just use regular
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:15,008	| IOT200 |	So this is an interesting question because most of the smart bulbs that we
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:15,776	| IOT200 |	Found
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:19,616	| IOT200 |	Pretty much max out at like a 75-watt equivalent lifx
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:21,920	| IOT200 |	Seems to be the brightest in terms of lumens
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:27,040	| IOT200 |	We started looking 450-watt Replacements we came up short
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:27,808	| IOT200 |	There are
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:29,344	| IOT200 |	Definitely LED bulbs
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:33,184	| IOT200 |	We did find a couple but we would not recommend them
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:33,952	| IOT200 |	Because they are from
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:34,720	| IOT200 |	Randall
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:36,000	| IOT200 |	Random
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:38,560	| IOT200 |	This is true
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:39,328	| IOT200 |	This is true
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:41,888	| IOT200 |	Books that we're not very familiar with I guess I should say yes
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:44,192	| IOT200 |	To your thought about
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:45,728	| IOT200 |	Getting a Smart Switch is
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:48,032	| IOT200 |	Probably the way to go and
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:53,152	| IOT200 |	Because of that you're going to save on the cost of your balls because the bulbs won't be smart
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:58,528	| IOT200 |	Your switch would then be no obviously cost your maybe forty $50 but you can find
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:02,112	| IOT200 |	Many many LED bulbs that are in the range of
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:03,392	| IOT200 |	Any word from
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:05,696	| IOT200 |	15 at least 1600 lumens
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:09,024	| IOT200 |	If you want to go with the inexpensive route EcoSmart
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:11,584	| IOT200 |	Has 100 watt replacement LED bulbs
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:13,120	| IOT200 |	They are
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:15,168	| IOT200 |	Basically
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:18,240	| IOT200 |	Price of $10 27 for a two pack
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:21,056	| IOT200 |	So that's where you're saving your money since the smarts aren't there
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:25,408	| IOT200 |	Cree also makes 100 watt replacement LED bulb but there could be a little more Spencer your PayPal
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:29,248	| IOT200 |	$13 for a dimmable LED from them
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:35,648	| IOT200 |	We definitely found all doable because you mentioned him both so it was one non-dimmable I'll just mention in kg
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:37,952	| IOT200 |	She decided don't need that effort every single light
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:38,976	| IOT200 |	Phillips does make
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:42,304	| IOT200 |	A 100 watt replacement non-dimmable LED with about
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:43,072	| IOT200 |	1500
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:43,840	| IOT200 |	Lumens
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:45,120	| IOT200 |	And that'll cost you about it
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:49,472	| IOT200 |	$12 97 for a two packs are the same as 1 crib also
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:52,800	| IOT200 |	You're obviously paying a little bit more for the dimmable Factor if you want that but
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:54,592	| IOT200 |	You got a bunch of options there
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:56,384	| IOT200 |	I would go with the switch quite honestly
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:58,688	| IOT200 |	There's just if you need that kind of brightness
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:00,224	| IOT200 |	And then Tim ability Factor
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:02,784	| IOT200 |	Might as well save money on the balls I just put the switches in
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:03,808	| IOT200 |	Yeah I agree
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:05,600	| IOT200 |	And having
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:08,160	| IOT200 |	And having it be dimmable is probably really awesome
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:08,672	| IOT200 |	Awesome because
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:11,488	| IOT200 |	It's not all the time you want multiple light bulb
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:12,512	| IOT200 |	I was giving you $100
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:14,048	| IOT200 |	What's right
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:15,072	| IOT200 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:16,096	| IOT200 |	Dial it back a little
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:19,680	| IOT200 |	Yeah these are all soft whites as well so just put that into the
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:21,216	| IOT200 |	Equation as well
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:26,336	| IOT200 |	Stacy you're more of a light switch off Smart Switch person than I am so what are your favorites
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:27,872	| IOT200 |	And what are the cost
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:29,152	| IOT200 |	Sister Joan has an idea
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:30,432	| IOT200 |	Torso
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:31,456	| IOT200 |	Lutron
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,224	| IOT200 |	If you want it
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:32,992	| IOT200 |	To work with
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:34,784	| IOT200 |	Assistance you're going to need a hub
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:36,064	| IOT200 |	So you may not
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:37,088	| IOT200 |	Want to go that route
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,624	| IOT200 |	Route those are about 50 V bucks
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:39,904	| IOT200 |	Her
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:40,416	| IOT200 |	Switch
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:42,976	| IOT200 |	The other options are Leviton
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:47,584	| IOT200 |	And those are about 40 to $50 but they don't require Hub their Wi-Fi switches
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:49,120	| IOT200 |	WeMo has a Wi-Fi
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:50,912	| IOT200 |	Switch that works really well
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:53,728	| IOT200 |	But I don't love the fact that it's really bright
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:55,776	| IOT200 |	Has all these lights on it so it's not great for like
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:35:57,312	| IOT200 |	And
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:58,848	| IOT200 |	Those are good
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:35:59,616	| IOT200 |	Brilliant
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:00,640	| IOT200 |	What is a light
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:01,664	| IOT200 |	Panel but it's
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:03,200	| IOT200 |	Overkill if you just want
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:04,736	| IOT200 |	Lights it also acts kind of a smart home
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:07,040	| IOT200 |	So it's coming to Mableton
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:09,856	| IOT200 |	Integrates with cubed integrates with all this other stuff
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:11,136	| IOT200 |	It's a neat concept
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:14,208	| IOT200 |	But it's a lot of work to program and
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:14,720	| IOT200 |	It may be Overkill
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:17,536	| IOT200 |	And it's far more expensive as well
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:20,864	| IOT200 |	So it's brilliant a 1 gang switch cost $300
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:22,912	| IOT200 |	Or the control a two gang switch
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:24,704	| IOT200 |	It's going to cost $350
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:25,728	| IOT200 |	Echoes up for their
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,288	| IOT200 |	You can use the fancy
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,568	| IOT200 |	Capacitive touch screen
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:31,360	| IOT200 |	Boxer thermostat
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,128	| IOT200 |	Music
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:32,896	| IOT200 |	All kinds of stuff
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:36,480	| IOT200 |	You pay more but you're getting more in that case of if John wants
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:38,272	| IOT200 |	To add features he has that option then
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,064	| IOT200 |	John I don't know if
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:40,832	| IOT200 |	I need to go that far
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,880	| IOT200 |	I mean if you want to go that far it's a nice enough
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:44,160	| IOT200 |	It's your money
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:45,440	| IOT200 |	All right
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:48,000	| IOT200 |	Well I feel that we have reached
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:49,536	| IOT200 |	Good closing

EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,008	| IOT200 |	It has been used
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:00,800	| IOT200 |	It feels kind of lame
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:03,360	| IOT200 |	Stacy's trash is your treasure
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:04,384	| IOT200 |	Exactly
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:05,920	| IOT200 |	Thanks Marie kondo
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:11,040	| IOT200 |	T2 now for our guests this week Michael Wolff of the spoon
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:15,904	| IOT200 |	And the founder of the smart Kitchen Summit he's going to be talking about connected kitchens
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:18,976	| IOT200 |	And the features you should look for in your next big appliances
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:25,632	| IOT200 |	Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:28,448	| IOT200 |	This week sponsor is database provider
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:29,984	| IOT200 |	And we have evolved
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:30,752	| IOT200 |	Aloe vera
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:31,776	| IOT200 |	Who is here too
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:33,824	| IOT200 |	I talked to us about farrakhan's new
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:35,104	| IOT200 |	Sitri Edge
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:35,616	| IOT200 |	Database
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:38,944	| IOT200 |	You go to database
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,992	| IOT200 |	Specifically for the iot
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:42,016	| IOT200 |	Tea tree Edge
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:46,880	| IOT200 |	Why
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:52,512	| IOT200 |	To answer your question why was to try to help solving the problem
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:59,168	| IOT200 |	Bridging the Gap that exists today between
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:02,752	| IOT200 |	Is that two roles that they already
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:12,480	| IOT200 |	Connecting the sheer amount of operational sensors that are producing thousands of data points per second
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:14,016	| IOT200 |	Is provided by the information technology systems
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:17,856	| IOT200 |	Okay and how does a database
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:29,376	| IOT200 |	Justin Bieber
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:30,400	| IOT200 |	But you can also have
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:31,936	| IOT200 |	Edible just like chains
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:37,568	| IOT200 |	Hub spoke or even met too many repetitions with filters to separate which they deliver sent where
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:39,872	| IOT200 |	It's almost like a fool
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:47,040	| IOT200 |	Are the basics care of that for you
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:56,256	| IOT200 |	Motor model database this entity provides both SQL and nosql
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:58,048	| IOT200 |	A computer requires
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:38:59,328	| IOT200 |	SPAC High School
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:02,656	| IOT200 |	I forgot to give you the flexibility of the skin
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:03,936	| IOT200 |	Kevo store interfaces
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:07,008	| IOT200 |	You can drop hundreds of thousands of data points per second
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:11,616	| IOT200 |	Still having to worry with the extra latency traduced by relationships are complex SQL queries
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:13,664	| IOT200 |	Traditional relational database for example
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:16,736	| IOT200 |	SQL database
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:20,064	| IOT200 |	So you can integrate your business intelligence your machine learning
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:25,440	| IOT200 |	Or any other bit of processing system that requires a standard interface has inquired it in real time
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:27,744	| IOT200 |	This can be done directly on the edge
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:29,280	| IOT200 |	Or on your central repository for
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:31,072	| IOT200 |	And what about
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:31,584	| IOT200 |	Security
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:43,104	| IOT200 |	It supports most of the algebraic systems like raspbian Windows RT Oracle decor
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:49,248	| IOT200 |	Karate application without having to write a single line of code
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:53,856	| IOT200 |	Not to mention the sport to Ida platforms like thing works from PC
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:54,880	| IOT200 |	That sounds great
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:57,952	| IOT200 |	So where can I buy listeners find out more information
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:58,464	| IOT200 |	About seats
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:05,376	| IOT200 |	Sensor data in real-time
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:09,472	| IOT200 |	Supplication to put a belt on a Raspberry Pi that you can easily do by yourself if you want
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:12,800	| IOT200 |	It's available on fire cam. Cam
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:13,824	| IOT200 |	If you'd like to watch it
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:24,320	| IOT200 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:25,856	| IOT200 |	Podcast today's guest
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:27,136	| IOT200 |	Is Michael Wolff
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:29,952	| IOT200 |	Who is founder of the smart Kitchen Summit and
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:31,488	| IOT200 |	Publisher of the
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:33,792	| IOT200 |	Spoon he's also a former colleague of mine
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:36,096	| IOT200 |	Gigaohm and he's
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:36,608	| IOT200 |	Now on
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,400	| IOT200 |	Bigger better
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:39,424	| IOT200 |	Smarter things
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:41,216	| IOT200 |	So Michael are you doing
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:43,264	| IOT200 |	Be good Stacey thanks for having me on
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:44,288	| IOT200 |	Man thanks for coming
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:45,312	| IOT200 |	And so I love
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:46,592	| IOT200 |	Smart kitchen gadgets
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:48,128	| IOT200 |	Like my favorite thing in the world
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:50,688	| IOT200 |	Actually it is not my favorite thing in the world
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:54,016	| IOT200 |	My favorite thing in the world is probably my nanoleaf lights they don't do anything
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:55,296	| IOT200 |	Next up is the kitchen
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:56,576	| IOT200 |	We just got back from
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:41:00,672	| IOT200 |	What I saw was a lot of the big Appliance
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:06,560	| IOT200 |	Fans are now actually offering real connected devices in the kitchen not just
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:10,144	| IOT200 |	You know things are wifi-connected but actually trying to build smarts into
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:11,936	| IOT200 |	I saw a fridges that
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:12,960	| IOT200 |	Eye cameras in it
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:13,984	| IOT200 |	I saw lots of ovens with
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:15,264	| IOT200 |	You know AI
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:16,544	| IOT200 |	You cooking
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:18,592	| IOT200 |	What are the big trends that you're seeing
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:19,616	| IOT200 |	From the major
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:22,176	| IOT200 |	Yeah I think you had a right
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:26,272	| IOT200 |	One of the things I wrote about for malachor this year was We would see
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:27,296	| IOT200 |	The big Appliance maker
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:28,576	| IOT200 |	Finally integrating
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:29,600	| IOT200 |	Intelligence
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:30,368	| IOT200 |	Features
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:31,904	| IOT200 |	Things like cameras and
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:34,208	| IOT200 |	Kind of things that understand what's in the cook
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:36,256	| IOT200 |	So I think you saw that cross the board was it at
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:43,680	| IOT200 |	Since they had their countertop oven this Century what I would call in sick of June like oven they also have their smart
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:46,240	| IOT200 |	That word actually had
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:49,824	| IOT200 |	Augmented reality on top of that memory as you cook
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:51,872	| IOT200 |	You can put stuff in then come does an overweight
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:52,895	| IOT200 |	Video screen
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:53,919	| IOT200 |	They also have this
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:56,223	| IOT200 |	Really kind of interesting modular oven
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:57,503	| IOT200 |	From KitchenAid that Elijah Wood
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:42:00,575	| IOT200 |	Steamer like a grill in there you also saw this
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:06,719	| IOT200 |	From Samsung they're entering the fourth generation of the family of Samsung's been going at it for a while now with the refrigerator and freezer talk about quite a bit in
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:07,999	| IOT200 |	For the first time really
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:10,815	| IOT200 |	Family Hub refrigerator actually has food recognition
EDL	00:42:11,327	00:42:15,423	| IOT200 |	So they've had the camera in there for a while if you're shopping
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:16,703	| IOT200 |	You can see what you forgot
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:19,775	| IOT200 |	That's okay that's kind of interesting but like the ability to actually recognize
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:23,103	| IOT200 |	Food pantry opens up some other interesting applications
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:26,687	| IOT200 |	I think what we saw from the big Appliance makers is moving beyond this idea just like
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,735	| IOT200 |	Adding WiFi and app control
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:36,159	| IOT200 |	Adding more intelligent creatures around cooking like Machine Vision play GE Building in the Hesston capabilities or the countertop
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:36,927	| IOT200 |	Cooktop is that you
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:38,463	| IOT200 |	She talking to the bachelor
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:40,767	| IOT200 |	Cookware to all these different things
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:44,095	| IOT200 |	Together showed me that the big of ice makers are really kind of making a Porsche
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:44,863	| IOT200 |	Into the kitchen
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:45,631	| IOT200 |	And adding work
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:51,007	| IOT200 |	Okay so then my question to you becomes as a consumer
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:52,799	| IOT200 |	Let's pretend that I am building a house
EDL	00:42:53,311	00:42:54,335	| IOT200 |	Cuz one day soon I will be
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:56,127	| IOT200 |	And I'm looking at all of the
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:56,895	| IOT200 |	The stuff
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:42:58,687	| IOT200 |	I feel like they're still several ecos
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:02,015	| IOT200 |	There's like whirlpools got there yummly stuff
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:03,295	| IOT200 |	Dimension GE and Heston
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:04,575	| IOT200 |	So
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:05,343	| IOT200 |	How is that working
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:10,207	| IOT200 |	I think we're still early stages right so even though the big eyes art
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:11,999	| IOT200 |	Getting in we are still
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:13,791	| IOT200 |	In these worlds were there separate Island
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:15,839	| IOT200 |	Technology nothing really in her Opera
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:19,423	| IOT200 |	You have guys like in it that are trying to ascend
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:21,983	| IOT200 |	Is an operating system if you will
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:26,079	| IOT200 |	You mentioned yummy that's really kind of whirlpools play the kind of build your own the other bag of ice
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:27,615	| IOT200 |	I figure they said hey why don't we just build her
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:29,151	| IOT200 |	Tire wall Garden
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:30,687	| IOT200 |	Technology
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:31,711	| IOT200 |	But I think that
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:36,575	| IOT200 |	That's kind of the challenge of early-stage markets we saw the same thing in the Smyrna or nothing really kind of work together
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:37,599	| IOT200 |	I think that's kind of.
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:38,367	| IOT200 |	State Route with
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:40,415	| IOT200 |	The kitchen until I take the challenges
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:42,207	| IOT200 |	Moving forward as I had to get these things dinner Opera
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:44,255	| IOT200 |	So I think Amazon Echo
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:46,303	| IOT200 |	AG I think those are kind of the deaf
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:50,143	| IOT200 |	Acto interoperability layers where they basically kind of circum
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:51,679	| IOT200 |	Vented and circumnavigated
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:53,215	| IOT200 |	What the kind of War
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:55,775	| IOT200 |	Smart kitchen Technology support on Technologies were trying to be
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:43:58,847	| IOT200 |	Stepping back into your question of if you're trying to build a home
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:01,151	| IOT200 |	I still think it's so early that I don't think a lot of
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:02,687	| IOT200 |	People who are building homes in
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:07,807	| IOT200 |	Customizable kitchen if you're redoing your kitchen so I can $50,000 thing the Challenger is like
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:09,343	| IOT200 |	Okay what do I put in there from a technology purse
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:11,647	| IOT200 |	The water this app isn't available
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:14,463	| IOT200 |	So all people really think he is a Sub-Zero fridge
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:16,511	| IOT200 |	Why won't like the G
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:22,911	| IOT200 |	Cafe line about technology I think if you're moving into new home you're thinking maybe about smart home but I just
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:25,983	| IOT200 |	Don't think you were there right now think about I want really advanced technology make
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:28,031	| IOT200 |	It is early
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:31,871	| IOT200 |	And let's just be selfish just for me since I have you in urine
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:34,175	| IOT200 |	And it like 18 months
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:35,455	| IOT200 |	I am going to be
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:36,223	| IOT200 |	Moving into
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:36,991	| IOT200 |	To a new home
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:38,015	| IOT200 |	Buy new Appliance
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:40,575	| IOT200 |	So maybe not witch
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:44,159	| IOT200 |	Companies I should look at but what are the technologies that you
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:46,207	| IOT200 |	You think will be there that I should be like
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:48,255	| IOT200 |	I will not settle for anything less than
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:51,839	| IOT200 |	Well I don't know if it's
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:54,655	| IOT200 |	Too early but I think it'd be really cool. Is building a new kitchen
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:55,679	| IOT200 |	The new home to have
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:59,775	| IOT200 |	The wireless power Consortium technology and my countertops like that'll be really cool
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:01,567	| IOT200 |	To have a inductive kind of
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:03,103	| IOT200 |	Power transfer technology
EDL	00:45:03,103	00:45:04,127	| IOT200 |	You can be silly have a
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:06,687	| IOT200 |	Qi Power Pad in your countertop that'll be pretty cool
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:08,479	| IOT200 |	I think it may be too early 18 months might be
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:10,271	| IOT200 |	Be kind of kind of course I know that they're trying to push it
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:12,831	| IOT200 |	Kelly's big guys are really pushing hard to get more
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:16,159	| IOT200 |	Technology for offerings in their high-end and
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:17,695	| IOT200 |	Keep pushing you down towards their kind of mainstream
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:21,535	| IOT200 |	Start off on the high end products of the moving into their Main Street
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:24,095	| IOT200 |	Tokaji eats a GE Cafe line
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:25,119	| IOT200 |	Pretty high-end
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:25,887	| IOT200 |	The challenges
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:27,167	| IOT200 |	You may have to have a mix
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:33,567	| IOT200 |	Brand type of kitchen if you want like the most advanced cooktop the most brands like if he wants like Steam
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:34,847	| IOT200 |	I've been like you want most
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:37,663	| IOT200 |	Refrigerator you need to sound like this hodgepodge a brands
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:43,295	| IOT200 |	It's cuz like right now you can't really look at anyone Brandon say Hey Dad this great line up across all the built-in Technologies
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:45,599	| IOT200 |	That have great smart technology really ban
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:46,367	| IOT200 |	They're all different
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:51,231	| IOT200 |	Let me break it down maybe this way so you don't have to tell me that Brands but like
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:52,255	| IOT200 |	What should I look for in my
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:54,303	| IOT200 |	Prevention cameras
EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:59,679	| IOT200 |	Maybe food recognition so let's do that tell me which are the Advanced Technologies I should need in
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:00,447	| IOT200 |	Jacob replied
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:01,215	| IOT200 |	It's a so we'll start with the fur
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:03,519	| IOT200 |	I mean Samsung
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:05,055	| IOT200 |	I think LG
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:09,663	| IOT200 |	Has been there as well really trying to make the refrigerator the Showcase in the
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:10,687	| IOT200 |	Location of Ike more advanced
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:11,455	| IOT200 |	Technology
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:17,855	| IOT200 |	We're on the fourth generation family Hub refrigerator like I said this is the first year that there cameras inside really understand what
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:19,391	| IOT200 |	Food is I think it's pretty
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:20,159	| IOT200 |	Interesting
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:21,951	| IOT200 |	The channel for me is like iced tea packets
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:23,743	| IOT200 |	Say how committed to Samsung long-term
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:26,815	| IOT200 |	Do I want to spend $4,000 on a Samsung family hub
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:31,679	| IOT200 |	And will that have a Tinder why cycle it seems like they're really committed it's like they've been going at the store
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:33,983	| IOT200 |	For 5 years now it seems like they're going to be there
EDL	00:46:33,983	00:46:36,287	| IOT200 |	Everything from the second generation on
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:38,079	| IOT200 |	Upgrades to the latest software
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:41,919	| IOT200 |	If I were working in a fridge you know you probably go a Samsung or LG
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:44,991	| IOT200 |	I would definitely want cameras inside and Wi-Fi connectivity
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:46,527	| IOT200 |	Other than that like there's nothing really
EDL	00:46:47,039	00:46:49,087	| IOT200 |	From the mainstream technology perspective
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:50,623	| IOT200 |	That you can get much more than that
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:54,463	| IOT200 |	Does not the electronic nose built into these fridges yet right there's nothing like that
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:55,231	| IOT200 |	Some of these
EDL	00:46:55,231	00:46:57,023	| IOT200 |	Kaiser think about putting like warming
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:47:02,143	| IOT200 |	Defrosters in the fridges so having like Beyond freezing at you going to warming but that's not available yet
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:05,215	| IOT200 |	Okay and then let's talk about my other
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:07,519	| IOT200 |	I demanded my Smart Oven
EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:08,031	| IOT200 |	In 18 months
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:10,079	| IOT200 |	I would love to have
EDL	00:47:10,079	00:47:11,359	| IOT200 |	An oven with a
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:11,871	| IOT200 |	Cool
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:14,175	| IOT200 |	Screen on it weathers to television
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:16,479	| IOT200 |	Or like a monitor or like an augmented reality
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:20,319	| IOT200 |	Translucent screen like you saw with like a Whirlpool I think that it really cool I think
EDL	00:47:20,319	00:47:21,855	| IOT200 |	You've grown to like your June
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:23,391	| IOT200 |	So having something
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:24,671	| IOT200 |	That recognizes what's in
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:25,439	| IOT200 |	Inside and kind of
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:26,719	| IOT200 |	Programs
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:27,487	| IOT200 |	The cook
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:33,631	| IOT200 |	In monitors the cook I think that'll be pretty cool not Technologies definitely moving into the built-in appliances I would demand that
EDL	00:47:33,631	00:47:34,911	| IOT200 |	I like the idea modularity
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:36,703	| IOT200 |	KitchenAid have this module
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:37,215	| IOT200 |	New
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:43,871	| IOT200 |	You be able to add steam functionality or add like a grill function out in there or I got cooking Stone
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:44,639	| IOT200 |	So is that in
EDL	00:47:44,639	00:47:45,151	| IOT200 |	Inside the oven
EDL	00:47:45,663	00:47:46,943	| IOT200 |	It's inside the oven
EDL	00:47:46,943	00:47:48,479	| IOT200 |	And it's basically add-on
EDL	00:47:48,479	00:47:49,503	| IOT200 |	So there's actually like
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:50,783	| IOT200 |	Can interface at the back of the venue
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:51,551	| IOT200 |	Depandi sings In
EDL	00:47:52,063	00:47:53,343	| IOT200 |	Haha okay cool
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:54,367	| IOT200 |	My stove top
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:56,159	| IOT200 |	I would go with induction
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:58,975	| IOT200 |	I know that induction cooking isn't as popular in the US
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:47:59,743	| IOT200 |	But I think that there
EDL	00:48:00,255	00:48:01,535	| IOT200 |	So much more you can do
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:05,631	| IOT200 |	Your kid is less likely to get burned or just less likely for a fire to start
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:08,191	| IOT200 |	And you can do things like high-precision cooking like what the heck
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:11,519	| IOT200 |	I like the GE oven with Heston technology built in
EDL	00:48:11,519	00:48:13,055	| IOT200 |	You could do this guy to cooking her
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:15,871	| IOT200 |	Hi Precision cooking you can't actually do that with fire
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:16,895	| IOT200 |	Felicio
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:18,175	| IOT200 |	How about my dishwasher
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:18,943	| IOT200 |	That's a great question
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:20,479	| IOT200 |	I would like
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:22,527	| IOT200 |	Kind of love these little countertop
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:25,599	| IOT200 |	A big built-in kitchen with
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:26,111	| IOT200 |	He's really kind of
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:27,647	| IOT200 |	High-end appliances
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:29,695	| IOT200 |	But like the tetris going to be shipping I think
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:33,279	| IOT200 |	By mid-year and there's another one I forgot the name of it there's another smart
EDL	00:48:33,279	00:48:35,071	| IOT200 |	Countertop dishwasher that actually
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:36,863	| IOT200 |	Uses like a fraction of the water
EDL	00:48:36,863	00:48:39,167	| IOT200 |	In a much smaller washwell
EDL	00:48:39,167	00:48:40,191	| IOT200 |	I really like this
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:42,239	| IOT200 |	I just think it's such a smart idea
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:42,751	| IOT200 |	Would you say
EDL	00:48:43,519	00:48:44,799	| IOT200 |	Cuz I was envisioning
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:46,335	| IOT200 |	So I'm on the market for those
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:47,615	| IOT200 |	Drawers that pull out
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:50,687	| IOT200 |	Dishwasher drawers that are not full size dishwashers coz
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:51,967	| IOT200 |	I have a family of three so
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:53,503	| IOT200 |	It's like two of those wood
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:54,783	| IOT200 |	Do just fine for me but
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:57,087	| IOT200 |	What are you talking about is this an actual countertop
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:48:58,879	| IOT200 |	Yeah so he works
EDL	00:48:58,879	00:48:59,647	| IOT200 |	Announce
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:03,999	| IOT200 |	In 2018 SES the Tetra dishwasher is a truly cool
EDL	00:49:03,999	00:49:06,815	| IOT200 |	Dishwasher design Fathead that frog design
EDL	00:49:06,815	00:49:10,399	| IOT200 |	Design company frog made it look so sexy it uses a gallon of water
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:11,935	| IOT200 |	I can do to spice up
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:13,215	| IOT200 |	So it's a much
EDL	00:49:14,239	00:49:17,823	| IOT200 |	Ecological footprint like it waste Way West water weigh less energy
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:19,103	| IOT200 |	It also has
EDL	00:49:19,103	00:49:22,175	| IOT200 |	If you're living out of an RV or if you're living in a dorm meeting at U of a dishwasher
EDL	00:49:22,687	00:49:23,967	| IOT200 |	All right I'm seeing these
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:25,759	| IOT200 |	Okay and then let's see
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:26,527	| IOT200 |	I feel like
EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:29,343	| IOT200 |	There's tons of countertop appliances
EDL	00:49:29,343	00:49:30,367	| IOT200 |	That people can draw
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:34,463	| IOT200 |	Just buy those feel great for like a retrofit are there any standout
EDL	00:49:34,463	00:49:37,279	| IOT200 |	You know countertop appliances that you're like oh my gosh
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:38,815	| IOT200 |	If you buy a dumb coffee maker
EDL	00:49:39,327	00:49:40,863	| IOT200 |	You're making a huge mistake
EDL	00:49:40,863	00:49:42,143	| IOT200 |	You know coffee is like
EDL	00:49:43,167	00:49:44,191	| IOT200 |	Waiting on the
EDL	00:49:44,191	00:49:44,959	| IOT200 |	NetSpend
EDL	00:49:44,959	00:49:46,239	| IOT200 |	Copy machine for a while
EDL	00:49:46,239	00:49:49,311	| IOT200 |	But there are some interesting connected coffee makers coming out
EDL	00:49:49,311	00:49:52,639	| IOT200 |	I'm waiting for a Kelvin coffee roaster one thing I've been waiting to do that
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:58,783	| IOT200 |	You trying to roast Tech coffee in the home and does it cost a roaster called Kelvin that should be shipping this year they're actually running a little late but that
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:50:03,647	| IOT200 |	It's kind of fun what's your coffee drinking habits are you someone who drinks everyday
EDL	00:50:03,647	00:50:04,159	| IOT200 |	Super automatic
EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:05,183	| IOT200 |	Coffee maker
EDL	00:50:06,207	00:50:07,743	| IOT200 |	Bruised it but hey
EDL	00:50:07,743	00:50:09,279	| IOT200 |	I've been looking at the bonaverde
EDL	00:50:09,279	00:50:09,791	| IOT200 |	I'm not going to
EDL	00:50:10,303	00:50:11,583	| IOT200 |	I think looks amazing
EDL	00:50:12,351	00:50:15,679	| IOT200 |	We try that other problem is you really need to
EDL	00:50:15,679	00:50:16,447	| IOT200 |	Capital One apply
EDL	00:50:16,959	00:50:20,799	| IOT200 |	Right I think the roast grind Brew
EDL	00:50:21,311	00:50:22,079	| IOT200 |	It's like
EDL	00:50:22,079	00:50:24,895	| IOT200 |	I think that at one picture too much I think the roasting
EDL	00:50:24,895	00:50:28,479	| IOT200 |	Built into an appliance that also crying that bruises maybe too much
EDL	00:50:29,503	00:50:30,015	| IOT200 |	You're saying that's over
EDL	00:50:30,783	00:50:32,063	| IOT200 |	I tasted the coffee and I was
EDL	00:50:33,087	00:50:33,855	| IOT200 |	I am so here for
EDL	00:50:34,367	00:50:35,135	| IOT200 |	But okay
EDL	00:50:35,135	00:50:36,415	| IOT200 |	We will not worry about that
EDL	00:50:36,927	00:50:37,695	| IOT200 |	Let's talk
EDL	00:50:37,695	00:50:39,743	| IOT200 |	Talk about any other countertop Appliance
EDL	00:50:40,767	00:50:41,535	| IOT200 |	I should be like
EDL	00:50:41,535	00:50:42,559	| IOT200 |	This must have intelligence
EDL	00:50:43,583	00:50:44,607	| IOT200 |	No I mean
EDL	00:50:44,607	00:50:46,143	| IOT200 |	I don't think you want to add a total
EDL	00:50:46,143	00:50:47,167	| IOT200 |	This retarded sake
EDL	00:50:47,167	00:50:47,679	| IOT200 |	I think
EDL	00:50:48,191	00:50:49,471	| IOT200 |	Steam is underrated
EDL	00:50:49,471	00:50:54,335	| IOT200 |	Yeah Wilson Rothman of the Wall Street Journal that has the same thing he said it ever been like that's a category he's waiting
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:55,103	| IOT200 |	The pop
EDL	00:50:55,103	00:50:57,407	| IOT200 |	Waiting for customers just makes your food taste
EDL	00:50:57,407	00:50:59,967	| IOT200 |	So you saw 2 Ball come out there generation
EDL	00:50:59,967	00:51:03,551	| IOT200 |	Do this like about a couple months ago I did a review of it I really like the
EDL	00:51:03,551	00:51:05,343	| IOT200 |	The taste of food this is another new guys
EDL	00:51:05,855	00:51:07,135	| IOT200 |	It's always a
EDL	00:51:07,135	00:51:07,903	| IOT200 |	Countertop oven
EDL	00:51:08,927	00:51:09,951	| IOT200 |	Smartest
EDL	00:51:09,951	00:51:11,231	| IOT200 |	But it has female tattoo
EDL	00:51:11,743	00:51:13,279	| IOT200 |	And such a little cheaper than the June
EDL	00:51:13,279	00:51:18,911	| IOT200 |	There are some like I said I mention the whirlpool one that actually has steam capability they can add as a feature
EDL	00:51:18,911	00:51:20,959	| IOT200 |	I do think if you're moving to new house I think
EDL	00:51:20,959	00:51:24,031	| IOT200 |	Steam is like 7 years real look at cuz it just makes food taste so much better
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:25,567	| IOT200 |	Induction and
EDL	00:51:25,567	00:51:26,335	| IOT200 |	Steam
EDL	00:51:26,335	00:51:27,103	| IOT200 |	Keep that in mind
EDL	00:51:27,103	00:51:28,383	| IOT200 |	So also
EDL	00:51:28,383	00:51:30,431	| IOT200 |	With the Samsung family fridge for example there's a
EDL	00:51:31,455	00:51:33,503	| IOT200 |	GE just showed a downdraft
EDL	00:51:34,015	00:51:35,039	| IOT200 |	Kind of system with that
EDL	00:51:35,039	00:51:36,319	| IOT200 |	27 in
EDL	00:51:36,319	00:51:37,343	| IOT200 |	Screen audit
EDL	00:51:37,343	00:51:39,135	| IOT200 |	I feel like I saw something else
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:41,183	| IOT200 |	The screen on it and I was kind of like
EDL	00:51:42,207	00:51:43,231	| IOT200 |	So what
EDL	00:51:43,231	00:51:49,631	| IOT200 |	Talk about where the Hub in the kitchen should be or where we need all these screen cuz I certainly don't need every Appliance.
EDL	00:51:49,631	00:51:51,423	| IOT200 |	Come with a really expensive
EDL	00:51:51,423	00:51:53,471	| IOT200 |	Beautiful screen that I'm just going to get grease all over
EDL	00:51:54,495	00:51:57,055	| IOT200 |	I mean I think that Amazon or Google
EDL	00:51:57,055	00:51:58,079	| IOT200 |	Marcus plays
EDL	00:51:58,079	00:51:59,103	| IOT200 |	That was really smart
EDL	00:51:59,103	00:52:03,199	| IOT200 |	Because if you look at the kitchen like it's where we spend so much time it's the Gathering
EDL	00:52:03,199	00:52:08,063	| IOT200 |	Spot and we were making food purchasing decisions and you can't do all that as much as I like
EDL	00:52:08,063	00:52:09,855	| IOT200 |	Amazon wants you to avoid shopping
EDL	00:52:09,855	00:52:10,879	| IOT200 |	You're not going to do out
EDL	00:52:10,879	00:52:11,903	| IOT200 |	Was I not filling out a
EDL	00:52:11,903	00:52:12,415	| IOT200 |	React shopping list
EDL	00:52:12,927	00:52:16,511	| IOT200 |	So I think that this idea of having the smartest ways on countertops
EDL	00:52:16,511	00:52:17,279	| IOT200 |	Really is
EDL	00:52:17,279	00:52:20,095	| IOT200 |	Martin you're seeing those really take off what appliances
EDL	00:52:20,095	00:52:20,607	| IOT200 |	Should take a belfie
EDL	00:52:21,119	00:52:23,423	| IOT200 |	I just don't know if it's going to be the refrigerator
EDL	00:52:23,423	00:52:25,471	| IOT200 |	I think this refrigerator has a very center
EDL	00:52:25,471	00:52:27,519	| IOT200 |	Space in most homes
EDL	00:52:27,519	00:52:30,847	| IOT200 |	Don't know if I could going to see tens of millions of like family have pepper
EDL	00:52:30,847	00:52:31,615	| IOT200 |	Refrigerators at
EDL	00:52:31,615	00:52:33,407	| IOT200 |	Speak strength screen
EDL	00:52:33,407	00:52:36,735	| IOT200 |	It's not a bad idea but I think that's kind of a limited set of people they're going to do that
EDL	00:52:37,759	00:52:39,039	| IOT200 |	BGE large
EDL	00:52:39,039	00:52:41,087	| IOT200 |	Display GE I think that's
EDL	00:52:41,087	00:52:43,903	| IOT200 |	Pretty interesting idea I think it's probably
EDL	00:52:43,903	00:52:45,183	| IOT200 |	Refrigerator conversation
EDL	00:52:45,183	00:52:45,951	| IOT200 |	So I don't know
EDL	00:52:46,463	00:52:47,231	| IOT200 |	If I can pick a winner
EDL	00:52:47,743	00:52:50,559	| IOT200 |	I think it may be a mix of all these in a water smart countertops
EDL	00:52:50,559	00:52:54,399	| IOT200 |	Swayze I think that did you see the Whirlpool oven with augmented reality on it
EDL	00:52:55,167	00:52:56,447	| IOT200 |	Yeah I said it
EDL	00:52:57,215	00:53:01,311	| IOT200 |	I just don't know if people who watch a lot of television on that everything but I do think I got to be like
EDL	00:53:01,311	00:53:02,079	| IOT200 |	Really interesting
EDL	00:53:02,079	00:53:04,127	| IOT200 |	Into manager cook and maybe do some shopping on
EDL	00:53:04,127	00:53:04,895	| IOT200 |	Okay
EDL	00:53:04,895	00:53:06,943	| IOT200 |	And I feel that we have to talk about the
EDL	00:53:07,455	00:53:10,015	| IOT200 |	We have talked a lot about Trends but it's time to get
EDL	00:53:10,527	00:53:11,551	| IOT200 |	Time to get in the now
EDL	00:53:12,831	00:53:16,415	| IOT200 |	So The Wirecutter just put out a review it was
EDL	00:53:16,415	00:53:17,695	| IOT200 |	January 15th
EDL	00:53:17,695	00:53:19,999	| IOT200 |	I love The Wirecutter I've actually in
EDL	00:53:19,999	00:53:21,535	| IOT200 |	Full disclosure arrive at work for the wire
EDL	00:53:21,535	00:53:23,071	| IOT200 |	Hair cutter and done some reviews for them
EDL	00:53:23,071	00:53:24,351	| IOT200 |	But they are headline
EDL	00:53:24,351	00:53:24,863	| IOT200 |	It broke my heart
EDL	00:53:25,375	00:53:26,399	| IOT200 |	June oven review
EDL	00:53:26,399	00:53:28,191	| IOT200 |	Not the countertop oven used
EDL	00:53:28,191	00:53:32,287	| IOT200 |	You should buy and basically the wire cutters Michael Sullivan
EDL	00:53:32,287	00:53:32,799	| IOT200 |	Who I don't know
EDL	00:53:33,311	00:53:39,711	| IOT200 |	I'm sure he's a wonderful person who knows what he's talking about he basically said that you nothing at $600 is not
EDL	00:53:39,711	00:53:40,479	| IOT200 |	Not better than their
EDL	00:53:40,991	00:53:41,503	| IOT200 |	Cake toaster oven
EDL	00:53:42,015	00:53:42,783	| IOT200 |	Is the Cuisinart
EDL	00:53:42,783	00:53:43,807	| IOT200 |	Tob 26
EDL	00:53:43,807	00:53:44,575	| IOT200 |	0 + 1
EDL	00:53:45,343	00:53:46,367	| IOT200 |	That'll stick with you
EDL	00:53:46,367	00:53:50,975	| IOT200 |	They're like you know what cost more and it doesn't do as much and they're big beef seem to be the
EDL	00:53:51,743	00:53:54,047	| IOT200 |	What's frustrating to find programs I don't know if
EDL	00:53:54,047	00:53:55,583	| IOT200 |	Is food just wasn't recognized
EDL	00:53:56,095	00:54:01,727	| IOT200 |	He couldn't adjust time in increments that work for him I don't know so I was curious
EDL	00:54:02,239	00:54:03,007	| IOT200 |	Your take on this
EDL	00:54:03,007	00:54:06,079	| IOT200 |	That's because you know I know that you know that you enough and in one of your
EDL	00:54:06,591	00:54:08,127	| IOT200 |	Your colleagues really loves his
EDL	00:54:08,127	00:54:10,687	| IOT200 |	I mean I feel like people when they do reviews
EDL	00:54:10,687	00:54:11,967	| IOT200 |	The projected WaterOne
EDL	00:54:11,967	00:54:14,527	| IOT200 |	What this means for like ever one right
EDL	00:54:14,527	00:54:17,087	| IOT200 |	I think people are so unique and how they cook
EDL	00:54:17,087	00:54:17,855	| IOT200 |	And have such
EDL	00:54:18,367	00:54:20,415	| IOT200 |	Specific views and what works for them
EDL	00:54:20,415	00:54:23,487	| IOT200 |	Michael Sullivan I don't know him I haven't read the review in full by like
EDL	00:54:23,487	00:54:24,511	| IOT200 |	I'm sure he's
EDL	00:54:24,511	00:54:26,559	| IOT200 |	Trying to extrapolate like how he likes his
EDL	00:54:26,559	00:54:29,887	| IOT200 |	Kitchener like and what he kind of likes and fell faults but
EDL	00:54:29,887	00:54:30,911	| IOT200 |	You have someone like
EDL	00:54:30,911	00:54:32,703	| IOT200 |	You I think you have the June one
EDL	00:54:32,703	00:54:35,007	| IOT200 |	Chris Albrecht with June to em both love it
EDL	00:54:35,007	00:54:41,407	| IOT200 |	I know that a lot of kids would that you and because it's very easy to cook with her kids so I can't really speak to what his mean
EDL	00:54:41,407	00:54:42,943	| IOT200 |	Problem was I do think there's
EDL	00:54:43,455	00:54:44,991	| IOT200 |	It's right I think that their society by
EDL	00:54:44,991	00:54:46,783	| IOT200 |	It's a small countertop oven
EDL	00:54:47,551	00:54:49,087	| IOT200 |	I also just think that there's
EDL	00:54:49,087	00:54:55,487	| IOT200 |	General Luddite feeling among a lot of people and a lot of editorial people that just reject on his face like
EDL	00:54:55,487	00:55:01,119	| IOT200 |	More technology in the kitchen they just want us to use kind of old-school tool to grew up with we don't need more SmartThings
EDL	00:55:01,119	00:55:02,911	| IOT200 |	This is glass maker space
EDL	00:55:02,911	00:55:07,007	| IOT200 |	Face in the home one of the things he talked about was the cameras fun to use but it doesn't make
EDL	00:55:07,007	00:55:07,775	| IOT200 |	Cooking easier
EDL	00:55:07,775	00:55:08,543	| IOT200 |	Which
EDL	00:55:08,543	00:55:09,567	| IOT200 |	Rang very false
EDL	00:55:10,079	00:55:14,687	| IOT200 |	Because to me it makes it tremendously easy because I just put something in and I don't know how that if it identifies
EDL	00:55:15,199	00:55:16,735	| IOT200 |	Then I don't have to know how to
EDL	00:55:17,503	00:55:18,271	| IOT200 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:55:18,271	00:55:19,039	| IOT200 |	Are we all do this
EDL	00:55:19,807	00:55:24,671	| IOT200 |	Are people right but I think often times the articles are written before review things and I feel like
EDL	00:55:24,671	00:55:25,695	| IOT200 |	And I can't speak to the
EDL	00:55:25,695	00:55:27,743	| IOT200 |	This Michael Sullivan tennis article
EDL	00:55:27,743	00:55:28,511	| IOT200 |	I know I've had people
EDL	00:55:29,023	00:55:29,791	| IOT200 |	Write about
EDL	00:55:29,791	00:55:31,839	| IOT200 |	Things just go get that remind me up for
EDL	00:55:32,863	00:55:36,703	| IOT200 |	It might just be that he rejects the idea by more technology in the kitchen
EDL	00:55:36,703	00:55:38,495	| IOT200 |	Or he just found it you didn't like it
EDL	00:55:38,495	00:55:39,775	| IOT200 |	Like maybe he was had to struggle
EDL	00:55:39,775	00:55:41,055	| IOT200 |	What's a recognizing his bacon
EDL	00:55:41,567	00:55:43,359	| IOT200 |	Yeah and I wonder if you tried to cook
EDL	00:55:43,359	00:55:43,871	| IOT200 |	Some fancy
EDL	00:55:44,639	00:55:45,663	| IOT200 |	Cuz he's talking about the
EDL	00:55:45,663	00:55:47,199	| IOT200 |	Camera getting stumped a lot
EDL	00:55:47,199	00:55:49,247	| IOT200 |	And I mean every now and then mine gets
EDL	00:55:49,247	00:55:50,015	| IOT200 |	Stumped
EDL	00:55:50,015	00:55:52,831	| IOT200 |	We can go like a month without it not recognizing
EDL	00:55:52,831	00:55:55,647	| IOT200 |	Something because I mean we tend to cook the same things we're not
EDL	00:55:55,647	00:55:56,415	| IOT200 |	I like super
EDL	00:55:56,415	00:55:57,695	| IOT200 |	You have 2 player Adventure SP
EDL	00:55:58,207	00:55:59,487	| IOT200 |	So I don't know
EDL	00:55:59,487	00:56:01,279	| IOT200 |	This wounded me to the core of my
EDL	00:56:01,279	00:56:02,303	| IOT200 |	My soul so I was
EDL	00:56:03,327	00:56:07,935	| IOT200 |	No I mean I think he has a point where I'm looking at article now I do think that the main
EDL	00:56:07,935	00:56:09,727	| IOT200 |	Probably have is like the June is actually
EDL	00:56:11,007	00:56:14,335	| IOT200 |	It's right like it's just doesn't have that big a cavity and that's what I
EDL	00:56:14,847	00:56:17,919	| IOT200 |	Pushing and asking and wondering win the big geyser
EDL	00:56:17,919	00:56:22,271	| IOT200 |	Forgetting in getting back what we talked about earlier having these big built-in appliances
EDL	00:56:22,271	00:56:24,319	| IOT200 |	Whisper capabilities I think it's going to
EDL	00:56:24,319	00:56:25,599	| IOT200 |	Really be interesting cuz
EDL	00:56:25,599	00:56:26,623	| IOT200 |	You can't cook it
EDL	00:56:26,623	00:56:27,135	| IOT200 |	A turkey
EDL	00:56:28,159	00:56:32,511	| IOT200 |	I can only do so much with these small cavity of mine doesn't even the Jim Bilton like his beastly the
EDL	00:56:32,511	00:56:33,535	| IOT200 |	Is the countertop in a
EDL	00:56:34,303	00:56:35,327	| IOT200 |	Hilton
EDL	00:56:35,327	00:56:39,679	| IOT200 |	Container it was a really like a wall up and it was more than
EDL	00:56:39,679	00:56:41,471	| IOT200 |	You're sticking the June countertop in the wall
EDL	00:56:42,751	00:56:44,031	| IOT200 |	And I I will agree with
EDL	00:56:44,031	00:56:46,079	| IOT200 |	With that I do wish this were in my larger ovenly
EDL	00:56:46,847	00:56:47,871	| IOT200 |	Okay
EDL	00:56:47,871	00:56:48,639	| IOT200 |	Well
EDL	00:56:48,639	00:56:50,175	| IOT200 |	I just I had to bring that up
EDL	00:56:50,175	00:56:52,735	| IOT200 |	And I am looking forward to your next smart kitchen event
EDL	00:56:53,247	00:56:54,015	| IOT200 |	Wherever it may be
EDL	00:56:54,527	00:56:55,807	| IOT200 |	Where to going to be
EDL	00:56:55,807	00:56:58,111	| IOT200 |	At houseware show in March I have to go to that that's
EDL	00:56:58,111	00:57:01,183	| IOT200 |	It's a great show for countertop appliances in
EDL	00:57:01,183	00:57:07,583	| IOT200 |	In San Francisco on the future of food robots Chris Albrecht and I and that whole whole spoon team will be doing a food web
EDL	00:57:07,583	00:57:12,447	| IOT200 |	It's a very small bet that we're having the guy who's behind the Sony aibo Ravin
EDL	00:57:12,447	00:57:17,311	| IOT200 |	The head of Google brain come and just getting all these nerves in her room cuz I talked about how robotics will change the world of food
EDL	00:57:17,823	00:57:18,847	| IOT200 |	And so that will be on April
EDL	00:57:19,359	00:57:19,871	| IOT200 |	Intemperance
EDL	00:57:20,639	00:57:21,663	| IOT200 |	It's called articulate
EDL	00:57:21,663	00:57:22,431	| IOT200 |	Awesome
