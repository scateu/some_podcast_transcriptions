EDL	00:00:58,880	00:00:59,648	| IOT116 |	Which
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:02,720	| IOT116 |	Put sensors on cars to test air pollution and
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:08,096	| IOT116 |	Man this is great iot use case we're going to talk about all kinds of challenges she faced
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:08,864	| IOT116 |	First
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:11,168	| IOT116 |	Let's kick off the show with a

EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:59,296	| IOT116 |	All right, let's kick it off with
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:00,832	| IOT116 |	New WiFi products
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:02,880	| IOT116 |	Because we love the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:06,464	| IOT116 |	Gyro
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,744	| IOT116 |	Which I have Eero
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:09,024	| IOT116 |	Routers at
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:10,048	| IOT116 |	My house
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,584	| IOT116 |	Where are you going to the wife I still
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:16,192	| IOT116 |	I am still tired I detest the Arizona was very very happy with
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:22,336	| IOT116 |	New products be two of the Eero routers don't worry dies
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:23,616	| IOT116 |	Your V ones are still cool
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:28,224	| IOT116 |	So what did Johnny say John 3 things that change the form factor
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:30,528	| IOT116 |	Did adding a radio protocol and
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:33,088	| IOT116 |	Get out of services so let's break that down
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:35,648	| IOT116 |	New form factor what they've done
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,928	| IOT116 |	They've taken a
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,744	| IOT116 |	Normal Euro
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:41,536	| IOT116 |	The square with rounded edges
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,816	| IOT116 |	That's going to be the
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:48,448	| IOT116 |	Primary hero that plugs into your router and has two ethernet ports that you can use for switches and all that other good stuff
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:50,496	| IOT116 |	And that caused what is that cost 7
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:53,056	| IOT116 |	The original gyro
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:53,824	| IOT116 |	At no
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:57,920	| IOT116 |	Actually the original arrows were three for $500 for 99
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:59,712	| IOT116 |	And then I went down I think by 100.
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:01,760	| IOT116 |	Nosey
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,528	| IOT116 |	The new version
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:09,440	| IOT116 |	I will the new version is I-10 and 10 Beacon which American talk about is
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:10,976	| IOT116 |	$299
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:12,256	| IOT116 |	90
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,816	| IOT116 |	Pekin is confusing
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,376	| IOT116 |	Beacons Ark
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:19,424	| IOT116 |	Completely new form factor for them
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:24,544	| IOT116 |	And they plug into the wall so they kind of remind me of the plume Wi-Fi pods
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:26,336	| IOT116 |	So think of this is a WiFi pod
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:30,944	| IOT116 |	It also happens to double as a nightlight so it might be something nice you put in your hallway
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:32,480	| IOT116 |	Forget Wi-Fi in
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,504	| IOT116 |	Hallway spaces
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:36,320	| IOT116 |	I got half the size of the original gyro
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,088	| IOT116 |	Yeah
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:37,600	| IOT116 |	And so
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:44,512	| IOT116 |	That's the idea is you will by the mainiero and then for many people just plugging in a couple Bekins around their house
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,536	| IOT116 |	Cows are going to be sufficient
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,888	| IOT116 |	This one factor is is it's good I can see how this would work
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:50,656	| IOT116 |	Free People
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:52,704	| IOT116 |	I would be sticking with my
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,472	| IOT116 |	Eero
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:04:00,640	| IOT116 |	Crow zero normal zero with ethernet
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:03,200	| IOT116 |	Sims 3 full-sized Euros are 499
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:04,224	| IOT116 |	Got it
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,504	| IOT116 |	Okay so
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:07,040	| IOT116 |	That is State that's back to that
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:11,392	| IOT116 |	And ideas 1 0 and 1 begin
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:14,464	| IOT116 |	For 299 is going to cover a 1/2 to bed
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:19,327	| IOT116 |	A two to three bedroom home you're going to want to add another Beacon
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,375	| IOT116 |	Play with that a little bit
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:23,167	| IOT116 |	And the pro
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:23,935	| IOT116 |	The three
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,727	| IOT116 |	Euro Pros
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,519	| IOT116 |	That's like a five to six bedroom
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,311	| IOT116 |	So that's one of those massive
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:31,359	| IOT116 |	Massive houses like we haven't
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,919	| IOT116 |	So I'm liking this
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:36,735	| IOT116 |	I think what I'm going to do with my setup
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:39,295	| IOT116 |	Because I have wired Lan and I have a lot of sweets
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,599	| IOT116 |	I keep my exist
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,135	| IOT116 |	But I might
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,159	| IOT116 |	Actually you know
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,439	| IOT116 |	Spring for an extra Peak energy
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:50,047	| IOT116 |	Brights right and in my case I do not have wire
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:54,399	| IOT116 |	Ethernet throughout the house so I have to go with a wireless solution so
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,447	| IOT116 |	I would if it were me
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:59,263	| IOT116 |	I'm take a look at the I-10 and
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:03,359	| IOT116 |	One or two because I got to figure that out based on homes us make sense
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:04,895	| IOT116 |	Yasso
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,663	| IOT116 |	This
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,943	| IOT116 |	I don't know what this feels
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:07,967	| IOT116 |	Pretty good for them
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,759	| IOT116 |	The other bits though
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:12,063	| IOT116 |	I think really excite
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,135	| IOT116 |	They've added
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:15,903	| IOT116 |	Thread
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:16,415	| IOT116 |	Capability
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,695	| IOT116 |	To there
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:21,279	| IOT116 |	And I know many of you guys are going to be like
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,047	| IOT116 |	What
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,839	| IOT116 |	That's still around
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:27,167	| IOT116 |	So thread is a low-power wireless protocol
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,727	| IOT116 |	That was developed by nest
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:30,495	| IOT116 |	Samsung
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:32,031	| IOT116 |	Couple other companies
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:33,055	| IOT116 |	And it's
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:36,383	| IOT116 |	It's basically a replacement or more modern
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,919	| IOT116 |	Replacement for zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,735	| IOT116 |	So think about it's a mesh Network
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:43,551	| IOT116 |	Talks directly to the Internet so it support IPv6
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,087	| IOT116 |	And
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:47,135	| IOT116 |	For the longest time
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:49,439	| IOT116 |	Most people have been like I'm not all
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:51,999	| IOT116 |	I'm not that excited about the red most people are not into the red
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:54,047	| IOT116 |	I was one of those people
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:06:00,447	| IOT116 |	So yeah I just talked about manufacturer so I asked Nick Weaver the CEO of Iran like
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,471	| IOT116 |	A threat he's like well
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:04,543	| IOT116 |	It's a great protocol and he thinks that
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:09,663	| IOT116 |	One of the reasons manufacturers aren't into it is because there's nothing to act as a
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:12,223	| IOT116 |	Hub for it so there's nothing to support
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:15,551	| IOT116 |	Unless you've got Nest products in your house you don't have
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:17,343	| IOT116 |	The thread Network that
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,623	| IOT116 |	You need like for my Mashburn
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:20,927	| IOT116 |	So
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:23,231	| IOT116 |	It's going to act as a thread border router
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:24,767	| IOT116 |	End
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:26,303	| IOT116 |	That will be exciting if
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:29,887	| IOT116 |	Stats
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:32,703	| IOT116 |	I don't think it's a Bad Bet and I'm trying to think
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:36,031	| IOT116 |	Are there any other routers right now that have
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,311	| IOT116 |	Thread support
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:41,919	| IOT116 |	Google why is my yeah I think it I think it might
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,711	| IOT116 |	I have to check out to be sure but
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:46,015	| IOT116 |	That's the only one I can think of you know and that's
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:52,927	| IOT116 |	It without the support the network support the vertical support you're not going to have products that work with it so sleepy I start somewhere so
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,951	| IOT116 |	Kudos to you
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,719	| IOT116 |	Chicken and egg
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:55,999	| IOT116 |	Barrister providing
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:57,535	| IOT116 |	Snow the chicken
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,839	| IOT116 |	Is the router the egg or the chicken
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:06,239	| IOT116 |	All right and then the final thing for this news is Eero is adding services
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,519	| IOT116 |	So
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:11,103	| IOT116 |	Then creating basically a $10 a month service
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:14,175	| IOT116 |	And you get applications over the net
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,967	| IOT116 |	Work the first two they're launching
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:17,759	| IOT116 |	Is security so network security
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,295	| IOT116 |	Through the network
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,319	| IOT116 |	And then the
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:22,111	| IOT116 |	Other one is Parental Control
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,391	| IOT116 |	Drools like more
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:26,719	| IOT116 |	Right now you have the ability to like pause devices
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,255	| IOT116 |	On your Eros
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,791	| IOT116 |	And you don't set like
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:32,095	| IOT116 |	My kids stuff can't go online at this place in
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,911	| IOT116 |	If you don't let you do things like
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:36,191	| IOT116 |	Summer editor's let you
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:37,215	| IOT116 |	Play whitelist sites
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:40,799	| IOT116 |	But as a parent I'm excited because they have things like
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:44,639	| IOT116 |	I can enable Google safe search for all devices associated
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:45,919	| IOT116 |	My daughter
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:47,455	| IOT116 |	And she actually can't change that
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:49,759	| IOT116 |	So
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:50,783	| IOT116 |	Is Edison Pointe timeout
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:51,807	| IOT116 |	Get smarter
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:56,671	| IOT116 |	They just Google for the answer to figure out how to get around the Google
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:02,047	| IOT116 |	That is part of this service as well so I'm excited to see the
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:04,607	| IOT116 |	I'm in the security stuff
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,399	| IOT116 |	It's actually very similar to what
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:10,751	| IOT116 |	The Almond router offers the Almond router from securifi has similar security
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:12,799	| IOT116 |	Features I don't believe they charge for them
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,615	| IOT116 |	Well and normally
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,895	| IOT116 |	I'm not a fan of
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:19,455	| IOT116 |	Paying for monthly services with smart home taipei
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,479	| IOT116 |	Things and
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:20,991	| IOT116 |	But not but
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:23,295	| IOT116 |	In this case I probably would make an exception
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:23,807	| IOT116 |	Because
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:27,903	| IOT116 |	What we talked about all the time or the challenges at IRT and smartphones and such
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:29,183	| IOT116 |	Is the security
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:31,999	| IOT116 |	So if this can help protect against
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:38,399	| IOT116 |	And I are going to have a lot of malicious website or s or some other exploit I'm all for it
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:42,495	| IOT116 |	You know and that's the promise I mean that the promises he will understand like
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:43,775	| IOT116 |	Hey
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,335	| IOT116 |	Should your nest thermostat really be talking to China
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,615	| IOT116 |	Herbert
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:50,175	| IOT116 |	And so that's the exciting part
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:53,759	| IOT116 |	Again I would pay I honestly would Pages for
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:56,063	| IOT116 |	Trolls because my daughter is a little
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:56,831	| IOT116 |	Younger than your kid
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:09:00,415	| IOT116 |	It's and curious to see
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:06,815	| IOT116 |	A security research firm really take a look at that's only because the promise is is pretty big men
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:11,935	| IOT116 |	Euro says that it's got built-in protections as a database of threats and that database
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:15,519	| IOT116 |	Has millions of malicious websites and net
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:18,079	| IOT116 |	It's updated every second so there's a lot of
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,127	| IOT116 |	Cloud stuff going on there
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:21,919	| IOT116 |	And it sounds very promising
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,711	| IOT116 |	But but seeing practice
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,807	| IOT116 |	That's the news
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,087	| IOT116 |	It's pretty big update
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:31,391	| IOT116 |	Very exciting will get the new routers
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:34,463	| IOT116 |	Here to test and we'll hear more about those win
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:35,999	| IOT116 |	When the time comes
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,535	| IOT116 |	So
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,071	| IOT116 |	Also
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:39,839	| IOT116 |	In Wi-Fi
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:44,447	| IOT116 |	The Wi-Fi Alliance is doing a home design Serta
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:46,239	| IOT116 |	Patient and I
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,543	| IOT116 |	I mean I think that's a great idea
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:51,615	| IOT116 |	Work so
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:52,895	| IOT116 |	Kevin you want to tell him what
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:59,039	| IOT116 |	Well to this is a really not force a consumer this is for home builders
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:02,623	| IOT116 |	Desertification project if you're going to build a house 2
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:07,231	| IOT116 |	You integrate Wi-Fi networks in the in the design of your home construction
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:08,511	| IOT116 |	So
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:11,583	| IOT116 |	They're going to suggest where you put access points and so on and so forth
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,119	| IOT116 |	I'm wondering how many
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:13,887	| IOT116 |	Builders
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,679	| IOT116 |	Will use this
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:20,287	| IOT116 |	What the cost benefit is to running you know either net and so on so forth.
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:22,079	| IOT116 |	Granted it's expensive to run
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:24,383	| IOT116 |	Cabling so there's got to be a cost-savings there
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,199	| IOT116 |	I don't know because
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:29,247	| IOT116 |	So we built our house in 2012
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:32,319	| IOT116 |	And we ran cable and ethernet
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,343	| IOT116 |	Every room
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:34,623	| IOT116 |	End
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,159	| IOT116 |	I'm so glad we did
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,695	| IOT116 |	Because
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,231	| IOT116 |	Almighty
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:43,839	| IOT116 |	And
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:50,751	| IOT116 |	It'd be really interesting like as acedia contractor you know like you could come in and have someone outfit your house for like
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,519	| IOT116 |	Smart home and
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:53,567	| IOT116 |	Retroact
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:55,871	| IOT116 |	What if we do this but like in the design phase
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:59,967	| IOT116 |	I don't know if I really buy into saying Go Wireless over
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,479	| IOT116 |	Wired
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:02,271	| IOT116 |	Right right
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:06,879	| IOT116 |	It's a tough decision because you know what is it you don't know what your home buyers
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:11,743	| IOT116 |	Needs will be in terms of services that are they going to do you know 4K video streaming on
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:13,023	| IOT116 |	And every bedroom
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,559	| IOT116 |	You just don't know
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:15,839	| IOT116 |	So
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,399	| IOT116 |	It's an interesting concept
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:21,471	| IOT116 |	I'm just not sure about the practicality of it yet
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:26,079	| IOT116 |	And maybe it's too far ahead of its time cuz I remember we had Scott Jensen who actually
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:28,639	| IOT116 |	He's a design dude he actually works at Google but
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:35,807	| IOT116 |	He came on to talk about like design considerations and Construction in one of the things he mentioned was as Wireless
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,831	| IOT116 |	Technology gets better
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,135	| IOT116 |	It becomes really
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,927	| IOT116 |	Telling to not have to like
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:44,255	| IOT116 |	4 light switches you wouldn't have a light switch you just have
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:46,559	| IOT116 |	Bluetooth switch
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:51,679	| IOT116 |	But
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:53,215	| IOT116 |	So you would eliminate the need for like
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,519	| IOT116 |	Wiring in huge parts of
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,031	| IOT116 |	The home
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:58,335	| IOT116 |	This is kind of that same idea and that's
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:03,455	| IOT116 |	That is a cost-savings especially when you talk about copper wiring when you're talking about like Cat6 cable
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:03,967	| IOT116 |	Alyssa
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:09,599	| IOT116 |	Rite Aid cost savings but now I'm trying to think of it from a homebuyer perspective
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,367	| IOT116 |	If
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:15,231	| IOT116 |	Your cell phone is Houston say what we've gone through the Wi-Fi Alliance Home Design products so
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,023	| IOT116 |	We can tell you where the best
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:17,791	| IOT116 |	Places to put
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:19,071	| IOT116 |	Your router isn't over
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,887	| IOT116 |	I don't know if somebody really cares about that
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:25,471	| IOT116 |	Enough they made this a worldwide rather have
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:27,519	| IOT116 |	Wired how much does that cost you know
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:34,943	| IOT116 |	And then if they're smart enough to know they need a wire there probably smart enough to figure out where the best place to buy routers and someone anyway
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,479	| IOT116 |	Pro Wireless Tampa
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,759	| IOT116 |	Well in so weird
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,527	| IOT116 |	We're probably thinking
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:41,855	| IOT116 |	We're overthinking this we probably what's going to happen is
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:46,207	| IOT116 |	Again it's going to fade in the background and consumers will just have their Wi-Fi stuff
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:50,303	| IOT116 |	Right I think it was going to happen
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:54,911	| IOT116 |	All of your connected devices that wireless doorbell that you want that's going to work
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,727	| IOT116 |	So maybe it's a waiter like
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:00,799	| IOT116 |	But it's not really selling point maybe it's just the way to reduce
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:03,871	| IOT116 |	And cost
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,383	| IOT116 |	And
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,967	| IOT116 |	You guys can say hello to my neighbor
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:08,479	| IOT116 |	Pradaxa
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:10,271	| IOT116 |	Haven't having a field day today
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,551	| IOT116 |	All right so that's
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:15,647	| IOT116 |	So let's talk about services
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,207	| IOT116 |	Last week Kevin and I talked about
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,999	| IOT116 |	Opening his door
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:20,767	| IOT116 |	Through his Google
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,535	| IOT116 |	Home
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,559	| IOT116 |	Amazon figure out
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:23,583	| IOT116 |	How to do that
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:27,423	| IOT116 |	What you can't eat meat
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:28,191	| IOT116 |	But Scott Jones
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:30,239	| IOT116 |	Sent us an email he was like guys
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,031	| IOT116 |	It was actually
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:42,271	| IOT116 |	But he's right he's right we are
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,855	| IOT116 |	I did this with the echo because that's
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:49,183	| IOT116 |	That happens to be downstairs in my house and I know Kevin is an echo dude
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,207	| IOT116 |	So I set up
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,511	| IOT116 |	The way you're going to do this
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:56,863	| IOT116 |	To natively lock or unlock your doors have to be to separate commands
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,655	| IOT116 |	Is I went into wink
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:00,959	| IOT116 |	And I created a shortcut
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:01,727	| IOT116 |	It was called
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:03,519	| IOT116 |	Lock garage door
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,311	| IOT116 |	So I went into it
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:08,383	| IOT116 |	After setting the shortcut and I
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:12,735	| IOT116 |	Tied it to my Amazon Echo and then I said
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:13,503	| IOT116 |	I gave it
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,783	| IOT116 |	Command so
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,551	| IOT116 |	Ended
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,831	| IOT116 |	Precursor to any commands
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:19,903	| IOT116 |	Giver is Madame a trigger
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:22,207	| IOT116 |	And then whatever were you like
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,743	| IOT116 |	So
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:25,023	| IOT116 |	I did garage
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,095	| IOT116 |	Oh I know I did
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:28,863	| IOT116 |	Trigger
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:29,887	| IOT116 |	Lock garage
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:31,679	| IOT116 |	So
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:32,703	| IOT116 |	I probably should have
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:33,983	| IOT116 |	Extra lock
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:37,567	| IOT116 |	And you said that up and then you
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,591	| IOT116 |	Say if
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:40,895	| IOT116 |	Madame a trigger and then you go to then
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:41,663	| IOT116 |	You go to the wink
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:46,271	| IOT116 |	And then it's going to say shortcuts and it's going to give you a list of your shortcuts you pick the
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:47,295	| IOT116 |	Block version
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:48,319	| IOT116 |	And then
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:52,159	| IOT116 |	When I ran the command my latency was about admit it
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:55,487	| IOT116 |	It wasn't very long at all so
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:56,255	| IOT116 |	I really
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:58,303	| IOT116 |	Sutherlands great now you are good at to set up a separate
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,351	| IOT116 |	For unlocking it
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:01,631	| IOT116 |	And you mean
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:04,703	| IOT116 |	Try to get your Echo
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:09,823	| IOT116 |	Yeah shame on us for forgetting about half
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,103	| IOT116 |	Is Sia
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:12,127	| IOT116 |	That that's
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,407	| IOT116 |	Yeah I did I fell
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:13,919	| IOT116 |	I felt really
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,991	| IOT116 |	Will it away I mean that's
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:21,855	| IOT116 |	It's telling that the native services are getting better on these devices that you don't need
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:26,207	| IOT116 |	Some kind of backend Cloud Plumbing like afternoon in a lot of cases but
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:31,071	| IOT116 |	It is a great service and we shouldn't we should have overlooked it so it's kind of I kind of do feel silly as well
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,631	| IOT116 |	And this works because the wink
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:35,679	| IOT116 |	Actually can see the lock
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:38,239	| IOT116 |	And in my case the home
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:39,775	| IOT116 |	Can see the wing
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:41,567	| IOT116 |	But I can't see the lock on the way
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,591	| IOT116 |	See everything else on the way
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,359	| IOT116 |	Wake so
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,639	| IOT116 |	So this is a way to get around that
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:47,199	| IOT116 |	Yay and
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:51,039	| IOT116 |	We also noticed that in the Wink app
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,063	| IOT116 |	Should you want to
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:54,879	| IOT116 |	And Kevin says this has been around for a while
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:55,391	| IOT116 |	I
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:58,719	| IOT116 |	I have my Christmas lights
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:03,839	| IOT116 |	Do things on the Winker cuz I have to spread my Gloria my Gloria cross many hubs
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,375	| IOT116 |	I got it all
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:10,239	| IOT116 |	So he was like oh my God they have this and he's like
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:13,055	| IOT116 |	But I didn't tell you that in case you didn't know
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:16,383	| IOT116 |	You can set a mode change on link and have it work
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,151	| IOT116 |	Through
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:17,919	| IOT116 |	Google
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:18,687	| IOT116 |	Home
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:22,527	| IOT116 |	So you can have vacation mode and you can set a Cascade of events to happen
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:25,087	| IOT116 |	Turn off devices connected to your
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,135	| IOT116 |	And it will happen
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:27,647	| IOT116 |	When you say
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:30,207	| IOT116 |	I won't say the words but hey G
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:31,743	| IOT116 |	Is it telwink
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:33,535	| IOT116 |	Or is it just
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,047	| IOT116 |	Vacation mode
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:37,119	| IOT116 |	I mode
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,887	| IOT116 |	So
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:38,399	| IOT116 |	Haiti
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,679	| IOT116 |	Vacation mode
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,471	| IOT116 |	And
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:42,239	| IOT116 |	Gualala
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:42,751	| IOT116 |	It happens
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:46,847	| IOT116 |	Yeah this is this is been a beta for voice actions
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:49,151	| IOT116 |	With Google in wink
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:53,247	| IOT116 |	For a while and it actually now makes sense that they have shortcuts in Google
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:56,319	| IOT116 |	Which we talked about it to Mid to shows like
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:59,903	| IOT116 |	I wonder if the beta set information into that actual and finished product
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:01,951	| IOT116 |	So I actually try to shortcuts
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:05,279	| IOT116 |	I tried the Logitech Harmony volume up volume down shortcut
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,559	| IOT116 |	So far that is not working
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:10,143	| IOT116 |	So I am still troubleshooting that because I really wanted
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:13,727	| IOT116 |	At some point in time I'm going to figure it out you guys and then I'll come back to you
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:14,239	| IOT116 |	Say this is
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,031	| IOT116 |	Or
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,567	| IOT116 |	One of you astute listeners
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,335	| IOT116 |	Who's
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,615	| IOT116 |	Way better and things of things like if
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:22,943	| IOT116 |	Y'all can tell me how you did it because
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:23,455	| IOT116 |	Nothing I say
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,551	| IOT116 |	Why were talking services in wink
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:30,111	| IOT116 |	On the last episode we mention that
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,903	| IOT116 |	Wink added services
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:35,743	| IOT116 |	Two of them home sitter and Moonlight and I didn't try home sitter because
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:40,351	| IOT116 |	I work from home so I don't want the lights going on and off at various times to make it look like I'm home
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,655	| IOT116 |	Cuz I'm already home
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,935	| IOT116 |	Yes yes
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:48,543	| IOT116 |	But I'm home at 9
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:53,407	| IOT116 |	I can just see the girls downstairs watching TV hey the lights just went out
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,687	| IOT116 |	Make it look like we're not home
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:56,479	| IOT116 |	Moonlight I did use Moonlight witch
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:18:02,111	| IOT116 |	I actually used a manual version of this by setting up schedules and pack
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:04,927	| IOT116 |	I'm going to correct myself because in the last time I said they were robots
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:09,023	| IOT116 |	They were not realize they were schedules in the Wind Gap see so confusing
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:12,607	| IOT116 |	And that's the whole point of moonlight is to make it not confusing
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,887	| IOT116 |	Two brand-new
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,423	| IOT116 |	Wink Hub owners
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:16,959	| IOT116 |	So what Winky
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:18,751	| IOT116 |	Add was the Moonlight service which
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:21,055	| IOT116 |	Ask your lights turn on when it gets dark outside
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:25,663	| IOT116 |	And I was already doing that in the schedules are they said but in Moonlight I set it up
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:29,759	| IOT116 |	It's pretty simple to nice clean interface you pick which lights you want to go on
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,295	| IOT116 |	Are you
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:37,695	| IOT116 |	And put the location which basically it uses GPS to determine your home location to make sure I can sync up with when's sunset
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,463	| IOT116 |	When Sunset is
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:39,999	| IOT116 |	At your home
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:45,375	| IOT116 |	And then you choose timing and this is what it kind of fell down a little bit for me but I understand why
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:51,007	| IOT116 |	When do you want to turn your lights on and on and off is what it says and give you three options
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,799	| IOT116 |	Sunset to midnight
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:54,591	| IOT116 |	Sunset to 2 a.m.
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:56,127	| IOT116 |	Sunset to Sunrise
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:19:03,039	| IOT116 |	I had scheduled for like Sunset to like 10 or 11 p.m. you can't change the times in here you get three
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:03,807	| IOT116 |	Hard-code
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:04,831	| IOT116 |	Credit choices
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:08,415	| IOT116 |	I get the concept it's to make it simple and useful
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:14,047	| IOT116 |	I guess I would like to see a little spinner option to change
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:15,327	| IOT116 |	The time regardless of that
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:16,607	| IOT116 |	I set it up
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:19,679	| IOT116 |	Saved it turn it on and Moonlight is working perfectly fine
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:21,471	| IOT116 |	If I fits overriding my schedule
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:26,847	| IOT116 |	To my lights didn't go off at like 10:11 or 11 even though the schedule is still active
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:28,383	| IOT116 |	So if you have a schedule
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:31,455	| IOT116 |	I think moonlights can override that so
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:33,759	| IOT116 |	Those are pretty much the devices in
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:35,295	| IOT116 |	Stuff we tried this
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,831	| IOT116 |	Actually no I tried the WeMo dimmer
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:38,623	| IOT116 |	I tried installed it
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:45,279	| IOT116 |	Before last show and I didn't get a chance to test out some of the stuff but now that I've lived with it for a little bit longer
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:48,863	| IOT116 |	Wi-Fi dimmer switch for $80
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:51,167	| IOT116 |	Okay here's some cool features they've got
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:51,935	| IOT116 |	Nighttime
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:53,471	| IOT116 |	Tricep nighttime tula
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:54,751	| IOT116 |	20%
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:55,519	| IOT116 |	I think it's at by default
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:58,079	| IOT116 |	And the 20% means that between
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:20:01,663	| IOT116 |	The default setting is like 11 and 6 a.m.
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,711	| IOT116 |	When you hit the light switch in your room
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,735	| IOT116 |	Are you down
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:07,551	| IOT116 |	It's turn on it turns on at only 20%
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:09,599	| IOT116 |	Which is super nice in that just happen automatically
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,111	| IOT116 |	Automatic
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:11,391	| IOT116 |	Nice
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:12,927	| IOT116 |	The other thing it does
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:16,767	| IOT116 |	Pretty cool is it calibrates two different LEDs and so actually
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:18,559	| IOT116 |	Started with different LEDs in there
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:20,351	| IOT116 |	And what time is it
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:23,679	| IOT116 |	The calibration process has you turn it to its lowest setting
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,983	| IOT116 |	And then it has you run up and down the dimmer
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:28,799	| IOT116 |	To see if it flickers and if it flickers it tries again
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,079	| IOT116 |	So
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:33,663	| IOT116 |	That was actually really cool because flicker is annoying as all get-out
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,783	| IOT116 |	And how many years as well but I told others
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,575	| IOT116 |	I couldn't hear him from either the alley
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:43,903	| IOT116 |	Daiso
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,183	| IOT116 |	And
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:47,743	| IOT116 |	It appears that when you turn it on and off
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:50,303	| IOT116 |	It goes to the last remembered setting
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:55,167	| IOT116 |	So if you didn't have them 200% you turn the lights on it's going to go to whatever you like
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:55,679	| IOT116 |	Last Hyderabad
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:57,471	| IOT116 |	What you like or not
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,775	| IOT116 |	Things that are little counterintuitive
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:00,799	| IOT116 |	AR
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:02,847	| IOT116 |	There's a Dipper thing on it
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:04,639	| IOT116 |	That touch sensitive dimmer
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,919	| IOT116 |	Chocolate Groove
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:08,991	| IOT116 |	You would think that you could
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:14,111	| IOT116 |	Move your hand on it and turn it on but you can't you have to click it and then move up the
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,672	| IOT116 |	So it's only for the light
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:19,488	| IOT116 |	Outputs not for light on light off
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:20,000	| IOT116 |	Yes
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:22,816	| IOT116 |	And then the other thing is they have a long
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:28,704	| IOT116 |	Press option that was really excited about so you can actually control other we nose and in my bedroom
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:29,984	| IOT116 |	Which is where these are
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:31,776	| IOT116 |	Are the WeMo dimmer controller for camp
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,312	| IOT116 |	And then I have
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:37,152	| IOT116 |	A WeMo Insight switch that controls my husband's beds
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:37,664	| IOT116 |	Side table lamp
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:39,456	| IOT116 |	Hey
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:41,760	| IOT116 |	Worcester long press and turn everything
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,040	| IOT116 |	That would be awesome
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:46,624	| IOT116 |	And I told it to do that like
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:48,160	| IOT116 |	8 different times in
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:48,672	| IOT116 |	It never ever work
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,464	| IOT116 |	So the laundress
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:51,488	| IOT116 |	I don't know what's going
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:52,512	| IOT116 |	But it's not working
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:54,560	| IOT116 |	But it sounds very prompt
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:59,680	| IOT116 |	Yeah I mean they're both Wi-Fi devices I can assume and I can fit into each other
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:03,008	| IOT116 |	Yeah WeMo in the app conceive
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:04,288	| IOT116 |	It's very simple you're like
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:06,080	| IOT116 |	It's like settling press you press that
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:08,128	| IOT116 |	A toast to the thing where it's like
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:12,224	| IOT116 |	You can toggle something you can turn it on you can turn it off and I feel like you do
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:12,736	| IOT116 |	Another thing
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,528	| IOT116 |	So I just said turn off
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:19,392	| IOT116 |	And then it gives you all the WeMo devices it's found so in my house there
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:21,184	| IOT116 |	So I can
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:22,464	| IOT116 |	Dimmer and
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:23,488	| IOT116 |	Bedside table lamp
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:27,584	| IOT116 |	It's safe and when I hit save it was like
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:29,376	| IOT116 |	The screen just got a flash but I didn't
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:34,752	| IOT116 |	Forget the lag time
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:40,384	| IOT116 |	Strange
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:41,408	| IOT116 |	So we know
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:44,992	| IOT116 |	Alright news
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,528	| IOT116 |	There is some news
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:50,880	| IOT116 |	From the week before that we can get to in last week's podcast the biggest
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:53,184	| IOT116 |	AWS Greengrass
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:55,744	| IOT116 |	Y'all are like what
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:57,792	| IOT116 |	So this is for the Enterprise crew
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:02,656	| IOT116 |	What happened is Amazon has Amazon web services which is AWS
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:04,960	| IOT116 |	Huge business for them cloud
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:05,984	| IOT116 |	But
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:09,056	| IOT116 |	Green grass actually it brings
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:11,104	| IOT116 |	Iot to the edge
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:11,872	| IOT116 |	So
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:16,736	| IOT116 |	What you do is you can run AWS Greengrass core on an edge device
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:19,808	| IOT116 |	It will allow a lot of things to happen
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:22,112	| IOT116 |	And it talks to AWS Lambda serve
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:26,208	| IOT116 |	So some of the things that lets you do is it's going to help me in a state
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:28,256	| IOT116 |	On devices even when there's no internet connected
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,304	| IOT116 |	It helps
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,584	| IOT116 |	Communicate between
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:33,888	| IOT116 |	Other devices that talk to
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:37,472	| IOT116 |	The Gateway device so if you have
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:40,288	| IOT116 |	AWS iot SDK on
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:41,568	| IOT116 |	Vice
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:44,384	| IOT116 |	Those devices were all talk to AWS
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:45,408	| IOT116 |	Green grass running
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:46,432	| IOT116 |	Devices
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:47,968	| IOT116 |	Even if there's no
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:50,784	| IOT116 |	Haven't did that make sense to you
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,600	| IOT116 |	I felt like I was
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:54,624	| IOT116 |	Using a lot of
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:56,928	| IOT116 |	Words that didn't make sense to a lot of normal teeth
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:59,488	| IOT116 |	SO2 translate to normal
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,280	| IOT116 |	What this does is this pools
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,584	| IOT116 |	Amazon web services away from the cloud
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,608	| IOT116 |	Put on
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:06,656	| IOT116 |	A Gateway device
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:10,240	| IOT116 |	It extends Amazon's Cloud capabilities to the industrial
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,288	| IOT116 |	Because those guys
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:17,920	| IOT116 |	If tons of data a lot of it needs to happen without any latency so think about a blade
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:21,248	| IOT116 |	In a manufacturing plant that you know is chopping chickens to bits in
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:24,832	| IOT116 |	You know if it senses a finger in the way it's got to stop
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:29,696	| IOT116 |	So this is a really big Market
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,464	| IOT116 |	4
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:32,512	| IOT116 |	Everyone Microsoft has introduced
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:35,072	| IOT116 |	Azure at the iot
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:37,120	| IOT116 |	Azure at the iot edge does the same thing
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:39,424	| IOT116 |	Kind of links the cloud to the Gateway
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:41,728	| IOT116 |	Going to see a lot more this
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:44,544	| IOT116 |	And if you want to know more about 8
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:48,640	| IOT116 |	Green grass I did do a whole Amazon
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:50,688	| IOT116 |	Industry in the newsletter so
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,456	| IOT116 |	You could have Stacey on iot
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:55,296	| IOT116 |	Shameless plug for me
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:56,832	| IOT116 |	The other big news
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:57,856	| IOT116 |	Roblox
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:01,440	| IOT116 |	So we will talk about robots that much
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,976	| IOT116 |	Know what is that
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:05,280	| IOT116 |	There's a mean there's only so many cool things have
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:06,560	| IOT116 |	What is pretty
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,936	| IOT116 |	Sometimes they're scary
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:15,264	| IOT116 |	And I think that has a lot to do with what we're going to talk about next to be honest
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:18,080	| IOT116 |	This would be a good place for a nap
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:19,872	| IOT116 |	It's so scary
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:22,176	| IOT116 |	Tuscany
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:27,040	| IOT116 |	Yasso remember back in 2013 Google bought
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,320	| IOT116 |	Boston Dynamics
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,088	| IOT116 |	Text which makes those
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:31,392	| IOT116 |	Bipedal quad
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,160	| IOT116 |	People
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:33,440	| IOT116 |	Robots that
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:38,560	| IOT116 |	You can't take them over they look like when was like mechanical deer or Buffalo and they look like demons
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:43,680	| IOT116 |	See that there's the scary.
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:45,216	| IOT116 |	Giant
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:46,752	| IOT116 |	Loping
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:48,032	| IOT116 |	Jibon looking thing
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:52,640	| IOT116 |	That is really cool but scary as all get-out and they recently made a
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:54,432	| IOT116 |	Bipedal
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:56,224	| IOT116 |	Jump over stuff
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:59,296	| IOT116 |	Just scaring
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:01,600	| IOT116 |	It's so scary
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:08,000	| IOT116 |	Anyway there's been a lot of ammunition covered like you said these videos and a lot of people walking away
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:08,768	| IOT116 |	Terry and
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:10,816	| IOT116 |	I don't know the Google is happy with that but
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:13,120	| IOT116 |	It also made me the fact that
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:14,912	| IOT116 |	I don't know that they found a way to make money
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:15,936	| IOT116 |	From it
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,216	| IOT116 |	So
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:23,360	| IOT116 |	I think about a year ago it was rumored that they were looking to sell Boston Dynamics I think Toyota was actually in the mix for that
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:26,688	| IOT116 |	But regardless tire is not in the mix now because SoftBank
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:28,480	| IOT116 |	Has bought
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:31,296	| IOT116 |	Boston Dynamics SoftBank Japan
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:33,600	| IOT116 |	Do they have any of the robotics
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,880	| IOT116 |	I'm trying to think I do
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:40,000	| IOT116 |	It's the company is the French company that made pepper they have a big investment there
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:46,912	| IOT116 |	I so yes they have never going to put pepper heads on scary demon
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:49,472	| IOT116 |	I also bought
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:50,752	| IOT116 |	Is it shaft
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:57,920	| IOT116 |	Another robotics firm
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:27:01,760	| IOT116 |	Not a lot of news about shop it's like a secretive kind of
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,296	| IOT116 |	Incubator type
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:06,368	| IOT116 |	Project from jsk robotics Lab at University of Tokyo
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:07,648	| IOT116 |	Yeah
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:10,208	| IOT116 |	So that they might be willing
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:12,000	| IOT116 |	It's something even scarier so
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:17,632	| IOT116 |	They might be because I went to their website and it said that permission forbidden like I couldn't go to the Republic website today
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:18,144	| IOT116 |	Yeah boy
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:20,960	| IOT116 |	All right
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:27,360	| IOT116 |	So let's piece this all together cuz softbank's been doing some really interesting things in the iot space first off I think there's going to be like
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:28,896	| IOT116 |	100 million
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:30,944	| IOT116 |	Connected devices which goes beyond
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:32,480	| IOT116 |	Or a hundred billion I mean it's
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,528	| IOT116 |	That's baby
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:35,552	| IOT116 |	Everything's gonna be connect
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:37,344	| IOT116 |	Stopping speed
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:40,416	| IOT116 |	And what they've done is they've got a huge investment
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:40,928	| IOT116 |	An arm
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:43,488	| IOT116 |	Embedded chip firm
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,512	| IOT116 |	Chip design firm
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:47,072	| IOT116 |	Actually recently just made a
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:48,864	| IOT116 |	Acquisition of
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:49,376	| IOT116 |	A lot of stairs
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:55,008	| IOT116 |	An acquisition of a stake in a company called OSI soft which does Industrial Automation
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,032	| IOT116 |	Software
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:58,848	| IOT116 |	And when we start thinking about
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,152	| IOT116 |	Embedded Computing everywhere
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:02,688	| IOT116 |	Industrial Automation
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:03,712	| IOT116 |	And robots
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:05,760	| IOT116 |	What are we doing
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:06,784	| IOT116 |	It's the future
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:07,552	| IOT116 |	Yes
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:09,344	| IOT116 |	The SoftBank is basically
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,880	| IOT116 |	Say hey we're going to be connected
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,672	| IOT116 |	We're going to need
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:16,512	| IOT116 |	Software-based ways to mediate that and we're going to need robots doing
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,792	| IOT116 |	A lot of the tasks
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:21,120	| IOT116 |	Spent humans using and
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:22,144	| IOT116 |	Environments that
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,936	| IOT116 |	Are less friendly
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:28,032	| IOT116 |	And they can also chase us down and kill us
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:31,360	| IOT116 |	We could you end up in reality self
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:35,712	| IOT116 |	It's obviously a big Vision player when you put it all together
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:38,016	| IOT116 |	I'm so I guess it's not surprising
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:40,832	| IOT116 |	To see SoftBank purchase Boston Dynamics
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,112	| IOT116 |	Terms of the deal
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:43,648	| IOT116 |	Not available
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:48,256	| IOT116 |	Don't think Google ever said what they paid for Boston Dynamics I don't know if they're making money or losing money but
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:51,072	| IOT116 |	Again big picture yeah there
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:52,864	| IOT116 |	Southbank is positioning itself for
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,656	| IOT116 |	Industrial
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:56,960	| IOT116 |	World domination
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:58,752	| IOT116 |	Alright so
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:01,312	| IOT116 |	After that scary bit
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:02,848	| IOT116 |	Let's take a moment for a
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:05,920	| IOT116 |	Message from our sponsor and then we'll go into
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:08,992	| IOT116 |	A conversation that's going to make you feel good about the internet
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:12,064	| IOT116 |	We're going to have the CEO of Aqaba
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:13,344	| IOT116 |	Davida herzl
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:14,368	| IOT116 |	Talk about
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:19,232	| IOT116 |	How we can actually improve data collection for really granular Environmental
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:23,584	| IOT116 |	Yay we're going to do what's polluting
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,608	| IOT116 |	Stay tuned for all of that
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:32,800	| IOT116 |	Hey everyone we are taking a break in The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:35,360	| IOT116 |	Where is TE Connectivity and I have shed
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:38,688	| IOT116 |	Cragar a general manager at TE Connectivity
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:40,224	| IOT116 |	How about smart

EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:57,280	| IOT116 |	So how does TE Connectivity come into that interaction
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:31:00,864	| IOT116 |	Betsy conductivity were providing antennas
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:03,424	| IOT116 |	And sensors and connectors that are allowing
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:05,216	| IOT116 |	The communication
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:06,752	| IOT116 |	Between the device
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:10,592	| IOT116 |	And the digital assistant we are sensing the information
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:12,128	| IOT116 |	Inside the appliance
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:17,248	| IOT116 |	And through our connectors and antennas communicating that back to the digital assistant
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:20,320	| IOT116 |	I'm expecting a lot of really awesome
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:22,112	| IOT116 |	Connected features in my new appliances
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:23,392	| IOT116 |	But holy cow
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:25,952	| IOT116 |	Those are really tough environments
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:29,536	| IOT116 |	What kind of things is TE Connectivity doing to him
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:35,936	| IOT116 |	Prove reliability the risk of all these additional features and appliances there's more power in the appliances Mezmur
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:37,472	| IOT116 |	Power is in the appliance
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:38,496	| IOT116 |	The risk is
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:42,080	| IOT116 |	That there could be a failure and if there's a failure in Appliance
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:44,384	| IOT116 |	And many times can lead to
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:44,896	| IOT116 |	The fire
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:48,224	| IOT116 |	And that's of course something we are here to provide
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:49,760	| IOT116 |	And we're putting

EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:02,720	| IOT116 |	Because you guys are doing something near and dear to my heart
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:05,536	| IOT116 |	Constantly telling people about how to iot
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:07,328	| IOT116 |	Is really a way to
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:09,632	| IOT116 |	Get information at scale
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:10,912	| IOT116 |	Very little money
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:12,960	| IOT116 |	And then use it to do something
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:18,336	| IOT116 |	And you guys are doing that so you just announced this big project with Google do you want to tell us about that
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:20,128	| IOT116 |	So what we announced
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:26,528	| IOT116 |	Is that is the result of I work that we've been doing allihoopa we've instrumented Google Street View car
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:29,600	| IOT116 |	Cars with our environmental intelligence platform
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:31,648	| IOT116 |	To measure air quality and
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:32,416	| IOT116 |	Climate
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:34,464	| IOT116 |	Scale
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:35,488	| IOT116 |	And in our announcement
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:37,280	| IOT116 |	We launched the first map
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:39,328	| IOT116 |	From Oakland
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:43,424	| IOT116 |	Which we generated in in partnership with Google and the environment
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:47,264	| IOT116 |	And so what was the result
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:53,408	| IOT116 |	The study study generated one of the largest data sets on Urban Air Pollution ever assembled
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:54,944	| IOT116 |	And the results were
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:56,992	| IOT116 |	Resultz1
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:34:03,648	| IOT116 |	It demonstrates that our approach is highly scalable highly effective and cost-effective
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:05,440	| IOT116 |	To generate higher
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:06,208	| IOT116 |	Pollution
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:09,792	| IOT116 |	Maps of air quality and it also showed us that air quality
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:12,352	| IOT116 |	Is much more variable
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,888	| IOT116 |	Then anybody had ever expect
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:15,424	| IOT116 |	So you can have
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:16,704	| IOT116 |	Best air quality
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:19,264	| IOT116 |	And the worst air quality on the same block
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:21,312	| IOT116 |	And that's really important
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:25,152	| IOT116 |	For decision-makers you know whether it's urban planners
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:27,712	| IOT116 |	Or health insurers or
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:31,296	| IOT116 |	Citizens understand how they are affected
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:32,320	| IOT116 |	Air pollution
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:33,088	| IOT116 |	You really need
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:34,368	| IOT116 |	Highly granular
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:37,696	| IOT116 |	Highly localized information and
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:39,232	| IOT116 |	Proven that we can do it with
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:40,768	| IOT116 |	Are platform and with this
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:41,280	| IOT116 |	Methodology
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:44,864	| IOT116 |	Awesome so let's dig into some of the tech here just for fun
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:45,632	| IOT116 |	Just for funsies
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:50,752	| IOT116 |	You called at the environmental intelligence
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:53,568	| IOT116 |	So is that just a sensor is that
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:54,592	| IOT116 |	Cloud service what is it
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:35:00,224	| IOT116 |	Our environmental intelligence platform is a fully integrated from sensor
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:02,528	| IOT116 |	Backend 8A manager
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:05,088	| IOT116 |	Algorithm
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:06,880	| IOT116 |	That makes sense of the
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:07,904	| IOT116 |	Data coming off
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:10,464	| IOT116 |	Answers to the management system
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:11,232	| IOT116 |	Manage
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:12,512	| IOT116 |	All of the remotely

EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:18,400	| IOT116 |	So it's a fully integrated end-to-end stocking
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:19,680	| IOT116 |	Threesome
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:24,288	| IOT116 |	Selena great it is that we really see this as a massive signal processing Challenge and
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,056	| IOT116 |	We're trying to do
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:26,592	| IOT116 |	Capture signal
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:28,384	| IOT116 |	Songs about within the environment
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,152	| IOT116 |	And turn it into
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:30,176	| IOT116 |	Information that we
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:32,224	| IOT116 |	And that platform
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:34,016	| IOT116 |	Deployed
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:35,040	| IOT116 |	And multiple settings
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:37,600	| IOT116 |	Take me to Coit indoors in buildings
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:39,136	| IOT116 |	It can be deployed Outdoors
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:41,184	| IOT116 |	I'm stationary settings
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:43,488	| IOT116 |	The tops of buildings
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:46,560	| IOT116 |	And it can also be deployed on moving vehicles
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:47,584	| IOT116 |	And be able to
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:48,096	| IOT116 |	Degenerate
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:49,376	| IOT116 |	Insights from
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:52,192	| IOT116 |	Spencer's at highly granular
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:55,008	| IOT116 |	I'm resolution that haven't been possible before
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:36:00,128	| IOT116 |	Okay and in this case how are the sensors communicating the data back to the
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:02,944	| IOT116 |	The sensors are commute
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,712	| IOT116 |	Indicating
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:04,992	| IOT116 |	True Cellular Connection
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:10,112	| IOT116 |	And they're communicating in real-time so they're sending up data once every second
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:10,880	| IOT116 |	And they're also
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:11,904	| IOT116 |	Communicating
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:14,208	| IOT116 |	Location in a lot of other metadata
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:15,232	| IOT116 |	It's really important
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:16,512	| IOT116 |	For managing the networks
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:18,560	| IOT116 |	When they're deployed in the field but also
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:21,376	| IOT116 |	Making sense of the data after it's been
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:21,888	| IOT116 |	Collective
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:24,192	| IOT116 |	Okay and I saw some of this
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:24,960	| IOT116 |	Estate I mean
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:30,336	| IOT116 |	How much data are we talking about in I don't know
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:32,640	| IOT116 |	Sure so we all at once
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:35,456	| IOT116 |	Per second and weekly cover this particular study
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:37,248	| IOT116 |	We collected data
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:39,040	| IOT116 |	From May 2015 to May 26
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:46,208	| IOT116 |	We collected 2.7 million data points over 14,000 miles and 100
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:52,608	| IOT116 |	50 days of driving and this is this is one of the largest if not the largest data sets on Urban Air Pollution
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:53,632	| IOT116 |	Ever ever assembled
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,168	| IOT116 |	Wow okay
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:57,984	| IOT116 |	So that's a lot of data to take
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:37:00,544	| IOT116 |	A lot of companies are dealing with this right now is there
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:02,592	| IOT116 |	Thinking about iot
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:04,384	| IOT116 |	Do you have advice for them on
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:05,920	| IOT116 |	Taking in that kind of data
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:07,712	| IOT116 |	In turning it into something that
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:08,736	| IOT116 |	Actually useful
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:11,040	| IOT116 |	For policymakers or people who are not date
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:13,088	| IOT116 |	How do you do that at school
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:17,184	| IOT116 |	For users right I mean I think I think so much of the focus on
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:18,464	| IOT116 |	IRT is either you know
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:20,256	| IOT116 |	Either talking about the janitor
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:24,352	| IOT116 |	The value of the data but there's a lot of work that has to be done
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:25,888	| IOT116 |	Translate that data is
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:27,680	| IOT116 |	Into information that people can
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:28,704	| IOT116 |	Use end
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:33,824	| IOT116 |	One of the things that that we've been doing and then there's admittedly I think an iot there's a chicken and egg
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:35,360	| IOT116 |	Challenge right
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:36,640	| IOT116 |	Because you have to
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:37,920	| IOT116 |	Collect the data
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:40,224	| IOT116 |	To understand what value is in it
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:44,832	| IOT116 |	And then you have to understand what value is in the data to understand how to optimize your data collection
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:47,904	| IOT116 |	We're doing here in Oakland
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:49,440	| IOT116 |	Is that we over stamp
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,464	| IOT116 |	That mean we just
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:52,256	| IOT116 |	The quantities of Jade are so huge
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:54,560	| IOT116 |	Because what we were really trying to do was
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:56,352	| IOT116 |	Learn learn where is the valley
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:59,936	| IOT116 |	The data how do we turn it into those information product
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:06,336	| IOT116 |	That people can use and we've been very intentional over the course of the last year we made a commitment in 2015 with Google to
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:08,640	| IOT116 |	Map communities across California
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:14,272	| IOT116 |	And what we've been doing is really using that as an opportunity to explore applications of the data and so
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:15,808	| IOT116 |	You have to creep
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:20,416	| IOT116 |	Room for this kind of iteration cycle but you have to be very intentional about
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:26,816	| IOT116 |	About the fact that there is there is a need to collect data to surface the data into then talk to users about ways the
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:27,584	| IOT116 |	They need
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:29,888	| IOT116 |	That data represented and so we've been talking
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:31,680	| IOT116 |	Two users in the urban planning space
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:34,496	| IOT116 |	Space space really under
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:36,800	| IOT116 |	Understand the ways in which that data needs to be reduced
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:41,408	| IOT116 |	An analyzed to deliver really useful information
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:41,920	| IOT116 |	How do you
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:44,480	| IOT116 |	Take the massive amounts of data that you
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:44,992	| IOT116 |	You have
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:48,320	| IOT116 |	And go to the process of making that useful to each differ
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:53,440	| IOT116 |	Do bring people in from that Community do you guys employee all those folks.
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:39:00,096	| IOT116 |	Have a magical machine learning box
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:00,864	| IOT116 |	We have a highly
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:02,912	| IOT116 |	MN
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:05,984	| IOT116 |	And what we've done is yes on our team we have domain expert
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:07,520	| IOT116 |	Who are
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:12,384	| IOT116 |	Looking at the data and using our tools to look at it through the lens of users
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:17,760	| IOT116 |	In the communities that they represent so whether it's a scientific Community or for example
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:19,296	| IOT116 |	In the built environment
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:20,064	| IOT116 |	We have
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:21,600	| IOT116 |	Former director of research
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:22,624	| IOT116 |	The US Green Building
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:26,208	| IOT116 |	It is about bringing those Jame next
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:28,256	| IOT116 |	In those areas of application
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:30,560	| IOT116 |	Reprioritize
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:32,864	| IOT116 |	And then having those
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:33,632	| IOT116 |	Domain expert
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:34,912	| IOT116 |	Directly engage
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:36,960	| IOT116 |	The Industries or User Group
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:40,032	| IOT116 |	That we're selling our services into to refine
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:42,080	| IOT116 |	Rrd2 products
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:44,896	| IOT116 |	And then work working very closely with our product team
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:48,224	| IOT116 |	Visualization and an interface
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:48,992	| IOT116 |	Team
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:50,272	| IOT116 |	Ensure that
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:51,808	| IOT116 |	We are creating data products
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:54,112	| IOT116 |	Serve the needs of those user groups
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:55,136	| IOT116 |	Operating
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:39:58,720	| IOT116 |	New territory right this is the key challenge around
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:00,000	| IOT116 |	Turning
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:02,816	| IOT116 |	Industrial or enterprise-scale iot data in
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:04,608	| IOT116 |	She's really meaningful
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:06,656	| IOT116 |	Invaluable information
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:08,192	| IOT116 |	I agree
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:12,800	| IOT116 |	So then the question is how do you charge for that do you charge based on insights and if so
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:15,104	| IOT116 |	What is that mean or do you just charge
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:16,640	| IOT116 |	Buy data iPad a pipe
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:20,736	| IOT116 |	We have a number of different application areas been in the building space for example
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:22,016	| IOT116 |	We saw environmental ontology
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:23,040	| IOT116 |	As a service
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:24,832	| IOT116 |	So these are managed
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:25,856	| IOT116 |	Sensor Networks
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:27,136	| IOT116 |	And there are
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:28,672	| IOT116 |	Subscription fee is
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:32,768	| IOT116 |	And for management of that network but subscription fees to the date of product
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:35,584	| IOT116 |	Intelligence that the Analytics
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:36,352	| IOT116 |	Provide
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:37,376	| IOT116 |	From the Sun
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:38,400	| IOT116 |	Your data and
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:39,936	| IOT116 |	The sensor data alone
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:41,728	| IOT116 |	Does not solve problem
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:46,080	| IOT116 |	For users in the in the built environment it's really important
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:49,408	| IOT116 |	That we that we translated into those meaningful data products and
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:50,944	| IOT116 |	And we saw them as a service
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:58,112	| IOT116 |	Let's talk about this cuz you got in this Oakland example there was some really interesting findings and I'd like to dig into some of these
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:58,880	| IOT116 |	Is because
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:02,720	| IOT116 |	There's one about it and I don't remember the street but there's one area where
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:05,024	| IOT116 |	You noticed that there was huge pollution
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:09,888	| IOT116 |	Brightest people were entering onto the Bay Bridge and I guess the theory was his people accelerate to
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:12,704	| IOT116 |	I guess get past the light and get on the bridge they just
EDL	00:41:13,216	00:41:14,496	| IOT116 |	It's been a lot of pollution
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:16,544	| IOT116 |	That kind of thing seems
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:19,616	| IOT116 |	Really interesting but it also seems
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:21,152	| IOT116 |	Really threatening
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:22,944	| IOT116 |	To maybe
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:29,600	| IOT116 |	Someone who owns an apartment that's right at that address and so would I look at how granular this data is
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:31,648	| IOT116 |	I'm reminded of
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:37,536	| IOT116 |	Talk to somebody in Singapore cuz they it outfitted an area of the city with noise pollution sensors in
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:40,096	| IOT116 |	They got a lot of complaints from people who owned
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:43,680	| IOT116 |	Apartments around places where the noise was Dean tires
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:45,728	| IOT116 |	Because it was affecting the real estate values
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:51,616	| IOT116 |	And so I feel like we're entering this Brave New connected world where information is just so available
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:53,663	| IOT116 |	How are you seeing people react
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:54,687	| IOT116 |	This sort of
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:56,479	| IOT116 |	The availability of this
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:59,807	| IOT116 |	Overall it has been
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:02,111	| IOT116 |	Very positive and there's demand for more
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:05,439	| IOT116 |	Right because I think in this case the data that we
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:06,719	| IOT116 |	We collected directly relevant
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:07,999	| IOT116 |	Demon House
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:09,279	| IOT116 |	Enter people's house
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:11,839	| IOT116 |	And the challenge I mean it in many ways
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:12,607	| IOT116 |	No it's
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:16,703	| IOT116 |	Equivalent to Revolution that we've seen in
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:20,287	| IOT116 |	Genomic sequencing and the availability of data about your
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:20,799	| IOT116 |	DNA
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:22,847	| IOT116 |	Right it's empowering
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:25,151	| IOT116 |	Empowering
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:26,431	| IOT116 |	Choices
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,455	| IOT116 |	Empowering
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:30,271	| IOT116 |	More intelligent delivery of healthcare
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:35,903	| IOT116 |	And so we think that there's an equivalent opportunity when it comes to environmental health
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:37,439	| IOT116 |	You know when we talk about things like climate
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:40,255	| IOT116 |	These are really abstract Concepts
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:41,535	| IOT116 |	But when you
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:44,607	| IOT116 |	They look at the same emissions are changing our climate
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:46,655	| IOT116 |	At the type of local scale if he
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:47,935	| IOT116 |	Becomes really relevant at
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:48,703	| IOT116 |	The human
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:50,239	| IOT116 |	The human health lens
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:51,775	| IOT116 |	And that's information
EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:52,287	| IOT116 |	People want
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:54,079	| IOT116 |	People need and
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:55,359	| IOT116 |	You know if I have a child
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:56,639	| IOT116 |	Asthma or
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:59,455	| IOT116 |	Or if I'm an insurer that you know that is seeing
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:01,503	| IOT116 |	Section of my population that's being
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:05,599	| IOT116 |	For example a respiratory disease or
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:07,647	| IOT116 |	Or other forms of diseases are connect
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:12,511	| IOT116 |	I want to be able to take care of my members to take care of
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:13,279	| IOT116 |	My child
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:14,815	| IOT116 |	I'm in incorporate that in
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:19,423	| IOT116 |	Information into decision-making so I think there's a. Of during which we have to come to
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:22,751	| IOT116 |	Terms with this availability availability of this kind of information
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:26,335	| IOT116 |	But I think it's up to us collectively to ensure that we're serving
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:27,871	| IOT116 |	Public good
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:31,711	| IOT116 |	What are the things I feel like we don't do enough of in The Internet of Things
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:32,479	| IOT116 |	Community is
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:35,551	| IOT116 |	Making sure the data that we're generating is actually
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:41,439	| IOT116 |	Useful valid and tested so this could be anything from wearables and making sure they're actually
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:42,719	| IOT116 |	Getting the right information
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:45,023	| IOT116 |	All the way to something like environmental data Sol
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:49,887	| IOT116 |	How do you make sure it's it's peer-review that it's high-quality that so people can
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:50,399	| IOT116 |	Can actually trust it
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:52,703	| IOT116 |	Thank you that's it that's a really
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:53,215	| IOT116 |	Important
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:54,751	| IOT116 |	Conversation
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:55,263	| IOT116 |	Because I think
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:57,823	| IOT116 |	All of this new data
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:02,431	| IOT116 |	Informing decision and in the case of environmental data
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:05,503	| IOT116 |	Urban planning
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:06,015	| IOT116 |	Policy
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:07,551	| IOT116 |	Care delivery
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:09,599	| IOT116 |	Consumer choices and
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:11,135	| IOT116 |	What's really important
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:13,439	| IOT116 |	That we deliver quality data and so
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:16,511	| IOT116 |	The fresh one of the ways we've been doing that is through a number partner
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:18,047	| IOT116 |	What's the scientific name
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:19,327	| IOT116 |	Immunity to validate
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:21,375	| IOT116 |	The ways that
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:26,239	| IOT116 |	Comparing our sensors
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:28,799	| IOT116 |	Hybrid laboratory equipment
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:35,199	| IOT116 |	Getting our methods validated and doing this with organizations like the EPA like Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:40,575	| IOT116 |	The case of the Oakland study with the environmental defense fund and the University of Texas and
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:42,623	| IOT116 |	It took us a long time
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:45,439	| IOT116 |	We were collecting data in Oakland for year
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:46,463	| IOT116 |	Getting it
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:47,231	| IOT116 |	Right
EDL	00:44:47,231	00:44:48,255	| IOT116 |	Is really important
EDL	00:44:48,255	00:44:49,791	| IOT116 |	Ensuring that were
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:51,839	| IOT116 |	Or creative people can rely on and
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:55,423	| IOT116 |	And delivering on our mission of really using the iot for good
EDL	00:44:55,935	00:45:00,287	| IOT116 |	So I looked at the state and I'm like I can see government officials being interested in
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:02,591	| IOT116 |	But I could also see something like
EDL	00:45:03,103	00:45:05,407	| IOT116 |	A community organization like
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:10,271	| IOT116 |	Do you know what PTA to school I would love to be able to drill down to my school's level NC
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:12,319	| IOT116 |	A community may not make that available
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:13,599	| IOT116 |	So
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:15,647	| IOT116 |	Are you thinking of ways to make
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:22,303	| IOT116 |	Actionable insights available to people beyond the folks that will actively by the platform
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:25,631	| IOT116 |	Yes and that's one of the most exciting aspects of gar
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:27,935	| IOT116 |	Partnership with Google
EDL	00:45:27,935	00:45:28,959	| IOT116 |	Is that
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:29,727	| IOT116 |	There's a real life
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:32,287	| IOT116 |	Kennedy to you imagine
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:33,055	| IOT116 |	In a day
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:35,359	| IOT116 |	Where this is as available as traffic
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:39,711	| IOT116 |	And where this is as available as you have Street data is on
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:41,759	| IOT116 |	Google Maps application
EDL	00:45:41,759	00:45:42,527	| IOT116 |	Today
EDL	00:45:42,527	00:45:43,807	| IOT116 |	And so I think
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:45,087	| IOT116 |	You know there is such absolute
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:47,647	| IOT116 |	One of the things that we're exploring
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:48,927	| IOT116 |	And part of
EDL	00:45:48,927	00:45:51,487	| IOT116 |	You know what we'd love to accomplish together
EDL	00:45:52,767	00:45:53,535	| IOT116 |	That's awesome
EDL	00:45:53,535	00:45:58,911	| IOT116 |	And it kind of brings up this idea that when you have the sensors you really can put them
EDL	00:45:58,911	00:46:00,703	| IOT116 |	On a lot of different places
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:01,471	| IOT116 |	So
EDL	00:46:01,471	00:46:04,287	| IOT116 |	Where do you think the ideal places for this kind of data capture
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:07,359	| IOT116 |	We talked about header
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:08,383	| IOT116 |	Genius Network
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:09,919	| IOT116 |	Brookstone networks that
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:12,479	| IOT116 |	That combine data from sensors
EDL	00:46:12,479	00:46:14,015	| IOT116 |	Floyd in a lot of location
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:14,783	| IOT116 |	So
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:16,831	| IOT116 |	And we we deploy our sensor
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:17,599	| IOT116 |	I'm building
EDL	00:46:17,599	00:46:18,367	| IOT116 |	Today
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:20,415	| IOT116 |	Some of the largest air quality
EDL	00:46:20,415	00:46:21,951	| IOT116 |	About the largest air quality sensor
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:24,255	| IOT116 |	Turn networks to play today inside a building
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:25,535	| IOT116 |	And then we also.
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:26,047	| IOT116 |	Deploy them
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:27,839	| IOT116 |	Tops of buildings
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:29,119	| IOT116 |	We can play them on light post
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:30,911	| IOT116 |	Stationary
EDL	00:46:30,911	00:46:36,543	| IOT116 |	That gives you a view of the environment overtime right and so we can get a really good temporal
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:39,103	| IOT116 |	Air quality or climate emission
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:40,895	| IOT116 |	But by putting them on vehicle
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:42,943	| IOT116 |	And what's really exciting about
EDL	00:46:43,455	00:46:43,967	| IOT116 |	Trends
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:45,247	| IOT116 |	Vehicles
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:46,783	| IOT116 |	Mobility
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:48,319	| IOT116 |	Is that vehicles
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:51,391	| IOT116 |	Become a network since olives and that gives us
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:52,159	| IOT116 |	Facebook
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:54,207	| IOT116 |	Suddenly we can cover an entire
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:54,975	| IOT116 |	City
EDL	00:46:54,975	00:46:55,999	| IOT116 |	And do it at a
EDL	00:46:55,999	00:46:56,767	| IOT116 |	Speed
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:46:57,535	| IOT116 |	And scale
EDL	00:46:57,535	00:46:58,559	| IOT116 |	It would be very difficult
EDL	00:46:59,327	00:47:01,375	| IOT116 |	Stationary networks and what are
EDL	00:47:01,375	00:47:03,167	| IOT116 |	The Oakland study shows
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:04,447	| IOT116 |	Is that
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:08,543	| IOT116 |	You need that kind of coverage because pollution is hypervariable
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:10,335	| IOT116 |	Hyperlocal
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:11,615	| IOT116 |	And so
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:12,895	| IOT116 |	If you're limited
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:13,663	| IOT116 |	2
EDL	00:47:13,663	00:47:14,687	| IOT116 |	Stationery sets
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:15,455	| IOT116 |	Pictures you're not going to
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:20,319	| IOT116 |	Have data but you need to understand pollution and emission
EDL	00:47:21,343	00:47:22,879	| IOT116 |	I'm sure it's also a little bit
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:23,391	| IOT116 |	Temporal
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:26,975	| IOT116 |	I imagine pollution
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:28,767	| IOT116 |	Winter in the middle of
EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:29,279	| IOT116 |	Yeah
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:30,559	| IOT116 |	Yes
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:31,583	| IOT116 |	Exactly
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:37,983	| IOT116 |	Yeah and so what we've done is in a really developed a methodology to be able to create a representative
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:38,751	| IOT116 |	Snapshot
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:40,543	| IOT116 |	That shows us where the hot spots are
EDL	00:47:41,055	00:47:47,199	| IOT116 |	So just a few weeks ago Brian krzanich the CEO of Intel actually was talking about self-driving vehicles and
EDL	00:47:47,711	00:47:48,991	| IOT116 |	Using them for things like
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:51,807	| IOT116 |	Putting surveillance cameras on them this feels
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:53,343	| IOT116 |	Very much in line with
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:55,903	| IOT116 |	Are you looking at expanding the app
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:57,439	| IOT116 |	Platform Beyond Maybe
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:58,207	| IOT116 |	Air quality sensor
EDL	00:47:58,719	00:48:00,255	| IOT116 |	Yes what we care about
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:06,143	| IOT116 |	Is understanding the health of our environment and there's ways to to do that not just
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:07,423	| IOT116 |	Direct measure
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:10,495	| IOT116 |	Air quality sensor
EDL	00:48:10,495	00:48:11,263	| IOT116 |	But there is
EDL	00:48:11,263	00:48:12,543	| IOT116 |	Many other sensors that can
EDL	00:48:12,543	00:48:14,079	| IOT116 |	Can be integrated into our platform
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:16,639	| IOT116 |	The capture this kind of information
EDL	00:48:16,639	00:48:18,431	| IOT116 |	And we're really you know again tonight
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:18,943	| IOT116 |	Think that the
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:20,223	| IOT116 |	Trend
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:20,991	| IOT116 |	Self-driving
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:22,271	| IOT116 |	Cars and
EDL	00:48:22,271	00:48:24,831	| IOT116 |	The mobility shift that were staying in Mobility
EDL	00:48:24,831	00:48:25,855	| IOT116 |	Offers up a notch
EDL	00:48:25,855	00:48:26,367	| IOT116 |	Opportunity
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:32,511	| IOT116 |	New capabilities Beyond just seeing what they're using today whether it's lidar other forms
EDL	00:48:32,511	00:48:33,535	| IOT116 |	Cameras
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:34,559	| IOT116 |	Visual senses
EDL	00:48:34,559	00:48:36,351	| IOT116 |	All these other capabilities
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:38,399	| IOT116 |	Scale
EDL	00:48:38,399	00:48:38,911	| IOT116 |	Distribution
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:42,495	| IOT116 |	Vehicles would be tremendously valuable for
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:44,031	| IOT116 |	Companies for
EDL	00:48:44,031	00:48:45,567	| IOT116 |	For policy-makers are
EDL	00:48:45,567	00:48:48,127	| IOT116 |	Planners and I'm really excited about
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:49,151	| IOT116 |	Boring
EDL	00:48:49,663	00:48:50,687	| IOT116 |	Those kind of application
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:55,039	| IOT116 |	Got it so the car isn't just going to be a computer it's going to be a big sensor
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:57,599	| IOT116 |	That's right a big sensor that can
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:48:58,879	| IOT116 |	Free all these others
EDL	00:48:58,879	00:49:02,463	| IOT116 |	Sitel benefit beyond the permeability play
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:05,023	| IOT116 |	Awesome so if you had one thing you could wish for
EDL	00:49:05,535	00:49:08,095	| IOT116 |	One maybe technology maybe it's a business a I don't know
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:11,167	| IOT116 |	What would it be what are we lacking today
EDL	00:49:11,167	00:49:13,983	| IOT116 |	That you would love to see us implement or
EDL	00:49:13,983	00:49:16,799	| IOT116 |	That you would love to buy off the shelf
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:18,335	| IOT116 |	I think
EDL	00:49:18,335	00:49:18,847	| IOT116 |	Power store
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:21,407	| IOT116 |	Is that are pink one of the
EDL	00:49:21,407	00:49:23,711	| IOT116 |	You know we've been we started at 9 corporate
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:24,223	| IOT116 |	Mm
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:26,015	| IOT116 |	And back then
EDL	00:49:26,015	00:49:26,783	| IOT116 |	Cloud computing
EDL	00:49:28,319	00:49:29,599	| IOT116 |	So now that clock
EDL	00:49:29,599	00:49:30,111	| IOT116 |	Computing is
EDL	00:49:30,623	00:49:31,647	| IOT116 |	Probably available
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:34,207	| IOT116 |	Diffusion a player and so we should have been living through over
EDL	00:49:35,231	00:49:36,255	| IOT116 |	Several years
EDL	00:49:36,255	00:49:39,583	| IOT116 |	All of these enabling Technologies coming into into being and
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:40,351	| IOT116 |	Turing
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:42,911	| IOT116 |	And one of the one of the big ones for us
EDL	00:49:42,911	00:49:45,471	| IOT116 |	Is just is really excited about is
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:46,751	| IOT116 |	It's the work that's been happening in
EDL	00:49:47,263	00:49:48,799	| IOT116 |	And being able to power these
EDL	00:49:49,823	00:49:50,847	| IOT116 |	In a way that
EDL	00:49:50,847	00:49:52,895	| IOT116 |	That is doesn't require intervention
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:55,455	| IOT116 |	Got it okay well
EDL	00:49:55,455	00:49:58,015	| IOT116 |	DaVita thank you so much for coming on the show that
EDL	00:49:58,783	00:50:04,159	| IOT116 |	No thank you for having me really really excited to continue the conversation in the Itt
EDL	00:50:04,159	00:50:04,671	| IOT116 |	Community I think
EDL	00:50:05,183	00:50:11,583	| IOT116 |	Great stuff is coming and we're glad to be a part of the community
EDL	00:50:11,583	00:50:17,983	| IOT116 |	For this week show thank you so much for listening and if you want more iot news you can sign up for my news
EDL	00:50:17,983	00:50:24,127	| IOT116 |	Just let her stay see those things at Stacey on iot. Cam will see you next week
