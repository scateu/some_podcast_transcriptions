EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:49,056	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	He sent me to a gas station

EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:03,136	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And the red and blue Chevron logo on the side

EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:17,984	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Was Chevron
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:19,008	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And for some reason

EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:23,104	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	This gas station is a modern Chevron station in every way

EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,544	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	That phrase bona fide intent
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:54,592	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Means that you want to keep a trademark
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,360	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	You have to use it
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,408	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	In this particular case
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,456	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	When General oil was busted at
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:02,016	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Standard Oil trademark
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,808	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Still retain a lot of
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:05,088	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Goodwill in value
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:09,952	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And if for whatever reason down the line Chevron wants to take advantage of that value
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:10,976	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The name standard
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,000	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Has to be used
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:15,840	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And I have to be used in connection with whatever the underlying
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:17,632	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Goods or services are so
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,656	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	They couldn't dress
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,168	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Prince
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,448	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Templates
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:26,592	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Occasionally used mix Chevron standard branding and say that they were still using it for oil and gas
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:31,200	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Matthew prominently use the standard name in conjunction with oil and gas services
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,224	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	If they want to keep
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:34,784	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So that's why there's a standard gas station
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:38,112	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	All intents and purposes operates as a Chevron station
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:41,696	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	In San Francisco and 15 other locations in the US
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:44,768	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	This week
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:46,048	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	You should do a story
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:51,680	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	We're researching and presenting short design stories requested by our listeners and seen where that path takes
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:54,240	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And in the spirit of the exercise
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:59,360	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	We're starting with what I think is the most requested design topic of all time
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:01,664	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Here's our digital director Kurt Kolstad
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,176	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	I thought you with me
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:03,456	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	About
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,224	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Desire path
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:10,880	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	As the name suggests desire paths are these unplanned routes people just really want to take
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,928	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And their sheep by repeated use
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:16,000	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And I think part of it is that they're found
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,791	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Everywhere you can just see them all over the place
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,607	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And the most common type of UC
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,119	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Are short
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:23,679	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Which are often just visible as
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:26,239	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Ruffner Trails through you know grassy areas
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,007	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Is insidious
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:29,823	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The most commonly when you think of Desire path you think I would like
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:30,847	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Imagine like
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:34,687	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	A circuitous or maybe like a 90-degree turn on a sidewalk
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,991	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And then there's this like 45 degree
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,271	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Dirt path
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,295	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	That cuts across
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:41,343	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And create a shortcut and that's
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:43,647	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The most common idea what it's Sour Patch
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:45,439	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	This is people want to take the shortest path but
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,975	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Desert pets are not always
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,559	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Back sometimes they end up being a long cut
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:54,399	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And this can happen for all kinds of reasons in some places
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:57,471	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	There superstitions about walking under utility pools
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:01,567	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And some people end up taking his long way around and you can see that box in the dirt
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:04,127	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Or like when there's like
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:09,247	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	A slope going down to a to a crossover underneath the road
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:12,831	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And normally in a biker with bike down that hill and then bike back up the other side
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:16,671	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	But often there's like a way to just you know take the grass
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,207	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And go off to the side
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,999	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Indians of being a longer path
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:22,303	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	But I want to go up and down hill
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:24,607	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So it's like a shortcut in the center
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:31,263	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Energy it'll still take them less work ultimately but it also is just kind of weird because it blows out to
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:33,055	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Besides
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:39,967	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So this can be really frustrating as an urban planner because a lot of reason
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:45,343	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	You designed things the way you do is that use the built environment to shape the behavior you want
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:46,623	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	But
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:48,927	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Deserve us can also be eliminating because
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:53,535	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	They can really show a designer how to make their design work better for people
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:59,423	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Right sometimes they frustrate the plans of urban planners in trailmakers but other times these people can actually
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,703	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Evaluate
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:03,263	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The behaviors that people have naturally
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:06,079	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And use that to inform their designs
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:08,383	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So for example college campuses have been known
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:11,711	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	To map out a basic grid of sidewalks
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:18,111	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	But then leave some sidewalks unpaved and just sort of see where people walk to fill in the gaps and then they
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,647	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	They come back in and they pee fat
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:22,463	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Based on the natural behavior of those people walking
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:24,511	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And in Finland
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:27,071	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Park Winters have been known to
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:31,679	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Watch and see where people walk after a big snowfall so there should be a blank slate
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:33,727	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And people cross the park
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:38,847	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And they just trace the pause then use that to inform a year-round pathway for that
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:42,687	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Which I see reminds me of my favorite form of
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,223	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Snow base
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:45,503	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Desire path the snake down
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,063	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Which is a portmanteau
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:52,671	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Snowy and neck. Which is kind of hard to picture it's like a
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,463	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Part of the car but you can imagine like a straight
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:55,743	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Street
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:58,815	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And then like a little bit of a bump out of the curb in extension of the
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,095	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Drug is called a neck down
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,911	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So how did the people use a snake down
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:07,263	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So like those finished Park planners that are evaluating
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,799	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Where people walk after snow falls
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:10,847	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Urban planners can use
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:14,431	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Smackdown to evaluate workers drive after a snowfall
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:16,991	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And more specifically they can look at where they don't
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:19,551	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So when the fresh snow
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:21,855	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Covers the road drivers in the following there or pass
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:26,719	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And then other cars follow in that narrow path which leads a lot of area actually untouched
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:32,095	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And this results in what is effectively like a temporary curb extension
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:35,167	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And can also form for the traffic islands in the middle of streets
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,703	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Where cars just don't go
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:41,567	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	But didn't did they ever take this information and like use it for other parts the year when it isn't snowing
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:43,871	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	That's really the key is
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:46,687	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Erlanger's can evaluate where people don't go
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,735	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And use that information
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:53,087	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Advocate for curb extensions and traffic islands where they don't it currently exist
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:56,159	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And the argue is pretty straightforward I mean if the cars
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:58,207	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Don't need to go there in the winter
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:00,767	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Why do they need to go there at all right
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:04,095	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	PetSmart I like it it because you look a little
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:06,911	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Sandbox to plan once the snow falls and all the sudden
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:11,775	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	You realize that you can have this opportunity to replaying your city and these two little tiny waist
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:14,335	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Oh wow this analysis is really kind of lovely it's
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:19,967	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Like people go out and they take pictures living videos and then they trace over these places where the cars don't go and suddenly
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,015	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	It was very clear the cars
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,783	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Actually need that
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,087	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	1 reasons why desire paths
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,391	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Since I found her soap that resonates so much with
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,183	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Awnings and not because they're urban planners
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:33,535	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	It's because there's this great metaphor for design in general
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:35,839	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Yes and a lot of people use them
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:38,655	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And usability design and think about them
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,167	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	In terms of
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,959	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Interface design
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,727	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:43,775	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	A really common tactic is to not just
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:47,615	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	You decide we're going to make this thing this way and people going to use it this way
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:51,711	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	But instead to actually look at how people are already using something
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:54,271	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And then take that and get it a more official way to work
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:58,111	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The word example on Twitter you know apps and hashtags
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:00,415	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Who's built in with Twitter
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,951	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Users of all those
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:02,463	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Overtime
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:05,023	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And then put her images that o
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:09,375	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Well if user using them we're going to support this usage and you know evolve
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,935	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	I never really thought about that at Saint
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:15,007	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Hashtags for basically desire path created by the user
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:15,775	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Digital desire
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:21,151	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	You want to take a deeper dive into the hash mark
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,687	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Four octave work is a
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,455	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	For the calling
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:26,015	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Average of Mendenhall episode about its Origins
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,551	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Turn your hymnals
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:29,599	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	New episode number 145 you will fight
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:38,047	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Ministry suggestions we get come through Twitter someone
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:38,815	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Twitter login
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:41,375	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And we'd a lot from emails to but this suggestion
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:43,167	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Came to senior producer Katie Mingle
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,959	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	In person
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:50,847	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Yeah so this was after our recent live show that we did in La a fan came up to me
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,151	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And he was like nice job
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:56,479	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Also I've story idea for you
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:10:02,879	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Ugly it on me and he start telling me about it and it was like about electrical current clock
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:05,183	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	What's the time in Southern California win
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:10,047	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Switch I I don't know I didn't absorb that much of it at the time
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:16,959	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	What did you tell me it did kind of sound like a bar alley so I went back I started looking into it and
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:18,495	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Basically the story starts back
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,287	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	In the late 1800s
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:25,407	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The Los Angeles area and through surrounding the other towns in Southern California
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:27,455	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	We're starting to get there first
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:30,527	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Power plants in the main motivation at the time
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:33,599	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Listen to bring Refrigeration to the Citrus Growers
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:34,623	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So they can play
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:35,647	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Oranges inside
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,183	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Refrigerators
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,719	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Exactly for cold Orange
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:39,999	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Of course
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,791	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And so back in these early days
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:46,399	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	List of electricity there wasn't a national standard for like what frequency of
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:48,959	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Current these power plants should deliver us
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:49,983	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	What is an Alexa
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,287	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Really mean and then what are the option
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,311	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Do you have to work
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:54,591	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	I'm still at school
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:59,455	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Now the part of the show her I explain electricity
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:04,063	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	No I don't want to actually do the complete the service of
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:07,391	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Talking too much about the physics of electricity but
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:14,559	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The way I understand it is at electricity basically comes into our homes in waves of alternating current
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,119	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And you can actually think of them like pulses
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,655	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And the number of
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:21,215	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Pulses per second is the frequency of the current
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:25,311	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So if you're on a 50 Cycle System or like a 50 hertz
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:26,591	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	System
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:31,199	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The pulses are coming at 52nd and then 60 hertz would be
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:31,711	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	60 second
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:35,295	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	I'm 50 and 60 are sort of the two most
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,063	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Common
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:36,831	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Frequencies
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,111	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And why would you use one like
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:47,583	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	They're both fine they both do all the things we need them to do and you can deliver current at lots of different
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,607	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Frequencies
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:51,935	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	But if you slow it down enough likes a 2:30 Hertz
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:54,751	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	When you screw in a lightbulb
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,287	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	You apparently
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:58,591	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Can actually perceive a sort of
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,127	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Stop pulsing in it
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,919	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Service perceived as like a flicker
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:02,687	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Inverter
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,199	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	In the light bulb
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:09,343	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So in the early 1900s Southern California so Lake Los Angeles Burbank Pasadena
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:12,159	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	They all start from getting on the 650 Hertz
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:12,927	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	System
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:16,767	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And meanwhile the rest of the country is getting on a 60 hertz
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:18,559	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	For the most part and there's like
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,327	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Some exceptions
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:22,911	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Right in civil right now that's not that big a deal in the early 90s
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:25,727	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	But eventually this greatest. Going to all meet up
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:26,751	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Would not be
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:35,199	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Right I'm so it starts to become a problem and one of the things that becomes a problem is like manufacturer
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:39,039	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Had to make different products for people in Southern California
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:45,951	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Because anything with like an electrical motor that was designed to work on a 60 Cycle System is not going
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,719	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	To work as well
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:48,511	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	50 Cycles
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,279	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	System
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:53,631	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And one of the things that definitely didn't work as well was Electra
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,143	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Clocks
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:13:01,055	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So if you had a clock that you got a New York City and then you moved to LA and you plug in your clock
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,871	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	It would actually lose 10 minutes
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,383	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Every hour
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:06,175	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,711	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And that is because
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:08,991	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Electric clock
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:10,527	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Actually use those
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,807	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Pulses of current
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:14,367	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Keep track of the time you know some clocks
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,647	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Have pendulums but
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,927	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Keeping track of those
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:19,231	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Pulses of current is it is the way that electric
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,255	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Clocks know what
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,279	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Time it is
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:22,303	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Or when to move
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:26,911	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And at that point electric clocks were really popular like a lot of
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,679	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	People have them they're not
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,215	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Common anymore
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:31,775	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	3:00 swear problem other things with motors
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:35,359	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And then in the thirties California started to receive
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:38,687	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Power from new dams like the Hoover Dam
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:42,527	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And this power was coming into California at the wrong
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,575	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And then the power companies with
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:45,599	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Convert it
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:49,439	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And the conversion process was difficult and expensive
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:54,559	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So in 1936 the city of Los Angeles decided to
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,327	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Switch all there
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:57,887	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Customers to 60 Cycle
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:14:00,447	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Current and then in 1945
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:04,031	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The Southern California Edison Company decided to switch
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:06,335	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Everyone else in Southern California
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,383	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Over to the the sick
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:08,895	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Dixie cycle
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:11,967	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And that must be crazy because you're talking about every Appliance
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:12,991	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Plugs into
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,271	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The wall
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:16,063	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	He's now like being running
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:17,087	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Suboptimal
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:17,855	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Frequency
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,903	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And therefore you have to change everything
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:27,583	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Yeah it was nuts it was a huge undertaking like they weren't just like okay sorry like throw out your stuff
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,607	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	They sent
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:33,471	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Cruise into people's homes to retrofit their washing machines
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:36,287	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	They sent people into factories
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:39,103	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	To make sure all the Machinery worked right
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:40,383	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And it was
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,663	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Hundreds of thousands of
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:43,455	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Customers like I think nearly a million
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:43,967	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Customers
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:48,831	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Spend another power companies also had to change all their own equipment all the electric meters
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:50,879	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And then
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:54,975	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Four clocks you could actually go and drop your clock off at it
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,511	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	At 7 call the clock Depot
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:15:00,863	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And there were just like rows and rows and tables of
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:04,959	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Clocks being worked on and serve men sitting there working
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:05,983	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	To make your clock work
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:10,079	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Riddles is like
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,103	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	You have this big
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:17,247	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Such a project and then everyone just got to work and made it work for everybody
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,783	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Quite a few
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:21,599	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So by 1948 all of Southern California has
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:22,367	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Switched
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:24,671	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	To the new system and the final
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,975	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Tally was like 500000 clock
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:29,279	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Almost 400,000 lighting fixtures
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,839	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	58000 refrigerators
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,887	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And if you think of
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,423	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	How the population of LA
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:38,239	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Exploded in the following years it's
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,775	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	It's so lucky
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:43,615	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	That they decided to take this on when they did
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:46,431	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	I mean you can possibly do it now
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:51,295	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	No like no way and that's sort of why you'll never see like
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,831	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	International
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:55,135	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Standard for electrical current
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:59,231	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So you'd be may know if you've traveled to Europe that you have to buy like a little adapter
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,023	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Cuz most of Europe is
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,559	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Still on A50 psychosis
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,631	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And they'll never change cuz it would just be
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:10,239	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	I was just be too much I think the United States and Mexico
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,519	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Chicago and most of like
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:14,335	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Central America maybe South America or R6
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:15,359	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Cycle
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:22,015	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And Japan is actually I think the only country that still uses two different frequencies
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,551	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	In there one country
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,599	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So basically one half of the country has
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:26,367	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	50 hertz
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,391	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Send the other half
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:28,159	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Is using 60 hertz
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,695	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Open MySpace
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:35,839	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Yeah it actually like was a really big problem after the Fukushima at
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:40,703	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Accident because a big portion of the country lost power there was a tsunami
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:45,823	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	They were trying to send power from one part of the country to the other which is
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:47,359	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Fairly common thing that
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,639	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	You know we do
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:52,223	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	But they couldn't do it you can
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:52,991	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Convert
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:55,807	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	From one frequency to another but it's hard to do it
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,343	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	In really big
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:57,855	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Quantities
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:03,231	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And sold every so often in Japan actually there will be this little movement that bubbles up that's
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:06,559	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Like we should all be on the same frequency and then
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:11,935	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	It just like really quickly dies because like once I was like well we're not going to switch
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:16,287	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Every Other Side Cycle where is definitely not going to switch either
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,823	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And that's the end of that
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,103	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	What stays the same
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:19,871	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So it's
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:21,663	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Say the same and yeah we
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,943	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Can think of those early
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:27,295	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Pioneers in La that were like let's go ahead and do this before Things Are
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:28,831	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Control
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:29,855	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Thanks
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:30,879	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Those guys
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,695	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And thanks to Jake in it
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,743	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Yeah I think
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,255	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	PJ Cannon
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:39,071	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And you talked to a couple other people that you want to say
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:45,471	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Talk to a horologist named Ken Randall for the story I thought the story was actually going to be more about clocks
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:48,543	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Send it ended up being so Island
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:51,871	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Anyway she was great
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:57,247	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	I asked him if he'd heard a sound he said no of course I immediately sent him a link
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:18:00,575	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And then I also talked to an electrical engineer named Darrell Heinrich
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:02,111	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Who is also really
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:02,623	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Really helpful
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:21,055	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Longtime crew clothes that has been obsessed with
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:23,359	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	European style tilt and turn windows
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:26,175	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Really ever since he was a kid living in viroid Germany
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:30,015	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	I can't really explain them in audio with a really functional and
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:31,807	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Worthy of his design obsession
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:34,367	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	What about them recently on the website
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:37,695	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And several readers shared and appreciated his design session
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:39,487	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And to some they were completely new
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:44,607	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And there was a bunch of Europeans were just confused because they didn't understand that these windows weren't already everywhere
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:49,471	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Half the readers were astonished these things exist and wanted to have them and the other half
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:54,591	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Shocked that anybody would think they were shocking because they were totally ordinary everyday window design
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:58,175	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So this web article prompted a bunch of our audience
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:02,271	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	It's to send in suggestions for other clever Regional design Solutions
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,807	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	That we should also do a story about
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,087	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	What are the things that
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,391	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Somebody suggested right off the bat
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:09,439	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Which I was instantly fascinated by
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,975	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Are these things called
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:13,023	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Finnish dish drying closet
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:15,583	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	They're also known as dish drying cap
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:17,119	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Okay tell me the truth
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,167	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	It's osteon
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,447	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Cuy
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,215	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Valve
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:21,727	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Scopy
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,775	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Xian Cuevas comp
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:26,079	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	That's what it's called that's what it's called
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:28,127	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Asean cruise by icamp
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:31,711	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Okay so go ahead
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:33,759	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So the design has a pretty simple premise
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:36,063	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	If dishes can drive themselves and Storage
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,343	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	There's no need to drive a manual
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:40,671	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So instead of having a drying rack next to sink
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:43,999	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	You put your dishes away in the cabinet above the sink
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:47,327	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And this cabinet has special shelves with slots
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:49,119	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The waterfalls down through each level
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:52,447	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And it lands ultimately in the sink or on a sloped surface
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:52,959	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Richland Transit
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:56,543	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And of a nicer of
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,567	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Design by product
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:01,407	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	This end up cleaning up clutter in your kitchen so you don't have this
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:05,247	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	You know just drying rack is always half-full dishes sitting next to sink
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:07,807	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So your dis Trainwreck is essentially the same cabin
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:10,623	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	You put your dishes away in exactly the one step process
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:12,415	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	You just get out of take the dishes
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,951	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Put them away they drive themselves
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,487	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	I love it
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:16,767	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	It's so beautifully simple
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:17,791	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	They should do that
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,583	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	We should have those everywhere
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:21,375	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So this Regional design match
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,655	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	It was suggested by
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:23,167	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	By Anton
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:24,703	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Now that he lives abroad
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:26,495	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Anton says
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:28,031	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	I have to dry my dishes
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:28,799	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Anorak
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:30,079	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	That's it from the counter
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:30,847	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Biker bar bear
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:35,199	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Truant on I agree with you
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:35,967	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	We are Barbarian
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,551	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So you wrote an article about that when it was a huge hit
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:42,367	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And then it cause people to send in other little Regional
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,927	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And suddenly I had a lot of
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:46,975	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Regional design Solutions work with
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:48,511	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And one of the first ones that
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:50,815	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Came out was this could Tatsu table
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:53,375	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Which is a Japanese burnishing that doubles as a heating
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:57,215	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Show picture of really tall coffee table with
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:57,983	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	A quilt
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,519	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Over the sides that you
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,543	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Put your legs on
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:03,615	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And I underneath the tables there's a small space heater
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:10,015	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Endless top layer of the table it's a large picture but just like two two two panels sandwich this blanket so you
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:12,575	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	You have a service that you can set things on but you also have
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:15,391	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Is blanket or comforter extending out on all sides
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:19,488	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Instead of sitting around in an arc facing a fireplace
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:21,024	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	You can actually sit around in a circle
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:23,840	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And face each other and pull up sections of this cover
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:27,168	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And then to interact around this this Central Heating
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,960	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Why is this a Japanese thing
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:34,080	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Historically been really useful in Japan specifically because
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,896	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Home insulation is often sparse
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:39,200	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And whole house heating can be difficult and expensive
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:44,832	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And then traditional Japanese clothing also lends itself especially well to this form of space Heating
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:49,184	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Because warm air can flow up to the folds of a spacious kimono and then out
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,464	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The neck and arm holes
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:52,768	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	I mean that's what I like about it is
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:55,840	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	It has a lot of very specific reasons that it comes out of Japan
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:22:00,192	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	But a lot of those aren't necessary to add function either
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:02,240	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	A lot of those things would work for a really unique place
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:05,568	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	With the way that it's optimized for a kimono suggests that
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,616	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	It didn't used to be
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,384	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Electric heating oil
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:15,552	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	No historically they came from a food cooking system that was in the floor so they have these charcoal burning
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:18,112	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Who took hers in the floor and this morphed into a system
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:22,976	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Where they would try to use that to keep the home that eventually in on the modern era
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,768	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The certiport dangerous
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:27,584	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	ConEd fire solution was replaced by an electric
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:28,096	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Local heating system
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:29,888	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Cool one of those
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,424	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Kotatsu table
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:36,800	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	These would be great everywhere as long as they burn your legs is there any incidents
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:38,848	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Did you hear about anything about
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:41,664	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Advisories
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:43,712	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The daylight don't fall asleep under your couch
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:45,504	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	2 table legs
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:52,416	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Lead to injuries and things are perfect
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:54,976	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Sleep under tables in general probably
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:00,096	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	So it's really important to use
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,632	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Table as described
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,680	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	But that is not like our next
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:06,496	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Design solution was one of its powers is
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:07,264	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The versatility
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:08,544	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Of this on
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:10,336	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	It's called The Hills
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:13,152	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The hills hoist is effectively
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:16,992	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The opposite use case it can be used for everything
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:18,272	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	That is not designed for
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:26,208	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Basically it's a rotating clothesline they have a central metal pole that sticks up from the ground like the trunk of a tree
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:27,744	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The smaller clothesline Sports
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:28,512	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	The branch out from the top
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:30,560	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And then this thing sits
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:34,144	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Awesome backyards and it's been slowly Breeze drying clothes on a series of lion
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:36,448	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	That just a circle that
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:37,216	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Central Pool
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,240	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	And where is the healthways
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:41,568	| 99pi-0263-youshoulddoastory-1 |	Hills hoist was developed in Australia
