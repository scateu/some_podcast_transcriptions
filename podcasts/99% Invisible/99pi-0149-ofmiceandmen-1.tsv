EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:35,519	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	With each letter map to number aiding one you can imagine that it gets harder once you reach the middle
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,031	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Letters of the alphabet
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:40,383	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Yeah I have no idea of the top of my head what number of the alphabet o is
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:44,991	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Right well there's a chart you can hang up next to a desk to reference
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,015	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	What number each letter is
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:48,831	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	But the point is all of this take
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:49,343	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Subtract
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:53,951	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Still I could imagine how with a lot of repetition you could get fast
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:04,447	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Doug engelbart felt his mouth and key said would allow us to communicate with computers more fluidly and the fish
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:10,847	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Efficiently you know it sounds pretty hard to learn as a single bite was against user-friendly devices
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:17,247	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	But you just believe that if we were willing to put time into learning computers they could do so much more fat
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:21,855	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	He thought they could help us communicate and collaborate to become better humans and more effective
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:29,535	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	So that meant how can you make humans in groups and organizations be
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:34,399	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Dramatically more effective how effective can you make them is there a limit
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:40,799	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Maybe the idea that computers can help us collaborate doesn't sound that crazy now but Engelbert was working at a time
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:44,383	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	When most people thought of computers at Giant calculators
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,663	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Their purpose was

EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:51,295	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And in my father's Paradigm why would you ever automate
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:56,159	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	How you do things now a computer affords a whole new way of working
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:58,207	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	What way would you work if you weren't
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:00,767	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Limited to the old technology

EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,663	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Engelbert actually helped invent the internet
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:20,735	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And throughout the sixties and early seventies
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:23,807	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Is group building Tire online collaboration
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:27,647	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And included video conferencing and collaborative text

EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:30,719	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Curious presenting those things and what
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:32,767	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Became known as the mother of all demos
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:36,607	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	I need to know what terminal you are on Bill
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:39,935	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Okay I'd like to have him see my texts

EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:50,943	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And sure enough it does
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:51,967	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	But what's that
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:52,991	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Running around
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Well he's okay my texts he like have something to say about it
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:09:00,671	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	The reason people call it the mother of all demos is that in it
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Engelbart show the world so many revolutionary ideas
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,791	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	The mouse of course
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:09,631	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	But also a bunch of things that didn't catch on until decades later
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:13,983	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	The time most people hadn't even heard of personal Computing let alone the internet
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:17,567	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And here was Doug engelbart demonstrating the ancestor
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,335	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Pictures of tools
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:18,847	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Like Skype

EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,199	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	In the 1960s
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:27,551	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Despite all of this by the early 1970s
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:30,879	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Engelbart's lab ran out of funding to continue his research
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:37,791	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Much like is three-button Mouse and key set his other ideas were seen as interesting but complicated
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,583	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And not particularly marketable
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:42,911	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And meanwhile another computer Visionary had under the
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:43,679	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	15
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:46,751	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	One that unlike the ganga Bart you've probably heard of
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:49,311	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	A guy by the name of Steve Jobs
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:51,359	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Steve Jobs was never satisfied
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:54,431	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	With the first of the second Raven 210
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,967	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Pass and making something simple
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:10:03,135	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	That's Larry tesler Apple from 1980 to 1997 S&P and chief scientist
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:08,767	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	How simple you made it he would come and say that's pretty good but I think you can make it simpler than that
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:11,583	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And then he would leave us like will how
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:15,423	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Once in a while he would make a suggestion but usually he just walked away
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,959	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And we had to figure out a way to make it simpler
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:21,567	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	One thing jobs wanted to simplify was engelbart's Mouse and key set
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:25,663	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Jobs had first seen the mouth and key set at Xerox Parc
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:29,503	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Which was The Cutting Edge Computing research facility at the time
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:33,855	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	In the 1970s when engelbart's lab started to disband
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:37,439	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	A lot of engelbart's researchers and some of his prototype
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,719	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Ended up at Xerox Parc
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:45,631	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Jobs
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:52,031	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Complicated to use he dismissed the case at all together
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:58,431	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Do Apple employees saying that the mouse Apple was developing with only have one button
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:00,479	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Years Apple held onto it's one button Mouse
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:02,271	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Even as competitors developed
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,039	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Two-button mice
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:07,647	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	He was very attached to it considered including engelbart's
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,951	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Keyset companion to the mouse
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:13,023	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	It was too costly clunky and complicated to learn
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:16,095	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	An apple we wanted people to come into the store
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Look at the software try it out figure it out
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,191	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	In the first
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:20,959	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	2 minutes
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:25,055	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And and plunk down a credit card and take the computer home
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:26,335	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,895	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	It wasn't okay to say will take it home
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:32,991	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And work on it every day for several hours a day and a six months you'll be really good at it
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,039	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And suddenly
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,575	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Computers were for everyone
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:37,855	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Even better
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:41,951	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Beautiful that's a beautiful
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:44,767	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And that it's helped a lot of people
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:46,559	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	That's Christina engelbart again
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,095	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Problem is

EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,655	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	The whole mission
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:57,055	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Christina thinks that when we prioritize simple user-friendly devices over more complex learnable ones
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,335	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	We limit ourselves
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:00,639	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And we might miss out on important ideas
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,943	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And for a while at least
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,991	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Steve Jobs did exactly that
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:10,879	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	When job showed engelbart the brand new Apple computer Christina said that her dad responded like this

EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,559	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Here's jobs in South
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,863	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Talking about missing the importance of network
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:29,215	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	When it was first demonstrated to him at Xerox Parc in 1979
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:32,799	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	100 Alto computers all network using email
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:35,103	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Excetera excetera I didn't even see that
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:38,175	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	I was so blinded by
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:40,735	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	The first thing they showed me which was the graphical user interface
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:44,063	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	I thought it was the best thing I've ever seen in my life
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:49,183	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Of course jobs eventually came around to networking but I take Christina engelbart's point
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:53,023	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Are the designer being married to some pussy
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:56,351	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	We might also be limited by Simplicity as user
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:14:03,263	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Example my dad used to like to go and I think this was really appropriate is the difference between a tricycle in a vice
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,055	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	So
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:07,615	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Anybody can get on a tricycle
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:09,663	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Especially if you see somebody else ride it
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,175	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	You know
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,967	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	You can just get on and ride it
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:13,247	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	You don't need any
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:15,039	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Training
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:16,063	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Do it and figure it out
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:19,135	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	But that's fine if you're just going to
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,183	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Go around the block
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:21,951	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	A couple of times
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:26,559	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	You trying to go up a hill a tricycle is a pretty bad way to go
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:28,351	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	You want to bike with gears
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:33,471	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Can you learn how to balance tear in chain gears because it gives you a lot more power
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:35,519	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	You can cover a lot more steep ground
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,311	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	A lot of people
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:39,103	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	I made the point that
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:42,431	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	My dumbing-down computer is so much that is easy for anybody to learn
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,735	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	We made it so that
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,015	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Most people don't
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:48,319	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Go to the trouble of learning something that
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,087	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Could
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,855	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Give them more
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,135	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Leverage
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:52,671	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	More power with their computer
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,231	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And I think that's a fair criticism
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,023	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	That's Larry tesler again
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:15:00,351	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	He agrees that early on Steve Jobs Overlook Network
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:03,423	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	They also thinks that jobs was right

EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:05,983	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	If
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:08,031	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	You make it as we did an apple
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:08,799	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	So that
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,079	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Just about anybody
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:10,847	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Can do
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:14,943	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Things that they do everyday on on a computer or on a smartphone
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,967	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Then
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:17,759	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	You giving them the only opportunity
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,783	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	But they're probably ever have
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,063	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	2
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:20,831	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Benefit from
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:22,111	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	That power
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:26,463	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Doug engelbart might look at the world now and say they're all on tricycle
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,743	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Spaceship Beyond bicycle
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:29,023	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Nothing is
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:31,583	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Are tricycles have gotten pretty awesome
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:38,495	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	They become so powerful and so well-designed that were actually able to get around without ever learning how to ballet
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:40,031	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Balance on two wheels or shift gears
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:42,847	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Maybe that's the world we're living in today
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:45,663	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	When were a lot of engelbart's ideas
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:48,479	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Come to fruition and almost anyone can access
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:50,015	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Including you
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,807	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Your mom and Grandad and yes
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,343	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Pretty soon
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:55,903	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	You're drooling iPhone poking toddler
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:59,487	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	But I think Christina would say there's still more we could learn
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:02,047	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And a simple interfaces have sort of hidden that path
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,607	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Is hung a curtain over the complex
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,911	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	It's tough to keep us from having to face
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:09,983	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	And in doing so they keep a stranded in Grand and
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:10,751	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Appointment
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:13,823	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	My dad always said for sure easy to learn easy to use
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:15,103	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Fine for the beginner
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:22,527	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Once you do something for a year or two or five why would you sit down and use the computer the same
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:24,575	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	What year did the very first day UK
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,599	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Okay man that's
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:29,183	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	You need to have a clear stream lionpath
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:33,023	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	For advancing into a much more sophisticated

EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:36,607	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	With a computer
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:40,447	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Maybe the question is what kind of users do we want to be
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:45,311	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	The best design may not always be the one that's user-friendly at first sight
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:50,943	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	It might be the one that allows is the degree of virtuosity if we think investing the time is worth it
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:54,271	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Or another words it's the one that helped us
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:57,087	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	Switch from tricycle riding to bicycle riding
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:59,135	| 99pi-0149-ofmiceandmen-1 |	So that if we want to
