EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:04,895	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	And then I asked them if the person in question had to be deceased
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,199	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	And they didn't respond
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:09,503	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	But on the application it says

EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:58,911	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	The stairs one of those signs right on the corner Helen and John black Square
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:00,703	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Could just ask a city councillor
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:02,239	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	And they would put in a council order
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,055	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	The city would do it
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:06,335	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	So we have intersection
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,895	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	In some parts of town that have one of those

EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,199	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	The four corners
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:11,711	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Really
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:12,991	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:13,503	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Preponderance
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:15,551	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Dedication
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:17,599	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Preponderance
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:19,391	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Proliferation of dedication
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,927	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	You seem you seem
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,231	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Not so pleased
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:25,535	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Well it gets to be a little
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,815	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Instead of a clutter after a while
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,119	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	And they begin to lose their meaning
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,143	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	So I think the
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:32,703	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	City council is a little more resistant
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:35,519	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Used to be they're running out of places to put these
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:42,687	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	So I just to be clear these places they're not recognized by the US Board of geographic names
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:45,503	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Maps are used by the federal government in any way but
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:47,039	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	That said
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:51,135	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Local usage is something the board takes into account when it's evaluating a proposal
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:54,719	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	And not just the local Authority recognizing the name
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,487	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	But the locals
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,279	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Those Folks up there
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:58,559	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	In that house
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:01,375	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Getting that Over Yonder this is Kevin O'Brien again
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:07,263	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	That Busta Rhymes Island we would have to go to them and say hey do you know the name of that Island if they were psycho that's
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:10,591	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Busta Rhymes island or whatever else we're going to name it
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:12,895	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Then that would be considered local usage so if
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:14,687	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	If local folks know what to call it
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,967	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Everybody calls it that
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:21,087	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	Then you have a lot more a lot more weight going to the government and saying I'd like to name this island
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:23,647	| 99pi-0105-onemanisanisland-1 |	But as far as Heaven Knows
