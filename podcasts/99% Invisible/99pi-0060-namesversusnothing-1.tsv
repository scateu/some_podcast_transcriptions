EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:01,760	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	Versus
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:02,784	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	Nothing
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:06,112	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	When I was a kid growing up in South Florida there was a
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:08,672	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	Beautiful green place where I always wanted to go play
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:12,768	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	Look perfect for a kid to run around and throw a ball

EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:17,376	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	But my parents wouldn't ever take me there
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:24,544	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	But with good reason it was inside of a giant Highway interchange my five year old self would never have been able to convince
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,312	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	My parents
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:27,360	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	This would be a good place to play
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:30,944	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	Because no responsible parent takes their kid to play catch-up a side of I-90
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:35,552	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	But I don't think I would even have known how to ask them to take me there because this
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:38,112	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	Place isn't really anywhere that we think of is
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:39,136	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	Being a

EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:50,656	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	But as I grew up and became a driver I learned to ignore them like everyone else
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:52,960	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	So what happened

EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,375	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	Potential
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:49,983	| 99pi-0060-namesversusnothing-1 |	Sometimes everyday unremarkable spaces can become something more simply by virtue of
