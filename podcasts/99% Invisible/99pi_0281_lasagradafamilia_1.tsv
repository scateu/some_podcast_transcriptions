EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:06,655	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Picked up in boxes little

EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:19,455	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	For the next couple of decades the remaining Architects and other workers tried to figure out how to move forward on the
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:21,503	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Suction without Gowdy's plans
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:25,599	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	But outside the church there was opposition to moving forward at all
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:29,439	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	In the 1960s an impressive group of intellectuals in Arkansas

EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:38,655	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	LD wasn't only in Arkansas
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,167	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Back they argued
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,191	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	He was an artist
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:44,287	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And you shouldn't attempt to finish a work of art without the artist
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:45,567	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	They felt good
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:47,871	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	This was a total waste of time they should have left
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,431	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Just the original Nativity facade
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:52,479	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Almost like a Gothic ruins
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,783	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	That is a homage to Gaudi
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:57,343	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And the Gaudi wasn't being well-served
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:00,671	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	But the patrons of the project would have none of it
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:04,767	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	The building was never supposed to be an homage to Gaudi they argued
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:08,351	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	It was always about something bigger
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:14,751	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	That said they would try to honor Gowdy's original Vision as Faithfully as possible but it would be easy
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:21,151	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	The models and drawings had been the roadmap for how to move forward on the construction and they were burned and smashed.

EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:24,735	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And this wasn't just any Cathedral

EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:34,975	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	It would taste his successors
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:37,023	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Years to fully get a handle on it
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:43,423	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	The church still had no interior

EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:46,495	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	It was just walls and Towers

EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,439	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	That he was sad

EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:09,791	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Meaning that there was

EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:25,055	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	After a year
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:27,615	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	He managed to draw out architectural blueprints

EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:30,175	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	It was a start
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:34,783	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Mark Berry didn't stay long at the Sagrada Familia

EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:08,928	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	That's right after that
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,424	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Between the beats
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:21,728	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Bongs and chatter of our devices
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:25,056	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:26,336	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	If
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:30,944	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:38,368	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	She talked to us
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:40,416	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	It is a creation of Sonic trash
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:43,744	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:47,328	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:49,120	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	To make them more human
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,960	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Turn the living room lights on
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:54,752	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:57,056	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Dim the living room lights to 50
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:57,568	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	2%
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:27:59,360	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Okay
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:06,016	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:37,248	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	We need to talk about something
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:40,576	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Constipation abdominal pain and bloating you tell yourself
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:44,416	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	It's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:46,464	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	But thinking about it all the time is frustrating
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:51,840	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:57,984	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And you don't know why then it may be time to seek help go to oh my God. Info podcast

EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:09,248	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	What are things you mentioned that piece are these models
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:10,784	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Destroyed and
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:14,624	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	How important they were in realizing gaudi's vision for La Sagrada Familia
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:17,952	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Bluetooth technical to get into in the piece
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:19,488	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Kolstad
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:20,000	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Noses
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:24,352	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And I asked him to come to the studio and explain gaudi's modeling technique
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,888	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And why it is so important
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:26,656	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	The creation
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:28,192	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	La Sagrada Familia
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:28,960	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	With a lot of Arkansas
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:30,240	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Especially once
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:30,752	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Do you like to use
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:33,824	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Preferred to work in models rather than
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:37,152	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Models helping experiment with really complex
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:38,176	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Control structures
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:39,968	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And Albany
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:42,784	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Model out structural Arrangements test things out
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:45,856	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Photograph as models in draw over the photo
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:48,416	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	The bottles were behind all of this
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,184	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Yes they were driving the design
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:53,536	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And one of the things that you tied with a lot and bottles were variations on what
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:54,048	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	What's called a cabinet
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:56,864	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Okay so what is a catenary arch
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:58,912	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Catenary is
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,448	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	The curved shape
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:02,496	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	That a hanging chain assumes
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:03,520	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Under its own weight
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,312	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Basically picture
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:07,616	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Electric line suspended between Utah
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:10,432	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Okay so you're driving on the highway
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:11,456	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	C2 utility
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:15,552	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Electric line goes across them and there's that natural Boeing
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:16,576	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Of the
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:17,600	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Electrical wire
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:18,880	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And that is
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:19,392	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	The Cat Mario
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:20,928	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Exactly
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:21,952	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And that term is actually
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:23,488	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Drive from the Latin word for cheap
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:27,072	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And it was already well-known by gaudi's time
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:30,656	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	That an optimal Arch shape could be made by mirroring
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:31,680	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	A catenary curve
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:32,192	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Vertically
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:34,496	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Basically you take that hanging curve
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:36,288	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And you just flip it up
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:38,336	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And that becomes the model of your
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,128	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And that Arch
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:42,944	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	These building loads efficiently and a lot of God
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:47,040	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Okay that makes sense you take this BO2 chain
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:48,832	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Christy altomare
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:49,600	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	When you flip it over
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:54,208	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And when Ukrainian churches in the gothic style this is a good way to create a good
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:55,744	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Model
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:56,512	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	But
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:57,792	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Gowdy took the idea further
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:30:59,584	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Chi hung strings
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:00,608	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Other strings
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,376	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Other strings
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:03,424	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	They added birdshot
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:05,472	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	To weight them down at structural intersections
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:07,264	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Incredibles
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,288	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Huge intricate
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:09,056	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Wireframe model
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,104	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	End up looking about like Chandelier
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:14,432	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And then God would use mirrors to flip
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:15,456	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	These vertically
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:17,760	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And study the shapes they created
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:20,576	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	In order to shape his own elaborate building skeleton
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:22,624	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And it sounds a lot like what
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,928	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Leader Architects use
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:25,440	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Software for
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:27,232	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	When they did 3D model
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:29,536	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Yeah there are a lot of parallel
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:30,816	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Innocence
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:32,352	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Long before parametric
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:34,400	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Design was a computer software problem
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:36,192	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Gowdy changed
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:40,032	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Parameters in his models by moving strings and weights around to see how
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:41,824	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Who's individual modifications
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:43,360	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	3shape an entire structure
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:47,456	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And then a century later people came along and finally made these digital
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:49,248	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Technically
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:50,528	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Handmade models have been doing
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:54,624	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Allowing Architects to see how small changes would Ripple out to their entire designs
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:56,928	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	So you know you can imagine
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:57,696	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	It would take like
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:58,464	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Call Amanda
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:00,256	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Moving around a little bit
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:02,560	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And that deforms like all the other shape
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:03,072	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Types of Destruction
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:04,864	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Right and then
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:08,192	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Software you do this and nail the software
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:09,984	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Cranks long and does its thing
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:11,264	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	But in gaudi's time
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:13,824	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	You would move a weight around
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:14,848	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And you'd see how the
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:20,736	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Connected set of chains with all kind of deform by adding a little bit of birdshot
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:21,248	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	211
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:23,808	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	That's amazing
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:25,344	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	And it looks stunning
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:26,880	| 99pi_0281_lasagradafamilia_1 |	Yeah the results are amazing
