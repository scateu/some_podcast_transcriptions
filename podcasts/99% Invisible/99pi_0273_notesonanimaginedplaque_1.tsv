EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:18,592	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	It's always worth stopping to see what person or event is being commemorated in stone and Metal
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:22,944	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Person being depicted is not always worthy the story being told
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:24,480	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	If not always true

EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:59,296	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	To be added to the Statue of General Nathan Bedford Forrest
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:02,368	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	On hearing the Memphis city council has voted to move it
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:05,184	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	An exhume remains of General Forrest and his wife
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:06,976	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Mary Ann Montgomery Forrest
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:10,048	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	From their current location in a park downtown
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,840	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	The nearby Elmwood Cemetery
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:15,168	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	First it should be big but black
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:18,240	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	But necessarily because there's so much to say
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,776	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	So there is so much to say
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:26,176	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	But big enough to be noticed on the side of this rather Grand Monument after they move it and the bodies beneath it
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,712	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Across town to the cemetery
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:30,528	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	And that's as big for the sake of bigness
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,808	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	He needs to stick out
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:32,832	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Is something off
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:36,416	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Something that disrupts the admirable balance of the statue
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:38,208	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Currently so tasteful
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:38,976	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Regal even
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:41,536	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Is bronze man on this bronze horse
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:42,816	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Goatee
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:43,840	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Square jaw
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:44,864	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	You got it
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,400	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	You seen it before
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:48,448	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Even if you haven't seen it before
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:51,008	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	The statue faces North
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:53,568	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	This culture wanted for us to face South
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,360	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	You better catch the Light
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,640	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	But people complained
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:59,200	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Implied that the general was retreating
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:01,248	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	And he wasn't a man who retreated
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,296	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	He surrendered once
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:05,600	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	But if this culture face North
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:08,160	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Maybe people would forget that part
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,672	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	I guess
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:12,512	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	She has to be big enough to catch your eye
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:18,144	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	When you're checking your cell phone or walking your dog eating a chicken Caesar salad from a plastic box and a bench
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:23,008	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Whatever people are doing there in the cemetery and whatever they might do there in the future
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,800	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Because that's why we make these things right
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,080	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Plaques
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,872	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Bronze man on bronze horses
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:30,432	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	You want people in the future to remember
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:33,248	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	But first we want them to notice
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:38,112	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	So let's think about material for this imagine black
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,672	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Because the flag should be garish
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:44,768	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Not intentionally ugly not necessarily but like titanium Maybe
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:48,864	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	A patch of Frank gehry futurism on the stage state legal thing
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:50,400	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Catch the lion
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:51,680	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	The catch the eye
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:55,008	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	In contrast to the northward facing brown green man
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,800	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	On his brown green horse
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,848	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Or a great pigeon
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,640	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Elite on his brown green at Gillette
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:03,712	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	I like that the Geary of it all the futurism
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:06,272	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Is not at all futuristic it's millennial
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:10,112	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	A decade from now it'll be dated literally dated
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:13,952	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Do Bauer Disney Hall or wherever will seem so late 90s
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:15,232	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	So 2000s
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:16,768	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Window scarf
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,047	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	They want that
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,351	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	I want this pain to be fixed in time
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:22,399	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Let people know when it went up
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,703	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Let people know what was up at the time
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,751	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Because Dad at the point here
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:30,591	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	The point of this plaque is to make sure that these future people realize
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:32,639	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	That this lovely old statue
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,431	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Wasn't always old
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,223	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	He wasn't always here in the cemetery
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,783	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	And moreover I want the reader
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:41,087	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Standing there in the shadow cast by the late
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:43,135	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Somehow still demented
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,671	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Nathan Bedford Forrest
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:46,975	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Once and future summer Sunday
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:50,047	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	To know why it wound up in a park and the other side of town in the first place
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,375	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Because memorials aren't memories
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,679	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	They don't just appear upon death
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,215	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Letter of surrender
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,775	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Signing some Farmhouse at the edge of some Battlefield
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:03,615	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Doesn't come complete with a historic marker it fixed the door
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,967	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	The monument to Nathan Bedford Forrest
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:11,295	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Was put in that park downtown for a reason
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,599	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	At a specific Moment In Time
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:17,951	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	And at that time General Forest in mrs. forest
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:19,999	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	We're already buried in Elmwood Cemetery
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:23,327	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	The same place the city council recently voted to put them
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,119	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	His body
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,143	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	In her body
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:28,191	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Were originally dug up from the ground
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:30,751	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Because a group of prominent memphians
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,799	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Thought they were better off somewhere else
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,847	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	That was 1905
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,895	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	40 years after the war
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,199	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	30 years after Forest death
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:42,783	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	They felt the city needed Nathan Bedford Forrest right then
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:45,855	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Because they had seen that City fall from Great Heights
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:49,183	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Memphis have been left relatively unscathed by the war
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,975	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	But not by its outcome
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:53,791	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Not by the end of the slave trade
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:56,863	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	That had been one of the economic and cultural pillars of the city
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:00,959	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Without the slave market selling men and women and children
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:04,543	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Without the river boats and Crews and suppliers and dockworkers
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,335	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Sending them up and down the river
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:08,895	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Memphis was Harley Memphis anymore
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,711	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	And then there was the yellow fever
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:15,039	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	And it swept through the city some years before in killed so many
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:17,087	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	I drove many more away
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:20,159	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	People who never returned after a mandatory evacuation
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:23,231	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	And now it was the turn of the next century
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:25,023	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	In the city was increasingly

EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:01,503	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Because some influential memphians

EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,063	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Destroyed it will
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,855	| 99pi_0273_notesonanimaginedplaque_1 |	Maybe that should be enough
