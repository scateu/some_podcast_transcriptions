EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:46,367	| 99pi-0097-numberstations-1 |	The CIA likes to be other stations do other strange things
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,743	| 99pi-0097-numberstations-1 |	Then they usually go into the message

EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:04,191	| 99pi-0097-numberstations-1 |	I've always assumed these are using a one-time Pandora.
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,727	| 99pi-0097-numberstations-1 |	Which are
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:11,871	| 99pi-0097-numberstations-1 |	Theoretically unbreakable given the assumptions of only having ciphertext are only having what's broadcast on the station
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:14,943	| 99pi-0097-numberstations-1 |	A one-time pad is a page of random numbers
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:18,015	| 99pi-0097-numberstations-1 |	Which is the key used to encrypt and then decrypt the message
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:20,575	| 99pi-0097-numberstations-1 |	The sender and recipient each have a copy

EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:37,727	| 99pi-0097-numberstations-1 |	Many many times they've seen the code pad they seen the receivers
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:40,287	| 99pi-0097-numberstations-1 |	The fact that the other side knows
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:43,615	| 99pi-0097-numberstations-1 |	But this is how they do it does not give them any more access to the information
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:45,663	| 99pi-0097-numberstations-1 |	It's a perfect system in that respect
