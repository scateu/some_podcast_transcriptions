EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,887	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	But from the outside
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,935	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	Southdale Center is not much to look at
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,727	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	I mean it looks like a mall

EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:00,511	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	Congruence mind it should have
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:04,351	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	Pretty much of a blank facade no signage on it
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:06,399	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	And then you enter that
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:09,983	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	Space and then you walk into the shopping center and that's that
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:16,383	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	Set of transformational Gruen transfer moment muldaur designed as the sort of suburban pilgrimage sites
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,151	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	Which of course
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,687	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	You have to drive to
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,479	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	It's a commitment
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,527	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	You're driving 20-30 minutes
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:25,343	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	You're parking your getting out of your car your walking in
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:27,391	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	Good new that Americans love to drive
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,927	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	To the mall with his compromise
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	You had to walk and stroll once you're inside
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:34,303	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	But the customers could drive over
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,839	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	So he just hates
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:38,655	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	The automobile but he never will acknowledge
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:41,983	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	That he's creating the shopping centres which are
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,775	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	Largely

EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	But over time
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:59,135	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	Truancies that in erecting these malls

EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,239	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	Actually
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:50,079	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	His plan for Kalamazoo became the first outdoor pedestrian shopping mall
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:56,479	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	Open the u.s. to turn Fifth Avenue into a pedestrian Mall

EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:02,111	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	What is City's downtown is not a mall
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:08,511	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	Not so easily quote-unquote fixed not so perfectly designed and controlled cities were

EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:22,591	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	It's very much
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:29,247	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	And I think that may have been somewhat of his reason for the retreat to Vienna
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:36,159	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	In 1968 Gruen from Los Angeles back to Vienna back to the greenery and Plaza

EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,839	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	There's a shopping mall that's being built on the edge of Vienna
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,143	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	And he points to that
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:48,447	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	As how that shopping malls destroyed
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,983	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	Downtown Vienna
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:53,823	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	Congruent mind Vienna was already perfectly planned
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:57,407	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	It didn't need a mall like the broken American suburbs did
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,199	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	As he saw it
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:05,343	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	His original Vision had been completely skewed after being in Vienna about 10 years

EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:47,839	| 99pi-0163-thegrueneffect-1 |	But I mean literally it was air condition
