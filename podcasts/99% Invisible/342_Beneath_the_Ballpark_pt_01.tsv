EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,743	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	On the West Coast

EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:44,479	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And as luck would have it for a Roz Wyman and other angelinos desperate for baseball
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:47,807	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	There's an East Coast team in desperate need of a new stadium

EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:53,695	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	They were a classic baseball team who have been playing at a classic ballpark

EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,607	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Right in the heart of Brooklyn
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:04,703	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But those who are nostalgic about seeing game at

EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:11,359	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Abbottsfield had a lot of problems
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:13,919	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	There were columns obstructing the view of the field
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:20,063	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Steep climbs the upper deck barely any parking or freeway access and the building itself was falling apart
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:26,719	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The team owner Walter O'Malley wanted to build his own modern well-designed stadium in Brooklyn
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:33,631	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	He even went so far as to hire Buckminster Fuller to Draft plans for a dome to go over the top of the field that would turn
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:35,935	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	On the stadium into an all-weather facility
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:41,823	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	You don't usually think of baseball team owners as being friends with that with futurist Architects but
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:42,847	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	In this case that was
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,383	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Then that that was what was going on
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:49,759	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	O'Malley fought for years for his dream of a privately owned Stadium
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:53,855	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But there was one very powerful bureaucrats standing in the way
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,903	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	New York Symphony
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,671	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Master builder
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:57,951	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Robert Moses
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:01,791	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It just so happened that Robert Moses
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,839	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Not only didn't like spectator
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,655	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Sports he thought that spectator sports warraich
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,423	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Total
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,447	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Waste of time
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:10,495	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And for what he called LaRue
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,543	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And without Moses's
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,311	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Support
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:15,359	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	A new Dodger Stadium in Brooklyn
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,383	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Basically
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,151	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Impossible
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:21,503	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And O'Malley said well one I'm a brooklynite and I want the
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:26,623	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The park to be in Brooklyn if it's in Queens it might as well be ten thousand miles away
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:29,951	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	O'Malley figured if he couldn't get his dream stadium in Brooklyn
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:32,767	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	He might as well move the daughter is all the way out
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,047	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The California
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:38,143	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Roz Wyman in the city council
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,191	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Invited O'Malley out to Los Angeles
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:45,055	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	He had by my estimation and spent a total of
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:45,823	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	10 days
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,847	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	In his entire life
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,639	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	In Los Angeles
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:52,479	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	He doesn't really know where he wants to build a deal
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:55,551	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Yet to come to Los Angeles but he's scouting it out
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:09:01,183	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Decided to take a helicopter ride across the city to get a feel for the area
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:03,487	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And he saw something that caught his eye
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:06,047	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	What look like an empty piece of land
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:08,095	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Just a few miles from downtown
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,911	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	This hilly area was called Chavez Ravine
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:16,031	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The thing that he sees is all the vacant land around Chavez Ravine
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,335	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But it was surrounded by the freeways
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:19,871	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	This is Mark's Landing
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:21,919	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The official historian for the LA Dodgers
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:26,271	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	He says that the freeways made the side of healing because it meant that fans would have
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,807	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Easy access to the stadium
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,599	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The train was really hilly
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:32,415	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And we would need to do a huge amount of work
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,183	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Flatten out the land
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,743	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It was all worth it because of the highway Acts
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,303	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	He even estimated the amount of
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,095	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Land that would have to be moved
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:46,239	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	That didn't bother him because it's easy to move that land but it's hard to build three or four different freeways
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:51,359	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Broomelli probably didn't realize that the plot of land that he had his eye on
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,895	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Wasn't completely empty
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:56,479	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	There were a few families living in Chavez Ravine
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:10:00,063	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I've been there a long time and if the Dodgers were going to build a stadium there
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,367	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	They'd have to kick those people out
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,415	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And it wouldn't be the first time
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:06,207	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But the people of Chavez Ravine
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:07,231	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Have been forced
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:07,999	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	To leave their home
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,815	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	O'Malley thought he saw a vast
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,607	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Empty stretch of land from the helicopter
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:19,519	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But what he was really saying we're the last legs of a community that had existed there since the early 1900s
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,823	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	In for a long time
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:23,359	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It was a neighborhood full of life
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,151	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It was very colorful
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,687	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Because the ladies
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,199	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Had
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,015	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Colorful birds
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,807	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Canaries were big I mean
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:34,367	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Atwood wake us up canaries in the morning singing
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:37,183	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And it was just a very colorful
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:38,975	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Community
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,767	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	This is Carol Hawkins
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:43,327	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Yes my name is Carol Hawkins
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,351	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And it's spelled
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,143	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Jacquees
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:50,239	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Carol is 76 years old now and still lives in Los Angeles
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:53,823	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And as a little girl she grew up in Chavez Ravine
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:56,383	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I know you said you're pretty young when you left
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:11:01,503	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I'm so as much as you can remember I'm out so I can remember a lot
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,015	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:07,135	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Carol was only nine or ten years old when her family left Chavez Ravine
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,695	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But our memories are crystal clear
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,975	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I was very rude
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:13,023	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	So we could always see the trees
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:16,863	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And at that time when I was growing up anyway
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,911	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	At this time of year there always be like
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,471	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	When you woke up
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,543	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Chavez Ravine with like a small town within the city
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:27,871	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It was home to mostly Mexican and Mexican-American families
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:30,687	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Was made up of three different neighborhoods called
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,455	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Palo Verde
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,479	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Paloma in Bishop
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:35,295	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Some roads were paved but most boring
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:38,111	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Water pump at electricity but some didn't
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:42,463	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	In its own way though it was still a flourishing closely knit community
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:46,815	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	We're like any other neighborhood we had some people that we're doing very well
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:48,863	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	There was some families that were very
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:49,631	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Or
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:52,191	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	There was some families that were not so nice
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:54,239	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	There was some families that were very religious
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,031	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But they were all still
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:57,823	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Friends and everybody knew each other
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:01,919	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Chavez Ravine was located just a few miles
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:02,943	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Bus from downtown Los Angeles
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,479	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But it felt like
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,503	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	A world apart
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:08,063	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It was this isolated pocket
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:08,575	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Within the city
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,367	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It has its own schools
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:11,647	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Churches stores
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,671	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Barber shop
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:16,511	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The residents had everything they needed without ever having to leave the neighborhood
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:20,607	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But a lot of the reason why they were so independent
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,887	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Or because they had to be
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:24,191	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	60% of the
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:24,959	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	People
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:29,567	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Mexican Mexican American people that were living in Chavez Ravine area
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,615	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	On their own home
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,383	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And the reason is
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:36,223	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Because that was the only place in the city we could live
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,247	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Because of the Covenants
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,807	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Covenants were racial restrictions
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:43,135	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	That limited where people of color could actually purchase property
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,695	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	From the 1910s through the 1940s
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:49,535	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Chavez Ravine with one of the few places in Los Angeles
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:52,095	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	That non-white people could actually own a home
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:56,191	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	First threat to the community was not actually the baseball stadium
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:58,239	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	18 years before
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,775	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	In the form of a new housing project
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:02,335	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	1949
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:04,639	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The federal government passed the National Housing Act
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:10,527	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Which allocated funds to cities all over the country in order to build new low income housing for
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,039	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	People in need
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:12,831	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Los Angeles itself
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:15,647	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	We're going to be home to 10,000 of these new public housing units
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:22,559	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	This was part of an effort to alleviate a severe housing shortage that ensued during the early
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,863	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Early 1940s during World War II
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:29,471	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And public housing was seen as a solution to providing
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,495	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Affordable
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:36,639	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Sanitary living conditions for poor people who were not able to provide that for them
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,151	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Sounds
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:39,199	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	This is Eric Avila
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:42,015	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Professor of history and Chicano studies at UCLA
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:47,391	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	He says that the city selected Chavez Ravine to be the site for 3600 new units
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,159	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It's because

EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,255	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Determined it was

EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:02,751	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	With new modern house
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:06,079	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	From an urban planning perspective
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:09,407	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Or from the perspective of City Hall
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:12,479	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	For Community like the Choppers are being
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:15,039	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Fit their idea of what
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:16,063	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Islam was
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:20,927	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The time but if you talk to the people who remembered what it was like to live in the troposphere
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,999	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	They didn't think of their neighborhood as
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:24,767	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Aslam
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,791	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	We have flushing toilet
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,583	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Everywhere that I went
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:31,167	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And I went to a lot of houses and when I had to go to the bathroom
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:32,703	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	We had flushing toilets
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:36,031	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	We had some lights not a lot
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:36,799	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:38,847	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	We can still see all the stars at night
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,383	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Without any problem whatsoever
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:42,431	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	We had a lot of things
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,455	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	That would not Marcus
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:44,735	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	As slums
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:48,831	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But because Chavez Ravine was officially designated a slum
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:53,951	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	City Housing Authority was able to use eminent domain to clear the land for the housing project
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:58,047	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Property-owning residents were offered payment for their homes
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,839	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Which was Far Below market value
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:03,167	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And it's debatable whether you could even call it an offer
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:06,239	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Carol remembers when a man named Frank Wilkinson
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,775	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Who was in charge of the housing project
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:08,799	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Keep the house
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:11,615	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I remember when the actual knock on the door came
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,151	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Anda
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:15,967	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	He wasn't that congenial he wasn't really that nice
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:17,759	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:19,807	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Who is it Italian
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:22,879	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	He was there to tell us
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,671	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	That we have no choice
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,439	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	That was made
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:25,951	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Very clear
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,743	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	That there was no choice
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:29,279	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But we all had to move
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:36,703	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Almost everyone in Chavez Ravine ended up selling their homes and then moving to different parts of the city
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:43,615	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	By 1948 the restrictive covenants that prevented families of color from moving into other areas were ruled unconstitutional
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,383	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Nutritional
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:49,759	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	A lot of these former residents became the first Mexican and Mexican-American families in these new neighborhood
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,807	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	We moved into what was it
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:53,855	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Completely white community at the time
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:56,415	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But what was going on for me when I move there there was a lot of white
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:01,535	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Having people like me leaving because of people like me coming in
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:12,287	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Some residents were told that they would be first in line to move into the new public housing community at Chavez Ravine
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,823	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But those hopes
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:14,591	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Short-lived
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:20,223	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	In 1953 a new Los Angeles mayor named North Pole Santa office
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:22,527	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Ideological objection to the

EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:27,903	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Public housing as a communist plot
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:30,719	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Or socialist conspiracy
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:34,815	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Wholesome thought that subsidized housing for the poor it sounded like Tommy not sent
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:38,655	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And he made sure that the housing project was dead in the water
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:42,239	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The people of Chavez Ravine have been displaced
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:43,519	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	For no reason
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:47,615	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Except for a small number of people who refused to leave their homes
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:50,687	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The community of Chavez Ravine was basically gone
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:57,599	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	We would go there you know it's like oh look there's this house or this or that all they took all the flowers out of this year
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:17:00,415	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	We'll just go back and visit but it was a ghost
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,183	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Discount
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,975	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Except for a handful of people
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:07,583	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	All the stores were gone the church was gone they knocked down the school
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:11,423	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The city ended up buying land from the federal Housing Authority
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,703	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I left it undeveloped
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:16,031	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	For years while it figured out how to put the property to public use
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:18,335	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And that's where the Dodgers come back into the
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,895	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Walter O'Malley was convinced
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:23,199	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Chavez Ravine was the perfect place
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:24,479	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	To build his perfect Stadium
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:27,551	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The first it looks like it might be smooth sailing
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:30,879	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The city council approved the deal to give the land
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:31,391	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	To the Dodgers
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,183	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But as it turned out
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:38,303	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	A lot of people were opposed to the Dodger deal for reasons that had nothing to do with Chavez Ravine
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:41,375	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I didn't want the city subsidizing a private business
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,679	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Even if that business was baseball
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:44,959	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Fact
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:46,495	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The opposition was so intense
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:49,567	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	City decided to put the deal up for a referendum
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:51,615	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	This meant that the following year
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,919	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Contract would be placed on the ballot
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:57,247	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And the citizens of La would get the chance to vote on the new stadium
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:59,039	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And in the end
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:01,087	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Voters did come out in the Dodgers favor
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:02,879	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Barely
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:09,535	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But they were still the issue of the handful of remaining holdouts live in in Chavez Ravine
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:12,863	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Even though the federal Housing Authority had tried to clear the land
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:15,167	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	There were a small number of families
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:16,703	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Refuse to give up their home
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:18,751	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Those who remain
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:20,287	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Being so in protest
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,687	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	They're only about
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:30,015	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	20 families left after the federal Housing Authority tried to clear the land
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:32,831	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And they needed to be evicted in order to start
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,343	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Construction
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:37,439	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	These residents had watched their Community disappear around them

EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:42,303	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	That was their land that was their property
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:44,863	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I guess you could say that they were squatting
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:47,167	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But from their perspective
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:48,191	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	They are on that land
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:50,495	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	For 4

EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:05,855	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	What followed
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:09,183	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Was a horrific scene of a family called the arteaga's

EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:20,703	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	This was captured on camera by reporters

EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:25,567	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But it was broadcast all over the country
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:28,383	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	There are these scenes that are
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,943	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Indelibly impressed
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:36,063	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Into the living memory of Los Angeles
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:36,575	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Of

EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:44,511	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I'm a grandmother being

EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:55,519	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	When I saw
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:57,055	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Aurora Vargas
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,847	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Intellivision
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:19:59,359	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Being
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:02,431	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Forcibly taken out of her house
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,223	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I saw the house
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:05,503	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Being knocked down
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:06,783	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	That was
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:09,087	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Really that was the point where I hated the Dodge
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,135	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Because in my head
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:13,439	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	That's all I could see
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,463	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Is is
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,255	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	This wonderful
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:19,071	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Kind of Nirvana place that I grew up in
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,887	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I was sad to have left that
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,655	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Of course
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:23,679	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,215	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I saw them
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:26,239	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Knocking down
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:28,287	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And doing what they did on
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:30,079	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Live on TV
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:31,871	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I think I was
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:34,943	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Can a 15 psi under but it was pretty traumatic for
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,455	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	For me
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:41,599	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Evictions dredged up memories not just of a failed housing project years earlier
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:45,183	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	What if an entire history of racial discrimination that
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:49,791	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Latino and Chicano Americans have been experiencing in Los Angeles for decades
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:52,607	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And if you know anything about Mexican American history
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:54,911	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It is a history of Conquest
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,959	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It is a history of displacement
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,775	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And it is a history most of all
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,543	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Loveland
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,055	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Dispossession
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,591	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	So this team
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:06,175	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Really hit a nerve with a community
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:07,455	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	That had a long
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:07,967	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Suffered
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:12,575	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The indignity the pain the inconvenience
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,855	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Displacement and Landis
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:16,672	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It just hit
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:22,560	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	What happened at Chavez Ravine will always be part of the team's Legacy
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:25,120	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But it wouldn't be fair to blame all that
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,400	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	On the Dodgers
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:27,936	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The Dodgers
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:28,704	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	God blamed for this
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:30,752	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Although it wasn't the Dodgers
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:32,032	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Koovs
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:33,312	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Remove these families at
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:35,104	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	City Who removed
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,896	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	These families
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:39,200	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I think it is unfair to say that
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,736	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The Dodgers remove these
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:41,248	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	These families
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:44,064	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The the chain of events is a little different
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:46,624	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	This history is complicated
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:52,512	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It's hard to sum of all the forces and events that led to the destruction of job as ravine
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:55,072	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But the stadium has become a monument
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:58,400	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Physical reminder of the community that was the
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:59,680	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Displaced from the land
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,704	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	On which it sits
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:05,568	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Today Dodger stadium is the third oldest ballpark in baseball
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,616	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And you have to admit
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:09,152	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It's a beautiful Stadium
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:14,016	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It's symmetrical with elegant lines amazing views of the city
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:15,040	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And somehow
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:16,320	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Even a bad seat
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,344	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Still a pretty good seats
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:22,720	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	In some ways the ballpark did exactly what those politicians back in the 1950s wanted it to do
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:25,280	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The Dodgers are a Civic Institution
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:27,840	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Beloved by people throughout the city
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:33,984	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The Dodgers are even known for having one of the most diverse fan bases in Baseball thanks in large part
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:35,520	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	To La's Latino community
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:42,176	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I would have to say that that LA's Mexican-American Community is of two minds on this issue
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:48,064	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I I think many mexican-americans see the Chavez Ravine as part of a larger story
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:50,624	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Of discrimination
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:54,208	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Displacement in Southern California
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:59,840	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	On the other hand Mexican Americans are among the Dodgers biggest
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:07,008	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And that was especially true in the early 1980s with the arrival of Fernando Valenzuela
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,568	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And Fernando Mania
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:10,848	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Isn't the only reason why
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:16,480	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The Dodgers have tried to appeal to the LA Latino Community from the very beginning with
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:20,832	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Broadcasters like Jaime hurrying who's been calling games for the team in Spanish
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:26,976	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Almost as long as the Dodgers have been in LA
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:34,400	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Edward Satie on spotter Lewis
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:37,728	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Was one of the many who refused to see games at Dodger Stadium
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:41,056	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	He didn't blame the team for what happened to his community
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:44,384	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But the stadium would always be reminder of
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:45,408	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The home he used to have
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:47,200	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	His claim to fame
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:49,760	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Is that he was born where third base is at
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:52,576	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And his umbilical cord back then
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:54,624	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Would be buried wherever
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:57,184	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	You know you were born so he claims that their base
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:24:01,792	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	That every time somebody hits a triple or a homerun
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:03,840	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	He would get a pain in his stomach
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:06,144	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Because that's where his umbilical cord is very that
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:11,008	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	On the 3rd Saturday of July
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:16,128	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Former residents of Chavez Ravine get together for an annual reunions picnic in Elysian Park
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,664	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Edward's father Louis
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:20,992	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Started the tradition years ago and named the group
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:23,296	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Los Desperados meaning be uprooted
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,600	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And they don't get together out of anger
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,648	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	They're not there to protest the Dodgers
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:29,696	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It's just a bunch of friends
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,464	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Family
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:32,000	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Want to tell stories
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:33,792	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And celebrate the neighborhood
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:36,096	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But they shared beneath the ballpark
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:55,040	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	What the hell is a Dodger anyway
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:57,088	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Vivian will be back to tell us

EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:45,984	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:52,640	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:14,656	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And how we can humanize the sounds around us
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:17,472	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:18,240	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Right here
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:19,520	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	NPI fate
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:24,384	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	So I'm back in the studio with Vivien Leigh
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:26,176	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And we can talk a little bit more about the Dodgers
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:28,480	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And mainly where the name the Dodgers
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:29,248	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Comes from
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:33,344	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	So this is kinda embarrassing I am from Southern California
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:36,160	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I moved here from La so the Dodgers
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:37,952	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Have essentially been mighty
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:39,744	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	My entire life
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:43,072	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And I didn't realize until I started working on this story
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:45,376	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But I had no idea
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,144	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	What the hell is a Dodger
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:55,104	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But you've never wondered or you've never been told I've never thought about it and I never realized it.
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:57,664	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	As an action and so I just
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:02,016	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I guess I didn't really think of it either so what is a Dodger and what it what exactly are they dodging
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,808	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The name actually comes
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:08,928	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	From where the team originally started out which is Brooklyn where they were known as the Brooklyn
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:09,696	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Trolley Dodgers
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:12,512	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Used to have a lot of
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:18,912	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Trolleys that we're on the street and you had to.
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:22,496	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Buy a few nicknames for this they officially started as the Atlantic
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:25,824	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And then they were nicknamed The Brooklyn bridegrooms
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:28,128	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	For while and this was
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:29,152	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	This is so weird it's because
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:32,992	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Six or seven of the team members happen to get married around the same time
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,808	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And the nickname just stuck
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:38,624	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Wow a lot of like major league teams in the early days
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:41,440	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	They went by nicknames instead of there
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:42,464	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Official name so it kind of
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:43,488	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It changed a lot
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:49,120	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But back in the mid-1890s that's when they first started
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:52,960	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Being referred to as the trolley Dodgers thanks to a man named General Henry
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:53,472	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Slocum
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:55,008	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It's lightning sounds
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:56,032	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Vaguely Familiar
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:57,056	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But please remind
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:28:01,920	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	So if you've ever heard of the PS General Slocum disaster
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:04,224	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	That ship was named after the sky
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:09,600	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	He was a Civil War General from Atlanta and then moved to New York after the war and served in Congress
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:16,512	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And in 1891 General Slocum kind of made it his mission to modernize transportation and bring elect
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:19,840	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Electric streetcars do Brooklyn and at first the city denied this
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:26,752	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	This sounds dangerous but in 1892 Brooklyn trolley ordinance passed which
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:29,056	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Approved the conversion from horse-drawn to elect
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,384	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Was it as dangerous as
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:33,664	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	People thought it might be
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:40,064	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	100% for the standard so
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:42,112	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Charlie Rose where laid out all over the place like
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:46,464	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	In Brooklyn and Manhattan and Brooklyn Street for basically already
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:47,744	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Neither of these trolley rails
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:49,792	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	At first it seemed like a good idea to
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:51,584	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	We could go faster and you can be
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:53,120	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	How much more efficient and
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:53,632	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Clear
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:59,008	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	If you can pound that with
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:04,384	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The fact that there's pedestrians all over the streets and you're suddenly changing this technology that
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:06,432	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	People have to with that tooth very quickly
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:07,968	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It just becomes
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:12,832	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It's funny cuz when I hear the name Charlie Dodgers it actually sounds kind of cute in it
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:15,392	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But this is really like the streets were deadly
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:16,672	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	84 people all of a sudden
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,464	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Is giant cards
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:19,232	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	We're going very very fast
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:22,048	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:24,608	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	So this is pre automobile culture
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:26,400	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Are so people just weren't used to
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,936	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Looking both ways before Crossing
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:32,032	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The street and horse-drawn trolleys were not very dangerous cuz you
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:32,544	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Probably
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:36,896	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Briskly power wash Mexico
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:42,016	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	So the electric cars are going a lot faster and it was just catching people off guard and so it required
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,064	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Color.
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:45,344	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Yes
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:48,160	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Astrologer going three times fast
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:52,512	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And it was so dangerous that in
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:55,072	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	1892 the first year that they're introduced
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:55,840	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	There's five.
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:58,400	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The next year there are 51 deaths
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:03,520	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And by 1895 trolleys and already killed 107 people
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:04,800	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And injured at least
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:06,336	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	400 other people
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:09,152	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	So people are literally having to jump out of the way of these
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:13,248	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Basically like death machines
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:18,368	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	These political cartoons from around that time and they're just kind of horse
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:20,672	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Okay so
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:21,952	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Show me one near it
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:24,000	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	In the wake of a cable car
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,280	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Andaz
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:29,888	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Didn't mean to bodies on the street like have run over
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:30,912	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Crying
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:33,216	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Dark it really is
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:33,984	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:35,264	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	So what would
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:38,080	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Possess you to name a baseball team after this
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:39,872	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	The weird thing is it was
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:40,896	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	I have a compliment
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:42,688	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	So you only found Electra
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:45,760	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Search Ollie's in highly urbanized areas like New York
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:47,808	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Or Chicago so having to act
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:49,344	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Out of the way
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,392	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It made you
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:53,184	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	It was the market like a modern
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:57,536	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Cosmopolitan person and also a modern cosmopolitan
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:31:00,096	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	City so it was as good on the city was gone the purse
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:02,912	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	So at what point did the trolleys
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:08,544	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Disappearing around the 1920s which is around the time that car culture
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:10,080	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	Sure start popping up so yo
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:18,016	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	But you know that the name stuff the trolley Dodgers stuck and eventually they got shortened to the Brooklyn Dodgers
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:20,576	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	And then eventually became the Los Angeles Dodgers
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,600	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	When they moved in
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:22,112	| 342_Beneath_the_Ballpark_pt_01 |	1950s
