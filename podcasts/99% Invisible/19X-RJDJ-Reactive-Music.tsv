EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:10,239	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	And very recently
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,775	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	We got used to the idea that
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:13,567	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Music can be recorded
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:14,591	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Unfrozen in

EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:37,119	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	And those thousands of years of mutability
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:37,631	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Ended
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,959	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	But the technology of rjdj puts an end to that
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:44,031	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	The studio is actually inside
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,055	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	The iPhone

EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,199	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	When
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:52,735	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	That happens when
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:53,759	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Set delivery point
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,551	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Music
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,087	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	It's actually a studio itself
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:58,623	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Something very much
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,159	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Because
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:00,927	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	It means that
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:03,999	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	That mixed and that way freezing music

EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:05,791	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Recording
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:07,327	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	It's no longer really necessary
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,863	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	It means that you can have
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,399	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Multiple pops
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,167	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Simple ways of a
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,191	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Experiencing a piece of meat
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:13,983	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	So it's kind of like
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,519	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Worlds of music
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:22,431	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	The promise of rjdj is an unparalleled musical synchronicity with your surroundings
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:26,271	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Rather than putting on a set of headphones to block out the rest of the world
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:28,319	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Rjdj listeners.
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:34,207	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Plug into a constantly changing unique soundscape that connects them to what they're doing and where they are in the world
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:35,999	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	I imagine
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,791	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Walking around San Francisco
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:41,375	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Listening to a mashed-up composition of punk and Hip-Hop
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:44,703	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	It gives me a history of the neighborhood I'm traveling through
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:49,823	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	And the GPS will trigger a sound clip from Alfred Hitchcock's vertigo when I pass through Nob Hill
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:51,359	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Do I need to do spells this week
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,407	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	I'm having one right now
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:57,247	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Music
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:00,319	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	In the tempo of speed up as I
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:06,975	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Scary out of the way of an obnoxious bike messenger into the path of an unnoticed oncoming cable car
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:10,559	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	My sudden lack of all movement as I
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,351	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Lion the pavement while listening
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,631	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Using a harmonica
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:15,167	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Drone from the iPhone earbuds
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,215	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Which one makes beautiful
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:19,007	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	The Sirens from the paramedics
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,287	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	As they approached
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,615	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Stop
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,151	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Or you can choose your own adventure
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,831	| 19X-RJDJ-Reactive-Music |	Unless it's over this week I hope you enjoyed it
