EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,032	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And it raises the question
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:27,872	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Should we protect an ecosystem that's not purely natural
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:33,248	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	The Salton sink has not always been full of water
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:35,040	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	But it hasn't always been into either
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:41,696	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Over centuries the Meandering Colorado River would periodically flow into the sink and fill it with water
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:44,256	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And then over time the water would dry up
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:47,584	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	This cycle repeats itself every four or five hundred years or so
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:51,424	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	But when white settlers showed up in the desert in the late 1800s
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,472	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	There was no see there at all
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,008	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Just a park space

EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:11,904	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	But Frontier developers soon realize that if you brought in water you can grow crops 12 months a year under
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:12,928	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	The Desert Sun
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:14,720	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	So they said about rebranding

EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,815	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And they started by getting rid of the name
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,839	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Salton sink
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:23,423	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Well that's not a very appealing name if you're trying to sell Lots
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:27,263	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	So they thought of Imperial Valley it sounded great
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,799	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	That's not laughing

EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:34,943	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	They established a water company
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:38,783	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Which would bring water by Canal from the Colorado River
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,831	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	They said if you start a farm here
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,367	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Will bring you the water
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:44,927	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	This water came into Imperial Valley
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,719	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And water the April
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:48,255	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:51,327	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	These real estate developers sold a lot of lots

EDL	00:04:56,447	00:05:00,287	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And they had a wonderful agricultural industry going down there
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:02,335	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	For a few years anyway
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:05,407	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	In 1905 the water company cut a new canal
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:07,711	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And before they had time to reinforce it
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:10,015	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	They had a very late

EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,391	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Came through and washed out that
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:17,183	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Cut and flooded the valley
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:20,255	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Water broke through the wall of the canal

EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:27,679	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And it just kept pouring in
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:34,591	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	The federal government could not be bothered to help so the task of stopping the flow of water fell mostly to the southern

EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:49,695	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Out to the break in the die and then they just took flat car loads of

EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:42,431	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And for much of the twentieth century the runoff coming into the sea was about the same as the amount of water being

EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,871	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Like the Salton Sea on weekend
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:47,711	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	It was really a wonderful place to go for recreation when I
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:49,247	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Came in nineteen
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:52,575	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And I have memories of many
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:55,647	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Hamburger fries on the beach and swimming
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:57,951	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	But the water was great and
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:00,255	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	There was water skiing and
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:02,303	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	They had a lot of boat races across
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,327	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Send back
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,607	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And then there were the fish
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:06,911	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	The California Department of Fish and Game
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,215	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Decided to stock the sea with
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:11,007	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	With fish in order to encourage
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,775	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	More tourism
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:17,151	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Scientists at UCLA work to design an ecosystem that can handle year-round Sportfishing
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:19,199	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And they had to re-establish a hole
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:22,783	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Food chain to get the larger game fish
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:26,111	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	To survive but they started with the little brine shrimp
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:28,415	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And they brought them up from the Gulf of
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:32,767	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Baja California and the brought in the brine fish and then whatever the
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:36,351	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	8 Bryan fish came and then the next thing up the chain
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,655	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	The water was salty but not too salty
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:42,239	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And so they try to mix of freshwater and saltwater species
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:45,055	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And a lot of his work was done by biologist
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,103	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	But some of it was just
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:47,871	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Renegade fishing
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,663	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	I tried them all kinds of fish
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,943	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Find harbor seals
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:53,247	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And they survived I guess for a while back
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,295	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	That's why they didn't see any of many more

EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:07,583	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Thrived
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:09,119	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	By the 1960
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:13,215	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	The Salton Sea was one of the most popular fishing destinations
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:13,983	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	In the country
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,263	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	The marinas were
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:18,079	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Full of Boulders the marinas were full of life

EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:20,639	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Was packed there were
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,687	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	A run of cars

EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,415	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And then gave
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:39,071	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Concerts in programs on the shore of the Salton Sea
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:45,215	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	What's the place to go
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:48,287	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	There was a time when more people went to the Salton Sea then went to Yosemite
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:54,431	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	But the good life in the son didn't last all that long
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,479	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	In the 70s and 80s
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:59,295	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Mugs knocked out a lot of the infrastructure along the shore
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:04,415	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And most of the owners of the marinas on the yacht clubs decided not to rebuild
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:06,463	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Anna by then people began thinking then
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,767	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Maybe they were more issues than
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,791	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And they were aware of it

EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,327	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And they were right
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:13,119	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	One of the biggest issues
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:13,631	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	This was salinity
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:17,727	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	The water entering the Salton Sea picks up salts from the soil
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:18,751	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And those salts
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,031	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	I have nowhere to go

EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:33,343	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Every year the sea gets saltier and saltier
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,879	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Which is a natural process
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:36,159	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	That's four lakes with no Outlet

EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:44,351	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	By the 1990s most of the marinas

EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:45,631	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	To close their doors
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,423	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And a lot of people had left town
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,983	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	A rugged contingent stuck it out
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,519	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	In small Seaside towns
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,311	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	What the dream of the

EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:55,615	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Was over
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,919	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	And then in the mid-90s
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:59,199	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	The sea begin to dry up
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,735	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Remember
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:04,319	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Pretty much the only water going into the sea was from agricultural runoff
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:07,903	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	But over the years Farm to become more efficient

EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:12,767	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Reduce the runoff draining into the sea
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:15,839	| 99pi-0224-ASEAWORTHITSSALT-1 |	Then in 2003 as part of a complicated water deal
