EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:21,568	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And moving material objects was essentially

EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:37,952	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Remember every day people didn't speak Morse
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:41,280	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	So the message had to be deciphered written on a slip of paper
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:43,328	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And that it was delivered to the recipient

EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:15,584	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	But they needed to do was come up with another way to get messages across the city quickly
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:20,960	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	So if you can't send something with that newfangled electricity stuff you have to figure out a way to do it all

EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:22,399	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And to the bank with my Dad we go to the drive-thru and he put his deposit slip or whatever inside the

EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,215	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And so they were checking antics

EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,871	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Into the tube
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,407	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And then measured
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:45,919	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Soundwave
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:48,479	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And be able to figure out to Within
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:52,063	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	I guess two metres or so where the blockage was
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,087	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And then
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:54,879	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	They would be able to go under

EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,559	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	I guess it's better than what happened in
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:05,631	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	In Berlin where they just poured copious amounts of wine
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:08,191	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Into the tubes in order to unfreeze

EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:13,055	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	As exciting as all this sound electric communication evolve
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:17,407	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	You're up other Technologies like telephone and tell facts and proved that way cheaper
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:19,455	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And so off The Last Mile problem
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:23,039	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	It was another form of physical transport that put the nail in the coffin
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:26,879	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	The thing that put them out of business in the United States was

EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:32,767	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	What did it
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:36,863	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Trucks are fine and all but they just don't capture the imagination like a massive

EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:46,591	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Moline I spent a good deal of time trying to figure out what exactly it is about the tubes that leads
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,103	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Be fascinated

EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,175	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Why you mad
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,943	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Tubes are magic
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:53,503	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	I think the Inspire Wonder
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,015	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Because
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,807	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	They're alive
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:58,367	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Or it feels like there alive there
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:01,695	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Reaching out through the city they have tendrils and 10th
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:03,999	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And they breathe
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,327	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And they feel
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,095	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Much much
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:09,375	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Bigger than we are
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,727	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Inspire Wonder because
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:14,495	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	They manifest

EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:23,199	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Today when we think of communication all the ones and zeros and digital things that we move

EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,295	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	But I also
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,855	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	They felt pretty magical 2
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,623	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Two people
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:33,183	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Back then to that they were
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:35,487	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Kind of electrical and breathing connections
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:36,255	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Communication
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,559	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	You could send to handkerchief
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,351	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And send it to your lover by a Pneumatic
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,655	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And it would still smell like you
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,215	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	So I mean
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:47,519	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	We're romantic as well and I think
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:49,567	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Weather today to
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:54,687	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	So in a sense they're both alive and mechanical both high and low Tech
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:58,783	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And there's also something to be said about the Journey of a tube canister
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:02,879	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	That you can imagine it's making its way through these Underground
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,647	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Passageways
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,671	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Carrying your message
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:10,815	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And so this idea of being able to go somewhere where you wouldn't otherwise be able to go is
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,327	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	It's amazing
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,655	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Message this made that entire underworld Journey
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:17,471	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	In order to surface in the hand sub

EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,287	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	More than their widespread use
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:24,639	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	What might be the most surprising thing about pneumatic tube systems is how long they
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,151	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Stayed in you
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:28,479	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	The post pneumatic operated in Paris

EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:34,623	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Even ran over the Brooklyn Bridge until 1953
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:37,183	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And took a force of nature knock them out of Prague
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:39,743	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	The city was using them until a flood in 2002
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,559	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Lots of places
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,071	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Still use
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:45,375	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Hospitals
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,655	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Used pneumatic tube system
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,191	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And that's what
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,215	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Cuz you really can't
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,775	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Digitize tissue or medication
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:57,663	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And so the next time you find yourself in a hospital take a look because you'll find them by the nurses station

EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,415	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Pneumatic tube so that
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,439	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	It's not any

EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:14,303	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	When Molly was doing research on tubes at the New York City Public Library

EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:36,831	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And as it happens my good friend Hannah Jamal grew up there
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:43,743	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Hey how's it going nice to hear from you so I asked her about the pneumatic tubes
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,815	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	I get flustered when people ask me about the garbage
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:48,607	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Because to me

EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:53,727	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	The most fascinating thing about it

EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:11,711	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	But there

EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:38,335	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	A lot of his come true right like we have little touchscreen computers we have hand communicator
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:43,199	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	What are things that we don't have and will probably never have is
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,223	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	The Transporter
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:46,783	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	You know the thing that can disassemble something somewhere
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,575	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And reassemble it somewhere else
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:53,439	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And I wonder if that has to do with why the tubes feel both so ancient
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,231	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	And so futuristic at the same time
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:58,559	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Like it's the closest we ever got to transmitting a
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,351	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Physical object instantaneously
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:06,751	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	I think that's definitely possible that you could get something instantly
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:10,847	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	It's again that you could communicate
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:13,407	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	But you said that you could not only get it
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,175	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	But but
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,199	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	You could have that feeling
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:20,831	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Sensation or that information right away it's the Nexus of those two things
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,927	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	What is more than just information
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,975	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	The scented handkerchief that are rhymes
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,815	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	After traveling through miles of Paris underground or even

EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:41,311	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	I mean maybe that's why we keep coming back to it and maybe that's why

EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:48,991	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Actually we do need physical things and
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:51,551	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	You know we've we never did get our check
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:58,975	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	But we we do care all the more about things that are real and tangible that come to us and I think with
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:00,767	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	The pneumatic post represents
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:03,071	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	What pneumatic tubes represent
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:06,399	| 99pi_0061_aseriesoftubes_1 |	Is the possibility that that could happen
