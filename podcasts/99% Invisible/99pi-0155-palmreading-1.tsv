EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:45,632	| 99pi-0155-palmreading-1 |	The only reason the trees were there was because about 40 years ago
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,936	| 99pi-0155-palmreading-1 |	The bird flew over and pooped out fertilized
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:49,728	| 99pi-0155-palmreading-1 |	And no one ever touch
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,264	| 99pi-0155-palmreading-1 |	It's not like
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:55,360	| 99pi-0155-palmreading-1 |	They're just putting the tree up to make it look better on the freeway look at all the rest of them they look like crap
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,896	| 99pi-0155-palmreading-1 |	And that's when Brent put it together
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:03:02,528	| 99pi-0155-palmreading-1 |	A work crew doing an after-hours landscaping job in an area where they never do any work

EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,840	| 99pi-0155-palmreading-1 |	Now the reason that Brent Green was able to deduce all of this
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,888	| 99pi-0155-palmreading-1 |	Is because he is by

EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,984	| 99pi-0155-palmreading-1 |	And so he knew the worth of the trees
