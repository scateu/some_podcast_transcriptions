EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:36,863	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Sarah told me that in 2002 Elemental got a commission to build a hundred units of low-income housing
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:39,167	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	In a city in Northern Chile called
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:42,239	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	He gay and they had to deliver it on a tight budget
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,519	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	$7,500

EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:55,295	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Was the cram everyone into big block style apartment
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:56,575	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	When they
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,599	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	What about blocks
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:59,391	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	They said if you dare
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:01,439	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	To propose to block we started hangers
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,743	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Because it's the worst thing ever
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,791	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	According to Juan Ignacio cerda
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:10,399	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	The community threatened the hunger strike because an apartment block would be extremely limiting
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:15,519	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Sure they were living in a slum before but at least they had control over their own space
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:18,335	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	They can make expansion some adjustments when they wanted to
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,895	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	But with a block style housing project
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:23,711	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	They be confined to a small static space
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,479	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Which is worse
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,783	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Because you are not able to expand a house
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,831	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Into what element all came up with
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:32,671	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	We're tall rectangular houses separated by empty space
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,695	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Each unit was
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:34,719	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Just big enough
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:37,535	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Give me Chili's minimum standards for low income housing
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:41,887	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	And then residents could on their own time however they wanted
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:44,959	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Expand into the empty space adjacent to their home
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:48,799	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Element all spent the early 2000s iterating on his concept
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:54,431	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Building homes that just met the basic legal requirements for low income housing in chili
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,223	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	What was room to grow
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:59,039	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	And then in 2012 after the earthquake
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,063	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Can Constitution
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,111	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Elemental got a commission
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,135	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	To help create a new map
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:04,671	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	For the city
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,975	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Which included creating a new neighborhood
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,511	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Full of incremental building
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:11,839	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	It would be located on one of the tallest Hills in the city
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,119	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	It would be called

EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:36,479	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Lowest laid concrete on the empty side of the house to make a floor
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:39,295	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	And put up exterior walls and flooring for the second
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:39,807	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Story
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,135	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	None of them had really done construction before
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:46,719	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	But they had direction from workshops on building techniques

EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:52,863	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	The homes also come with a user manual with directions for how to expand the house
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:56,447	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Expansions can be done with standard size building materials
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:13:00,031	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	The residents don't have to pay lots of money for a custom cut pieces of lumber
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:05,663	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	So far Lewis has focused his efforts I'm just getting the house to be big enough to accommodate his family
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:08,735	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	And so inside the walls are still in painted

EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,671	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Louis knows they've got a long way to go on there
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:20,255	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	But he doesn't just see the bare walls and course floor
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:22,559	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	He sees what it all can become
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:28,191	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	If and when the Enriquez family does have tiling in

EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:34,591	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	It'll be way nicer than anything that they ever could have afforded on their own
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:39,199	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Or what they could have normally gotten through state-funded low-income housing programs
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:40,479	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	And some now

EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:02,239	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Incredible
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:08,127	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Not everyone I talk to it Via Verde was enthusiastic about having to build their own home
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:11,711	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	And some thought Elemental contractors could have done a better job
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:15,551	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	But for the most part people there seemed really happy with their homes
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:18,367	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Even people who had an expanded there's at all

EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:45,503	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Most people in Via Verde are further along with lyrics

EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:53,439	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Some residents have been opted to use their extra space to start businesses

EDL	00:14:57,535	00:15:00,863	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	If you only got from residence is that they felt invested in Via Verde
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,655	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	They like living there
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,167	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	I felt safe
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:05,215	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	It all kind of made me wonder
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,775	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Why haven't we seen this approach in the US
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:08,799	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	I don't think this could work in
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:12,127	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	There's a lot of things going on here which are
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:14,687	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Really Innovative and there's a lot of things
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,967	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Where things go wrong
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:19,807	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	This is dr. Jennifer stoloff a researcher with the consulting firm

EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,047	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Dr. stoloff is an expert at evaluating government programs
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:32,863	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Particularly those that pertain to housing
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:35,167	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	She's also an historian of public housing in the US
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:38,495	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	I told dr. stoloff about the Via Verde project
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,799	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	There's some pictures and she says yes
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:41,567	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	It does
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:43,615	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Kind of a line with the US ethos
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,639	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Pulling yourself up by your
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:46,175	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	It is very bootstrap
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:48,735	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	It's true but it's also very risky
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:51,039	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	I mean and I mean in a safe
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,063	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	The way
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:53,087	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Not just in a financial
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,111	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	It is both
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:57,439	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	First off someone could get hurt building out their house
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:16:01,279	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Which means you'd have to do with both a medical and illegal emergency
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:03,071	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	In the States you know there be
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,351	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Litigation
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,119	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Issues
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,911	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Right I mean if you
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:07,935	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	We're working
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:09,471	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Building your floor ceiling
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:10,751	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	And you fell down

EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,615	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Look for Doctor stoloff
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:21,247	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	The biggest hurdle to an incremental building project working in the US isn't a matter of safety
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,015	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Legality
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,039	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	It would be embarrassing
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:27,391	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Rights of the United States of America can only build poor people have a house

EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:33,535	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Even though in fact that might end up providing way Murphy
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:35,071	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	People with adequate housing
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:35,839	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	At the end of the day
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,399	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	But we couldn't do it it's like we lose face
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:40,447	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Because unlike Thule
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,471	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	United States
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:42,239	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Does have the money
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:45,055	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	And perhaps also unlike July
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:47,103	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	We don't like to spend money on poor people
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:51,455	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	I think everybody should be able to
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,991	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Find their own way out of poverty
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:57,343	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	And it's just not true but that is the expectation
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:58,367	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	And
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,927	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	We are not in a scarcity
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:03,487	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	And we could afford to
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:04,767	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	People and Tire
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,815	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	But by and large
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,327	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	We don't
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:10,143	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	The US it's not a matter of scarcity
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,935	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	It's a matter of values
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:14,239	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Elemental however
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:16,543	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Has come to see scarcity as a tool
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:19,359	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	A tool which Juan Ignacio cerda
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,383	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Find vital
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,919	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	I'm sure that in the states
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:28,319	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Everything have rules and controls so you don't leave room to all those new things and came up
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,087	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	From Latin word
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:32,159	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	That obviously come comes from
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,463	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	So if you had if you're doing this project
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:37,535	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Unless it's at the very last minute
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,815	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Had to go okay we're going to double your budget

EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,055	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	You still want to go
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:55,455	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	It's a good thing to deliver whole house but if you give me double the money I keep their houses it is
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:56,223	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	And I improve
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:59,551	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	With all that money the public space surrounding the house
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:00,063	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	The neighborhood
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:06,463	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Providing the infrastructure that people can't provide themselves like parks and libraries and public transit
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:09,279	| 99pi-0231-halfahouse-1 |	Is at the very root of the sites and services approach
