EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,415	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Because the shortest way
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:28,511	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	You've got to look at it on the glow
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,583	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Is a trace a direct course from New York to Paris

EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,167	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Remember Lindbergh
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:40,287	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	In the 1920s before Gander exist
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:45,663	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Newfoundland grassy Fields were the jumping off points for transatlantic Daredevil pilot

EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:50,783	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Because it was so far east
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:55,135	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	It made sense to start there if you were worried about getting across the Atlantic with enough fuel
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:58,719	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Eventually the British government which control Newfoundland

EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:04,095	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Maybe there is something to this whole air travel thing
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:09,727	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	In 1936 the British shows what was then basically a patch of woods on the Eastern side of Newfoundland
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:13,311	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	As the site for over a million square yards of runways
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:20,223	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	By the spring of 1938 the gander airport was fully operational but the massive runways were mostly on you
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,271	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	There just weren't enough

EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:49,663	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Americans and Canadians have been shipping planes over by boat
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:56,063	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	But that wasn't working out so well they were being torpedoed by the Year by German submarines
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,855	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Rare finds Denver actually making it over

EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:06,047	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And he says to get planes to the UK the British had to come up with a new idea
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:09,887	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	They would have to put up what we call a bladder inside it was a

EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:19,615	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And was called

EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:22,687	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	The first Crossing was 7 playing
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,735	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And it took place in a freezing night in November
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,295	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	The pilot had to fly in the dark
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,575	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Because lights could alert the Germans
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:31,135	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Miraculously all seven made
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,695	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	But that was just the first day
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:40,351	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Over the course of the war 20,000 planes were brought to Gander to be flown across the Atlantic for the war

EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:53,407	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	I guess it was the turning point of the war really trust for Britain

EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:18,495	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	If you live in court
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,031	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Right next to the runway
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:22,847	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	I will show you in a hundred yards or so or even closer than that
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:26,687	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And I made a hell of a lot of noise it was a those aircraft
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:30,271	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Because the gander airport started as a military operation
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:34,111	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	It wasn't until the war was over and civilian air travel began
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:37,439	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	They decided to build a separate Town away from the runway
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:43,327	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And then in the late 1950s the Canadian government built that fancy International Lounge
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:44,351	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	At the airport
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:47,935	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	In 1958 just a year before the new Lounge open
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:51,263	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Jets like the de Havilland comet in the DC 8 rent reduced
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:56,895	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	These planes could make the long Trek across the Atlantic without having to stop and refuel in Gander
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:59,455	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	But they took a while to go mainstream
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,479	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And 4 years
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:02,015	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Gander served as a stopping
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,551	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	For international travel
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,111	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	These are the Glory Days of candor
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:10,719	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	When celebrities from all over the world would wind up stopping through on their way to or from the state

EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,583	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	I'm building something small
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,119	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And much much uglier
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:52,959	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	But there was a huge outcry from architecture enthusiast
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:53,471	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Around the world
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:56,031	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Full disclosure I was one of them
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:59,871	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	In the end thanks to organizing by people like Luke
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:03,711	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	The mid-century Time Capsule that is the international Lounge was saved
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:06,527	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And Jerry cram promises it will stay that way
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:07,807	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Party words
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:12,671	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Mark my words but I'm not always going to be around either so
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:17,023	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And so as long as Jerry cram is round
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:21,375	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	The international Lounge stands as a kind of Monument to a bygone era
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:23,423	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Mine was luxurious
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:26,751	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	When you didn't have to take your shoes off to go through security
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:28,031	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	When actually
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,567	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	There was no such thing as security
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:32,639	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	When the bar in your Airport terminal
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,919	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Was open to anyone
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:35,455	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Ticket or not
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,783	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And if Sinatra cut in front of you in line
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,807	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	You just tell him
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:40,319	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Please
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:41,855	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Wichita
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:03,615	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	What do those big numbers painted on Airport runways really mean
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,431	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Kurt Kolstad will decode them for you
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,199	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Right after this
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:15,647	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Between the beats
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:17,952	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Bongs and Charter of our devices
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:21,280	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:22,560	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	If
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:28,960	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:33,056	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Another
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,592	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Technology talk to us
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,640	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	It is a creation of Sonic trap
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:39,968	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:43,552	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:45,344	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	To make them more human
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:49,184	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Turn the living room lights on
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:50,976	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:53,280	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Dim the living room lights to 50
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:53,792	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	80%
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:55,584	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:22:02,240	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:04,800	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Makes for a much more natural experience
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:06,848	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Turn the living room lights on
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:10,944	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Dim the living room lights to 50%
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:18,624	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:20,160	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	About how are sounds gay
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:21,184	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Is impacting our health
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:23,744	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And how we can humanize the sounds around us
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:27,072	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,864	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Right here on the 9th 9 p.m.
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:33,472	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	We need to talk about something
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:36,800	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Constipation abdominal pain and bloating
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:43,200	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	It's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is frustrating.
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:48,064	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Doesn't have to Define constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:51,648	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And you don't know why then it may be time to seek help
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:54,720	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Go to oh my God. Info podcast
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:59,840	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:01,120	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Oh my God. Info
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,144	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Black podcast
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:06,752	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	So a few years back the Oakland International Airport changed
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:07,776	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Two of its Runway number
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:10,592	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	27 peking 28 +
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:11,104	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	29b
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:12,128	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	30
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:16,224	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	99 guys on Kirk Kolstad lives in beautiful downtown
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:16,992	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Oakland California
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:21,344	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And he's here to explain why it was really important that they make that change
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:23,904	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	First though you have to understand how
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:24,928	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Runway numbering work
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:28,768	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Airports around the world use this Universal system
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,816	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	That's based off Earth's magnetic north
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,120	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	So basically you
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:34,144	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Figure out the
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:37,216	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Magnetic compass direction of the runway up to 360 degrees
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,264	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Then you round that off to the nearest
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:41,568	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	10 and then drop the zero at the end
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:42,336	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And and then you have your number
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,640	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	I can see you in for the sub numbers one
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,944	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	236 instead of
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:47,712	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	10
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,224	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	236
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:52,832	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	All right that's it and each one way as a complimentary number to that goes in the other tracks
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:56,160	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And that's of course I 180 degrees difference
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:59,488	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	So Runway number 18 is the flipside of wrongdoing number
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,000	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	36
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,280	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And so on sofa
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,840	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And if you see letters
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:06,144	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	That actually means there are multiple runways
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:07,168	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Running parallel to each other
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:08,704	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	So Alice for the left
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:10,240	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Are for the rain
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:13,312	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And if there's one in the middle they use letter C for a center
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:14,848	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	So
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:15,872	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	By necessity
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:18,944	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	If it was 18 L the other side would read
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,224	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	36
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:20,992	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Pixar
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:22,784	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Okay I'm going to make that don't make sense
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:25,344	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	No it's not obvious to me why they do use
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:27,136	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Compass directions rather than just
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,416	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Then bring them one two and three
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:32,512	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Will you do with all the high-tech stuff that guides plates fees.
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:35,328	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Magnetic directions serve as a kind of backups
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:39,168	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Help planes land in case something goes wrong
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:43,264	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Also make it easy for pilots on the ground to double-check that their Runway and compass
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,312	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Online before they take off
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:47,104	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	They know they're in the right place doing the right thing
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:48,640	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Do it all else fails
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:49,408	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	You can use a compass
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,712	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	It begs the question
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:52,992	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Why
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:53,760	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Do the numbers
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:54,272	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Ever change
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:56,320	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	That's the really crazy part
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:58,112	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	I knew that
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:01,952	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	The planet's magnetic poles reverse every few hundred thousand years
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:06,304	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	But they're also be smaller but significant ships going on
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:06,816	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Constantly
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:09,888	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And we tend to think of North in terms of true north
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:13,472	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	That is no single point of the top of a globe or map
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:17,824	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Compass reading of magnetic north differs from one place to the next
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:18,592	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:20,640	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	It moves around all the time too
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:22,688	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	By the flows of the Earth
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:24,224	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Molten metal outer core
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:27,040	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And when those cumulative changes are big enough
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:33,952	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Then the airports have to repaint the runways or the numbers don't make sense anymore
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:34,976	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Gradle could just be
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:38,304	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	It goes from point for 2.6 and that tips in the other direction
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,072	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Right
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:39,840	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Around 3
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:46,240	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And these ships happen even faster closer to the poles so airports that are really part of the North or really hard as a child
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:47,776	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	Actually have to make these changes more often
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:55,712	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	I just have to keep an eye on this for their own sake because if they're traveling on a plane they want to make sure these things are right
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:26:00,832	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And it turns out it's a huge project magnetic monitoring stations all around the world
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:02,624	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	And satellites that also help keep track
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:05,184	| 304_Gander_International_Airport_pt_1 |	I was actually just talked to my dad about this
