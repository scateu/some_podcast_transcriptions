EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:57,951	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Why I see you found the cow tunnel
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:03,327	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Sobran walk the story around ask the whole mess of people
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:05,631	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	And everybody's heard of the tunnel
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:09,215	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	But when they talk about the facts are never the same
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:13,311	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	But it's somewhere different and is made of different items
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:15,359	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Since it was built at a different time
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:18,687	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Brian finally circles back to Fred
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:19,711	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Princess
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:20,735	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Well
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:24,831	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Actually I never saw it it was a buddy of mine I saw it
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:28,159	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	So again that's how Brian told the story in his article
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,951	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	In 1997
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:32,767	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Sitting in his office with me in 2014
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,559	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	He told it this way
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,583	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	We were digging some test pit
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:37,119	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	For a Verizon
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	So so
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:42,495	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	You were there and digging and
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:46,079	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Right and so we dug down about five feet and then
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:46,591	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Grits
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:49,151	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Curved surface that looks like a balti
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:49,663	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Did roof
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:53,247	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	So now the story has completely changed
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,295	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	In Brian's mind
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:57,855	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	He's the one watching not Fred
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:03,743	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Not would you talk this way
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:06,815	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	For another 10 minutes before he finally stopped and said
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,095	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Wait a second
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:13,215	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Call me in the beginning of this cuz I was
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:13,727	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	I didn't
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:18,335	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	100 and even the same damn thing Fred did
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:21,407	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Let me tell you how big it is and where it goes
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:24,479	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Everyday man
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:28,575	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	I know I started doing the same damn thing this is what happened with the code tunnels
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:31,391	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	And why the truth of them is so hard to get ahold of
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:35,487	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	It's like as soon as you start to retell the story it gets loose
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,023	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	And begins to bend
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:39,071	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	It's like an instant fishtail
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,863	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Except it's about cows
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:43,423	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	And somehow the folklore of it
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:48,287	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Stretches further and further out until nobody can remember how the story started
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:55,711	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	And so when Nicola twilley wrote her first blog post in 2010 she went solely off of
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,735	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Brian's article
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:58,271	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Which uncovered nothing
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:00,319	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	And that one line in the Betty Fussell book
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:03,135	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	But around the same time she had published
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:06,463	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	A little shred of hard ish evidence popped up
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:09,023	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Cowtown a version of the Shroud of Turin
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,559	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	It's a coffee table book
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:11,839	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Called
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	New York
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,887	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	In the 19th century
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:21,055	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Send there's a picture in here that shows this is an 1877 engraving from Harper's Weekly
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:26,175	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Tunnel at 34th Street paddle being driven up through a tunnel
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,199	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Looks like a wooden tunnel
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:29,759	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	And it says tunnel from the dock
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,527	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Huh
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:35,135	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Emerging from it's almost like they're
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:39,231	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	And then they're strung up by 1 foot
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:40,767	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Samara Lee X
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,375	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	But
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,911	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Wow so that seems to be
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,191	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Evidentiary
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,727	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Right there is a picture of a towel tunnel
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,799	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	I don't know about that though
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:54,847	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	This is Nicholas
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,383	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	You can actually see
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Where the tunnel is emerging from a tunnel
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:02,527	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Photograph
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:06,111	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	But there's a cow emerging from a
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:11,487	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Well and the cowboy in the picture is about 2 foot tall so there's all kinds of problems
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,279	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	The cow is about 10 times
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,047	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Decisive
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,607	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	I wasn't I wasn't buying it
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,143	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	I needed more
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:22,751	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	I needed more so she did what she says bloggers like her and never do
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,031	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	When they're researching a topic
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,823	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	She called people
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:27,615	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	I talked to
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:30,687	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Cities director of archaeology and cheese
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,223	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Without this
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,783	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	As if she'd be nice
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:37,343	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Christian Bale
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,111	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	12
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:44,255	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	After I read about them the first time that sort of bubbled up on a few blogs and I suppose those people were actually
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:52,191	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Probably what she said to me which was
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:59,103	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	No evidence never found anything
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:04,479	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Historic preservation very nice
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:07,039	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Very apologetic sorry
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,903	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	I am about
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:15,231	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Really fully write these things off as a myth
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,535	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	When I decide
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:19,583	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	To call CC Saunders
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:23,935	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Of historical perspectives Incorporated which basically consults with big projects
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:29,823	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Construction projects in that sort of thing and they gauge whether there is historical archaeological
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,871	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Important stuff
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:32,895	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	In the area
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:39,295	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	That's my she called me back
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,063	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Fairy
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:40,831	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	On the way back
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:41,599	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Vim Staten Island
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,415	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Of course they exist
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:49,791	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Yes no question don't be ridiculous I'll send you the blueprints
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:50,815	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Soon as I get home
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:57,215	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	After all this there are blueprints yeah original at this point but I have
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:59,263	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	What's the copy that we put into our
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:05,407	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Report that we did when we study the Reconstruction of Route 9A otherwise known as the West Side Highway
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:08,991	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Is narcisi Saunders
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,039	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	I have never been CC Saunders
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,087	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	With her for about 20
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:16,927	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	CC Sertraline was basically the count
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,951	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Alien
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,463	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	At their shop
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:24,863	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Back in 1991 the state contracted historical perspectives to do and historical study
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:28,191	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Of that former meat packing area at 12th Avenue in the upper 30s
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:34,847	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	And Faline wrote the report so she did a ton of research
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:39,455	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Look at all these old maps and documents and built this picture
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:43,551	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	The kinds of structures that used to be a long 12th Avenue there

EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,159	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Stop right there
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:53,535	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	On the very very last page of the report about that meat packing area
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:57,631	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Sure will and underground cattle pass
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:04,543	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Was built and used by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company it extended about 200 feet beneath 12th Avenue in the shore
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:07,615	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Flying to the block between West 38th and West 39th Street
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:10,943	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Pardon my bad grammar back in 1991
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:16,319	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	It was not meant to say that it was 200 feet beneath 12th Avenue it was 200 ft long
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:17,599	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	And beneath the Avenue
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,159	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Misplaced modifier
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:23,231	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	The tunnel was built in 1932 and may still be present
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:26,815	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Wait a minute 1932
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,119	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Yeah and
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:33,471	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Yeah that was during when all of this construction is going on in the city
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:35,775	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Are being planned at least new Bridges and tunnels
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:42,687	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Again like 200
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,735	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Feet from the dock to the slaughterhouse
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,271	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	So that New York could
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:48,319	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	At the end of a long day of building
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:49,855	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Ham steak for dinner
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,391	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	So how big was it
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:55,231	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	9 feet wide by 7 feet high
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:58,047	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	And that was ascertained from a New York Department of Doc

EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:03,935	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Yes
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:04,447	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	So
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:05,983	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Maxine
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,263	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Pretty Ironclad
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:13,151	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Well yeah I would say it was an ironclad concrete pad but yes
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:19,295	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	To actually see a blueprint
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,575	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	It was sort of it
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:22,623	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	You know a lottery winning
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,135	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Moment
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,671	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	I felt pretty good
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:28,511	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	The design

EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,071	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Exactly
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,119	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Exactly having a really I mean I was
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,423	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	I was pretty stoked
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,239	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	What did you say
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:42,591	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Well really I thought I have to go out there and
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,407	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	So where
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,455	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Roughly
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,503	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Roughly here
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:52,831	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	After looking over the blueprints Nicola
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:56,415	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Pause for a minute to write up a new blog post
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:58,463	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	To the area where the tunnel had been
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:15:59,487	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	See if
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:03,071	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Any sign of it any hope
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,863	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	That it might still exist
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:07,167	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Some people swear it's intact
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,983	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	That the tunnels in tax
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,591	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Wait we might be able

EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:21,247	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	They've been one of the buildings without having to excavate the roadway at

EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:31,743	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	When you think about the Lincoln Tunnel that were standing
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:32,767	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Right next to you
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,303	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Most likely
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:37,119	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	If Cal tunnel there was once upon a time
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:40,191	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	It was pulverized and all of that construction
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:41,471	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	And any void
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:43,775	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Westfield in
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:47,615	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	You have a blueprint of it so how do you know if I'd be built inside of it
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:50,943	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Plan on other maps that were made though the area later
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:57,087	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Oh I see in and it's in the 1953 Port series from the Army Corps of Engineers
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,647	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Which I don't really know what that means but there is
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:06,559	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	And actually in a research that I Nicholas found evidence for that other tunnel at 34th Street
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:08,351	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	It was in the Harper's Weekly picture
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:11,935	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	There's this New York Times article from 1875 that talks about it
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,215	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	It says
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:18,079	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	There runs a tunnel under 12th Avenue where the animals are brought into the shambles
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:19,359	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	In fact
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:23,967	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Cattle are never seen by the outside public from the time of their Landing
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:25,759	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Until they are converted into beef

EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:48,287	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	And apparently
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:53,151	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Of historic importance in Boston that also exist
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:55,967	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Oh contraire Nicola twilley
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:57,503	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Oh contraire
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,807	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	So wait the train
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,087	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Right now
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:08,255	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Is going through what used to be a tunnel
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:11,071	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	We do know whether the couch handle in Boston accept

EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:16,447	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	I stood on a bridge above it with Charlie Sullivan
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:19,007	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	By the way the way this neighborhood developed
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:20,543	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	The cattle market
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:23,615	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Was established over on Massachusetts Avenue
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:27,199	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Quite early before the railroad came through
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:30,783	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Farmers would drive the cows here
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,063	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Over the road
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:35,647	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Charlie's the head of the Cambridge historical Commission
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:38,719	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	He says it used to be Cowpens on either side of this bridge
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,743	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Walden Street Bridge
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,791	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Accountable
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:44,351	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Polly Walden Street cattle pass was built
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:49,727	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	So farmers could drive the cows from one pen to another
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,007	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	So
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:51,519	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Because they might
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:53,311	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Because they would get loose
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:54,335	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Like Lucy
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,783	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Cows that have minds of Their Own
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,063	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Anyway
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:06,879	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Viscount tunnel is now on the national register
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,159	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Of historic places
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:10,207	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	But other than a plaque that mentions it
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:13,535	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	You never know it was tucked underneath the railroad bridge
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:17,887	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Off-limits to the public next to an active rail line which is fenced off
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,935	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	So that people don't get hit by trains
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:25,311	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	So in short the commission preserve the structure that no one can see who has any access to
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,079	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Correct
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:28,639	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	The only way is to hop try to hop that fence
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:29,151	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	You want to do that
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:32,479	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Define it would be fun interesting way to spend the morning
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:33,503	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	I'm not sure
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:35,295	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	I'm able to do it
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,111	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	So
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:42,975	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Feel free please tell me that you have two hands without him please tell me that you have to fence without him
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,743	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	Sound too
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:49,119	| 99pi-0115-cowtunnel-1 |	So when Charlie was well out of sight and couldn't be accused of aiding and abetting
