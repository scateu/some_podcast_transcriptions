EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:01,760	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And that sound along with many other cartoon sounds remains constant

EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,728	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And therefore
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:24,544	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Sound doesn't have to obey those laws either

EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:18,559	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	My first job in sound was at Hanna-Barbera studios in their Sound Apartments
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:21,631	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	I started as a track reader
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:26,239	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Which is a subset of sound editing where

EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:43,903	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	That led to subsequent promotions to becoming a sound effects editor
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,463	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	In that department to Hanna Barbera
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:51,839	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And an apprenticeship with a number of really amazingly gifted sound editors
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,655	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Back then this was 1976
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,959	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	I didn't know anyone

EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:04,639	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	But I would argue that everything that we were doing it Hanna-Barbera was every bit as

EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:04,191	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Musical instruments were used to make the effects because they were easy to find

EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:09,471	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	You can get an idea of how effects and music can come together
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:28,159	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	The sounds for Porky's Hare hunt were created by an editor named treg Brown
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:30,719	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Treadworks on Looney Tunes for decades
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:34,303	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Created many of the iconic cartoon sounds we still know today
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:42,239	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Once we divorce ourselves from the need to record live to picture
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,031	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Craighead the
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:46,335	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Fundamental understanding of
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:49,919	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	How to decontextualized the sound how to take the sound
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:53,503	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Your finger in a coke bottle
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:56,063	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And make that the sound of the Roadrunner tongue flip
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:02,207	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Why the sound of an inertia starter the sound
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:06,303	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Of this motor that makes a biplane engine start
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:09,119	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Why that's the sound of a spinning Tasmanian devil
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,223	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	He learned
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,783	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	A genius at
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,575	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Taking sound out of one contest
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,599	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Placing them in another
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:33,951	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And that's what made him so amazing and when you listen to
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,719	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Does
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,743	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Looney Tunes shorts
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:38,047	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	There isn't a lot of
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,583	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Cartoons
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,863	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Is there is not a lot of
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,399	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Comedic sound
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,703	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	It's all blood in his ability to
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:46,751	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Take the sound from somewhere else
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,799	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And put it where it didn't belong
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:52,127	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Creating this bizarre juxtaposition that made it funny
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,431	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Has anybody
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,223	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Better than he was at that
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,807	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Around the same time Shrek was working at Warner Brothers
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:04,927	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	William Hanna and Joseph Barbera we're creating the Tom and Jerry cartoons at MGM
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:05,951	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Marc's mentor
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:06,719	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Greg Watson
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:09,535	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	What's the sound editor on those early Tom and Jerry cartoons
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,839	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	When I met him is he was in a 6
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:17,727	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Late in his career but immensely proud to be still working in cartoon and he still
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,519	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	So I deserve an art form
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,799	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Something is very proud of
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,615	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	He would never take credit
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,919	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	For anything unless I asked him
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:30,015	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Greg where did this come from and he said oh I remember back in
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:30,783	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	You know
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,831	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	51 1
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:39,231	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Bill did this one funny scene with Jerry and we needed a funny sound and we thought it would be good to do
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:39,743	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Do this
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:41,279	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	He was a man that was
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,839	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Thrilled to be a part of the process
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:54,335	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Bill Hanna and Joseph Barbera eventually created their own studio and during their 30 years of making cartoons they free
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:56,127	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Created a massive library of
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,151	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Totally classic
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:57,663	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Sex sounds
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,199	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	I think they're unique
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:01,247	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	At least because
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,527	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Of their own Merit
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,551	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	They're just
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:04,319	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Silly
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:05,855	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	So many of them
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,415	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Even out of the context of the cartoon
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:11,231	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Just sound like that's just the silliest thing I've ever heard
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:17,119	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	But then within the context of the cartoons in the way that they were used in the life that they brought
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:19,167	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	To those cartoons
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,703	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	They just get better
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:23,007	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Basking in the Limelight of the animation
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:26,591	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	The sound is pretty silly on its own
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:34,015	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Now imagine Tom hanging from his whiskers in the unavoidable fall as each one is plucked from his cheeks
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:45,791	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	There were hundreds of familiar sounds like this created at Hanna-Barbera Studios
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:49,119	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	They had such a signature quality to themselves
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:51,679	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	It made them stand out as a unique piece of
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,959	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Quality artwork
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:54,751	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Sonic artwork
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,543	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	In the 1960
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:58,847	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Hanna-Barbera started selling their Sound Library
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:02,943	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Other production companies like Warner Brothers use these sounds to this day
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:09,087	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	The popularity of the Hanna-Barbera Sound Library has given cartoons and almost Universal sound language
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:11,391	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	But Mark feels some sounds are overused
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:15,999	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	I was on a one-man campaign to eradicate
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,535	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Head take
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:18,815	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	It was this
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:23,679	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Name noise that was again I think a recording accident
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:26,751	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	That you use whatever a character
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:29,567	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Allison caught themselves in the midst of
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:32,383	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Thinking or experiencing something bizarre
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,919	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And it was way overused
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:37,759	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And did you ever notice how it sounds when a cartoon character runs
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,343	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Mark's not a fan of that one either
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:44,415	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	That running sound was called blob
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:44,927	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Gallup
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:48,255	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And again a sound that
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:52,607	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Was I felt overusing I I tried to not use it
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:57,727	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	As often as I could it's a logical but I tried not to use it as often as possible
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,775	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	It's a testament to its effectiveness
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:03,103	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Even in 1976 I was
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:05,151	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Turning into an elitist I suppose
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,175	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Embarrassing
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:10,271	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Of course there are plenty of sounds that Mark loves
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,807	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Like tiptoeing xylophone
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:17,183	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Oh that's
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:19,999	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Classic sound I have actually used
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:22,047	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	That sound
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:27,167	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	I did the two Flintstone live-action movies and I did use it in that because
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:31,007	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	That was a sound that Brian Levant the director and I just loved
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:33,567	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	We just couldn't avoid using that
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:39,711	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	My favorite was The Jetsons spaceship
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:51,487	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And I never found out what those were made from a tried to deconstruct them
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:55,839	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	I asked around the studio if they know who made them and nobody knew
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:58,655	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	But that sound always brings a smile to my face
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,943	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Some of these old techniques have been lost
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:14,015	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	But remember this was a busy Studio
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:17,855	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And everyone was focused on getting the work done on time and getting cartoons on air
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:22,207	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	It was real machine it always started with track reading
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,743	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	This is ballpoint
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:24,255	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Pun
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:25,535	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Line 1
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,839	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Good evening ladies and gentlemen
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,887	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Which is to say
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:35,007	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	The voices would be assembled in a studio with a script and storyboard
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:37,567	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	The director of that show would walk
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:41,407	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	The talent through the recording session so that you captured all the voices
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:46,015	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Speaking all the lines that you needed for that particular episode
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,063	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Watch Supernanny
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:49,855	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:55,487	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Then the animators would go off and then draw the characters doing these things
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:15:01,119	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And a month later all the animation would come back and short rolls of completed theme
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:05,727	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Then we in the editorial Department assemble them in their storyboard order
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,519	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And then cut them down to sheol
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:11,615	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Anomatic in between like we have in live action
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:13,151	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Weed assemble a show
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,175	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And then cuts down to it
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:23,391	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	When Mark was working with Hanna-Barbera they didn't have a department dedicated to creating new sounds
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:26,975	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	If you wanted an effect that wasn't in the library. To find himself
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:28,511	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	You would just
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:30,047	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Kind of on your own
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:32,863	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	I was the most Adventures especially for
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:35,679	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Super Friends I would go across the hall
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:39,519	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Talk to the two composers of Paul to court and Hoyt Curtin
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:44,639	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And ask them for musical sounds and especially synthesizer sound so they would give me
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,407	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Long
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,431	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Recording
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,455	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Stretches are good
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:49,759	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Weird noises they make with their synthesizers
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:52,319	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And they would always be used as
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:54,367	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Science fiction components if I had a
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,391	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Beijing Opera
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:57,439	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Flying Saucer in an episode
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:16:00,511	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	That's what I use the electronic sounds for because that felt
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,023	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Futuristic
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:08,191	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Efmark couldn't find the sound he wanted
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:09,471	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Create it
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:11,007	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Even if he had to use his own voice
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:17,407	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	If you can't find it you do it with your voice it's the easiest tool to manipulate you have total control over it
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:22,783	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	I use it for creatures and animals and funny noises
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:26,367	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	I did a lot of Gremlins voices for the Gremlins movies
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:38,655	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	It's just something where you feel the character inside of yourself and you think
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,935	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	I can do this better
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:41,983	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And you just do it
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:46,079	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Mark also went on to work on some of the most classic animated films

EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:01,695	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And The Lion King
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:16,031	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	March experiences with animated films were different from the grind of televised cartoons
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:18,591	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	If nothing else
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:19,871	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	You get much better
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,151	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Schedules
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,943	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	We usually get
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,991	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	The time to design
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:29,087	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And create something that no one's ever heard before
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:31,391	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Another sort of unique distinction is that
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:33,439	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	You have the option
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,719	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	To create sound
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:35,743	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	First
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:39,583	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And then have animation be done to what you did
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:43,935	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	It's not that often that we get to actually drive the in
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:45,215	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And on the
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:49,567	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Disney animated films in the Pixar films in the DreamWorks films and others
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:55,199	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	They're smart enough to know the value of sound and how it can be the inspiration to the artist
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:58,783	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	To draw something they might not otherwise have drawn
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:01,343	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	For example in Beauty and the Beast
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:03,903	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Belle's dad was this inventor Aeneid built that

EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:09,279	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	That was a sound that we made before animation
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:22,335	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	The song
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:29,759	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	That's just pure design that's when you get to let your imagination run while you can see a picture
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:31,295	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Storyboard and then
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:37,695	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	You just get to dream up what it might sound like and that's just gold for sound designer when you should've allowed to do
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,719	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Design unfettered
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:51,775	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	With all the cable channels in streaming services available today there's more animation than ever before
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,823	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	How does sound design work
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:19:00,223	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	In modern cartoons in which iconic sounds are still used today we'll get to all of that when 20,000

EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,992	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	There's a perfectly logical explanation
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:43,040	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And The Boondocks for Sony
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:51,232	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Heather is an expert in modern cartoon sound design
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:58,144	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Cartoon sound effects are different from live-action sound effects because would live action you start with production sad you record
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:02,496	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Burning a picture in the recording the audio at the same time
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,032	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Street you have cars going by
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:10,176	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Was it a cartoon if you were doing a street seeing all I get is dialog it's just the actors were recorded
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:16,576	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Get to start with a blank slate I don't have to try to hide production backgrounds I get to get the dialogue and I get to create a word
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:17,088	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Roll around it
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:21,952	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Call the best thing and the worst thing at the same time to work in a cartoon because
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:27,328	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	You're not trying to hide anything but you have nothing to start with so in your head you have to think what was the sound like
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:34,752	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Much like marks time at Hanna-Barbera Heather gets a fully animated show and often add sound effects from a ready-made Library
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:35,520	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Sound
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:38,592	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	This includes many from the Hanna-Barbera and Warner Brothers Library
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:40,640	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Dear are some of her favorites
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:43,712	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Call the tooth sunk sound effects
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:47,040	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Everybody knows how this sounds like it's called but is that
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:49,856	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Get your head stuck in a jar
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:56,256	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	So clearly conveys my head is stuck in his jar it's not coming out again
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,816	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Elsa
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:03,680	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	I'm using the phone all the time
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:11,872	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	I think I'm just persisted in everybody is because I said language that we've started to understand
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:14,944	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Blake's you kind of expect to hear that
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:18,784	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And of course Heather uses the falling whistle
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:25,952	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	I think in our side effects Library it's called bomb drop but it's the same thing
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:28,256	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	That's another piece of the language that everybody knows
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:33,632	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And some of the show she works on or more realistic
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:38,240	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Heather wants us to hear the sounds of the characters moving around interacting with their world
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,520	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Kind of like a live-action movie
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,056	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	The Foley Department
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,872	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Really brings the shuttle life they record
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:47,712	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Things characters
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:49,504	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Call props
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:56,160	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	They do more of the smaller sounds and it's great to have fully doing that still alive because then you're not hearing the same
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:58,720	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Footsteps over and over they really make it sound more real
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,584	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And just like in the past
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:06,144	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	If you can't find a sound you have to make it
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:12,544	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Stranger things I've actually recorded it done myself for a sound effect is we had a bit in robot and monster with everyone
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:17,152	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	I was in a crowded restaurant so it's supposed to be this crowd of people gagging and grossed out by something
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:20,480	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	My library
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:22,528	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	So I grabbed a bunch of people around the office
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:25,344	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And we recorded ourselves gagging and lots of different ways
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:43,520	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Sometimes layering multiple sounds together is the best way to create something new
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:47,616	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Combination that you might expect
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:54,016	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Animals in engines is a really great one animal Roars under engines growls it really kind of brings
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:54,784	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Vehicle to life
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:56,832	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	A lot of shows do it
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:25:00,672	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Star Wars the Tie fighters are some growls under there as they go by
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,952	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Actually love
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,328	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	It's fantastic
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,096	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Inspiration
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:14,496	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Another option Heather has is to take a classic Library sound and change its pitch to make a new effect
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:16,288	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Take this cartoon boing sound effect
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:19,872	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	She can pitch that sound up
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:20,384	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Or down
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,944	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Other uses a lot
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:26,016	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Classic non-literal sounds while working on car
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:26,784	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Cartoons
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:30,112	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	But some Modern cartoons are more realistic than slapstick
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:32,160	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Our choices really depend on the show
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:37,536	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Should I get a new show the show the clients come in
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:39,328	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Get together
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:45,728	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Talk about the overall feel of the show I cuz it going to be kind of a realistic show
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:48,544	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Fairly OddParents
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:54,944	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Fairly Odd Parents taught me how to speak cartoon
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,736	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Nothing without the appropriate protective gear
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:26:00,576	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	It's just nonstop cartoon cartoon cartoon
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:04,672	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Where's the Bulldog Spirit it feels more like you're making a movie with horses
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:06,464	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Outlook Fields with girls
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:07,744	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	What's my boy
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:09,280	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Remember me from the Train
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:18,496	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Because Spirit riding free has more natural sounds than a cartoon like Fairly Odd Parents
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:20,032	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Heather needed some new sounds
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:25,152	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	We got a whole new horse library because in that show there's three characters who are horses
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:31,552	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	And each of the different personalities we had to find kind of different vocals for each of the horses
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:40,768	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	But even Spirit riding free still sometimes needs a dose of the vintage cartoon sounds
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:50,496	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	A lot of times people will come in with their show and say I don't want to use his old Hanna-Barbera sounds I want to do something completely different
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:55,360	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	But they kind of animated the traditional way so when you put new sounds today
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:59,712	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Feels wrong and a lot of times go back to using the older sound effects
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,648	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	When it comes to cartoon sound design
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:11,488	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Mark and Heather both agree that the medium pushes the boundaries
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,256	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Creativity
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:14,304	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Characters
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:16,352	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Stretch a naturally
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,632	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Out of their body shape
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:23,264	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Those are just the simplest examples of visually what's happening with these characters so
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:24,288	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	In a way
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:25,312	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	It gives you
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:26,592	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Permission

EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:36,064	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Working for animation cuz I'd like to build the world with sound from the ground up
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:41,440	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	The best part is you're designing a world from the world that no one's ever heard before
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:46,560	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	Sound design for the process for animation cuz there's no

EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:17,024	| 345_Classic_Cartoon_Sound_Effects_pt_01 |	That gives all of us purpose
