EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:32,672	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	I am walking down hundreds
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:34,976	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Towards Manhattan Avenue
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:38,560	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	I can see the building and
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:41,632	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	That's producer Jessica Miller
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:43,680	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Wandering around her old neighborhood
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:45,728	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:48,800	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	So you can see on the back of the tower there's like a smokestack
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:51,872	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Or at least the remnant of the smokestack
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:57,760	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Just used to live near Central Park and she's been walking by this building and wondering about it for a long time
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:04,416	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	So she met up with Jim ratzenberger who's done some writing about the building for the New York Times
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:09,536	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The address of the building is 455 Central Park West
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,816	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And it looks like
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:11,328	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The castle
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:14,656	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Huge it takes up the whole East End of the block
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:16,704	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	It's made up of red brick
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:19,008	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	What does intricate Stone trim and it's got
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:20,800	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Five or so large cylindrical
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:21,568	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Cool turrets
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:22,336	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Silver cones on
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:24,896	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Gigantic gigantic
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,688	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	I was going to say ginormous
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:31,296	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Building looks like something out of a fairy tale
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:37,696	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Until like Rapunzel could let down her hair through one of the windows for some knight in shining armor
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:40,000	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Bro just wandered over from Central Park
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:45,376	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	What I found out is that this building's past is not very fairytale like
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:45,888	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	At all
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:49,728	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	You want to let just take a walk around the building and see what we see
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:54,080	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	I saw it coming up around the side there are these things that look like
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,360	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Smokestack
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:58,944	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Kind of off of this Factor
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:01,760	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Maine Smoke Stack has been torn down
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,296	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And it was
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:06,624	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Part of the crematorium where they used to burn bodies
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,440	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Well that took a dark turn
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:16,352	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	So the building has been renovated but when it was built in 1887 it was the country's first hospital
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:17,376	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Devoted solely to the
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,144	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The treatment of cancer
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:21,472	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And they weren't very good at treating cancer yet
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:21,984	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	So
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:24,032	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The crematorium Smoke Stack
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,824	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	It was smoking pretty often
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,920	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The old castle-like building
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:31,456	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	At 4:55 Central
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:33,504	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Carquest can actually tell us a lot about
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:35,040	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The history of cancer and the
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:36,064	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	History of Hospital

EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:46,048	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	It's the late 1800s and people seem to know that cancer starts as a tumor and that sometimes the tumor

EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:53,472	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	A lot of hospitals in the US don't even want to treat cancer patients
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:56,800	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Some people fear the disease they thought it was contagious
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:58,592	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Some doctors thought it was contagious
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,360	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And also
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:01,408	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	There's a lot of stigma by having the
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:03,456	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	That's william shatner
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:07,808	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	She's a clinical associate professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,600	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And she's writing a book about cancer awareness
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:16,512	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	On top of misconceptions about cancer being contagious there was another reason that hospitals might have hesitated
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:17,791	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Today cancer patients
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:18,815	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	At the time
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:21,119	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	They had to publish their death rates
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:24,191	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	So they turn away patients who are likely to skew the numbers
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:30,847	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	This is why you had tuberculosis hospitals and other specialty hospitals for diseases that were particularly deadly
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:34,175	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	In the late 1800s Europe was a bit ahead of the US
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:34,687	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	In terms of cancer
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:37,503	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	During and after the Civil War
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:41,599	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Patients in the United States who had money or could afford to go to Europe
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,391	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	What do so for care
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:44,159	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,439	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Doctors from the United
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:49,791	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	States who then in it for the most part had minimal education would go to Europe
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:52,607	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Study science and pathology and surgery
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:56,703	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	One such man was J Marion Sims
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:05:00,543	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Sims went to Europe and learned a few surgical techniques for removing cancer
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:04,895	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	He wanted to bring this knowledge back to the US where he had worked previously
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,943	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	New York Women's Hospital
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:10,271	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And then in 1874 the hospital decided
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,551	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	They wouldn't let women with
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:14,367	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	For all the reasons we
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:14,879	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	You just talked about
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:17,695	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	It was two deadly they thought it might be
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:18,207	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Contagious
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,511	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	So in 1884
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:26,399	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Simple interest including Elizabeth Cullum who lost her son to cancer and later died from the disease or so
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:28,191	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Broke ground on what would become
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:31,775	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The first hospital exclusively devoted to Cancer Care
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:36,383	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	It opened in 1887 and was designed by architect of Charles hate
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:40,223	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Earlier I talked about the hospital looking like a castle
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:40,735	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	From a fairytale
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:42,783	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And it turns out that was a
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,575	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Pretty common style for hospitals
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:49,695	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	They look like like castles they look like aristocratic mansions
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:52,511	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And we see in the architecture that they
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,023	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	They have
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:59,167	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Deck the walls they have gate houses they have elaborate entry sometimes
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:05:59,679	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Tourette's
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,471	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	They have
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:02,495	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	All the trappings
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:06,335	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	A very very wealthy neighborhood they're very domestic
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:07,871	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	In their
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:10,687	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	That's Anne-Marie Adam
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:12,223	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	I'm sorry I'm Ann-Marie Adams
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:15,295	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	I'm director of the School of Architecture at McGill University
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:22,463	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	She's also written about hospitals from the time. And she says that in the late 1800s hospitals were chair
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:25,023	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Charitable institutions run by wealthy philanthropist
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,815	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Where poor people went for care
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:30,655	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Rich people still mostly receive Care at home
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,959	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	But Hospital administrators wanted to change that

EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,079	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	People
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,359	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	To come to the hospital
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:47,295	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	1887 the first cancer hospital opened its doors to both paying and non-paying patients with can
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:51,391	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And it tried hard to be an inviting place for paying customers
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:52,927	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Even the food was good
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,207	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	So they had great chefs
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,487	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Part of being
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:55,999	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Competitive
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,023	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Really good food
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,071	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	People went
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,095	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The hospital dining
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,375	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	To celebrate
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:01,887	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Special occasion
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,703	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Like we might today
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,983	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Go to a hotel.
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:06,495	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Even out for
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,311	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	I saw that
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:11,103	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Changed a lot
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:17,247	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The cancer hospital for palliative care
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:21,087	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	In other words just making people comfortable in relieving pain
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:22,111	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	So
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,391	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	They had champagne parties
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:26,207	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	They took people on carriage rides in
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,511	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Park again that's Jim rosson
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,303	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Play met up with at the beginning
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:34,143	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Was a beautiful building and meant to be beautiful
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:36,447	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	So the people didn't feel like they were going off
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:36,959	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	2
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:40,799	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	A terrible place to die but rather going off to the French Countryside
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:47,199	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And the big round turrets with lots of Windows that make the building look like a castle were actually wards
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:47,711	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	That has page
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:51,295	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	But the patients were in beds around
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:52,319	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The perimeter
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,343	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And there would be
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,111	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	10 or 11.
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:58,207	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And so the doctor would come in and make his rounds from bed to bed to bed
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:03,327	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Just make sure you can really picture this the rooms were perfectly circular in about 40 feet in diameter
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:09,471	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And an aerial view of the rooms looked a bit like the face of a clock with beds around the perimeter
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:12,031	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	But the roundworms weren't just about Aesthetics
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,335	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	By having these rounded rooms
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,103	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Fewer corners
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,663	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	I was thought that you could
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,967	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Keep the hospital cleaner
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:22,783	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	You know dirt accumulates and Corners so
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,575	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Just get rid of the corners
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,111	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Kind of brilliant
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:28,159	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Another distinguishing
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:30,463	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Feature of this hospital and of others at the time
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:31,487	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Tons of
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:35,583	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Any idea was it the open window
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,119	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	What allow
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:37,887	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Fresh air
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,655	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	How to flush the
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,167	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The space between
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:40,447	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Patience
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:41,983	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And this
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:44,287	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Of course played into the idea that
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,847	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	It's sicknesses traveled in
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,359	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Bad air
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:53,503	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	This idea that sickness was spread by polluted smelly are was called the Mae eisma Theory
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,783	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	But the weird thing is
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	By the time the cancer hospital
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:09:00,415	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Was built the miasma Theory had been debunked by The Germ Theory
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,951	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Which rightly held that.
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:03,743	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Diseases spread through germs or micro
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:05,791	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The architecture just
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,583	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Haven't caught up yet
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,887	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The architectural design of a hospital does
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:11,423	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Doesn't always correspond
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,191	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Exactly
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,471	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	To the medical
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,239	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	All theories of that
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,519	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	I'm almost like
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,311	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Society is
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,079	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Hesitating
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,615	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	To fully endorse
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:26,015	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Light Airy room champagne parties
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,783	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Carriage rides
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,295	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Do the park
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:28,831	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	It all sounds
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,111	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Kind of charming
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:34,975	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Until we get to the part about how nobody had any idea what they were doing medically speaking
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:39,327	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Beyond palliative care the main treatment for cancer at the
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:39,839	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The time with surgery
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:43,167	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	But surgery for cancer was still incredibly
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:47,775	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Massive cutting of people with tumors
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:54,431	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	With the idea of removing every lymph node in their body and as much as possible it could be done won't keeping them alive
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:56,735	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Surgery was also hugely risky
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:10:01,599	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	This was before the type of antibiotic soap a lot of people die from infections after surgery
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:03,135	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	But desperate patients
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:04,415	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Play Desperate Measures
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:08,255	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	You know what the doctor said I can take this out of you and it's causing pain
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,559	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Bleeding you know
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,839	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	People would often agree
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:18,751	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The surgery is at the Cancer Hospital in New York as in other hospitals at that time were happening in an Amphitheater so that
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,543	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	That students could watch and learn
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:26,943	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	There's a show on Cinemax I watch called the Nick but graphically dramatizes he's Amphitheater surgery
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,479	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Come around that same time.
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:34,111	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	I want the students to take know the doctor Christensen is answering on the medial line just above the pubis
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:38,975	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	As you can see there is significant blood in the cavity vacuum
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:48,703	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Surgeon from this time we're doing pioneering work and patients were pioneering guinea pigs
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,983	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	We had to start somewhere
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:54,847	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	But that show makes me so so happy that I live in 21st century
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:57,151	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Agreed things were bad
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,711	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And they stayed bad for cancer patients for
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,479	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Quite a while
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,783	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	As late as 1920
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,551	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Only
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:06,367	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	15% or so of patience
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,391	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Survived
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,415	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Cancer diagnosis
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:10,719	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	For more than two years
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:13,791	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Almost everyone died so the numbers were bleak
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,815	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:17,631	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	In 1900 the numbers were even worse
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:20,447	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Which must be why they felt they needed a crematorium
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:25,311	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Decide if you were there and you can look out your window
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:30,175	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	And see the smokestack imagine looking up there and seeing smoke come out of that Smoke Stack
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,711	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	I would have been pretty awful
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:36,575	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Under that billowing smoke the New York cancer hospital soon earned a nickname
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,367	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The Bastille
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:42,207	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	It was trying to look like a French Chateau but
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:44,255	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	It ended up feeling like a French prison
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:48,095	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Which is why despite a huge demand for cancer treatment
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:50,911	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The hospital couldn't get people in the door
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:53,471	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	That is the very few people wanted to go to the New York answer
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:56,031	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Hospital and what's amazing is that
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:57,823	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Good place
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:59,871	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Struggled financially Cancer Care
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:03,455	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Before 1904 a long time after was not lucrative
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,527	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	The hospital also tried to attract
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,063	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Send funds by
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,855	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Procuring a controversial new form of
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:11,903	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Radium
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:16,255	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	For awhile around 1920 the New York cancer hospital boasted the
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:22,655	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Country single largest repository of radium
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:29,055	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Lori in 1921 in therapy
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:29,823	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Understood
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:34,175	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	It was administered by people who didn't know how to administer it be
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:37,247	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Didn't really understand it
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:40,319	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	A lot of the radiation workers doctors in nursing
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:42,367	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Themself develop cancer
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:48,767	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	It wasn't until the 1930s or so that things started to improve surgery became better the radiation
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:49,791	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	Woodworking
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:53,631	| 99pi-0132-castleonthepark-1 |	I think of the 1960s and 1970s then you have
