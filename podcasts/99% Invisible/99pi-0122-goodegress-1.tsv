EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:44,096	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	But there's one safety device

EDL	00:02:57,152	00:03:00,224	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	But it all depends on the size and purpose of the structure
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:05,856	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	In architecture and building codes do you always need a certain number of exits or means of egress

EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:08,416	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,440	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	This fire escape
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,208	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Precariously
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:12,768	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Bolted to the side of the building is
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,816	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Is one of our means of egress out of the space

EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:45,280	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	But then I bothered to read the sign with the evacuation plan for our building

EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:51,168	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	But because we are at a beautiful old brick building
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:55,776	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The fire escape is actually one of our means of egress we just speak of

EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,615	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And in the 1700s
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:33,151	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The fire did break out
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:35,199	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	There wasn't a whole lot you could do about it
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:39,551	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	But that time there were firefighters loudly
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:41,855	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And they would come and it would bring you

EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:04,127	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And then there'd be a ladder

EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:08,223	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And out and sew in a fire

EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:30,911	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	That athletic necessarily to begin with but
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:31,679	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Second of all
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,471	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	It's a fire
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:38,079	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	You know this isn't the best time to eat a like figure out
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:40,383	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	How to lower yourself on a rope
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:43,455	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Another patent proposed individual parachute
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:45,759	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	That's with a company in rubber shoes to break the fall
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,551	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	They're also these
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,343	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Big slide fire escapes
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:53,183	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	That were largely marketed to schools as both emergency devices
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:54,719	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And playground equipment
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:59,839	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	They're actually used to be a giant spiral slide to Escape The Claremont Hotel right here in Oakland
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,119	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Which
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:04,703	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Would have made that place a whole lot better lots of ideas
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:07,263	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	But by the 1870s
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:09,567	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Fire escapes begin becoming
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:12,127	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Something iron something fixed
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,663	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Out of the building
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:17,503	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Although by that point they still weren't anything great
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,015	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	They were
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:21,343	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Like a iron platform outside of a window
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:23,135	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	With straight ladders attached
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:27,231	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Or it might just be a straight ladder clamp to the wall
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:29,279	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	In some cities the external ladders
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,583	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Angled and widen to become more like stairs
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,375	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	This was an improvement
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:39,519	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	But ultimately fire escapes just didn't suffice a terrible tragedy to show this
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:42,847	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	So the asch building
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,383	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	In New York
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,711	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Was built as a locked building
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:49,247	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And its owners
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:51,039	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Representative as being
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,855	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	You know maybe for warehousing
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,439	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Not necessarily for manufacturing
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:08:01,791	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Based on its Dimensions the asch building was required to have three means of egress
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:06,143	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	But the developer insisted that the property would just be used as warehousing
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:08,447	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Two rather than three stairs
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:10,239	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	He was allowed to put into stairs
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:12,287	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And a thin fire escape
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:16,127	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Then the owner rents the top three floors of the asch building
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,687	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The Triangle Shirtwaist company
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,711	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	In March
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:21,247	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	19
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:21,759	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	11
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:25,087	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	There's a fire in the building
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,879	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	It's not know exactly how it begins
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,415	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And it is
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,439	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	It spreads
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:29,951	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Quickly
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:33,535	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The 10th floor has an exit to the roof
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:38,655	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	So many of the 10th floor workers are able to survive by taking the stairs up and
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,447	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The workers on
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:42,239	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The 8th floor
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,007	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	AR
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:47,103	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	By-and-large able to get out or we're trapped
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:50,943	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The door to the stairs opened in word and became block with bodies
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,967	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And the stairs
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:55,295	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	We're backed up with workers exiting from the floors below
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:58,111	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The workers on the 94 couldn't even get down
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Only a few workers on this floor new about the 10th floor exit and so they didn't even try to go upstairs
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:07,839	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	There was charged that one of the doors was locked
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:10,655	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And this was approved at the trial
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:11,935	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	But
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:14,751	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	I believe even if it had been
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:18,591	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	With all the people exiting from the 8th floor
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:24,223	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And the staircases were very narrow and winding there just wasn't the capacity
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:27,295	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Some workers tried to use the outside fire escape
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,343	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And it collapsed under the weight
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:34,975	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	It was from the windows of the ninth floor that many workers desperate to escape the flames and smoke
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:37,023	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Fell or jumped to their deaths
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:39,327	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	146 people lost their lives
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,119	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Right in the middle of Greenwich Village
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,911	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	There were a lot of witnesses
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,191	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	It was horrible
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,983	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	But the building
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,007	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Was fine
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:50,079	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The asch building was a fireproof building
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:53,407	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And of course it's it's still standing
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,711	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And it's now part of
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:57,247	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	New York University
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:00,575	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The asch building now called The Brown building was well-made
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,111	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Which is why at the time
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:04,159	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	No one really thought it needed an egress
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:07,487	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Exit and egress were a problem people fought for the tenement
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:08,511	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And the poor quality build
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:14,143	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The logic was if a building was first class it was in and of itself say for the occupants
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:19,007	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And then the people could just be safely locked inside of these non-combustible building
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:22,847	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The triangle fire proves that architecture couldn't protect
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,407	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	We had to protect ourselves
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:26,687	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	From Ark
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,735	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	This is when
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:32,063	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	An organization called the National Fire Protection Association
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:32,831	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Does a lot of
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,623	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Studies in thinking
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:35,903	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	You know about
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:36,671	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Egress
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And goody Grace meant getting rid of fire escapes
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,023	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	For so many reasons
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:43,071	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	They weren't commonly used
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:45,631	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	So they were often out of order and states of disrepair
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:49,727	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	In Northern climates they were covered with snow or eroded by rain
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:53,055	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And not everyone could access them like people with disabilities
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:55,359	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And the very young and the elderly
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:59,199	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And women who are hamstrung by the fashion of the time
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Women in these long skirts
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:05,087	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Might not have the presence of mind to take off their skirt could actually get out
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:10,463	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Also fire escapes are scary using some narrow rickety staircases on really tall building
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,999	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	That make you feel like you should
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:15,071	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Strap on rubber shoes in a parachute
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And if people weren't used to using fire escapes they often didn't know where they were
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,703	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	People
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:23,263	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Try to leave the way they came in you know that's
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,031	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	That's what they think
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:26,847	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And that's where Modern fire escapes come in
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,895	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	They're not bolted to the side of the building
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:30,687	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	They are the logical place
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,967	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Where you go in an emergency
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,503	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	They are the stairs
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:36,063	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Well they look like normal stairs but
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:36,831	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Really
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,367	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	They're pieces of Emergency Equipment
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:42,719	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Enclosed in fireproof walls and sealed with a self-closing door
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:45,023	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	I'm covered with sprinklers and alarms
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:45,791	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And because
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,071	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	They
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:49,119	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Work perfectly well as stairways
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,399	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	They're often
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:52,191	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The stairway
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:52,959	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	In a building
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:53,727	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	So if the
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:54,751	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The building won't have
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:57,055	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The grand stairway any longer
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,079	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	It'll have
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,871	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Lots of elevators
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,151	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:01,663	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The fire stick
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:05,503	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Goodbye opulent lobbies with sweeping grandstand
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:12,159	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	If you like to take the stairs you probably already bemoaned the fact that they are always shoved off into a tower
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:16,255	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And are very cold and Industrial no matter what the building looks like from the outside
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:18,559	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	If we want we can make them look good but most clients

EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:41,087	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	These rated Towers can be like buildings within buildings

EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:49,791	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The Freedom Tower which has this emergency Corps
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:53,631	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Which is on its own separate electrical and plumbing system
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:56,703	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	It has its own elevators and stairs
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:59,775	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	That's a logic huge he's a professor at Wesleyan University
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,567	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And I'm also a practicing architect
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:04,383	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Can I run a small firm called periphery project
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:08,479	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And part of that periphery involves doing research on architecture
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:13,343	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	He's particularly fascinated by these core structures around the fire stairs
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,623	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And these emergency
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,927	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The cores are modeled with software

EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,655	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Can simulate
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,935	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	How quickly
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:31,007	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	A floor of a building can be cleared
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:33,567	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Based on the maximum number of bodies that
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,615	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Would be allowed in the space
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,407	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	How quickly could those bodies
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:37,919	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Exit this
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,711	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	So the architect
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:41,247	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Or actually more likely the consultant
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:43,807	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Will plug in the measurements of a building
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:46,367	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	All the information about its Emergency Equipment
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,647	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The maximum number of occupy
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,927	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And basically
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,695	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Play
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:51,487	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And watch the digital people
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:51,999	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Escape the pics
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:56,607	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	A lot of agent-based modeling programs with humans
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:14:01,983	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Don't work terribly well cuz he was doing necessarily behave predictably
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:03,519	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	But in emergencies they do
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:05,567	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Given adequate signage
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:09,151	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	People will behave in predictable ways in the event of an emergency
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,687	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	So this makes sense
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:13,503	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	We've already established that in an emergency
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:16,319	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	People don't want to go places they haven't gone to before
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:18,879	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Or use devices I've never seen
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:21,951	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	You know figure out if they can catch a rope shot at them with a bow and arrow
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:27,071	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The way egress works now is in keeping with the way that we use buildings normally
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:30,143	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Even though rated Towers take up a lot of space and money
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:32,447	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And make for an unpleasant shopping experience
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:34,751	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	It's hard to argue with this solution
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,799	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Is paid off let's say
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:38,079	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Sarah again
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,615	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	2012
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,407	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	In nonresidential structures
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,711	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	There were 65 deaths
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:45,503	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	In the whole year
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:48,063	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	You don't probably more people struck by lightning
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:52,415	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Usually 28 people were struck by lightning in 2012
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:52,927	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	But still
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:57,535	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Even though each one is a tragedy 65 gas doesn't strike me as all that money
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:00,863	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	This number is already down from 2003
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:04,447	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Where they work 220 des and on his eventual Bill Dance
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:07,519	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	So these are the buildings with heavy regulations in core structure
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:12,383	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Modern Emergency Equipment in egress procedures are really helping to minimize the effects
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,151	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	The fire accident
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:15,455	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	But from an aesthetic standpoint it
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:16,735	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Almost a pity
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:19,295	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Because fire escapes are beautiful
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:25,183	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And although I'm not really thrilled at the prospect of clamoring down the fire escape outside my window
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:26,719	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	I do like to look at it
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:30,559	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Is there a fire escapes even the ones that are no longer in use
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,863	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	What is physical reminder
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:35,167	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	That we evolved past being a culture that says
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:36,959	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Here's a rope
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:38,495	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Good luck buddy
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:40,031	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	I just like seeing them
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,823	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And hope that
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,359	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	They'll be preserved
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,127	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Because
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:47,199	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	It just makes me realize how we
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:49,759	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	Kind of have to work together as a society
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:55,903	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	You have to rely on other people to put in the stairs to follow the rules for the rules to be there
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:57,439	| 99pi-0122-goodegress-1 |	And that's what makes us safe
