EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:30,624	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	My mind wanders

EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:39,584	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	I look at the exits and entrances the layout of the building how could it be done
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:41,120	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Most of the time
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:43,424	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Buildings are our friends
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:47,264	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	It's fun to recast the building as the enemy
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:50,080	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	The obstacle we have to overcome
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:56,480	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	I guess it's a good thing we made our last Kickstarter goal the puzzle of how to get the money

EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:22,848	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Oh and one of them
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:25,152	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Actually pull that off
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:26,432	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Several times
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,064	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Iced one

EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:42,304	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	So I'm alone agena number designer noticed I'm based in London my work
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:44,864	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Relates to the idea that design could be a plot
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:47,424	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	And I think while I'm fascinated
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:48,448	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Bye
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:53,824	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Is a fact that it never has to happen so you have absolute freedom to find size about whatever you want
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:57,152	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	And with this in mind Gainer set out to make her Heist
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:57,920	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Is big and calm
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,200	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Cheated as
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:02,272	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	A sort of go-big-or-go-home style
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:05,088	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	And she was interested in the interplay
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,904	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Hollywood movies about heists
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,672	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	In real life
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:15,840	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	This is really weird feedback loops that happened in Hollywood Hollywood being the intrinsic pool on everything
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:16,608	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Thing that relates
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,144	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	To the iconography of a heist
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,960	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	So of course her highest had to take
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:21,728	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Cake place in LA
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:26,080	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	There were years mostly in the 70s 80s and 90s
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:29,920	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	When La was accurately dubs the bank robbery capital
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:30,432	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	The world
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:33,760	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	A particularly bad years there were as many as
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:35,296	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	2600 bank robbery
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:39,904	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	That's roughly one robbery every 45 minutes
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:40,416	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	I've been working
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:43,744	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	People of conjecture about why this is
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:46,048	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Inner thinks it may be the pull of Hollywood
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,352	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Or the physical layout
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:48,864	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Ballet
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:52,960	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Is constructed due to the opposite of the highways
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:55,264	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	It's actually very easy to get away
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:58,848	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	As long as you're not trying to get away during rush hour
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:03,968	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	To be fair to La their bank robbery stats are way less jaw-dropping now
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:09,600	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	According to the FBI there were only 212 reported bank robberies in 2013
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,392	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	But let's get to gainers

EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:44,415	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Crashing into the government building one Wilshire
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:51,583	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	One Wilshire is a 28 story building in Downtown LA most of it is filled with computer servers in Telecommunications
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:57,983	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Equipment is the goal of is to draw crowds of pulses buying preoccupied police from what's real
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,007	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Really going on
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:04,383	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	And what's really going on is that wall every emergency responder in La is busy with
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:06,431	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	The destruction at one Wilshire

EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:17,951	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Because that's where the big money is
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:24,607	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	It's become La loan now that they're only allowed to hold $2,000 at 1 so if they there
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,143	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	For example there were 10 total
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:33,311	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Behind each cubicle you need 10 people in the OD amount that you ever get is a is a limit of $2,000 in
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,335	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Each of those cubicles
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:38,943	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Gaynor's plan was to drill large concentric circles
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:39,967	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Into the bags
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:41,759	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Fallout the vault
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:47,647	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	And then load them on a truck we could call circles that get smaller in size as you reach the vault
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,695	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Anasazi pool
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:55,839	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Pull the goods backwards it rips the building and pause so that the building could collapse on its own weight after you
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:06:00,959	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Leaving no traces or trying to diminish the amount of evidence possible
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:07,103	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Gaynor did a ton of research trying to figure out the size of the vaults the layout of the building
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:12,223	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	She was working with a group of students from the Art Center College of design in LA
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:15,551	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	And we have them ask questions in the buildings
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:19,647	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Kind of playfully where architecture students who want to find out
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:23,487	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Powerful How deep the building goes and so on
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:26,303	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	As of now she knows the sizes of all the vaults
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:32,191	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	But one V one was still trying to work out weave Comfort to the cleaner that has worked in one of the bank
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:36,287	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Entering the Vault tolls is very difficult

EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:21,855	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Read a book on screenwriting or anything
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:27,231	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	He was just a guy working in real estate that like me and apparently a lot of other people
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:30,303	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Like thinking about the best way to rob a bank
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,839	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Part of my daily commute
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:34,655	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Was that I walk for my Apartments my car a few blocks
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,191	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Walk past an empty bank
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:39,519	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Every day when I was walking past this bank that's what we're talking
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:41,055	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	My head so it was sort of like this
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:48,223	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	It was just a few minutes of my day every morning and every evening where I would end up
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:51,551	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Working on this snow soda fantasizing about this story in my mind
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:55,135	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	In fact for about 3 Years chords constructed the
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,671	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Heist in his mind
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,975	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Before he ever wrote down a word
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:01,279	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	For most of that time I don't think I ever really intended
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:02,559	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	To write a movie
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:03,583	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	It was just
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,119	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	You know just
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:05,631	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	The date
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:09,471	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	He knew he wanted his house to take place in Manhattan
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:10,751	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	But it took him awhile to
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:12,543	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	To figure out what kind of Bank
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,055	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	It would be
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,079	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	You think about it
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,871	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	The story
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:17,407	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Is
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,455	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Dependent upon me
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:22,015	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	The architecture ever if you will or this
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:25,343	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Structure as I was writing it I had to have a sense of
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,391	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Okay is this a modern banquette
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,159	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Glasgow
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,183	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Going to come see everything
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,719	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	What's going on or is it old
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Just have smaller Windows into me
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,815	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	You know sometimes we know can I only see a little
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:37,887	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Because that was going to determine how you know a lot of the action
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	In the film
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,959	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	So the fun of it the great part is that
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:45,567	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	As I'm writing it I really get to build the bank however I want it to be
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:50,943	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	The bank that gorgeous in that building cuz they classic old one high ceilings marble floors
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:57,343	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Elegant and uncomfortable in a way that big city banks used to be and it has no windows in front of the police
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:02,207	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	He's a very little idea about what's going on inside with all the bank robbers and hostages
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:07,327	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	CBS 2 News outside Manhattan Trust Bank where we have just been told by investigators
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:09,375	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	The bank has been robbed
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:14,495	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	An okay spoiler alerts ahead but the house that he designs is really clever
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:16,031	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	A group of masked robbers
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:20,895	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Enters the bank and takes everyone all of the customers and all the bank employees hostage
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:28,063	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Everybody that the robbers make all of the hostages take off their
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,855	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Clothes and put on the same outfit
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,391	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Update Robert
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,415	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Are also wearing
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:34,463	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	I kind of blue jumpsuit
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:35,231	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Like a painter would wear
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:39,583	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	I need all of you to put on one of these suits
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,351	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Chinese mask
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,655	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	So you can't tell
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,679	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Who's the hostage
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,703	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	The robber
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:47,007	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Even the hostages lose track of Who's Who
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,799	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Toward the end of the movie
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:51,615	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	The hostages and robbers all come out with their hands up
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:54,687	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	But because they're dressed exactly the same
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:56,735	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	The police have no idea
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Who was the hostage
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:58,527	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Who were the robber
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:02,623	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	They questioned everyone but they still can't figure it out
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:04,927	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	And eventually they have to let them all go
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:05,951	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Anna Bruen
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,255	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	But there was still one problem
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,559	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	It became clear to me that
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:13,887	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	As clever as it was to tie them in a dress themselves up like the hostages
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:17,727	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	They're they're still needed to be a way to steal something and get it out of
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,287	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	You know I couldn't I couldn't sneak it out
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,567	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Indiana with the house
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,079	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Messages
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,615	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	So
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,687	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	In the end I decided one of them had to stay behind
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,479	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	And
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:33,599	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	From there it became well if he stays behind he's got he has to be hiding and if he's going to be hiding
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:37,183	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	It's got to be really clever and it has to be something that is hinted at
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:40,767	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Throughout the entire movie while the robbers are in the back
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:43,071	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	They're doing something in the back room
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,095	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Building something
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:45,119	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Digging something
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,167	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	It's unclear what's going on
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,727	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	You think that maybe they're digging a tunnel
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:58,687	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	But they're actually building is a room a tiny cell with a false wall hidden behind some shelves
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,455	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	In the basement
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:10:59,967	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	At the bank
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:03,039	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	They use the building itself
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:04,319	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	As an unwitting accomplice
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:07,903	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	One of the robbers the one who actually has the stolen goods
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:10,463	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Has to stay behind until all the police are gone
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:13,023	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Until they're done Gathering evidence at the bank
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:15,839	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	He has to stay in this little room
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,119	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Burn entire week
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,911	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	You know it's it's
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:21,471	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	It's funny it's hard for me to know exactly how much
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:22,495	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	My intention actually
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:24,031	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	True but when they're
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:26,079	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	When they're hacking through the concrete floor
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:28,895	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	They're building a toilet
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:31,967	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Because of your hiding in a tiny cell for a week
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:33,759	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Well you're going to have to go
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:34,271	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Somewhere
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,319	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	And that's the thing about this high
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,623	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	It feels pretty believable
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:39,903	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	There no black box
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:42,975	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	And you know if you're watching a movie
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:45,279	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	And a bunch of crooks get to the unit get to the safe
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:50,911	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Somebody just pulled out a piece of equipment from the backpack and sticks it on the lock and the villain a lock open
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,191	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	It's called the black box
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,751	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Those don't exist in the real world they only exist
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:12:02,431	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	But even without black boxes a highly orchestrated highest with multiple players and lots of moving Parts like the
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,455	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	1 in Inside Man
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:05,247	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Is really different
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:08,575	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	From the reality of how most bank robberies take place
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,647	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	According to the FBI's own status
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,183	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Sex most Bank
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:15,487	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Properties are done by just a single person
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,535	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Who presents a note to the teller
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,559	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	And walks out
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,327	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Without a lot of fur
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:23,423	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Which is a fundamental principle of design
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:25,983	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	If you want something to work and work well
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:27,519	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Keep it

EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:42,879	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	So all of the other people I'm I'm talking to you for the show
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,671	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Designs
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,719	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Bank robberies or bank heist
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:52,607	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Kind of a creative exercise but that's not the case with you
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:55,167	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	Now that's correct
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:13:00,287	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	I have unfortunately been convicted of 26 bank robberies in three different states
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:03,871	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	A my case they called me the choir boy robber
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:10,783	| 99pi-0116-breakingthebank-1 |	The FBI gave him the same because during the robberies he would stand with his hands folded on the counter and his
