EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:29,760	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And I was very intrigued by the town for that reason

EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:58,688	| 339_The_Tunnel |	A Ruckus going on for example of sirens going down the street
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:01,248	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Everybody kind of runs out to see where the
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:03,040	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Where the cop cars are going
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,832	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And that's like the where's the meat
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:07,136	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And what what's going on it's a hubbub.
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:12,768	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Keoki pick the name because on occasion that he'd been accused of being a meatball dedal
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,792	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Meaning of nosy

EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,520	| 339_The_Tunnel |	He loved collecting bits and piece
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:25,056	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Information
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:26,080	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And asking questions
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:28,128	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Figuring out what was really going
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:31,200	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And so that's how I got
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,736	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The name for my business
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,272	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:34,784	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Stuck
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:38,368	| 339_The_Tunnel |	It's stuck in fact to this day how many years later
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:43,488	| 339_The_Tunnel |	I'll run into people that get a gas station and they'll see me and they'll yell at me in Spanish

EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:52,704	| 339_The_Tunnel |	I don't know my name but they know I had them
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:57,568	| 339_The_Tunnel |	If it's kind of perfect though because it's also where you first started to
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:59,616	| 339_The_Tunnel |	See evidence of this big
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:01,920	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Conspiracy that was going on
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:04,992	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Yeah there was things going on there that
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:08,064	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Wasn't hard to start picking up stuff
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:11,392	| 339_The_Tunnel |	So that would eventually lead karaoke
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:14,976	| 339_The_Tunnel |	To one of the biggest and strangest stories he'd ever cover
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:18,815	| 339_The_Tunnel |	In other news today something that one Customs agents called something out of James Bond
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:25,215	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The story involves the cocaine trade
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:28,543	| 339_The_Tunnel |	El Chapo Guzman has been the most Wanted Man in Mexico
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:32,383	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Marijuana cocaine meth heroin and murder are all part of his business
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:35,711	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And an incredible feat of engineering and architecture
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:37,759	| 339_The_Tunnel |	That would change the drug trade
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,271	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Forever
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:50,559	| 339_The_Tunnel |	It was 1989 when keokee first started noticing some new customers in the Juice Shop
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,863	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Guys he haven't really seen before
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,399	| 339_The_Tunnel |	They have a certain
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,167	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Swagger
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,191	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Attitude
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:58,239	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And he says they often had bodyguards
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,823	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Which is not typical for an outing to the Juice Shop
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:04,639	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Keoki describe them as Sinaloa Cowboys
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:10,783	| 339_The_Tunnel |	So just when you said you Sinaloa Cowboys would come in like what they look like what do they act
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:12,831	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Real high-end
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,343	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Cowboy boots
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:17,439	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The Levi's the leather vest that the white hats
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:18,207	| 339_The_Tunnel |	What they wear
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,999	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Pickup trucks with Sinaloa plates
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,839	| 339_The_Tunnel |	They all feel like they're Cut Above the Law
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,399	| 339_The_Tunnel |	They double Park out in front of my place
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,935	| 339_The_Tunnel |	No they didn't give
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:28,447	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Give a damn
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:33,311	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Everybody just kind of stayed away from him because they knew what was going on that these guys were
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,591	| 339_The_Tunnel |	In town for summer
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,359	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Some something
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,663	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Back in the late 80s
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:39,711	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The Sinaloa cartel wasn't quite Beast
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:43,295	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Falling dominant criminal organization it's become today
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,087	| 339_The_Tunnel |	But it was headed in that direction
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:51,487	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The cartel controlled a lot of the drug trafficking Corridor that ran through the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Sonora
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:53,791	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Then across the border into Arizona
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:57,119	| 339_The_Tunnel |	I don't update distribution points like Phoenix and Los Angeles
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:00,447	| 339_The_Tunnel |	El aprieta FL ride along that corridor
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:06,591	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Can you get suspected that these guys in his Juice Shop buying their smoothies with hundred dollar bills
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:08,127	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Were part of the cartel
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:10,175	| 339_The_Tunnel |	He began observing them
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:10,687	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Cautiously
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:11,967	| 339_The_Tunnel |	From a distance
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:15,807	| 339_The_Tunnel |	But he also wasn't above marketing to their sensibilities
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:18,111	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And the big thing we hyped with them was a
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,391	| 339_The_Tunnel |	We had drinks
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,927	| 339_The_Tunnel |	That we called AR-15
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,463	| 339_The_Tunnel |	I love that one
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:24,255	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And then we had what we had Alfalfa drink
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:26,815	| 339_The_Tunnel |	We hiked it as being real good for hangovers
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:30,911	| 339_The_Tunnel |	So they would come in and drink fresh Alfalfa mixed with pineapple or whatever
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:33,983	| 339_The_Tunnel |	You know they bought into my advertising scams you know
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,263	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And that's what they would have
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:38,079	| 339_The_Tunnel |	This keoki says is
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,615	| 339_The_Tunnel |	One of the Rules of Order.
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:44,991	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Even if the theory of trickle-down Economics doesn't really hold up in other places
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,527	| 339_The_Tunnel |	It's in the works here
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:49,855	| 339_The_Tunnel |	You're dealing with border towns and drug trafficking
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,647	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Trickle down economics
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,695	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Pictures of valid idea because
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,743	| 339_The_Tunnel |	In Mexico
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:57,023	| 339_The_Tunnel |	These guys don't hoard the money
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,303	| 339_The_Tunnel |	It gets better
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:01,375	| 339_The_Tunnel |	On stuff like big houses and fancy cars
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:04,191	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Not to mention Brides the local cops and
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,215	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Politicians
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,239	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And businesses
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,775	| 339_The_Tunnel |	It's where the narcos launder their money
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,823	| 339_The_Tunnel |	In general Kioki set
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:11,871	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Drug traffickers tend to be
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,639	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Pretty flashy
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:16,991	| 339_The_Tunnel |	But there was one guy that stood apart from the Sinaloa Cowboys
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:19,295	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Text with their leather vests and high-end boots
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:21,599	| 339_The_Tunnel |	This guy dressed more like a businessman

EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:33,855	| 339_The_Tunnel |	So I
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:34,879	| 339_The_Tunnel |	I seldom depart
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:38,719	| 339_The_Tunnel |	But when Gary first met Rafael coming rain out at a local bar
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:42,815	| 339_The_Tunnel |	He says he didn't suspect that, Rana was involved in any smuggling
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,119	| 339_The_Tunnel |	I remember him being dressed very well
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,167	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Was very professional
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,983	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Never look like he ever got
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:53,311	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Excited or upset and never said anything that would
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:54,335	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Make you
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,919	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Question who he was
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:02,527	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Doug's Diesel
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,879	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Amanda was outgoing and social
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,951	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And he became friendly with some of Douglas's most prominent citizen
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:14,559	| 339_The_Tunnel |	That included the chief of police and local Justice of the Peace who owned a lot of
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,887	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Actually bought a plot
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:20,191	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Near an industrial part of the Border
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:22,495	| 339_The_Tunnel |	I also bought the local businesses
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:25,823	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The business was called Douglas Ready Mix
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:30,175	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Sand gravel and concrete for construction projects
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,991	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Madonna higher Jerry to Help Services
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:37,599	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And so I was seeing Mister, Dana at least on a weekly basis
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,647	| 339_The_Tunnel |	At least Gary
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:42,463	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Camarena's business appeared to be above board
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,511	| 339_The_Tunnel |	So the Douglas Ready Mix
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:46,815	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Was actually bidding on federal contracts
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:49,631	| 339_The_Tunnel |	City contracts State contracts
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:51,679	| 339_The_Tunnel |	For all kinds of
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:53,471	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Materials that are needed in
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:56,031	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Road building a bridge building
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:58,591	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And so it looked like a very very legit business
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:01,407	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And I mean he was employing people in so
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:05,503	| 339_The_Tunnel |	So we were all happy because at that point in time there wasn't much industry in Douglas are
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:12,927	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Really right downtown
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,487	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Real close to where all the

EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:15,647	| 339_The_Tunnel |	We can see another proper
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,671	| 339_The_Tunnel |	That used to be, Dennis
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:20,255	| 339_The_Tunnel |	It's a ranch style home in a wealthy neighborhood Developers
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:23,583	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Medina built a house on a vacant lot
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:26,911	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Which he reportedly bought for $90,000
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,935	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Cash
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,727	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Was a little bit over and above
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,519	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Market price to say the least
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,567	| 339_The_Tunnel |	It raised some eyebrows
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:36,639	| 339_The_Tunnel |	This guy was throwing around a lot of money
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:40,479	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And then there was the enormous hole behind them
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:46,879	| 339_The_Tunnel |	It was going to be a swimming pool But as time went on then realize it was starting to fill up
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:47,647	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Erdogan
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:48,927	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And so

EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:02,751	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Swift trucks going in and out and Hauling dirt
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,543	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And at this point
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:10,687	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Because Douglas and Oliver Prieta are both relatively small towns and everyone knows everyone else

EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:18,943	| 339_The_Tunnel |	But they didn't really know exactly what it would be like
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:21,247	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The first reaction was like
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,039	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Okay
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:26,623	| 339_The_Tunnel |	A tunnel is it's going to be some little bitty hole

EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:29,695	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Crawling through
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,975	| 339_The_Tunnel |	This is Terry Kirkpatrick

EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:35,583	| 339_The_Tunnel |	At the time and he was there the night of the raid
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:39,167	| 339_The_Tunnel |	First agent entered the warehouse on the US
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:39,935	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Side
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,215	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And in the middle of the floor
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:45,055	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Was probably about a 2-foot by 2-foot great
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:50,687	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Well that great just having to be the shaft leading down into the tunnel
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:54,271	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Once they found the tunnel entrance in the Douglas Warehouse
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:56,575	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Some of the agents headed over to Agua Prieta
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:58,879	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Where they were joined by the Mexican Federal Judicial
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:03,231	| 339_The_Tunnel |	They discovered that, Donna and his family had already fled
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:04,511	| 339_The_Tunnel |	His house with them
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:06,303	| 339_The_Tunnel |	No one was there
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:13,215	| 339_The_Tunnel |	But there was no access to the tunnel they couldn't figure it out we weren't sure how to get into it either
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:15,775	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The agents went into what looked like a recreation
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:16,799	| 339_The_Tunnel |	With a pool
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,871	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And when they pulled away the carpet
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:22,175	| 339_The_Tunnel |	They could see there was something unusual about the
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:27,295	| 339_The_Tunnel |	It looked as if there was a separate concrete slab underneath
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,319	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The pool table
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:30,111	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Kind of enormous trapdoor
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:33,695	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Agent started looking around for some kind of button
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,975	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Lever that might open it
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:37,535	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And someone else has pulled out of jackhammer
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:42,911	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And I just happened to be the one that took the Jackhammer start Jackhammer in the floor
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:44,703	| 339_The_Tunnel |	On top of where the pool table was
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:49,311	| 339_The_Tunnel |	As I'm standing there jackhammering it all the sudden it moved and
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,335	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Started go up
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:51,871	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And then it stopped
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:54,175	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And so everybody kind of froze
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:57,247	| 339_The_Tunnel |	We said okay who touched what
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:00,063	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Well it just so happened that one of the
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:04,671	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Policeman outside was trying to get a drink of water out of an outside water spicket
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,975	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Return that spicket
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:08,767	| 339_The_Tunnel |	That's what was a control lever
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:11,071	| 339_The_Tunnel |	That allow the pool table to go up
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:16,447	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Valve triggered the pool table to rise up to the ceiling on huge hydraulic lift
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:18,239	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Like something in mechanics
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:23,103	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Revealing a set of stairs underneath which descended into the tunnel
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:26,943	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Same one they found an entrance to on the Douglas side of the Border
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:30,527	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The tunnel was located about 30 feet underground
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,831	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Once agent at the bottom
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,599	| 339_The_Tunnel |	It was a package
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:37,951	| 339_The_Tunnel |	About 270 ft long 4 ft wide
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:39,231	| 339_The_Tunnel |	5 feet high
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:43,071	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Just tall enough that a person could walk through slightly stoop
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:46,143	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Pushing a wheeled cart full of bundles of cocaine
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:49,471	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The tunnel had concrete walls and a curb
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,751	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Concrete roof
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:53,311	| 339_The_Tunnel |	It was a ventilation system and rudimentary lighting
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:55,103	| 339_The_Tunnel |	So this wasn't just a gopher hole
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:58,687	| 339_The_Tunnel |	This was clearly a sophisticated engineering
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,735	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Jess
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:01,247	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:04,575	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Complexity to this whole tunnel
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:06,111	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Was something that had been
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:08,671	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Unseen before unheard of
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:11,999	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And no one I think in the United States government
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:15,839	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Especially in law enforcement realize anyone it has ever existed
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:18,399	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Will federal agents on patrol along the mechs
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:24,799	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Mexico Arizona border said today that they discovered a major drug smuggling Ruth where they have never looked but enough
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:27,103	| 339_The_Tunnel |	2 million dollars worth of construction
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:28,383	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Discovered last night

EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,551	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Of a football field
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:40,671	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Agency discovery of the tunnel was pretty much the biggest thing that had happened
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:41,183	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And Douglas
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:42,719	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Everybody
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:43,487	| 339_The_Tunnel |	I was paying attention
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,023	| 339_The_Tunnel |	I mean everybody
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,303	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And we had
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:48,351	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Congress people come out to Douglas Arizona
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:50,911	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And you know America's Most Wanted and

EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:57,311	| 339_The_Tunnel |	We just had a lot of activity here for at least the first year
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:59,359	| 339_The_Tunnel |	After the tunnel was
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,639	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Discovered it was constant
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,175	| 339_The_Tunnel |	I was just concerned
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,455	| 339_The_Tunnel |	I hear the helicopters
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:07,551	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Black Hawks Landing all the time will who is it today
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:10,623	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Hillside Grand Central Station in that place
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:14,719	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Keoki started reporting in between shifts at the Juice Shop

EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:22,399	| 339_The_Tunnel |	To help maintain and secure the warehouse site so law enforcement could come and go
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:25,983	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The customer service undertook a massive investigation
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:30,591	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And people started printing t-shirts and bumper stickers would said I saw the tunnel
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:33,663	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And selling them to all the visiting politicians and journalists
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:34,943	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And everyone
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:40,063	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Government officials reporters law enforcement ordinary citizens of Douglas
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:42,367	| 339_The_Tunnel |	They were all asking the same question
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:45,695	| 339_The_Tunnel |	First Who provided the money to build
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:50,047	| 339_The_Tunnel |	It was estimated to cost one to two million dollars to create
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:54,399	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The project clearly had the financing of a much bigger operation
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:56,703	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And the other question was
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:58,751	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Who had the expertise
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:02,335	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Someone with engineering Noel have been involved
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:05,151	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Someone who knew how to build a tunnel
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:06,175	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Undetected
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:08,479	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Stretch the length of a football field
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:12,831	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And ran under the massive border fence in concrete drainage ditch
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:15,135	| 339_The_Tunnel |	But separated Mexico from the US
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,440	| 339_The_Tunnel |	So right away everybody was talking like
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,464	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Who invested
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:20,512	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Who is the Kingpin
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:21,792	| 339_The_Tunnel |	This operation
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,840	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And of course his name starts coming
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:28,192	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The name was Joaquin El Chapo Guzman
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:29,984	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And eventually
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:31,520	| 339_The_Tunnel |	As the investigation progressed
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:34,080	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Someone else started coming up to
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:35,616	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Anarchist
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:40,480	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The arrival

EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,040	| 339_The_Tunnel |	After this

EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:11,008	| 339_The_Tunnel |	It seems like there were a lot of implications in these articles about
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,568	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Local officials
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:14,336	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Profiting
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:16,384	| 339_The_Tunnel |	From this whole scheme
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:20,480	| 339_The_Tunnel |	But did anybody in local government ever

EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:24,576	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Anything like that
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:25,856	| 339_The_Tunnel |	No
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:28,672	| 339_The_Tunnel |	No nobody on the Douglas side
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:32,768	| 339_The_Tunnel |	They're also allegations about how Agents from the customer service
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:35,328	| 339_The_Tunnel |	May have colluded in the tunnels game
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:37,888	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And while no one was ever charged
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:41,728	| 339_The_Tunnel |	There was a lot of corruption going on within the agency in around this time
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:43,264	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Here's Terry Kirkpatrick again
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:44,544	| 339_The_Tunnel |	At that time
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:51,968	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Corruption was so rampant that the US government started a blue ribbon campaign trying to stamp it out and we
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:53,248	| 339_The_Tunnel |	We're so busy
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:57,600	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Trying to work the corruption and trying to weed out all wrong with these inspectors
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:41:01,952	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Because they were passing a thousand pounds in the trunk of a car right to the Port of Entry
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:06,560	| 339_The_Tunnel |	It was just a lawless kind of area back in 1989
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:13,984	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Senior agent in the customer service told me that the tunnel was probably in operation for at least 6 months
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:16,032	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And he said that quote
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:17,056	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Everyone
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:19,104	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Dave had to know about the passageway
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:20,896	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Route to be in regular use for that length
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:31,136	| 339_The_Tunnel |	After the discovery of the tunnel El Chapo Guzman came up with new ways of getting drugs across the border Tactical
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:34,976	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Cans of jalapeno peppers or inside coils of insulated wire
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:39,072	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Both Francisco, Rihanna and Saudi pakoda naved badass led to Max
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:42,144	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And it took a long time to get them back to unite
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:48,032	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Coming in and was eventually extradited in 2001 and a couple years later he
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:50,592	| 339_The_Tunnel |	He plead guilty for his role in the Douglas smug Lincoln
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:53,151	| 339_The_Tunnel |	You received a sentence
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:54,431	| 339_The_Tunnel |	10 years in Federal

EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:03,903	| 339_The_Tunnel |	He was released from federal prison in September 2018
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:06,975	| 339_The_Tunnel |	But that wasn't the end of the tunnel
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:09,535	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The devil's tunnel was like
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:10,047	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Prototype
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:14,911	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Even though it was eventually discovered it was so efficient and effective
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:16,959	| 339_The_Tunnel |	During the time it was an operation
EDL	00:42:16,959	00:42:19,775	| 339_The_Tunnel |	But it paid for itself many times over
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:21,311	| 339_The_Tunnel |	With a successful experiment
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:23,615	| 339_The_Tunnel |	They proved the viability of under

EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:27,967	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The tunnels after this one
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:29,503	| 339_The_Tunnel |	They almost became a nightmare
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:33,087	| 339_The_Tunnel |	That was one tunnel after another tunnel after another tunnel
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:39,999	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Tunnel from San Diego to Tijuana they found it so sophisticated being called a super tunnel
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:41,791	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Nearly seventy feet underground
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:45,119	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Part of it through solid Limestone on the phones
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:50,239	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Phone still work without specific information about where the tunnels are located
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:51,519	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Or just plain luck

EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:05,087	| 339_The_Tunnel |	In places where the ground is soft enough for digging but not so soft it will cave in
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:09,439	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Some of the tunnels are pretty rudimentary but some like the Douglas tunnel
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:13,535	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Are highly engineered and sophisticated projects with elevators and real cars
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:16,607	| 339_The_Tunnel |	I told discovered in Baja Mexico last year
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:20,447	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Included solar panels to power a ventilation and Lighting systems
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:26,335	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Most illegal drugs actually come into the country through legal ports of Entry
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:27,615	| 339_The_Tunnel |	That fact
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:28,639	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And tunnels
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:30,175	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Are two reasons why Trump
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:33,759	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Probably wouldn't do much to stop drug trafficking
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:40,927	| 339_The_Tunnel |	But the US government still sees tunnels as enough of a problem that they started tunnel task force groups along the boy
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:46,047	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The groups exist solely to monitor investigate and prevent tunneling
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:48,863	| 339_The_Tunnel |	The tunnels are notoriously difficult
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:49,887	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Detect
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:51,423	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And they keep showing up
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:57,823	| 339_The_Tunnel |	I was in Douglas I tried to get in
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:58,335	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Into the old tunnel
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:00,639	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Which has been kept open for
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:02,431	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Regional training sessions by the border
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:06,271	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Keoki Skinner worked his connections
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:08,063	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And got us into the warehouse where the entry
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:10,879	| 339_The_Tunnel |	But the tunnel is dank
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:12,159	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Anna maintains
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:15,231	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And I was 7 months pregnant at the time of the visit
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:18,303	| 339_The_Tunnel |	A city worker took one look at me
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:20,351	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Probably imagined me trying to
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:22,655	| 339_The_Tunnel |	To clamber down the rusty ladder in the dark
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:24,703	| 339_The_Tunnel |	And then wouldn't let us in
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:25,727	| 339_The_Tunnel |	After all
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:28,543	| 339_The_Tunnel |	But if we couldn't see the architecture of
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:29,567	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Drug tunnel
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:32,639	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Then at least we could see the architecture the drug trade has helped
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:33,407	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Spell
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:34,175	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Across the border
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:37,503	| 339_The_Tunnel |	So you see it was pretty nice neighborhood
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:41,855	| 339_The_Tunnel |	Once again we're driving around in keoki's rattling little VW Bug
EDL	00:44:42,367	00:44:45,695	| 339_The_Tunnel |	We're exploring the part of town where I will see you at this business
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:51,327	| 339_The_Tunnel |	It's the neighborhood where, Donna's ranch home with the hydraulic pool table
