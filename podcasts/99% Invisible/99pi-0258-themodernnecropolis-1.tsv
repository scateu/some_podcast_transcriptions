EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:11,231	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	What happened in 1900
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:18,143	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Was that the Board of Supervisors of the County of San Francisco decided that they did not want

EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:33,247	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	And that went into effect in

EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:47,583	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	I'm so the cemeteries fell into disrepair and became these tiny wastelands for vagabond

EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:50,655	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	And also they were gross
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,959	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	So in 1914
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:54,751	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Another ordinance kick them out
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:57,567	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	They passed legislation that said
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:12:02,687	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Not only no new burials but these cemeteries just look off all they thought they were disease-ridden
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,991	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	So the city said
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:07,807	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	The bodies have to be disinterred and moved
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:15,487	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	From 1937 into the 1940s most of the bodies from San Francisco were dug up and moved Tacoma
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:18,303	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Roughly 150000 bodies in total

EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:22,143	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Cost the family $10
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:24,191	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	If there was no money
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:24,703	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Unknown X
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:27,775	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	The bodies were put into mask
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,543	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Musgraves
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,055	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	In coma
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:31,103	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	But like respectful ones
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:33,151	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Cuz when you think of mass grave you off
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,175	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	I think I'm a sex
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:34,687	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Execution
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:36,991	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	And it was not that kind of
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,807	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	I was a much gentler
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:40,831	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Respectful process
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,367	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	The deceased
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:43,391	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	In the mass Graves
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:46,207	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	We're blessed and memorialized and accounted for in Wrecker
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,999	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	And their headstones
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:50,047	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Where we used as building material
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,583	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Well
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:55,167	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	The mass grave headstones ended up along Ocean Beach
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:57,215	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	You'll see a lot of headstones out
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:58,751	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	No
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:12:59,775	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,055	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	They were used
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:02,591	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	To keep from erosion
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:05,919	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	If you find yourself in Buena Vista Park in the heart of San Francisco
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:10,015	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Look at the pavestones letting the trails and the street gutters
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:13,087	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	And you'll see that a lot of them are Cemetery headstone
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:16,927	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	These headstones sometimes faded fragments of them
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,463	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Sometimes completely intact
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:20,255	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	All over the city
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,791	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Hiding in plain sight
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:26,143	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	And they are the closest contact most San franciscans have with Cemetery
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:29,471	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	There are only two graveyard left in the entire city

EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,079	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	See I don't think about
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:39,455	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Where is Downing, Maureen confronts her mortality every time she looks at her window
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:41,247	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	I looked out on the cemeteries
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:42,783	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	And I think
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:49,183	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	You know these people are resting in peace and sometimes I feel overwhelmed by all the things that I have to do
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:54,559	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	But the day that I wake up that I don't have anything to do I'm probably going to be moving into
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,071	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	To a cemetery
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:04,031	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Most people aren't sandwiched between two cemeteries and we don't really think about the question of what will happen
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,567	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Our bodies after we die
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:06,847	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	I asked
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:11,199	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	The question and very often people are at like a little taken aback either they haven't
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:12,479	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Thought about it are they
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:13,759	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	No I haven't made any plans
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:16,063	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	I certainly haven't made plans
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,111	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Chances are you haven't either
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:21,695	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	I've no idea what will happen to my body after I die
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:24,511	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	What kind of unusual on the course of history
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:27,327	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	It was indeed the case that
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:29,119	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Yes people
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,911	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Largely knew where they were buried
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:33,215	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Professor Keith egner says that
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:37,311	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Prior to the Civil War Americans assumed they'd end up in their family plots
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,079	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Counter-charge
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:40,895	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	And other parents and children would be buried there
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:42,943	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	To that is no longer the case
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:47,039	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	We move you know from job to job from town to town
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:54,975	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	We frequently encourage our children to and I'll go out and explore the world and we can. We don't really know where we're going to be
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:55,487	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	The ending up
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:15:00,095	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Which is why today many people have opted not to be buried at all
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,655	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Cremation has become increasingly popular
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:06,495	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Again to our own time and this brought with it
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,543	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	A number of
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:10,335	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	New building types
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,615	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Crematoria
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,639	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	But also
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,943	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	The public mausoleums
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:19,295	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Where you have a small box containing an urn with ashes
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:21,087	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	But with cremation
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:24,415	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	You don't need a connection to one place
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:28,767	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	I should don't have to stay displayed in a columbarium or mausoleum
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:32,095	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	They can be scattered anywhere you've ever lived
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:32,863	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Or wanted to live
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:36,191	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	If your family and friends live all over the world they can
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:36,959	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Each have a part of you
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:42,335	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	And there are these services that you can order where ashes can be compressed into a diamond
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:46,175	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	And wander around someone's neck or turned into a hand blown glass paperweight
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,967	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	So there's
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:51,295	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	A kind of brake I think on going
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:54,111	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Over the course of the last hundred years or more
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,135	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	In which
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,927	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	People were
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:59,231	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Perhaps much more rooted to the land
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:02,303	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Both in life and especially
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:02,815	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Death
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,351	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	By virtue of
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,887	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Burial and
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:08,703	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Knowing where they were going to be buried
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,727	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Then we are now
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:17,407	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	San Francisco's 19 century residents could never have guessed that they'd be evicted and relocated miles away
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:19,967	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Away from their Hometown to a city of the Dead
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:22,527	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Their headstones strewn about the

EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:24,831	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Of the city

EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:27,295	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Katrina's designed what she called a recomposition center
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:31,647	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	A facility where it would be possible to compost multiple human body

EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:41,119	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Listen to the way she envisions one of these Center
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,679	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	Remember it doesn't exist yet
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,703	| 99pi-0258-themodernnecropolis-1 |	This is just how she imagined
