EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:25,056	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	When the sun came out Palmer went to some screening
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,104	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Where audience members could ask question
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:29,664	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And often wonder screening
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:33,760	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Someone in the audience asked me how do you film The Amazing shot
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:35,040	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Of the mother wolf
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:35,808	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And it's
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:36,576	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Did

EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,096	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	We rented
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:49,120	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Captive wolves
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,680	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	We rented captive wolves
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:56,032	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	The shots of the puppies in the den were not filmed in the wild
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:59,360	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Instead the film crew had gone to a game farm
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:01,408	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Where the Wolves were more used to humans
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:04,224	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And built an artificial Den with cameras inside
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,760	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	I was suddenly
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,808	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Bearing
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,088	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Stockley
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:12,160	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	As an ethical dilemma for myself did I tell
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:17,024	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	The truth and answer truthfully that for betraying our trade secrets in filmmaking
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:21,887	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Did I continue to lie and pretend of the captive wolves
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:25,727	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	In fact what we want when they want
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,007	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Homer decided to
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:27,775	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	To come clean
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:30,335	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And when I did this I could
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,639	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Feel the audience's disappointment
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:35,711	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And this moment was a bit of a turning point for him
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:38,783	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Up to that point I think I kind of assumed but why would they care
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:44,415	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But they do cat people do cat when people watch documentaries especially science space documentaries
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:51,327	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	They are assuming they are seeing the truth they are seeing things that are authentic and Jen
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:53,119	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Inuits and truthful
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:55,423	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And when they find out that is not the case
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,959	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	They get very upset
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:00,799	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Of course there's some level of allusion in all films
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:03,615	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	You're editing footage to form an area
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,431	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	We do this and Radio 2
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:10,783	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But Illusions in Nature Documentaries exist on a spectrum
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:14,623	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	In some cases these allusions help tell the truth
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,391	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	About animals
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:17,183	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But in others
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:18,463	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Not so much
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:21,791	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	On the far end of that truth Spectrum you know
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,839	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Over toward the straight-up false and
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,887	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Is a film called White wilderness
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,679	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	I still remember watching
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:31,775	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Willis as a child about 11 years old
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:36,127	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	It was a documentary produced by Disney in 1958 about the high Arctic
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:38,431	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Land of many Mysteries
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:43,039	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	It's a strange fact that the largest Legends seem to collect around the smallest creatures
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:46,367	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	One of these is a nasty little rodent called the Lenox
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:54,047	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	In one scene of herd of tiny Lemmings approaches a rocky Cliff along the ocean
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:57,119	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Reach the final precipice
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:58,655	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	This is the last chance to turn back
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:02,239	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	The little fur balls Pier over the edge
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:05,311	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And then they go
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:06,591	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Epsom salt
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:09,151	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Show me Arctic sea is dotted with tiny bobbing.
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,967	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	It's dramatic stuff
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,247	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Except
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:16,063	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	This entire sequence was staged
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,111	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	The producers
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,391	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Went the Arctic
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,671	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Bagged up a bunch of lemon
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:24,767	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And flew them to this Cliff along a river in Alberta
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:28,095	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And they put them on a turntable That You Don't See in the film
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:30,911	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Elladan and they threw them off the cliff side into the water
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,447	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And films it
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:35,263	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And Lemmings don't actually hurl themselves off cliffs
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:42,175	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Some lemon species do experienced dramatic fluctuations in population size bleeding to some creative 19th century
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:44,223	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Three hypotheses about what might be going on
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:47,807	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But the idea of a mass lemming suicide ritual
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:49,343	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Is entirely apocryphal
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	White Wilderness didn't invent
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,439	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	The lemming suicide
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,999	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But it certainly helped to spread it
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,047	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	The film was seen by millions of people
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,095	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	I even won the Oscar
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,119	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	4 best documentary
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:05,471	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Everybody is learned that from that film and it be misled by Sophie
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:07,775	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	What we put in these films is important
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:09,055	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And that means
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,591	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	So important they are
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,103	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Made
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:18,015	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Not only entertaining lie but made I'm accurately and an ethically because they do have an impact
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:22,623	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	The lemming scene is an especially egregious example of dishonest film
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:26,463	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But smaller acts of deception happen all the time
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:29,791	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And after his experience with the wolf documentary
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:32,607	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Chris Palmer started looking into this stuff
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:34,655	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	He found filmmakers learning sharks
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,703	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Closer to the camera by dumping bug
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:38,239	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	It's a fish guts into the ocean
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:42,079	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And a producer using CGI to edit a sea otter into a shot
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:48,479	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Homer is particularly bothered by filmmakers that harass animals to try to get them to do something exciting
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:52,319	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	He thinks all this happens because of a race 4 rating
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:58,207	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And when you focus so so much on Resler that you inevitably
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,999	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	A move toward pregnant
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:02,047	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	That are highly sensational
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:08,447	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And overly dramatic a lot of Palmer's criticisms have to do with the visual side
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:14,847	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	I feel making but any conversation about the accuracy of Nature Documentaries inevitably ends up on the topic of sound
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:21,247	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	That's because in most Wildlife films The Sounds you hear were not recorded while the cameras were rolling
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:25,087	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Which makes sense if you think about how different the two technologies are
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:29,951	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Most filmmakers use really long telephoto lenses
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,487	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	The phone animals from a safe distance
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:35,583	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But there's no Sonic equivalent of a zoom lens
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:37,375	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	For good audio
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:40,703	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	You need to get a microphone really close to the source of the sound
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:46,335	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Which can be difficult or dangerous to try and pull off all the cameras are rolling
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:48,639	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	You can't just walk up to a lion
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,175	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Clip a lapel mic on its main
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:57,087	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And so many of the subtle movement sounds a chimpanzee rustling through leaves or a hippos
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,623	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Squelching in the Moc

EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:53,663	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And he tries to match the movement of the animal
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:56,223	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Usually on on Sat On The Floor

EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:13,119	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	When you're feeling animals usually use your hands rubbing your feet
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,143	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Because you have no control

EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:35,647	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And I kind of stealthy kind of stoking kind of whites to it
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:40,767	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Hinton has been doing Foley for years
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,815	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And it's worked on many big nature
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,607	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Including planet Earth 2
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:49,983	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	With all that practice he says he can often get it right in just a single take
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:52,031	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	I've been doing it long enough now to know
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,823	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	You know that point

EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,551	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	You know the more of this stuff
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:07,135	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But you do you stop picking up on these little visual Clues
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,439	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	The wild life gives you
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:11,487	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	In terms of what it's about to do with its Behavior
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:14,815	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	So many Wildlife films focus on the exact

EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:24,031	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But hidden rarely comes across footage of an animal he's never fully before
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:26,847	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	When you first come across something you haven't done
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:32,991	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	You do spend a couple minutes just just watching the pussies three saying right okay well how is this thing moving
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:33,759	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	How

EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:44,767	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	It sounds as a giant storage area full of materials he's hoarded over the years
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,815	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Sheets of metal pieces

EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,567	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	I'm a question about
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:10,271	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Foley artists share techniques
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:14,111	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And some tricks have become so ubiquitous
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:17,951	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	That they've actually changed our understanding of the way nature sounds
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:21,279	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	I mean this is the thing we've been thankful you're not restricted so long
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:25,375	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	People actually are used to listening to is how we fight Easter
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:30,495	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Which is kind of weird some people expect what we do brazas and what nature money
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:32,031	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Actually there in real life
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:32,799	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	For example
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:33,823	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Elephant feet
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:39,455	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	We expect to hear a big booming sound when a massive elephant foot hits the ground
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:43,039	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But that's not what elephants actually sound like
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,831	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Have you told anybody that works around Dallas
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:49,951	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	They will tell you that elephants make pretty much no sound at all when they walk
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:51,487	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Because the Departed

EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:55,839	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	So
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:58,143	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	They're incredibly efficient
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:00,447	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Distributing the whites as they walk
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:04,287	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But Hinton says that if you had no sound at all it would just

EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:05,823	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Weird
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:08,895	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	It's very uncomfortable to see a foot

EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,783	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Hinton tries to find a middle ground
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:17,855	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Between accuracy and giving people the sound they expect
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:24,511	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But he says the main goal of Foley is just to provide a little bit of that movement sound need
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,047	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	The help the film
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:28,095	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Slow movement sounds at one thing
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:34,239	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But then there's the distinctive vocal sounds an animal makes you know a lion's roar a cuckoo birds
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:36,031	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Cuckoo anything that you would

EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,735	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	It's okay to be as real as we can get it
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,271	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But just because it's
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:50,367	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Your it doesn't mean that you're hearing the exact same individual animal
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,391	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But you're seeing on the screen
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:57,279	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Unless you can see David Attenborough in kneeling next to an orangutan
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:15:00,351	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Chances are the sounds that orangutan is making
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:02,911	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Come from a different orangutan all together
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:10,335	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Mini sound Studios have massive carefully catalog libraries of animal recordings that sound editors will use
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:16,735	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	To match the specific behaviors seen on screen and sometimes filmmakers will hire sound recordist to go out
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:19,039	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Out and find sounds to fit their film
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,575	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Recordists like Chris Watts
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:24,159	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	My name's Chris Watson and I'm a sound recordist
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:26,975	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Watson usually gets a storyboard from the filmmaker
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,559	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And it's his job to go and find sounds that match different scenes
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:33,119	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	He's working on a lion seeking
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:36,191	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Watson will find a pride he wants to record
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,983	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And carefully study their
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,775	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And then realizing
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:43,871	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	You know when they're off hunting or when they're gone to another location

EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:28,927	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	He has all kinds of techniques for getting close up sound without getting too close
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:31,999	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Do you want to use a really long boom
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:34,815	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Take it as microphone near achita resting beneath

EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:15,263	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	In the final product it looks like the vocalizations are coming from the animals on screen
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:20,639	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	When you can though Watson does try to record sound while the cameras are rolling
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:23,199	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Synchronous sound is not impossible

EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:26,783	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And I can bring a special kind of realism
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,551	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	The film
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:29,855	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	In the BBC documentary the life of bird
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:32,159	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	The director asked him to make up a bunch of
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,439	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Trees and bushes
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:35,999	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	I swear he new song birds like the sing at dawn
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,279	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And it worked
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,583	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	The bird showed up right on cue
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:42,655	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And saying right into his tiny microphones as they film
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,703	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Amelie morning like
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,471	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	I see the bugs

EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:56,991	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Recording synchronous sound is much easier with Bluebird than say

EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:00,063	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	But Watson which has it happened more
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:04,671	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	He says that in general producers prioritize sites above say
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:09,279	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	I'll spend millions of dollars sending camera people all over the world
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,303	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	To get that special shot
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:11,839	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And then just
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:14,143	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Worry about finding the right sound later on
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:19,263	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Sometimes though recording the sound separately can actually enhance the accuracy

EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:23,615	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	In the BBC documentary life in the undergrowth
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:29,503	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	The filmmakers wanted to Showcase this bizarre behavior of the Alcon blue butterfly
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:33,343	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Wood ants mistake these caterpillars for their own larvae
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:35,391	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And carry them underground to the end colony
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:39,231	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Once inside the caterpillars do something remarkable
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:44,351	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Next regulate an internal organ things about 300
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:50,495	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	I had to look up stridulate to

EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:59,711	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	In this case it's the caterpillars attempt

EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,039	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	This sound
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,063	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Stimulates
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:04,575	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Then

EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:13,023	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	Something very special in the first
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:16,095	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	The filmmakers would destroy the antonym
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,887	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	That's if they tried to film this in the wild
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:20,703	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	So they established a colony inside a film set
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:23,263	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And filled it with tiny Periscope cameras
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:25,311	| 99pi-0256-soundsnatural-1 |	And the capsule the sound
