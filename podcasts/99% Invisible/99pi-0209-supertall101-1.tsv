EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,704	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And it was not satisfied
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,728	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	So then

EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:19,936	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	It's surreal
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:22,496	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	You can see it from almost anywhere in the city
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,288	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Even from neighboring towns
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,104	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Like a benevolent eye of Sauron
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:31,200	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Building something of this size is never easy but I pay an extra optic
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:34,528	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	In a city prone to earthquakes and typhoons
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:37,344	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	They had to design a building that could withstand these conditions
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:42,976	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And they had to convince the public that this freakishly tall new building was safe
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,512	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And for a while at least
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,792	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Taipei 101
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,328	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	But hold the coveted title

EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:50,912	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	I think
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:54,752	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	It's fair to say that a large part of the story and history

EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,080	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Is really wrapped up

EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,872	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Competition
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:02,688	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Optimal so than any other building type
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:03,712	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	This is Anthony Wood
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:05,504	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Executive director of the
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:07,552	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The Council on tall buildings and urban habitat
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:12,160	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	They are the organization that gives out that official title of
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,696	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Tallest building in the world
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,256	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Yeah we have a very big ruler
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:18,047	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And we send someone on socket
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:20,607	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	No it's it is all based on
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,887	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	On drawings on submit
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:22,655	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Drawings
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:29,055	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And it's important to have a fair an official measurement process because a tall tall building always represent
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:30,847	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Something larger than itself
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:34,175	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Historically a tall building was the embodiment of
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:37,503	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Corporate power and you could see that in the titles of the pro jet
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:40,063	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Pence Chrysler Building
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:43,135	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Chicago Tribune Tower or Sears Tower
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:46,463	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	But in the last couple of decades the agenda has shifted
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:52,351	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The motivation is the same in terms of getting attention I'm getting Brandon but it's now Moline clay
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,143	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	To befall a city
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,679	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	People and economy

EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:59,775	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Which is why projects are now more likely to be named for places

EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,623	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	We have arrived
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,927	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The question I typically get asked

EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:18,975	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	How high can we go

EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,607	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And I can tell you that that no
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,911	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Really the height of a tower is
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:28,191	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The product of its base
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:31,775	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And as long as you've got a big enough area at the base of the
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,543	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The tower
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:36,383	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	It's just down to Structural Engineering that you can go as high as you

EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:42,783	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Which means the only real limits
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,807	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	AR resources
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:44,831	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And will
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:46,111	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The main limit
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,135	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Is financial
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:51,487	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	That's the only limit on tall buildings really is who the hell is going to pay for it
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:53,791	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And then should it be done in the first place
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:06:00,703	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	In Taipei securing funding for their new building with a huge endeavor
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:03,519	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Is Taipei 101 representative Michael lucak
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:05,567	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	This was a public-private partnership
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:10,175	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	R a handful of local financial institutions signed on as shareholders
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:13,247	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Including Taiwan stock exchange
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:19,647	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And a lot of local bangs and some telephone company but local and getting the rest of the city on board with this
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:22,719	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Plan meant taking a lot of different considerations into account
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:24,767	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Light commercial flight pattern
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:28,863	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	When we proposed it is a big big challenge renovation Department
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:31,679	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Type is airport is right in the middle of a city
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:35,775	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	So we went to a very very difficult time you need to talk to them
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,055	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:40,895	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	You know knowledge of the city but also the the country
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:42,687	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Recognize that we need this
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:45,503	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	To really go for
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:48,319	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The tallest in the world and then saw the end
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,367	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The fly detour
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,719	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Because if
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,767	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The land was sad
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,559	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The air was cleared
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:03,167	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The city of Taipei was ready to create a building that would be the tallest in the world
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,471	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Now they had to make it look good
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:10,591	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The important thing is that you have to design building to be really iconic
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,895	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Otherwise you cannot become a landmark
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,919	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	That is C Wiley
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,711	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	He's a bona fide Stark attack
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:22,367	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Kid already designed big buildings and other cities in Taiwan and all-around China when he started planning this project
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:23,647	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Back in the late 90s
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,951	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	He wanted this new building to be
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:29,023	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Look different from skyscrapers in the West
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:32,863	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Imitate like mod a Chinese Pagoda
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:35,423	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	So some more like a high-rise Pagoda
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,983	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Super elongated
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,519	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Multi-tiered Pagoda
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,287	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Covered in
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,311	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Sea Green Glass
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:48,479	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Olympic a little bit light green mucus looks of record in this Pagoda is divided into 8 segments because
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:51,551	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Eight in Chinese sounds like the word for wealth
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:57,951	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Because that building is a financial building and for even more luck and wealth are a giant gold coins on all fours
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,975	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Four sides of the base of the building
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:04,863	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And for extra extra good luck the corners of the tower are accented with representations of
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:05,631	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Clouds
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,399	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And Dragons
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:12,799	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The Cornell I have so many kind of a small thing that's expressed a dragon
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:14,335	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Protectors of the building
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:16,383	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	In Taipei 101 needs
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:18,431	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	All the protection it can get
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:23,039	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	It is in what I like to call a tough neighborhood
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,063	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	That's Leonard Joseph
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,855	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Thornton Tomasetti
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:28,671	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	They provided the Structural Engineering Services
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,951	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Does on Taipei 101
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:30,975	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	You have both
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Typhoons that are
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,559	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Significantly more severe than
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:37,375	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The Hurricanes we see you in the eastern US
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,911	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And it is an active seismic
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:45,311	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Until thing about having both harsh winds and seismically-active ground is that in an earthquake you want a flexible belt
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,847	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	So you would
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:49,151	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Really would like a nice cool Timber structure
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,455	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	An earthquake zone kind of roll with the flow
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,807	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	When the wind blows that limber structure
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:58,367	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Sways too much and people get seasick
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:01,439	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	One of the ways to lessen that sway
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,975	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Is with a tuned Mass damper
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:08,351	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	A wind damper or a tuned Mass damper is basically a counterweight to wins
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:10,911	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Tuned Mass dampers appear in many forms
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,959	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	These can be weights on rollers
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:16,287	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Blocks of concrete suspended in pools of water or oil
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,055	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Or
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,847	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	In the case of Taipei 101
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,383	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	A gigantic pendulum
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:24,223	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	By having a 2 Mass damper having this big pendulum
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,527	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Has the building sways
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:30,367	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And this business pendulum is designed to sway at about the same rate
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:35,999	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The pendulum will handle a behind the building moves a pendulum follow
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:39,327	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Slows the sway of a building
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:41,119	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Tower would still stand without a
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:47,263	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	But the people inside might feel seasick or they might just be unnerved by the fact that they're building is Wayne
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:49,055	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	The damper
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:50,847	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Is typically intended
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,407	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Just to improve occupy
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Comfort having a temper is not unique there are lots of buildings that have one
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:00,575	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	What's unique about Taipei 101
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,879	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Is the way they've turned it into an ass
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:06,975	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Usually the Denver gets treated like another piece of machinery
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:07,999	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Velvet looks at it says
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,815	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Well if I have to I'll put it in
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	I don't want to but if I got it all right
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,399	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	It takes up space
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:17,727	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	It cost me money I got to maintain it I got to buy it you know it's a thing
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:18,751	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	That they have to pay for
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:22,335	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And so if there's a damper at all it's usually hidden away
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:25,663	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	You're the top of the building in some sort of machine room or attic space
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:30,015	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Put in Taipei 101 the wind damper isn't just visible
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,807	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	It's the main attraction
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:32,831	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	So of course
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:34,111	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Avery went to see it
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:36,927	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	This is like the 90
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,439	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	First
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,255	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Oh my God my ears are
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:44,863	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Okay now we are walking into the tunnel where it says
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:47,935	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Giant Windber with her friends bike
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:48,959	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Come here
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:50,751	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	This is
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:53,055	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	This is the pig camper
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,847	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	It is a massive
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,127	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Massive pendulum
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:59,199	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	An orb made of 41 stacks of solid steel
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:01,759	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Wayne 728 tons
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:06,367	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	According to an informational video elephants
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:09,439	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	It's suspended by 4 bundles of thick cables
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,463	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And all of it
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,743	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Has been painted
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:12,511	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Goal
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,791	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Really surreal again
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,095	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Just kind of
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:16,863	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Dystopian
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:17,631	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	If you're coming today
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:18,911	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Gigantic

EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:26,335	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And the damper is on display because the engineering at work
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:27,615	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Make people feel safe
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:32,479	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Even in today's volatile climate you don't need to worry about the title
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:35,295	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	Even the Wave A Lot in Taiwan in December but
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,063	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	You don't need to worry
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:38,623	| 99pi-0209-supertall101-1 |	And to promote their awesome damper
