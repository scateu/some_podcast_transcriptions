EDL	00:01:55,456	00:02:01,344	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Sure World Showcase directly came out of our experience with podcast which we ran about a year ago where we invited
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:06,976	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Anyone and everyone to submit podcast ideas about whatever they were interested in that wanted to make a podcast about
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:11,840	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And we got over 1,500 entries muchos wants got your hustle it's now
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:13,632	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	A show in radiotopia
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:20,032	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	What's the thing that I'm popular show in a very very proud of anime
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:22,848	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	He's at the response has been getting a Dutch rabbit
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:25,408	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I'm the point was we had so many great ideas
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:27,456	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But they weren't all necessarily
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:32,576	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Sustainable long-term show ideas and that will what if radiotopia could get
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:33,344	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Behind
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:34,624	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	A podcast that featured
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:37,184	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	All of these different ideas one after another
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:42,304	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I without them being separate podcast that had to go out and gain their own audience and live on their own
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,584	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	How could we
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:49,984	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Use the radiotopia name and reputation to help support even more producers with different kinds of ideas that wouldn't
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:50,752	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Beyond going shows
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:57,664	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And so what showcase is one podcast that has limited run series one after another with you
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:58,944	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Are short breaks in between
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,736	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And these will be shows up
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:04,576	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	All strikes were really going to play with Forum play with topic
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:06,112	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Gina push boundaries
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:08,672	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Giving you producers a chance and really
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:13,280	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	See how we can provide like really high quality listening for our audiences
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,584	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	How do you conceive of something
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,096	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:19,168	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Sort of sticks together holds together enough
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:19,936	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	To be a
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:21,984	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Radiotopia showing to represent
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,008	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Are values in a certain
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:25,056	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But also be desperate enough
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:25,824	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	2
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:28,128	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You'll make this an experiment worth having
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:34,784	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I'm just looking for ideas that I know like I'm interested in automatically I haven't heard anything like that before
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:39,904	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But the producer kind of fit the radiotopia profile their independence are highly ambitious
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,184	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	They have
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:45,024	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Big ideas about the subject that they're bringing to my attention
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,048	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But they have sent
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:48,096	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Humor and they can play a little bit
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:53,728	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And there's sound inclined I think every pitch I'm considering right now has a lot of sound involved because
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:56,544	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That's really a Hallmark of a lot of radiotopia shows as a
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,568	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Careful crafting
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:01,152	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Again how to experiment with the farm how to hear from new voices so
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,944	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Part of it is like what are topic
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:05,760	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Text we haven't heard yet you know go in those directions
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:09,344	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And also just stopped encourage people to like really
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,368	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Come up with something
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:12,672	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Brand new original something we can
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,720	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Take a bit of a risk on because
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,512	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Hoverboard is going to be in
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:19,839	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Trying something new and giving listeners like a new listening experience
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,887	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Typo
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:23,679	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Podcast for
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,983	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Be adventurous listener and I'll reward that
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:27,263	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Type of person
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:34,687	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It seems like just I'm going to just do this like input my 9 IP I had on a zit from a design perspective
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,991	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Why all one podcast
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:42,623	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Through this format what are you what type of experience are you trying to shape answer cultivate
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,135	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	With the audio
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:50,559	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That's a really good question cuz we also talked about all of these series just being separate podcast there's some liability
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,607	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Here what will people stick with it from one to the next
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:56,447	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I really hope you know the through line for all the series is going to be
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:59,519	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	An original radiotopia incentives

EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:04,127	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Play people will tune in
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:06,687	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I'm in your people thinking of it as a showcase
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,455	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Experience
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:09,759	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Just thinking about the series that comes up next Thursday
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,295	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Really having this like
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:15,391	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Comprehensive sense of what this offering is from radiotopia
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:19,999	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Right I mean that's the thing I like about it cuz there's something about this where
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:24,351	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You know hopefully you you get a little further into it
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,887	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	To judge
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,167	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You know because
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:29,471	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You trust the idea of the channel
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:31,007	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Like it it means something
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:31,775	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	To be
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,799	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	A listener to
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:33,567	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	To showcase
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,079	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Ascenso
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:38,687	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I'm just really intrigued by the new type of listening that might come out of that
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,711	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That isn't based around
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:40,991	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Building
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:41,759	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I had around
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:42,527	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	A single pot
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:47,135	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You know we talked about radiotopia as the account of music label a lot and
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,671	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	So this is kind of like a
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,695	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Compilation
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:52,255	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Record LP to CD series
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:56,095	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And so obviously
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:59,679	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I have a few lined up like I don't want to spoil anything but can you talk
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,727	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Being generally about the types of shows that are going to be on
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:05,055	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Bring a kickoff with a very sort of essayistic
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,871	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Sound rich
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:13,759	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Series about listening in the digital age how listening has shifted for us through analog technology
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:16,575	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Changing into transforming into digital technology
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:19,903	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And this was proposed by a musician Damon Creek
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:20,671	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Ask who
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:26,047	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Was in a band that I used to love Galaxie 500 and then Damon & Naomi
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:32,447	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Yeah yeah I had to get over that to begin with when we started talking to him
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:38,847	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But he has an ex-girlfriend
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,359	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Rating on iTunes
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:45,759	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	So this is a perfect example he's actually wrote a book about this
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:52,671	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	In the past year and we were talking about how that had to be a podcast it was about listening shifting from analog to digital culture how
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,207	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	How do you represent that through sound

EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:00,095	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	In a sort of intellectualize but I'm
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:05,727	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	How do how does he convey how lives are changing through these technological shifts and so
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:12,639	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	He came up with six different episodes of sort of based on the book but it's really departed from the book and become its own engines called ways
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,663	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Days of hearing
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:17,503	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And that's what we're going to kick off the Showcase with and I think there couldn't be a better
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:22,367	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Starter series because it's really about how we listen how we listen in this age
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:25,951	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And I really want to get people engaged with their ears and thinking about you
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:28,255	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	What is it about podcasting that they respond to
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:33,119	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	This is ways of hearing
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,655	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Listening in the digital age

EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:44,127	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The first record I made was all analog
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,663	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Wasn't a choice
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,711	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That's just how it was done in Haiti
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:51,295	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	My friends and I lived in an all analog world
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,855	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	There were no computers in our lives
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,927	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That didn't feel weird
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,975	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It would have been weird if there happened
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,767	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The time
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:03,071	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Computers with something you saw on TV
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:06,911	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	During a moon shot
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,471	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You suck people sitting at computer
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:11,007	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Did NASA Mission Control

EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:17,407	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Wasn't anything like a moonshot it didn't use numbers
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:24,319	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Is data plural
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,599	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Involved
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:28,159	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The tape decks mixing board microphones
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:30,719	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	They all seemed very magical
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:33,023	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But they were made of magnet
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,815	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Gears Motors electricity
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:37,887	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Like all the mechanical objects in our lives then
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:41,215	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And so my bandmates and I
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:43,007	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Set up our instruments and Studio
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,543	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Recounted off
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,079	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And we played our songs
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,271	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	In many ways
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It simply Nostalgia to think that it was so different
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,367	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	People Are People
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,647	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Sounds of sounds
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,951	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And our technology is always changing
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:03,999	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Still
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:07,327	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	There's something particular about that analog experience
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:10,399	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Seems hard to conjure back up in the digital press
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,959	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	For that very reason
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:14,239	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It feels important to try
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,279	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Human analog Studio
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:39,839	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It was a feeling when the tape started rolling
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,887	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That this was the moment we would capture
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,935	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Feeling of time
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,727	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Moving both more slowly
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,263	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And more quickly than usual
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:54,687	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Like when you're in an accident
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:10:01,087	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Which split-second suddenly so palpable as if you're living in slow motion it would we say
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:04,927	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It all happened in an instant
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,999	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Analog recording
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,535	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It's like an accident in other ways
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:10,815	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Untape
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	There was no undue
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,655	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You could try again
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,935	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	If you have the time and money
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,983	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But you couldn't move
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,495	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Backwards
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:19,775	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	What's done
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,823	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Better
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,335	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And worse
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,687	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Today
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:28,479	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Life is a musician is very
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,527	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	In the digital Studio
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,551	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I'm using one now
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:34,367	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Everything you do is provisional
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:38,207	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That is it can be redone reshaped
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:38,719	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Rebuilt
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,511	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	There's no commitment
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:44,351	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Because each element of recording can be endlessly changed
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:47,423	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You can even be conjured from digital scratch
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:51,519	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And entered into a computer directly as data
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,311	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Without anyone performing at all
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:03,295	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	This means there's no moment from lived experience
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:05,343	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Is captured forever
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:06,879	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Unalterably cell
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,415	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The digital Studio
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:17,119	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Which is why it's more than nostalgia
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It makes me remember the analog Studio
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,959	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It's different than what we know today
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:23,263	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Because the digital era
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:26,335	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Has not resulted or tools for working with sound
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,615	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Rematch
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,639	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Removing images
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:31,199	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It is changing our relationship
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,223	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The time itself
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:43,743	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	This is ways of hearing

EDL	00:11:55,007	00:12:00,639	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	We'll look at a different way that the switch from analog to digital audio is changing our perceptions
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:01,919	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Time

EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,295	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	This is about sound
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:09,087	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The medium we're sharing together now
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:11,903	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But I'm worried about the quality of that sharing
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:16,511	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Because we don't seem to be listening to each other very well right now in the world

EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,959	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Speed was hardly static
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:02,751	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	At least never for long
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:10,687	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	At the opposite end of the 20th century
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:14,015	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Hip-hop DJs used speed controls on turntables
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,295	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	To change the tempo of a wrecker
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:18,111	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Domatcha to another and keep the group going
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,903	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Or in the studio
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:22,463	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Pileup samples from older records
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,231	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And make a new one
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:28,095	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	In 1990
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:29,375	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	A Tribe Called Quest
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:31,935	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Sample Bass from Walk on the Wild Side
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:33,983	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Along with the surface noise from the lp
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:37,567	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Added it to a drum loop from a Lonnie Smith LP
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,591	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And made a new hit out of
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:40,895	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	They also have to give up
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:41,919	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Royalty
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:43,711	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	One of the
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:44,991	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Biggest samples
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,271	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:50,111	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	We were able to clear was the Walk on the Wild Side by Lou Reed
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,647	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:55,999	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And by clearing that he just took 100% of that song
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,303	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	He did
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:04,191	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That's Ali Shaheed Muhammad from A Tribe Called Quest
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:05,215	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Frannie Kelley
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:08,287	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	They host a podcast about hip-hop called microphone check
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,311	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Yeah that's
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:15,967	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	This is song 500 we ripped off The Velvet Underground way more than you do
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:20,319	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	We didn't have to pay them in time
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:22,623	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Diastole
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:25,183	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	How tribe use the variable speed of turntable
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:26,207	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	To make your own record
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:31,583	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I know sometimes we would change the speed on a turntable because
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:34,655	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Staple hip-hop turntable is good
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:38,239	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Technics 1200 so that has a pitch control we would sometimes
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:41,055	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Pitch it by there sometimes
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:44,127	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	A 33 RPM record you put it on 45
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,319	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	One thing with tribe
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,343	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	We layered
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:58,719	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Certain sound and saw you kind of had to pitch them cuz often
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,999	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	They weren't in the same key
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:02,047	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Layering sounds
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:03,071	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Tribe Called Quest
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:05,119	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Discovered something else about their sample
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:07,167	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The records we were recording
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:09,983	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	They might not have been playing to a metronome
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:14,847	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And it would free-flowing so their moments with in let's say even a toolbar phrase
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:21,247	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That may be a drummer or bass player like we're a line in the first two bars infratemporal seem to be consistent
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,783	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The last
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:27,135	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Three beats of a bar It sped up or slow down
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:34,047	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	1988
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:37,887	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The songs My bandmates and I recorded slowed down and sped up
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,679	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Just like always Shaheed described
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:42,239	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I know because I was the drummer
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:45,311	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Who played as steadily as we could
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:46,591	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But this was a performance
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:48,895	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	We were nervous and excited
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:50,175	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And we sped up at the Quarry
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:59,903	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You might find that a Florida recordings
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:01,695	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Or you might feel it's a part of their charm
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:06,815	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Musicians have been speeding up at the chorus for as long I'm sure as there have been choruses
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,119	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Our experience of time is
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:09,631	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Flexible
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:18,335	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But not long after we recorded that first Galaxie 500 album
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,871	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The commercial music world
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,895	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	For the most part
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:22,943	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Decided that this was most definitely a
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:23,455	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Flaw
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:25,503	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Bands on major labels
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:29,087	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Even bands who came out of our DIY Indie scene
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:30,879	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Started recording to a click track
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,927	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That is a metronome
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:37,535	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Fashion to music come and go at the time
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:39,583	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Everyone was also using the swirling effect
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:40,863	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Call the flanger
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:44,959	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	No one remembers why
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:46,239	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But the click track
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,775	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Poop more than a fad
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:49,311	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It was a change that stuck
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:53,663	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Because what truly changed in popular music during the 1980s
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:57,247	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	With a digital machines enter the mix for the first time
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:59,807	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	A machine have a different sense of
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:00,831	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Time
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:09,023	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	First drum machines to be widely used in commercial recordings were introduced in 1980
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:10,559	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And MIDI
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:12,863	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Musical instrument digital interface
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:17,215	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The language machines used to share musical information with one another
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:19,007	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Was launched in 1983
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,543	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Together
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:23,103	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	These tools can lock musical time 2:00
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,895	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Doesn't speed up
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:25,407	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Chorus
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:37,439	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Galaxie 500 recorded we played our songs and what audio engineer is now referred to as real time
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:41,535	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Real-time as the name implies is live time
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:44,607	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Time as we experience it in the analog world
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,655	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Digital time
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:48,191	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Is not live time
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,983	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It's machine time
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:51,775	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It's locked to a clock
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:54,591	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Annette clock the time code
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:57,151	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Makes everything more regular
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,175	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	In live time
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,783	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Time in the digital Studio
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:05,343	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Is stored in discrete cells on a grid
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:07,135	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Like figures on a spreadsheet
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:10,207	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And if you've ever worked with a spreadsheet
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:14,303	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You know those cells can be sorted any which way and we figured
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,607	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	To most any desired outcome
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:26,591	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	What this means is that a given experience a digital time is only one among many equally plausible
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:27,103	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Experiences
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,919	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Take this podcast you listening to
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:32,479	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Since this is digital medium
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:34,015	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You can choose to hurry me up
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:36,319	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Without changing the pitch of my voice
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:39,903	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Seemingly without changing any of my words or pronunciation
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:42,207	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Which means I can be equally fast
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:45,023	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Sitting at 1.5 times my normal Pace like a manic
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:45,791	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Or
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:48,351	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I can be equally slow
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:52,191	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Speaking at 3/4 normal pace
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,471	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Like I'm drunk
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:56,799	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Neither newbie how this happened in real time
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,591	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	In fact
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,639	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	None of this need ever have happened
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:03,711	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	In the sense that we understood that term in 1988
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:11,647	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That's a track meet entirely by software
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:14,207	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The singer is a program made by Yamaha
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,231	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Call Vocaloid
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:23,167	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Vocaloid tracks have been cropping up in the Japanese pop charts
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:24,447	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Score number of years
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:27,519	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And are now making their way into other forms of Music around the world
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:32,895	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Casper podcast
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,943	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Adobe is developing a program
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,967	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Voco
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:37,759	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That will read text aloud for you
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,551	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	In your own voice
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:41,599	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	What could possibly go wrong
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:47,999	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Making thyme conform to machines making it regular
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:50,047	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Would seem to make it more unify
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:52,607	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Like a standardized timeline
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:54,911	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That any of us can tap into at any moment
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:56,703	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But there's acid
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:57,471	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Surprising twist
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,007	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Digital time
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:01,311	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It's actually very difficult
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:01,823	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Synchronize
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,359	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It's a challenge
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:05,151	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	In digital recording
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:06,943	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	To whine up the different layers
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:07,967	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That make up a song
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:11,295	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	If you play a guitar into a digital recorder
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:13,599	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And then play it back and add singing
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:15,391	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Your voice won't line up with the music
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,696	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Exactly the way you performed
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:19,232	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The reason
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:21,024	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Is what's called latency
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:24,864	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Latency is the lag and digital Communications
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:26,656	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Introduced by the time it takes
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:28,192	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Computer to process them
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:32,032	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Computers move very fast that's what computers are good at
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,592	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But analog time it seems
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,128	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Moves faster
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:40,480	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Let's consider an example from outside music
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:44,320	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Bulletstorm
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:46,880	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That's the radio voice of the Boston Red Sox
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,904	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Joe Castiglione
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:54,816	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I don't have a signature home run call because all the good ones were take it and going going gone
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:57,120	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Buybuybaby
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:22:00,192	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Russ Hodges
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:04,544	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I got kind of used forget about it and because are you know it's gone
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:10,944	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Some fans didn't like that sweetheart forget about it's a big home run
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:13,504	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Hello the broadcaster is to describe
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:18,624	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	What you see and what is happening as it happened that's why we broadcast in the present tense
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:21,952	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Major deals and it's in there for a call strike
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:25,536	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I can't be too soon anticipated you can get burn that way
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:30,144	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Sometimes the ball doesn't carry as far as you think it's going through or sometimes it carries farther
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:35,008	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You can always tell if a broadcast is behind the action
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:38,336	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The crowds cheering and you're still building up to what's happening
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:41,152	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You have to be quick you have to be current
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,688	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You have to be right
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,456	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	On time
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:48,576	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Joe is such an important voice here in Boston it used to be common practice
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:50,624	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Watch baseball games on TV
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:52,160	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But with the sound off
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:53,440	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And the radio on
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:55,744	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	So we can watch the game
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:58,048	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The listen to Joe
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:00,608	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And then a strange thing happened
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:02,400	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	On June 12 2009
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:04,704	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Joe started calling a place
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:06,496	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Before we saw them on TV
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:08,800	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That's because on that day
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:11,360	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Every TV station in the US
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,920	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Switch from analog to digital transmission
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:18,528	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And that lag in the Digital television image the gap between it
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:21,344	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And the real time of the game as Joe is calling it
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:23,136	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That latency
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:28,256	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It takes time for computers to translate the world into Data
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,304	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And translating data
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,328	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The analog
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,864	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	So we can perceive it
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:34,912	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Slows things down
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:36,704	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Enough to put the tag
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:39,008	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	After the call by Joe Castiglione
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:43,360	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Throw throw in time at his house
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:45,664	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Was it all saying radio
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:47,968	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	When you read it it's history when you hear it it's news
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:52,064	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And we're headed the satellite picture on TV so
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:53,088	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	We are first
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:55,648	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And I think the immediacy of radio
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,696	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Is something that
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:59,488	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You're so critical and seoul
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,256	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Jermaine to it
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:03,072	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Back before digital broadcast
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:05,888	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That immediacy was audible in the city
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:09,216	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You always need when there was a homerun at Fenway
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:13,312	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Because you heard of simultaneous Collective cheer all around Boston
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:16,384	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	From every open window to passing car
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:19,968	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The news today
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:21,248	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Those shots are staggered
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:23,808	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	We get splattering of Cheers
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,600	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Like scatter points on a graph
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:32,768	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That's because latency
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:33,792	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	He is different
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:35,328	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Slightly different but different
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:41,472	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	On each digital device receiving its own particular stream of digital information
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:47,104	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Professional music producers and engineers in the digital Studio
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:49,408	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Worried about latency all the time
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:52,480	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Black and introduces can be very very small
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:53,760	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And yet
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:54,784	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It's always there
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:58,880	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And always threatening to knock the different layers of a song
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:00,672	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Out of sync with one another
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,976	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	If a young drummer today
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:03,744	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Managest
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:05,792	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Cast wide net around beat
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:11,680	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Perhaps that's not so different from my own speeding up and slowing down on Galaxy 500 recording
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,472	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It may be a flaw
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:15,008	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Or maybe part of the charm
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:19,360	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	If there's something very distinct
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:23,200	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	About an experience of analog time time that flexes
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,736	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Slower and quicker
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:27,040	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Tempo rubato
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:30,368	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And this feeling a blurred time
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:30,880	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Vim latency
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:33,952	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	From one
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:36,512	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I can't think of a musical term for latency
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:40,608	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Perhaps because it's not like anything we experience in live
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,680	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	However
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:47,264	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	This experience of latency is typical of Life online
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:50,336	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	For all our seemingly instant

EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:39,744	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Pause without lapsing into silence

EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:51,520	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It's time to sign from machines

EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:03,808	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Because when we trade broadcast for podcast

EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:55,904	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Music
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:56,928	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Is Frozen music
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:04,352	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It's only very recently in the history of music that we've been able to freeze music into an object
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:08,192	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	In my life the form of is object matter to lie
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:11,520	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I once bought vinyl albums and cassette tapes
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:15,360	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And there were two first songs per album side a
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:18,176	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Inside B
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:20,224	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The energy of a first song
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:22,528	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Made it stand apart from the other songs
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:23,552	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	At least my head
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:28,928	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Then the CD came along and eliminated side B and there was only one first song
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:34,816	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And the actual number of the track that you can see prominently displayed on the CD player URI
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:36,864	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That became my index for sorting songs
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:41,984	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	An MP3 is jumbled my sense of track order and albums began to feel more like
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:46,080	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	A loose grouping of individual pieces rather than a conceptual hole
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:50,176	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I can do this all day and you're welcome to try man let's just left totally has the sound of the waves
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:51,968	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But my point is this
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:55,552	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	When it comes to music the form of the thing matters
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:33:02,464	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But no effect has been his world changing as the original Innovation freezing Music In Time on
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:03,232	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Recording
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:07,328	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Or a single version of a song a single performance of a song
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,352	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Became
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:09,376	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The song
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:13,984	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	This inherently mutable method of communication
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:15,520	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Was fundamentally changed

EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:28,320	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	That's the songwriter composer and producer Jon Brion
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,856	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	No I didn't talk to John Bryan
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:30,880	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But I know people who did
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:36,512	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Jim derogatis and Greg caught are the hotel radio program I'm a huge fan of called sound opinions

EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:51,104	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Anyway
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:55,968	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	John Brian came to WBEZ in Chicago to talk to sound opinions in 2006
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:56,992	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And at the time
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:58,784	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Brian Tedesco produced
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:01,088	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Kanye West album late registration

EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:13,120	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I heard the show broadcast on WBEZ while I was sitting in my car in a parking lot of a Taqueria in Logan Square
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:16,704	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And I thought about this section of their interview about
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:18,752	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Songs versus performances
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:19,776	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	At least
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:21,824	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Once a month
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:22,336	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Since then
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:24,128	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	For 6 years
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:28,736	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But only recently did it. I mean that this is a perfect 99percentinvisible story
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:30,016	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	So here it is

EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:35,904	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I distinguish between
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:40,512	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Look for lack of better terms I call songs and performance pieces
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:42,304	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:45,376	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	What most people like are specific
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:47,424	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Performances we've grown up in an era of
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:47,936	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Recording
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:52,032	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Add to note the very thing one of the very things I love
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:53,056	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Recording has
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:58,688	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Killed people's ability to hear songs purely as core change
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,224	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Melody and lyric
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:01,760	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It's a very
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:05,088	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Strange and beautiful art form cuz when it's right
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:05,856	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Do you know it
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,136	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	But
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:08,928	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	What we have sort of Lost
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:10,208	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Is
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:12,768	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I don't have the best example I cried give would be
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:13,280	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Led Zeppelin
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:16,352	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Those things are the ultimate performance
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:18,912	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Pieces and I'm a big fan
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:21,728	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I think they're just absolutely astonishing
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:24,800	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	The sort of Dynamics they had
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:26,336	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Sorely lacking in music
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:26,848	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Today
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:28,896	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Record making is
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:29,408	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Great
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:33,248	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	A true band in the sense that you really could
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:35,040	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Tell who the individual
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:38,112	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Remarkable thing
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:39,392	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:41,184	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I don't
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:43,744	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Consider most of those things
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:45,280	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Songs
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:48,608	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And the way I can sort of prove my point is
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:54,752	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Have you ever listen to anybody else play Led Zeppelin song and got all that was a great satisfying experience
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:59,104	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Except for dread Zeppelin what people like
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:01,920	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Specific guitar sound that specific performance
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:04,992	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	In concert with that specific drum sound with that
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:06,784	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Pacific drummer playing that
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:07,552	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Pacific Park
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:12,672	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And it's beautiful it's a beautiful thing they're all different types of art
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:13,696	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Creative expression
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:15,232	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	However
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:17,536	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	If I were to sit and go here
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:28,544	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And I can play
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:31,360	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Ghetto 30 others that that's the thing
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:35,456	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You know I know it could sound like a snobbishness
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:36,224	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	It's not
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:37,760	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I love these records
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:39,808	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	They're great
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,344	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	However it is
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:44,416	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	There's a difference between
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:44,928	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Is that
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:46,464	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Anna song
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:48,512	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Say a Gershwin song
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:52,352	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	You could actually play in the style of Led Zeppelin and have it completely
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:58,752	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Satisfied Spirits all the time
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:37:05,152	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	When you start playing Zeppelin songs in the style of the 1920s music it's suddenly it's late
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,944	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	Oh no it was about those
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:08,224	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	People in those people were in a
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:13,344	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	And it was great and I loved it but I considered a performance piece
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:14,112	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	I consider
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:16,672	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	A lot of rocks people listen to
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,440	| 99pi-0269-waysofhearing-1 |	To be
