EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:06,976	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	These architectural leftovers rest or crumble or get taken down

EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:12,096	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And they remain in the urban organism
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:14,144	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And sometimes
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:16,960	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Even though they no longer serve
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:18,752	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Any discernible purpose whatsoever

EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,456	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Just because they're there
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:34,112	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	These architectural leftovers first caught the attention of an artist in Japan named a Cossack Elegante
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,904	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	This is a 1972
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:38,208	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	One day he was on his lunch break with some friends
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:41,024	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And as they were walking to lunch they came across this
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:41,536	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Staircase
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,072	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	That went up
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,352	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And then back down
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:46,144	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	But there is no door at the top
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,936	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	He basically just walked up
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,704	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And then walk back down
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:51,776	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And there was a piece of the railing that have been recently fixed
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,568	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Something clicked with him when he saw that
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:56,128	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Is Matt Fargo
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:58,688	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	He's translated into English
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,992	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Himself doesn't speak English
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:07,904	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And he's up there in the years and he's not currently doing any interviews but his passion for these City vestiges
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,184	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Bread to Matt Fargo
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:11,232	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Very rare for 1
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,256	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	There's not a lot of
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:14,048	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Facets of our life these days that are allowed to be
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:15,328	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Completely
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:21,728	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Urban leftovers as artistic byproducts of the city
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:25,056	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	He photographed all the things you can find that were both
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:26,848	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Vestigial and maintain
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:30,176	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	It began publishing his findings in a magazine column
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:32,736	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Company by musings about each object
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:34,016	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Set for example
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:37,600	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	This is what a casa Gala wrote about those stairs to nowhere
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:39,904	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Everything in our capitalist Society
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:41,440	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	To have a purpose
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:46,560	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	So where does that leave this particular staircase could you even call it a staircase
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:49,120	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	But I would let you keep into a window
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:50,656	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Of course you can
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,704	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	You can only call it art
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:54,496	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	A work of art
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:56,288	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Shaped like a staircase
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:04:01,664	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	People began to senda casa gala pictures of similar architectural leftovers that they found
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:06,272	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And it is call him a casa Gala would evaluate their submissions on two criteria
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:10,112	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Were they truly completely useless
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,136	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	+ 2
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,440	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Had they been recently maintained
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:20,095	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	In 1985 a casa Gala published a book of these collected photographs and writings
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:24,447	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Which Matt Fargo translated into English for the first time in 2009
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:24,959	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And of course
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:27,775	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Now Matt finds these things everywhere
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:30,079	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And they've changed the way he sees his around
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:31,103	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Architecture is
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,383	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Changing it
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,663	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Being amended
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:36,223	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	So it is fun to think about how how do we end up
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:37,503	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Where we are right now
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,807	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Instupendo weapon roof of how it

EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,879	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Static immutable thing
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:48,255	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	The changing nature of the city was especially clear to a casa Gala as a Japanese artist
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:51,327	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Japan's rapid reorganization after World War II
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:53,119	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Created a lot of these City vestiges

EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,863	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And then he was snatched up by another team

EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:04,287	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And he remained in this rut
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:06,591	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Until his contract ran out the following year
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,151	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	So you basically ended up
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:09,663	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Sitting on the bench
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,711	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And collecting a lot of money

EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,231	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And so this kind of

EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:39,775	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	So picture this
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,055	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	There's a drawbridge
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,103	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And on either side
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,383	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Adidas lifting arm Gates
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:49,247	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	You know like the barriers that lower at railroad crossings to keep a car from moving forward
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:52,831	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	But next to these modern lifting arm Gates
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,855	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Are the old model
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,391	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Or what's left of them
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,671	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Their arms were
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,207	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	But the bass
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:58,975	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Still there
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:00,255	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And this
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,791	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Old useless Bass
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,839	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Is still maintained
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,143	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	They actually took the trouble to move the damn thing
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,935	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	But they didn't remove it
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:10,751	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And they had it painted before
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,287	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	So we we
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:13,823	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Cannot figure out why it still here
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:16,895	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	They like to do the same color as the bridge black
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:23,039	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	It's kind of industrial black and these thomason's were some of the only indisputable examples that Claire and Allen found
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:25,087	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	There plenty of things are in the city that are just derelict
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,879	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	It's the maintenance
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,647	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	That makes it
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,415	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	A true Thompson
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:35,583	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Clarin Allen drove us to a loading dock by the San Francisco Marina and pointed out a staircase that let you know where
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:40,703	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Classic Thomasson upon closer look we weren't so certain I think
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,519	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	I don't think it has been repainted
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,055	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	If you look at the bottom
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:48,127	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Topeak Fades into inches
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,967	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Railings over there they're all
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,735	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Yeah in Ruston
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,271	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	So that
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,343	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	The four of us huddled around this
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:00,927	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Railing and try to figure out if the rest was painted over
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,975	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Which would mean that it was a Thomason
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:04,767	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Or the paint was rusted over
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,559	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Which would make it not a Thomas
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:10,399	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	It looks like it's freshly painted but then we're figuring it wasn't in that it
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,679	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Hasn't been used on
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,471	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	So that's why I didn't look like a
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,239	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	He doesn't have mixer
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:15,007	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Haircuts on it
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:17,567	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Business course is part of the fun of Thomason
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:20,127	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Anyone that does look at broken-down City parts
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:20,895	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	But it takes
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:23,455	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Active examination and attention
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:25,247	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	To assess if this object
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,015	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Is
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,295	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Truly useless
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,831	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And has been cared for
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:31,135	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Is detailed look and debate
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:34,719	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Is what a casa Gala was encouraging his writings and publications
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,791	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	I'm so we thought we would imitate that with our website
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,583	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Clear teamed up with Matt Fargo
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,351	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	The translator
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:44,191	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	To create a blog where people could offer up their own potential Thomason
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,471	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	For analysis and debate
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:52,383	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And I'm so people were actually using it and sending in there at the Thomas and small over
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,407	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	There are submissions
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	In this commentary as to whether or not they met the definition of a Thomason
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:01,599	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And we got a lot of really beautiful pictures that's transmitter Matt Fargo again
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,879	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And then one day
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:06,207	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	They got a submission that was definitely not
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:06,975	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Thomason
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:10,559	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Or maybe it was the truest Thomas end of the mall
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,839	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	One day we got one that was to
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,143	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Big picture of a middle finger
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,447	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And it said Thank you for

EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:17,727	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	My family
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,775	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Forever famous or something like that
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,311	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	News from Gary Thomas
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:21,823	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Daughter
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,919	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	That middle finger was a pretty clear sign
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,711	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	The Thomasson family
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,479	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Is not pleased
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:32,319	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	If indeed that is actually gay Thomas and his daughter he submitted it
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:36,159	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	But either way the family declined to comment for this story
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:38,719	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Brings us to another debate
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:40,511	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Me on whether or not something is a
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,023	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Thomason
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:44,351	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Is it fair to call these things Thomas ends
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:44,863	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	At all
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:49,471	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Gary Thomasson with a remarkable baseball player

EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:54,847	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And just being a professional baseball player in and of itself is amazing

EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:59,199	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Is about
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:02,015	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	The hardest thing to do in professional sports
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:02,783	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	If you are

EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:11,487	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Combine that with Thompson getting on in years the stress of living abroad
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:15,583	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	And any number of other things that could have been going on in his life at the time
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:19,167	| 99pi-0129-thomassons-1 |	Totally understandable that he wasn't the Slugger that he was
