EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:04,672	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Back in the 1930s
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:09,024	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Before noguchi you had a signature Museum and a namesake coffee table
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:11,584	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He was a struggling artist in New York City
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:14,144	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	We pay the bills by sculpting busts
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:14,656	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Rich people
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:17,984	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He called it head busting and he did it just to make money
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:23,360	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Or he said he did it just to make money but in truth he used it brilliantly is a way to Social Network
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:27,200	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And it was a way to romance the people who were his patrons
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:31,296	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He was as great a networker as he was a Sculptor
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:34,368	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Head busting wasn't exactly
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:34,880	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The feeling
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:36,416	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Do you want to think bigger
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:39,232	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Here's noguchi in an interview from the 70s
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:42,816	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The 1930s
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:43,584	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Having done
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:47,168	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Some more heads and being disgusted
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,960	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Doing heads
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,520	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Decide to get away you know
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:52,800	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Another dimension
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:56,384	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	That was the same thing that makes us go to the Moon
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,432	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Desire to get away
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:03,296	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	If you wanted to make art that would live in the world
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:06,624	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	I just in a rich person's home or on a gallery wall
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:10,208	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	You wanted to change the physical landscape that people moved
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:12,768	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Gucci said that he wanted people
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,560	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	To feel like the first person on earth
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:17,376	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The first person to explore
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:22,496	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And so he's hard to think of a concept for a giant public sculpture
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:25,056	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	It looked like a massive
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:26,080	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Massive
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:26,592	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Pyramid
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,896	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Imagine across
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,688	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Between a Mayan temple
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,712	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Gander Mountain
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,992	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Pushing up out of the Earth
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:35,552	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	With a long slide slipping down it
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:37,088	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Steps on two of its faces
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:42,976	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	It is it is a step pyramid essentially but on each side the steps are different heights
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,792	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And they were regular very symmetrical
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:48,608	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But it wasn't just a sculpture for a museum or a
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,376	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Bank Plaza
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:52,192	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi thought of it as a playground
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,472	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He called it
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,008	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Play Mountain
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:04:01,408	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	So he talked about play as the primer for a purposeful of pro
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,688	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Approach to space
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:08,832	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Trying to teach people to be more mindful of space and how we occupy it and how it works
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:15,232	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	This giant ziggurat wouldn't come with any Specific Instructions would have no rules no single
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:20,863	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Obvious way to play with it she wanted play Mountain to be a strange new landscape
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:23,935	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	It would dare children to imagine other realities
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:28,799	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	So that perhaps they could grow up into creative open-minded adults
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:35,199	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	I think you do cheat hope that by making playgrounds he could impact people at that
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:37,247	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Key stage in development
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:43,391	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In fact the inspiration for play mountain when he was at those keys dates himself
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:44,927	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	When he was a little boy
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:49,535	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Isamu noguchi was born in Los Angeles in 1904
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:52,351	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	His father yone was a famous Japanese poet
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:55,679	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	His mother was a white American writer named leonie Gilmour
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:05:00,287	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	They met when she answered an ad he placed in the paper for a translator and assistant
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:02,847	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Pretty much as soon as a Simon was born
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,383	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Unity abandoned
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,175	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And went back to Japan
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:08,735	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi and his mother eventually follow
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:11,807	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But his father had already started another family by then
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:15,135	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Gucci and his mother moved to a Countryside town
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:19,743	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Where noguchi's bright blue eyes marked him as an outsider to the other kids at school
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:22,815	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	His childhood was pretty lonely
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,375	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But from their little house
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:28,447	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In a little town they lived in on the seaside
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:30,751	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	They did have a great view of Mount Fuji
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:34,847	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Spec Fuji quite far away so like just a perfect little pyramid
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:40,479	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	So you can imagine that view that's a little boy has every day going down the stairs scene Mount Fuji
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:45,087	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	That idea of his own Mount Fuji stuck with noguchi
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:48,415	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	If I owe them money move to Indiana as a teenager
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:51,487	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	It followed him to Paris review Prentice with the Sculptor brancusi
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,791	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	I came with him to New York City
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,583	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The place that he decided would become his home
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:08,895	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The Gucci Road play Mountain was my response based on memory of my own unhappy childhood
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:11,711	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The desolate playground on a cliff in Tokyo
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:13,503	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Which I approached with Dread
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:17,087	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	It may be that this is how I tried to join the city
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:17,599	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	New York
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,391	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	HIPAA law
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:23,743	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Knew she wanted to move the mountain from his lonely childhood
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,023	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And reincarnated
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,815	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Is a place for gathering in playing
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,095	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	As a kind of
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,631	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Gift to the children of New York
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:34,239	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And after years and years of carrying that Concept in his head
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:35,775	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He got his big break
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,847	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In 1934
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:41,919	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	One of the fancy people noguchi had made a bust of
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,967	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Help them get a meeting with Robert Moses
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:47,551	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The newly-appointed commissioner of the New York City Parks Department
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:51,903	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Moses had said his number one priority was to build more playgrounds in the city
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,207	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Which at the time and very few
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:57,023	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Taguchi decided to bring him his idea
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:59,583	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi brought Moses a model of play mount
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:02,911	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	2 feet square in white Plaster on a wooden frame
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:05,983	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Designed to take up an entire New York city block
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,287	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi carries this
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,591	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Meter Mountain to Robert Moses office
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:13,407	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Then sit down on Robert Moses desk
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:16,735	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And says what if we know we built this for the children of the

EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,183	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	No way
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:28,767	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The playgrounds Moses Envision were symbol
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:32,863	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Asphalt or dirt surrounded by chain-link fence
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:35,423	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	With the four s's of playground equipment

EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,287	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	All made out of steel
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:44,383	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Moses was planning just the four s's in vacant Lots
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:47,199	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	All over the city by the hundreds
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:53,599	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	With this massive ambiguous otherworldly Urban Mountain
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:56,415	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Which would have required the movement of huge amounts of Earth
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,183	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And concrete
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,719	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Probably would have cost a ton of money
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,607	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	No way dope
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:07,423	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Play Kyrie 4S is I'm just going to order them
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,983	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And like we're going to be out 400 playgrounds by tomorrow
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:16,639	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Robert Moses dead end up erecting 658 playgrounds in New York as Parks commissioner
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,943	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But from this moment on
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:19,967	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Tienda Gucci
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:21,759	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Became the lifelong enemies
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:27,391	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He took his model and went home fuming and he fumed about it for the rest of his life really
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:32,255	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The concept of play Mountain remained very close to noguchi's hard
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,791	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Is a Gucci himself wrote
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:38,911	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Play Mountain was the kernel out of which have grown all my ideas relating sculpture
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,423	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	To the Earth
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:43,263	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Play Mountain represented this idea that noguchi had
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,823	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The children didn't need instructions to play
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,871	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	With say
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,895	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Swing Zara slide
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,431	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Is only one way to use them
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:54,015	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Kids just do the same prescribed activities over and over again
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:57,343	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But if you give children an abstract
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,623	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Surreal landscape
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:01,439	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	They can interpret it however they want
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:05,535	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	We can make up stories and have adventures and use their intuition
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,071	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	To play in a thousand different ways
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,887	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	This philosophy would later be called
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:11,679	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Non-directive play
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,959	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:14,239	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	This was the way that
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:16,287	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Sculpture could be out in the world
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,335	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	I'm really change the way people move
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,103	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And think
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,895	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He wasn't going to give up on it so easily
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,711	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In 1939
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:27,551	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi offered to design a playground for Honolulu Ala Moana Park
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,575	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But that fell through
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,367	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Bill not discouraged
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:33,439	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Nicotine patches his Hawaii playground ideas
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,719	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Back to the New York parks
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:35,999	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Again
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,279	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Again he gets rejected
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,839	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi is relentless
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:42,143	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Enso noguchi
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,191	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Still excited by the challenge
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:46,495	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	When Austin design Contour playground
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:49,567	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Contoured playground is really gentle
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:55,711	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Basically a smooth abstracted landscape of sloping Hills and Dales and riverbeds
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:58,527	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	It's still a non-directive playground
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,295	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But it's very subtle
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:00,831	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	This time
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:03,135	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	New York parks department actually seems
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:03,647	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Open today
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:07,231	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	I even start talking about finding a spot in Central Park to build
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:10,559	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But by then was 1941
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:13,631	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And the Gucci's plants were about to change
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:18,751	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi was in California
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:19,519	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Visiting a friend
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:22,079	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He was out shopping for some Onyx for a sculpture
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:24,895	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	That I was on my way to San Diego
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:27,455	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And I can turn on the radio and that's where I heard
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:41,535	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Am I really need a reaction was oh my God I'm a dumb in Japanese
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:44,607	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Nisei are Americans born to Japanese parents
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:47,167	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	With the US entering World War I
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,727	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Country playground was forgotten
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,263	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	By both the parks department and the Gucci
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,567	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	They were bigger Stakes now
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:56,895	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	I want to be able to help in some way
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:59,199	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi started to link up with other nisei
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:01,503	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Looking for ways to make it clear to the government
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:03,551	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But they were firmly on the American side of the war
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:09,183	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Intention was that we would contract the bad press
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:12,255	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Stop.
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:15,071	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But that hysteria was quickly coming to a head
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:19,423	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Barely two months after Pearl Harbor
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:23,519	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	President Roosevelt signed executive order 99066
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:29,407	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Executive Order 9066 gives the American Military the right to declare martial law
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:32,735	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In any part of the country that it deems necessary
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,015	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	To protect the Homeland
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:38,367	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And that's with the understanding that in the Western United States
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:41,183	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	David Roundup the Japanese American population
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:44,767	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Evacuation orders with fast-approaching deadlines
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:46,047	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Started landing on
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:46,815	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	People's doorsteps
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:56,543	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	My car in Los Angeles
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:03,967	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi had always been good at finding exactly the right person for the movement
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:05,503	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In This Moment
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:07,295	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He needed someone to help him take action
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,343	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	So he found him
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,367	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In Washington DC
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,903	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	So I went to Washington
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:15,487	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	You know what I can do
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:22,143	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	John Collier was the head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:25,983	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Because the government needed to build the internment camps in large
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:28,287	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Open areas of federally controlled land
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:31,615	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He decided to do two of them on Native American reservations
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:36,223	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Which meant that the actual undertaking of building and running these camps
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:38,015	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Woodfall to John Colliers Department
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:41,087	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	John Collier was relatively Progressive
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:45,695	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He wanted to give tribal governments more autonomy and support Native American culture
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:46,975	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And then
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,743	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Suddenly
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:51,071	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Have been given the task of Designing and building prison camps
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:53,119	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	On reservation land
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:55,423	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi reach out to him
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:02,079	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi and Collier started talking about what they could do with this assignment
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,895	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Now that there was no way to prevent internment from happening
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:06,431	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	What do they cook time
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:12,063	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And this is going to sound so crazy but in a way they cooked up what was a utopian scheme
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:13,343	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:15,647	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	From their point of view if it's going to happen
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,671	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Let's make it
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,463	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	As good as it can possibly be
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:21,791	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi Drew up a suite of plans for the largest of the
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:22,303	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Camps being built
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,119	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The one at Poston Arizona
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:31,263	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	I make plans for the park
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:35,359	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi Chuck the rigid grid of a military-style camp
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:37,663	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	With rows and rows of tarpaper barracks
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:40,223	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And cutting Avenue right down the middle of
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,271	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Lined with public services
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:45,855	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Schools in gardens Hospital

EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:56,095	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Zoo botanical gardens Sports fields and a mini golf course and
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,119	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Playground
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:01,215	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	What you're looking at is what he thinks the key parts of
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:02,239	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Civilization art
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:08,639	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	You have a huge population of people who have been removed from their lives and artificially plunked down in the
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:09,407	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The middle of nowhere
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,967	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Where do they are expected to live
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:14,015	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Quote on quote what does that mean what is the light
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,063	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	What does life consist of
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:19,135	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	How would what does it need to be real to feel real
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,695	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The playground is critical to it
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:26,303	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The plans themselves are pretty unbelievable
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:29,375	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But the really wild thing is that
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:33,471	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Even though Japanese internment only affected people living on the West Coast
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:35,775	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And maybe she was living on the East Coast
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,567	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi and Collier decide
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:41,151	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi should actually go to this concentration camp in Poston Arizona
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:42,687	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Voluntarily
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,735	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And leave it there while he carried out his plan
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:47,039	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And that's how I happened
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:50,623	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The camp was being constructed in the middle of the desert
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:53,439	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The southwestern part of Arizona
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,743	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	On the Colorado River Indian Reservation
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,791	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Who is hardly anything
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:59,071	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	For miles around
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:01,119	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Scrubby brush and dust
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,911	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Mountains in the far distance
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:06,495	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Sanducci got to post in like a week before it opened
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:15,455	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And I was hungry
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:22,367	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi was giving his own room and thought he'd soon be getting to work on realizing his vision for utopian
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,671	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	This was a guy who plunged
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,975	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Play Mountain down in front of Robert Moses
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,743	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And said
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,023	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Let's build this for kids
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:32,095	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Estranged hopefulness knew no limits
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,655	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Resume is the camp opened
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:36,703	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	It became painfully clear taniguchi
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:39,775	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But the people weren't coming there for an idyllic new lifestyle
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:41,823	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	They were prisoners
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:46,943	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Do the camp administrators from the war relocation Authority
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:47,967	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi looked
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:49,503	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Just like another one of the prisoners
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:52,063	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	I wouldn't give him the time of day
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:54,367	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Because he had some special privileges
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:56,927	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The other internees assumed he was the traitor
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,463	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In Cahoots with the camp administrators
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:01,023	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He immediately realized he was
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:06,655	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He was sort of the worst of Both Worlds because he was just in an attorney from the administration's point of view
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:10,495	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And he was a turncoat like a spy
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:12,799	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	From the other entries point of view
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:15,871	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	After about two months at Poston
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:20,991	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi realize that the war relocation Authority had no interest in making it a nice place to live
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,783	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	They ran it like a prison
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,599	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Because it was a prison camp
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:30,719	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	All of John Colliers and micucci's idealistic plans were ignored
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:34,559	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	See if there was no chance of doing what he'd come to do
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,607	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi decided to move on
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:38,143	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He figured he'd just
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:39,679	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Go back to normal life
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:42,751	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Mina famous artist in hanging out with his famous artist friend
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,287	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And they wouldn't let him
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,847	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Which was definitely
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:47,871	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Not a part of the plan
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,687	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	You no idea that he wouldn't be able to leave
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,855	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi with suddenly
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:58,367	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Prisoner
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:02,463	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Have you made enemies of attorneys and administrators alike
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:04,255	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He spent most of his time alone
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,791	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	With nothing to do
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,351	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Person with a bleak
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,119	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Aaron place
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:11,423	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Almost every day there was
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,191	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Triple-digit Heat
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:15,263	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Huge dust storms tearing through
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:17,055	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Coming in through the thin walls of the barracks
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,615	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Getting stuck in your bed and your mouth
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,383	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In your eyes
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:23,455	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi wrote to one of his famous friends
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,479	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The artist Man Ray
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:28,831	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Quote here time has stopped and nothing is of any
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,879	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Nothing of any value
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,671	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Neither our time
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,439	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Or our skill
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,975	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The world
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,743	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Is nuts
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,815	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	After 7 months
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:41,119	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And many many letters and phone calls
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:43,935	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	John Collier was able to get noguchi out
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:49,055	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And he never
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:49,567	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Went back
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:57,759	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	It's hard to know what to make of noguchi's failed mission to post in
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:00,575	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And it kind of leads to this deeper question
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,879	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Does it even make sense
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:05,439	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	To try to find Joy or beauty
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:06,719	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Playfulness
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:08,511	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In a system that's
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,791	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Just fundamentally
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:11,327	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Awful
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:11,839	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	You know
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:15,423	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Trying to make a prison better when the prison shouldn't exist
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:16,703	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Critic Alexander Lane
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:18,751	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Like he thought he could
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:21,055	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Make this internment camp more Humane but it's
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,359	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Is it inhumane endeavour
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:26,431	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The whole experience was painful for noguchi
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:28,735	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	His goals have been so compassionate going in
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,295	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Racism in fear and bureaucracy
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:32,831	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Kill those dreams
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,879	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And then imprison him
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:36,159	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	When he tried to help
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:40,255	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	New York 1940
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:48,703	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	I've had about enough
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:58,943	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	After posting
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:01,503	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The idea of Designing Public Works
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,527	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And playgrounds
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,295	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Must have seemed
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,343	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Wrong somehow
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:08,415	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	How could you think about play
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,183	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	When there's so much
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:09,951	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Cruelty in the world
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,279	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In fact in 1943
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:15,583	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The year after noguchi gets out of post in
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:17,119	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	It makes this sculpture called
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,143	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	This tortured Earth
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:21,727	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Which is like the nightmare version of his model for
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,495	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Contoured playground
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,543	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Twisted landscape
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:27,103	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	It looks like it's been stabbed and torn with a knife
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:31,967	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But once he was back in New York noguchi put Post in behind him
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:33,759	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He threw himself into the art scene
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:39,391	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He's designing Furniture he's making sculpture he's building a career New York City
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:43,487	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Play Gucci steps back from his utopian ideas about art and sculpture
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:48,095	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And this is the. When you design some of the things he's most famous for today
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:50,655	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Including the iconic coffee table
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:53,471	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The Gucci's career in sculpture really took off
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:58,847	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And you also got to design other kinds of environments he designed and sets for Martha Graham
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:20:02,687	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And sculpture Gardens for corporations like IBM Chase Bank
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:08,831	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He was smoothing up a storm becoming a household name and a real star of mid-century Art and Design
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:12,159	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Maybe she has that hunger in my soul
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:14,975	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Something more meaningful than the New York art scene
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:18,559	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He still wants to make something that can transcend a gallery space
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:22,143	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And that is because again I have this feeling that
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:25,983	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Culture was an important part of the living experience
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:29,567	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Something for electives
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:37,759	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	After a decade of looking inward indulging in the Adoration of the art world and recovering from posting
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:40,063	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi turns his sights back
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,087	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The playground
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:44,415	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Shake that realization that he had
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:46,463	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The playgrounds were actually
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,743	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The perfect way
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:49,791	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Sculptor to make real change in the world
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:53,631	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	3 tried two more times to build playgrounds for New York
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,167	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Once in 1950
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,703	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	At the new UN building
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:58,495	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And another in the early sixties
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:20:59,775	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Riverside Park
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:04,127	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And again noguchi's playground plans were shot down by the city
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:06,431	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But something was different
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,711	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And those round 2 projections
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:09,759	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Because noguchi was now
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:11,039	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Mega famous

EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:23,072	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	So other Architects artists and designers
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,096	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Started copying
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:31,264	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	So there are fair number of people in the fifties and sixties making abstract concrete forms and saying that they

EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:37,120	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:38,912	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Right here on the 99.
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:47,616	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	2 year old boy named Frank Nelson was climbing a 12 ft tall slide in the Chicago Park
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:49,920	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Because that's just how tall slides used to be
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:54,016	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He spoke to the railing off the steps and hit his head on hard ass
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:55,552	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:57,344	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Has permanent brain damage
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:00,672	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Frank became paralyzed on his left side
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:04,512	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Ear problems with vision and speech and had to wear a helmet

EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:08,608	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	So there's this big lawsuit where the
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:11,936	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Park system of Chicago has to pay out millions of dollars
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:13,984	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	9.5 million dollars
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:14,496	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Be exact
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:17,056	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The accident was in 1978
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:18,592	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And it changed ever
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:20,640	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The time
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,664	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	There were no laws
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:26,016	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Or real industry standards even when it came to the safety of playground equipment
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:30,368	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But Frank Nelson's fall was one of a number of lawsuits
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:33,440	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Led the consumer product safety commission to publish
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,464	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Handbook
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:36,000	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	For public playground safety
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:37,280	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In 1981
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:40,096	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Then another standards organization
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:42,400	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The ASTM published its own guide
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:44,960	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Pretty soon these Robux

EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:11,584	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	When I do a search YouTube video that a certified playground safety inspector uses to advertise his services

EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:21,312	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	They're all different sizes each approximating different child size body

EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:26,432	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Procure wish I could

EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:33,856	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Defeat would go in and then they had we get stuck so obviously we don't want that to happen
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:40,000	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And safety inspectors basically tried jamming these probes into every space or gap on a playground
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,792	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Looking for places where
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:43,072	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Kids could fall or get
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:44,352	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Pinch poke.

EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:48,192	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Obviously no one wants kids getting hurt on playground
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:50,752	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But as you might imagine
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:55,104	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	All these rules and regulations make the job of a playground designer
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:56,128	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	A lot harder

EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:43,232	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	It's going to look like that
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:45,024	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	A slide is a slide
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:46,816	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Your ability
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:49,888	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Almost
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:54,496	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Theoretically we've loved the idea of a special or unusual playground
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:57,056	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Like even within Tom's company
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:28:00,384	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	They want to manufacture beautiful new forms for kids to play on
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:02,176	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Are executives
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:03,456	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	You know they're like
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:05,248	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	We want to slide that nobody's ever thought
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:08,064	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	You got to be more creative than that and I'm like ice
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:11,136	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	You know what I hear you don't want to read the rule book
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,416	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Cuz that's going to bore you

EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:16,256	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Trust me it is what it is
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:20,096	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	So the playgrounds that you see everywhere
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,376	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Neighborhood parks
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:22,912	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	School yards
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:24,704	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	They still all look
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:25,984	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	More or less the same
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:27,008	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The majority of players
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:28,800	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	On the market today
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:31,360	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Are what we refer to as post index system
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:33,664	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Post index systems are also called
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:35,456	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Post and platform playground
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:37,760	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And with those you have Dax
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:38,784	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And you have stairs
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:40,320	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Bears and uibe pathways
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,624	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The post and platform equipment
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:44,416	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Essentially combines
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,696	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Swing slide
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:52,096	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And monkey bars into one piece of equipment is made of plastic parts in bright
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:53,120	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Primary colors
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:55,936	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Sometimes the parts are connected with Pathways cover
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:56,704	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Grooves
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:57,728	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Sometimes with Bridges
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:59,520	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But there are steps
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:02,336	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Find letters coming off the platforms at every turn
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:03,872	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Blocking kids
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:04,640	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	It's from being able to just
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,176	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Step off
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:07,456	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The platform into space
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:09,760	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	That agglomeration is kind of in
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:11,040	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Responsible safety standards
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:13,344	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Post and platform playground
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:16,416	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Definitely have more variety than the 4S is that
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:17,696	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Robert Moses was into
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:19,744	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	On the music style playgrounds
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:23,328	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Kids were just moving from one repetitive activity to the next
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:26,656	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	At least with posting platform structures
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:30,240	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Kids can make some decisions about how to get onto the platform
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:32,032	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And then how to get down from it again
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:37,408	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But still posting platform playgrounds are all remixes of the same basic
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:40,224	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Cat it's time for a change a little bit
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:41,760	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	This is Scott Roshe
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:43,552	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Creative director at landscape structure
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:46,880	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In addition to the standard playground kits
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:49,440	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Landscape structures also designs custom playground
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:51,488	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The clients that can afford them
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:54,816	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Actually one of Scott's big inspiration
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:57,120	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Is the work of isamu noguchi
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:30:02,752	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Designs of today hours are echoing a lot of what what noguchi's concepts were
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:05,824	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The kind of abstract playgrounds that new Gucci inspired
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:07,104	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Are starting to re-emerge
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:09,152	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	We're starting to bring them back
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:10,944	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In a lot of custom playground design
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:14,272	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Pretty special projects Scott works with a lot of landscape
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:17,600	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Moving Earth around and experimenting with new form
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:21,696	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	We've been to playgrounds that we've designed that are very abstract
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:25,536	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And where parents literally say I don't know
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:26,304	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	How
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:27,328	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	This is supposed to work
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:29,120	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	That's the best
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:33,984	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And this goes back to noguchi's concept of non-directive play
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:37,056	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	If adults are confused by a piece of play equipment
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:38,848	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	It often means that kids
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:40,128	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Will be all over it
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:42,176	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The kids are going to figure it out there
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:44,224	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	They're going to attack it they're going to
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:47,552	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Go and have fun they're going to make it
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:48,064	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Play
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:50,624	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	We don't have to tell them how to do that
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:52,672	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	We can make it safe and
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:55,488	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Last a long time and look beautiful but man
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:57,024	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Let them play
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:01,888	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	This Resurgence of abstract playgrounds is still developing
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:04,448	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But special destination playground
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:07,264	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	I'm sorry experimenting with new materials and processes
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:12,640	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	They're able to make forms that would have been astronomically expensive to produce and noguchi's time
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:14,688	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Contemporary designers
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:19,040	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Are now starting to push back against convention and play with more abstract shapes
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:22,368	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	4 communities that can afford custom playground
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:26,208	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	So I feel like there are people that are pushing the envelope
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:30,816	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And you know it's expensive to start out with but if more people adopt this
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:31,584	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Equipment
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:32,352	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	The price group
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:32,864	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Come down
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:36,704	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Although there are no playgrounds in New York City with Nucci's name on them
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:38,240	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Is ideas
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:40,800	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	About imagination in Freedom to play
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:42,592	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	I've left a deep mark
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:43,616	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	On playground designers
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:46,944	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And are affecting the emerging playgrounds all around us
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:51,552	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi could have never imagined the long shadow of his ideas
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:54,368	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Is greatest Concepts
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,392	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Had never been made
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:02,048	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	That's a recording from 1973
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:03,584	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	At that point
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:05,888	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi had only ever seen one of his playground
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,936	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Kind of built in Japan
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:11,264	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	A few years later he designed another one in Atlanta
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:15,104	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But both of these were nothing close to his true
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:15,872	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Play Mountain vision
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:17,664	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	His own City
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,176	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	New York
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:20,736	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Have rejected him five times
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:24,832	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Never found a way to break through a New York even after Moses was gone
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:26,880	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	For various reasons there's always a reason
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:28,928	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But I am usually frustrating
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:30,208	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	This was his home
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:36,608	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi's model for play Mountain remain on display in his studio in Long Island City
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:38,656	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Unrealised dream
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:39,168	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In miniature
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:42,752	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	That is until January of 1988
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:48,384	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	A man from Sapporo Japan comes and visits noguchi and is going around his Studio
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:49,152	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In Long Island
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:49,920	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	City
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:54,528	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And he says you know what like I I can get one of your playgrounds built in
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:55,296	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	In Sapporo
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:55,808	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Japan
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:58,368	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	At this point in 1988
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:00,416	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi is 84 years old
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:05,280	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	He goes out to visit this marshy site in Sapporo called moerenuma Park
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:06,816	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	It's just
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:08,096	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Perfect
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:10,144	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	This is the spot
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:12,704	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Foreplay Mountain would finally live
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:17,312	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi started designing play structures and Earthworks for the park
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:20,896	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	With his longtime collaborator the architect shouji sit down
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:23,456	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	But in the winter of that year
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:24,736	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	I came down with a cold
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:26,528	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	How many came back to New York
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:28,832	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	They turned into pneumonia
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:29,600	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	And he died
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:33,696	| 351_Play_Mountain_pt_01 |	Noguchi died on December 30th 1988
