EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:57,504	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Hello
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:02:00,064	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	We are Anonymous over the years
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:01,600	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	We have been watching you
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:03,904	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	First off we should describe what anonymous
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:07,744	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	It's not an organization it is a non organization
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:09,792	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	What sort of ever-changing Band of individual
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:12,864	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Sometimes described as hackers or hacktivists
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:14,656	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Store free expression zealots
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:19,520	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	So are just internet troublemakers you can't even call him a group I tend to call them
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,056	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	We are anonymous
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:25,920	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And for someone who writes extensively about Brands and brand identity
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:31,040	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Rob Walker became intrigued
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:32,320	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Magazine and
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,904	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Because this non group called anonymous
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,208	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Somehow created its own
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:44,608	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Visual identity it was so compelling and immediately recognizable which is a task that corporations are political camp
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:47,168	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	I think spend millions and millions of dollars
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,936	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	To achieve
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:51,776	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And these people seem to have done something very effective
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:57,664	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Without any organization or any budget for even any
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:02,016	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	There are two basic images used for anonymous
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:04,576	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	What is a logo headless figure in a suit
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,856	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Juxtaposed against
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:08,416	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Kind of world map
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:09,952	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Very
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:11,488	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Blatantly derive
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,768	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	From the United Nations
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:14,304	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Globe
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,352	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	With a?
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,704	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	The other major visual image is a mess
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:27,616	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Are there is a sort of stylized vicinage based on Guy Fawkes although no one real
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,384	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Recognize
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:28,896	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Guy Fawkes
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:33,248	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Is the mask worn by the protagonist in The Graphic novel and then movie
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,272	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	V for Vendetta
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:37,600	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	The original mask design was by the artist David Lloyd
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:40,928	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And it comes in handy when you're trying to stay Anonymous in the real world
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:43,488	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And it is sort of bleached over into
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,280	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Adjust Street protest
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:49,888	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Street protests liking non-affiliated Occupy Wall Street movie
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:59,360	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Anonymous has its roots in the anonymous postings on these / B / message board on 4chan.org
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:04,480	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	I would openly discourage your listeners from visiting the / B / message board
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:05,760	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,296	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Some things you just
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,576	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Can't unsee
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,112	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	See it's really
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:16,512	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Pretty harsh together as a kind of movement when they decide to take on the Church of Scientology
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:19,327	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	There was an embarrassing video of Tom Cruise
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:24,447	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	That people were posting and people representing the Church of Scientology were taking it down
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:32,639	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Anonymous had a problem with that
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:35,967	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Because of their kind of General free expression
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:41,599	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Point of view and decided that they would band together and keep reposting that video and then
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:45,695	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	That sort of escalated into what else can we do
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:48,767	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	To basically cause problems for the Church of Scientology
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:52,095	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	It was an ominous YouTube video producer
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:53,631	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Buy a small subset of a
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:56,191	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	We're more unified voice
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:56,959	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Spaghetti for
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:59,007	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	I was absolutely blown away by this
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:01,823	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	It's directed to the Church of Scientology
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:03,871	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	It's not directed To The World At Large
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:05,919	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Attention
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:06,943	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Scientology
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,479	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	We are anonymous
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,247	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And here's what we have
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:09,759	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Say
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:12,063	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And we're coming after you
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:14,623	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And we recognize you as a formidable opponent
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:17,695	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	But we're going to take you down
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,743	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And the visuals
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,279	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	It's just sort of rolling
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,815	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Clouds over buildings
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,863	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And this is kind of ominous
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:28,703	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Music playing in the background and the voiceover
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:29,983	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Is this
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,007	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Robot voice
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:33,055	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Which turned out to be an online AT&T tech
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,359	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	But it sounds really
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:38,175	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	There are a few notable moments
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:38,943	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Send turns off
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:41,503	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	The phrase in the video but the first one to grab Rob's attention
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:44,063	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	We are Anonymous and we're going to do this
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:50,975	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	For the good of your own followers for the good of mankind and for our own amusement ind4

EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:58,399	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Really encapsulates this like we're righteous and we just sort of feel like doing this right now cuz we
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:05:58,911	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	We find it fun
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,727	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Which is really kind of a scary combination
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,263	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Of ideas
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:06,591	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	The video ends with what has become the anonymous tagline
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:12,735	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And parts of this tagline I learned had been kind of floating around on 4chan at slash
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,503	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Splash board
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:15,295	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	We are anonymous
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,319	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	We Are Legion

EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,207	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Expect this is so like
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:26,303	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	You know you just almost immediately want to serve freeze up with
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,583	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Your keyboard and look over your shoulder
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:29,375	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	If they're there
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:38,079	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Around the same time as this video the apprehension headless suit man in front of the UN flag logo was created
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:41,919	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Again using elements that have been floating around these / B / board
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:42,943	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	For quite some time
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,479	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Elsa created a website
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,503	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And all this because
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,575	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	A media Savvy member of anonymous
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,599	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Warn the others
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:51,391	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	But if they didn't brand themselves
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:52,671	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Someone else
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,183	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Would do it for the
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,999	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	You need some kind of a solid identity
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:57,791	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Setopress
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:00,607	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Because they're going to they're going to come up with their own
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,399	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	If you don't and you want to control that message
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:06,751	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Rob Walker got the inside story of the early days of anonymous from Greg house
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,031	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Who is part of the
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,823	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Early planners
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,847	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Various
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,615	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Anonymous actions
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,151	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	You could say Direct
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,175	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	The action
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,199	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	But you know what
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,735	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Anonymous everyone knows that you
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,783	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	You can only make suggestions that if they're good enough
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:20,319	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Don't do it
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,647	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Ignored in the process
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:24,671	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Of being
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:26,207	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Bombastic
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:26,975	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	They could tour
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:27,487	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Scientology
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,047	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	They sort of accidentally created
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,351	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Ominous

EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:39,007	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	So this video that they did took off
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:41,823	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Currently it has over four and a half million views
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,615	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And it decided the next logical
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,383	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	.
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,151	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Was Street protein
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:50,015	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	We decided right then and there that that's what we're going to ask everyone to do we're going to send the internet
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:50,783	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Outside

EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:10,495	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	He means the V for Vendetta mask
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,263	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	That's kind of
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:13,567	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	A Batman mask
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:18,687	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Floating that night was old school masquerade masks
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:22,783	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Where you would actually hold the little stick and hold it up
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:26,367	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And then they got really pragmatic about their choice
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:27,391	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	We called around 2
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,439	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Comic book shops and cost
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:32,511	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Shoe shops in most of the major cities of the world from

EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,399	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And we ask
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:40,959	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	What do they cost
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,007	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And it won't be found

EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,591	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	It just caught fire
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:20,895	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	A powerful thing
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,431	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Sort of sot
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:27,039	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Another quality of the V for Vendetta mask is that
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,575	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Has its own
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:31,391	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Twisted version of a Mona Lisa smile
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,159	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	That you can
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:34,207	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And quite figure out if he's laughing
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:35,487	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Or mean
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:40,095	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Or laughing at you in a mean way having fun and Menace
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:44,959	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	You know it's not really that surprising that those two ideas
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:48,799	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	It is a statement of anonymity of personal privacy
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:50,591	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	But it's also a statement
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,615	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Of
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,151	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Wild freedom of expression
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:54,687	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:55,967	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Absolutely
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:58,015	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Through a combination of Mirth
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:04,415	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	I asked Rob Walker why he thinks he's too images
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:07,487	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	The Headless suit man and the V for Vendetta mask work
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,279	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	He gives two basic reasons
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,327	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	One is that they're just
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,095	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Graphically
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:12,607	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Pleasing
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:16,447	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	People up is like what is your empirical proof that this is
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,215	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Is good
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:18,751	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	I don't really have any empirical
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:20,543	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	What I have is
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,103	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	I look at it and I say that's awesome
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:28,223	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And the second reason is that the two symbols are easy to manipulate
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,759	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Very
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,527	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Simple graphics
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,295	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Program
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,319	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	You can put
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,855	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	The Guy Fawkes mask
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:34,879	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Over the Hedge
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:38,463	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Why are you can manipulate these things in any number of ways
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:39,999	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Which is
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,023	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	A strategy that
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:42,303	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Traditional
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,095	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Say corporate brand
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:44,863	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Or political
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,399	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Wouldn't
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,679	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Maybe not be so into
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:52,543	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	But in this case there was no creative brief there was no set of brand
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,311	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And standards
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:56,383	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	People just seem to intuitively know that you can
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,687	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Play around with these things
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,223	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Hand drawn the
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:00,735	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Power of the
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,527	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	But make them your own
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:05,343	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And in the making them your own
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:06,879	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	You're doing it in a way
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,439	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	That rebounds back to the original images
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:15,839	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	And that's just like the message board meme culture that
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,631	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Anonymous to begin with
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:20,447	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	You can make the images your own and be one of them
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:24,287	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	Are use it for your own purposes and have nothing to do with Anonymous at all
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:27,103	| 42-Recognizably-Anonymous |	No one will know the difference
