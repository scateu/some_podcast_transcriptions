EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:05,184	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Even during the construction of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge which was to become the third longest suspension bridge in the world
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,976	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	It seemed like something was wrong
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:11,072	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Willy's in hindsight it seems like it should have felt that way
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:12,096	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	But that's not

EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:22,592	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Moment
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:28,736	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Where the roadrunners dashing off the cliff and the coyote is following him in the Roadrunner can fly
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:34,112	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	There's this great moment where he's run off the cliff but he does not yet realize that

EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:40,000	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	The moment when we were wrong about something
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:41,792	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	But before we realized it is like that
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,072	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	We think
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:43,840	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	That
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:44,608	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	I believe

EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,752	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	We feel like our God suspension
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:53,056	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Bridge is not going to collapse
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:53,824	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Down and realized
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:03,040	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	I know it sounds crazy but even during its construction the deck of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:05,344	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	We go up and down by several feet
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:06,880	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	With the slightest Breeze
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:09,696	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Construction workers on the Spanish food on Lemon wedges

EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:18,400	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Because the bridge have been designed specifically to withstand winds up to 120 miles per hour
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:19,680	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	To everyone
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:20,704	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Thought everything
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,240	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Would be fine
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:26,080	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Well almost everyone
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:31,456	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	The original Tacoma Narrows Bridge designed by Clark Eldridge was pretty conventional for suspension bridge
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:34,528	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	It was later Modified by Leon moiseff
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:35,808	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	To be Slimmer more elegant
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:40,160	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	The most notable change was the 25-foot
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:43,488	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Lattice of stiffening trusses underneath the bridge on the original drawings
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,024	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Replace
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:47,840	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	With an 8-foot solid steel plate girder
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:51,936	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	The new solid gutter along the side and wasn't design
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,472	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Made for a much lighter
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:55,520	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Slimmer and more flexible Bridge
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,080	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	It also got the wind like a sail
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,616	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	But they didn't know that
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:04,992	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Moises design was also 2/3 the price of the original Eldridge design
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,272	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	And that fact
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,552	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Ultimately won the day
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:11,392	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Eldridge and other state Engineers were said to a protest in
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:12,672	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	But it didn't matter
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:19,839	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	The original Tacoma Narrows Bridge open to the public on July 1st 1940
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:23,935	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	They opened it was prone to having these oscillation
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:28,287	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	That's our Master of Disaster John Moore can I write on
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:31,359	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Various murders and disasters mother rum Sunday topics
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:35,455	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	You supposed to Zine called Mercury can be fun about these sundry topics
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:41,855	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	He wrote about the Tacoma Narrows Bridge years ago workers on a bridge and nicknamed The Galloping Gertie in that game quickly
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:48,255	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	China became the bridges unofficial name even light winds caused the roadway to Ripple with longitudinal wave some 5 feet
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:53,887	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	The state of Washington was unconcerned about this but not like intensely so they're like looking at
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:58,239	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Various things to reduce the motion to try some tie-down cables and installing a damper in
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,031	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Very sad things
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:06,431	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Again the roadbed seem like you can handle the waves just fine they're very confident in their structural integrity
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:11,551	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	The bridge was a solid as they are underneath Wylie Coyote
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:19,743	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	When you watch film of the waves traveling down the bridge
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:20,511	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	It is
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:24,095	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Donnie the fact the bridge stayed open at all
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:28,703	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Really illustrates how local governments have changed since 1940
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:31,007	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	That thing would never stay open today
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:37,151	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	If you were sitting in a car on the bridge when the waves were going the cars in front of you with Bob up
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:43,295	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	And then Disappear Completely from the you all look like it's Thrill Ride people actually dry specifically for the
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:46,879	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	The feeling of riding on this bouncing Bridge
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,719	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	The ride ended Just 4 months later
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:57,631	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	And the wind begins to speak with a roller
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:06,847	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	It was clear early on the morning of November 7th at the gale force winds were having a greater effect on the bridge
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:11,967	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Previously these two source of waves on the bridge have been like a fairly transitory
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:15,295	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Bounce out for a couple minutes but this was just going on and on so they
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:18,367	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Got this could be problematical although they had seen actually
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,391	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Deeper waves on the bridge
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:22,975	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	But then the movement changed things can't just got worse
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:29,375	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	The bridge begins twist violently along the Centerline and that became like extremely violent one end of the bridge.
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:31,423	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	45° angle
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:37,823	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Little 40 mile-an-hour deals with feathers families like living in Queens with but you wouldn't believe
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:39,103	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Palpable

EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,527	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	By this time everyone had gotten off
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:51,647	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	The blunt solid edge of the bridge disrupted the flow of the strong wind
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,695	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Causing one part to twist.
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,743	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Well the other section twisted
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:56,511	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Down
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:07:01,119	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	They continue this torsional back and forth for over an hour or so there was plenty of time
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,655	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	For spectators to come watch
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:05,215	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Including the bridge is original designer Clark Eldridge
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:09,311	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	A local camera store owner named Barney Elliott arrived on the scene
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:16,223	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	And took the now-famous color film of the bridges Relentless Generations

EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:21,855	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Giant table snap like you only friend
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:31,071	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	The disaster
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,095	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Gunplay net worth
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,143	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Others Dipper
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:35,423	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	But whatever the reason

EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:40,799	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	This timer bracelet will not provide a super thrill in the news
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:47,199	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	For the collapsed Bridge aerodynamics and structural failure due to torsion
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:49,247	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	It's scarcely been considered
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:54,623	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Or maybe those lessons I've been lost in the rapid evolution of more and more slender and longer Bridges
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:59,231	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	But the failure caused the study of bridge aerodynamics to take off
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:02,047	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	In any bridges that were on the drawing board in 1940
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:04,607	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Or redesigned with more conservative
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:06,911	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Deep open truss deck structures
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,775	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Believe designer Leanne Marshall
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:15,615	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	And his solid steel i-beams received most of the blame for the disaster
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,431	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	He never designed another Bridge again
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:22,271	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	Doing no small parts affected he died three years later
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,623	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	No one was killed on the bridge
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,671	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	A few people were very lucky to get away with
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,695	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	The lies because
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:33,023	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	I just imagine you're on this bridge and is twisting it at 45
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:35,583	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	3 angling trying to walk off in a fairly stiff wind
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:38,143	| 52-Galloping-Gertie |	The only casualty was a dog
