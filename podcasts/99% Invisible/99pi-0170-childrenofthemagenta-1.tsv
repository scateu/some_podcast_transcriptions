EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:51,424	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Automation in flight has been around for a long time
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:57,312	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The first so-called autopilot was invented by the Sperry Corporation in 1912
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:04:00,640	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And it allowed the plane to fly straight and level
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:05,248	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Without the Pilot's intervention in the 1950s the auto Pilots got better
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:08,064	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	So that you could program an autopilot the following route
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,344	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Notjustok

EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:12,928	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And this was making the Pilot's job a lot easier
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:16,768	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	But there was still a lot to think about in the cockpit of an airplane

EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:38,783	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	But by the 1970s all of those complex systems were also automated

EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,655	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	But by human error
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:05:01,567	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	In a French company called Airbus thought that they can make planes safer by letting automation carry an even bigger

EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:04,895	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Airbus was a leader
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,687	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Airbus has always been quite radical

EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:33,823	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Ziegler's playing not only had autopilot it also had what's called a fly-by-wire system
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:37,919	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	But basically an autopilot just does
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:39,199	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	That's what a pilot tells it
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:39,711	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	To do
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:43,039	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Fly-by-wire is a computer-based

EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:49,183	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And then do it smoothly and safely
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:53,023	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	So if the pilot pulls back on his or hers
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:53,791	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Stick
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:56,095	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The fly-by-wire system will say
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,887	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	I see that you want to pitch up
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:58,655	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And here
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,679	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	I'll do it for you
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,471	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Adjust the right angle and rate
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:08,127	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Importantly the fly-by-wire system will also protect you from getting into an aerodynamic stall

EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:52,159	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Here's the thing they can turn itself off
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:56,767	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And that's exactly what it did on May 31st 2009
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:07:01,375	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Best Buy 4470 through the night sky over the Atlantic Ocean

EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,615	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The captain
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,895	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	I don't back to sleep
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:15,199	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	This meant the to Copilot
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,991	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	That's where in control of the plane
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:17,759	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	They
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:20,063	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Encountered some weather it wasn't rough
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:22,367	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Are they deaf never hit significant turbulence
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:24,927	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	So far nothing out of the ordinary
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,439	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And then
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,719	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Suddenly
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,487	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	They lost

EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,591	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Degraded
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:48,991	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Like one step so the autopilot turned off and the fly-by-wire system shifted into a different

EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:57,951	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	None of this was ideal but it also wasn't a reason to panic according to William
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:01,023	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The plane was still basically flying straight
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:01,535	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Unsteady
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,327	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The airplane was not upset
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,119	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Had they done nothing
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:07,679	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	They would have done exactly
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,727	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	What they needed to do nothing
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:10,751	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	But that's not what has
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:14,591	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The co-pilot in the right seat put his hand on his control stick
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:17,407	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	A little joystick like thing to his right
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,943	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And he pulled it back
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:23,039	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Not just a little he pulled it 3/4 of the way back
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,831	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Why he did that
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,367	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Is
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:27,903	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The major question
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:30,975	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Perhaps he was startled or reacting to some
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:31,743	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Turbulence
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:34,047	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	It's important to note that he did not
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:36,095	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Tell the other pilot in the cockpit
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:37,887	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The guy in the left seat what do you do
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,655	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Just done
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,679	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	If you had
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:43,263	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Maybe his co-pilot would have known the dangerous situation they were about
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:43,775	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	2bn
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:50,431	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	In an Airbus the two pilots have separate control sticks that move independently of each other
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	In other commercial airplanes the controls would move in unison so that you actually feel the moves your co-pilot was making
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,111	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	On their controls
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:03,999	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	This design variation they also have contributed to what was about to become a very bad situation
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:07,583	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	In any case has the pilot in the right seat pulled back on his deck
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:08,607	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The airplane
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:11,935	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Old put his nose up and started to soar upward
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:20,127	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Install protections are in place the plane won't just warned you not to pitch it it's an extreme angle a physical
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:21,151	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	We will not let you do it
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:26,783	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Remember the plane it shifted into a mode in which it wasn't offering that underline protection
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:33,183	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Every angle that steeper and steeper the air can flow smoothly across the wings and the plane begin
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,207	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And the stall
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:40,607	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The plane was angled up trying to gain altitude but it actually began to lose altitude
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:45,983	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The plane couldn't prevent a stall but it could still warm that's always happening
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:49,823	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	It's at stall stall stall
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:52,639	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Stole stole
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,663	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Soul Stone
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:10:00,319	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And you think that if you heard this alarm someone would say hey I think we might be stalling
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:04,927	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	But this never happened did say
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,719	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	But he didn't say we've stalled
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:13,631	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Indian man in the right seat we was flying the airplane the junior copilot you put the nose down a couple times then bring it right back
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,143	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Look up again
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:21,055	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The copilot's began to ring frantically for the captain to come into the cockpit at one point one of them says
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:25,407	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Where is he here playing with shaking all kinds of alarms were going off
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:31,295	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	1 minute and 38 seconds after the episode started the captain came into the cockpit and asked
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,063	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	What's going on
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:37,439	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The copilot's did not say we're in a stall instead one of them said
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:37,951	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Quotes
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,999	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Completely lost control of the air
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,279	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And we don't understand
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:42,815	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	We tried
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:43,839	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Everything
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:49,471	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The captain have walked into a difficult scene to under
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:51,007	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	1st and everyone was
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:53,567	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Confused where they descending or climbing
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:55,615	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	At times it couldn't seem to figure it out
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:59,455	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Finally they seem to realize they're in a fast descent
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:01,759	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Losing thousands of feet per minute
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:04,319	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	But why they couldn't figure out why
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,879	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The captain never assessed
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,671	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Correctly what was going on
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:12,767	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	He was obviously trying to it wasn't there to drink coffee or suck his thumb
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:17,631	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	But he was never able to figure out what was going on even though it should have been
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,935	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Amply obviously
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,447	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Going on
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:24,543	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	But for whatever reason it wasn't obvious to them what was going on
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:27,359	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	They didn't know they were in a stall
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,895	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	They realize it William says
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:31,711	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The fix would have been clear its basic
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,759	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Pilot School 101
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:37,855	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The recovery would have required them to put the nose down
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,135	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Power doesn't matter
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:41,439	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Get the nose down get a below the horizon
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:43,999	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	We're game at flying speed
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:46,303	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And then pull out of the ensuing.
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:52,959	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The plane continued falling down at a jaw-dropping pace losing several thousands of feet per minute
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:56,031	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	But since they started at 37000 feet
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:58,847	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	For a while there was still time for a recovering
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,151	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	So for quite a long time
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,455	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Is a normal crew
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:05,247	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	I would have been able to recover
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:09,087	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And at the very end around 16000 be the best crew in the world
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:11,391	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Only probably would have been able to recover
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,415	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And below that out
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:13,951	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	No crew
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,487	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Would have been able to
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:20,351	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Recover cuz they simply didn't have the space beneath them to execute the die before hitting the water
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,911	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	But in any case they never try to do it
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:27,775	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Until the road this airplane down
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:30,079	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Expressing confusion the whole time
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:32,895	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And finally expressing
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,431	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Certainly that they were going to die
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:35,711	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	4 minutes
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,479	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And 22nd
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,015	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	After the incident started
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,807	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	They pancakes
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:42,367	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Into the water at a very high descent rate
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,415	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	And of course it kill everyone instead
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:57,215	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	6 years after the crash of flight 440
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:13:00,799	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	7 what's clear is that the pilots didn't understand what was
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:01,567	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Happening to them
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:03,359	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	The big question is
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:03,871	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	How
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,919	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	How could they have a computer yelling
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:08,735	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	Stall at them a not understand they were in the stall
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:16,671	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	There were various things that contributed to the crash of 447 but automation which is overwhelmingly made airline travel

EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:09,823	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	My approach to things is different I guess
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:14,943	| 99pi-0170-childrenofthemagenta-1 |	These Pilots were in that airplane with the passengers and I'm sure they had every motivation
