EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:33,983	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	This was particularly frightening to them because Charlotte was also pregnant
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:37,823	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	It was the most the most tense I've ever been in my life
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,895	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	What if Charlotte also went into early labor
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,687	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	What is the baby was born but
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:48,319	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Couldn't survive the post Maria world with no electricity and temperatures routinely in the 90s
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:48,831	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,367	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	When you sleep at night
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,695	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	So unbearable
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:07:00,095	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Serious that the amount of heat in the air was so so brutal
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:04,959	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Did you think I'm just going to get naked outside because I can't contain
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:05,727	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	This damn Heat
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:09,055	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	So I'm thinking a newborn can survive this
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:13,663	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Jorge even considered trying to get his wife off the island
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:15,967	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	But eight months pregnant they don't allow you to fly
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:23,647	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	After the Storm Jorge and Charlotte Bounce from place to place staying with friends who have generators
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,183	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	At home
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:26,719	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Jorge fretted over his wife
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:30,047	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Send baby who is coming ready or not in November
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:33,119	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	At work things were even more stressful
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:36,959	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	The first priority was to get power to hospitals and water treatment plant
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:40,543	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Aarhus power plant was one of seven major plants
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:44,639	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	On the island but all of the others were down and without those to help
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:48,223	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	His kept crashing over and over again
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:48,991	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Dead
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:52,831	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	It would connect as many hospitals that we can but it just wouldn't hold it
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:55,391	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Could you describe this like a tug-of-war
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:58,463	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	The power plants are on one side and their Giant
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:02,047	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	But the consumers are on the other side and they pull hard
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:06,143	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	If one power plant goes down the others will have to work harder
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:07,167	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And they get tired
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,959	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Sometimes to the point of
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:09,471	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Collapse
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:14,335	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	After Maria there was only one giant power plant on Jorge side of the Rope
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:18,175	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And on the other side hospitals and water treatment plants
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:20,223	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Which were pulling like crazy
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:26,623	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Every time there's a collapse you have to reboot everything just went down the drain and you have
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,159	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	How to restart from Step One
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:32,767	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	With just one plant that was constantly collapsing they had to triage
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:33,535	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Is like
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:36,351	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	I only have one power plant that just got fired up
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:39,167	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And I only have enough power for one
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,703	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Of those two hospitals right there
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:47,359	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Out in the field things weren't any better lines are down all over the island and there weren't nearly enough workers
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,383	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	To fix them
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:54,783	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Eventually support would arrive from the US Mainland but for the first week or so Puerto Ricans were basic
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,551	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Glee on their own
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,855	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	You know we only had 230
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,159	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Power Brigade bats
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,183	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	All we have
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:01,951	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	4
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:03,487	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	For the company for the island
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:05,791	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And that is not enough
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:07,583	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	That is just not enough
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:11,679	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	They're about three workers in a brigade so that's 690.
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,703	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	People give or take
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:15,519	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	As a point of comparison as Florida
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:19,103	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Prepared for Irma they had 16,000 workers on call
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:26,015	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Before anyone paying attention it was no surprise that prep I did not have the resources to respond to this disaster
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:29,087	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Again here's Danielle Alarcon
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,367	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Before Maria
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:31,647	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	The island
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,695	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Was in a terrible economic state
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:39,839	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	A decade or more of economic stagnation Puerto Rico a u.s. territory and popular getaway destination

EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:56,991	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	To make up for all the Lost Revenue to the Puerto Rican government began borrowing money in the
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,015	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	The form of bonds
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:03,647	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Year after year issuing more and more bonds kind of hoping things would turn around
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:05,695	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	But things did not turn around
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:11,071	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	By the time Maria hit the government was in the middle of an enormous debt crisis
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:14,143	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And in the course of that River was not spared
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:17,727	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And prep has settled over the course of many many years
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,007	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	With a lot of debt

EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:27,967	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Or I could never could have not that sounds like a lot can I look at my article cuz I'm not sure
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:33,343	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Daniel actually had to stop and check his notes while we were talking to make sure this was right
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:34,623	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Wow
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:37,695	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Yeah I know that's it that's it that's insane
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:44,607	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Because of cost and because of dad they're constantly postponing

EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:52,287	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Like for example in the mainland us the vegetation is kept mode so that there's basically a rose
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:54,847	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	That runs underneath the power lines
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:58,943	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	That's called right of way right and you're supposed to maintain the right of way
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:01,503	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	To make it easy in an in the case of

EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:16,863	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Now they would have to deal with one of the biggest crises the island has ever faced
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,983	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	But there was another problem and it was a big one
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:26,079	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	It basically had no strategy for communicating with the public
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:29,151	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Didn't have a presence on Twitter or Facebook

EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:41,439	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Hushed
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:43,743	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Just to prevent conflict
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,815	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And with little actual information from prepa
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:49,887	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	TV news stations just kind of made stuff up
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:51,423	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Which made Jorge went to

EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:03,455	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And not only that he was
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:05,247	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Inciting more fear
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:07,295	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And Desperation rather than comfort
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:10,623	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And I spend the night

EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:45,887	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Overtime for his post earned him a kind of celebrity status on the island
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:48,703	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	But yeah I went to go see a comedy show
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,495	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:52,031	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And he was mentioned in the comedy show
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:54,079	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And everyone
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:57,151	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Cracked up like an entire theater, like hundreds of people
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:19:00,223	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	These owls of recognition in like
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:03,551	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Applause and people doubled over laughing because it seems like everybody
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:04,831	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Was checking
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:06,879	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Everyday one word he said was saying
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:10,719	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	It's the first time in my life that I became a meme
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:17,119	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	140 meme was an image of his face on one of those Latin prayer candles
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:21,215	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	They would say don't let this candle burn out if you want Power
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,775	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Another meme referred to him as
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:24,799	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Fake beard
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:27,871	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	I had a very very rough beard
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:30,687	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	I didn't come down so these
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:32,735	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Start calling me saying beard you know
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:35,039	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Just caress his beard if you want Power
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:40,415	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	By this point for his bosses knew what he was doing and whether they approved or not
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:44,511	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	They sort of had to go along because the public was on his side
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:46,815	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	People were stopping in the streets
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:50,911	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Thank heaven when they do see me on the street at now they give me a hug because
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:52,959	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	I'm not I'm not usually a handshake guy
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:57,823	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	I'm more of a hug guy
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:03,967	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	On November 14th 2017 who his baby was born the healthy baby girl who they named Leia
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:08,575	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Amazingly Charlotte's mom and dad had just gotten power the day before
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:12,159	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	So when they left the hospital the family went straight to her parents
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:13,439	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Air-conditioned house
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,719	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Their new baby girl
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:23,167	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	This was the first Christmas in Puerto Rico since hurricane Maria devastated the island local engineers
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:25,471	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Half of the island had their power restored
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:27,519	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	But the mood was Grim
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:32,127	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	So many people have lost friends or relatives or had their homes destroyed in the storm
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:34,687	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Many people were still in the dark
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:37,247	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	No one felt much like celebrating
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,295	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Still there were moments
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:39,807	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	The blackness
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:43,391	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	A local musician Rewritten the song All I Want For
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,159	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Christmas
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:45,951	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	So that instead of all I want
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:47,743	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	For Christmas Is You
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:49,791	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	It says all I want for Christmas
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:50,559	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Is loose
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,607	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Which means light in Spanish
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:57,727	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	One line in the Rewritten song even name-drops Jorge pleading in Spanish
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,519	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Jorge Bracero
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,799	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Please give me what I want
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:03,615	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Okay I'm sending you this
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:04,639	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Songs
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:06,687	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	All right
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,455	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	On Facebook
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:10,015	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Oh my God you have the video
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:12,063	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Will Smith singing
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:25,120	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Eventually the woman who wrote the parody song reached out to Jorge and they made a video of the two of them singing
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,144	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Together
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:35,104	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Yo te quiero para me
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:38,432	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Capital Tri-State
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:44,064	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Ask me sueno
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:57,376	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Lose
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,680	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Oh yeah this is
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,192	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Is great
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:03,520	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	I'm going to watch this again later on
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:06,592	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	I forgot I almost forget about this
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:14,784	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	By spraying around 85% of the island have power
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:17,344	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Still there were thousands of people who did in
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:18,624	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	In the spring I visited
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,928	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	A kind of old folks home
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:21,696	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Up in the hills
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:24,000	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And at the bottom of the hill there was power
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,536	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	But there there was no power
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,840	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And they just couldn't understand why
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:30,912	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And they were just beside themselves and just
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:31,936	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Desperate
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:33,216	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,752	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	The sense of being forgotten
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:35,776	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	You know
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:40,640	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Holy continued with his daily updates which lines were being fixed
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:42,432	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Where the brigades were headed next
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:45,248	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	The team a irrigates and the American contractors
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:50,112	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And to keep up a sense of momentum he also shared videos as new places got power
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:55,744	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Like this one where an elementary school in the town of Puerto Nuevo finally gets electricity
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:23:02,144	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	The video was taken on some
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:04,448	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	IPhone from the hallway of the school
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:08,544	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Kids are running by with their arms in the air going completely bananas
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:10,848	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	The teachers are jumping up and down
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:12,128	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Just pure joy
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:20,832	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	It made me so happy
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:21,600	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	See it
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:23,392	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	That I figured people would be happy
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:23,904	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Etsy at 2
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:30,048	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Every week it seemed a new town was celebrating I started telling people
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:42,848	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:48,480	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Soon it would be their turn just remember that even if you don't have power right now you will have it in this is going to be you
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:24:01,280	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	I've been restored all of Puerto Rico it's been nearly 11 months since hurricane Maria
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:02,304	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And took out
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:08,704	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Finally in August of 2018 prepa announced that the entire Island have been reconnected to the grid
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:14,592	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	It was six weeks before the year anniversary of Maria and just in time for the next
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:15,616	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Hurricane season
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:20,736	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Peppa meanwhile is arguably in a worse place than it was before Maria
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:27,136	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	There's been a lack of steady leadership over the last year with five different directors cycling through the position
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:27,904	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	At the helm
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:29,440	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	One guy lasted you know
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:33,024	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Like a day there was a sense of a rudderless ship
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:35,072	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	To be honest sense of an absolutely vital ship
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:42,240	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	4 years a weird funeral have been in place that recipients of disaster money couldn't replace anything
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:43,520	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Staying with a different
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:45,568	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	I eat more expensive thing
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:49,920	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	For example wooden post can be replaced with stronger metal posts
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:55,808	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	So Puerto Ricans didn't actually get the opportunity to improve their infrastructure
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:59,136	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	That's the same grid they had before with a population that's
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:01,184	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Significantly more vulnerable
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:04,768	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Antonio's Estes Park can't be overstated
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:07,072	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Puerto Ricans were traumatized
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:07,584	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Maria
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:10,400	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	It's not just that they went through
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:11,680	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	This
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:15,520	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Storm and then went through the aftermath of the storm
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:16,288	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	It's I think
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:17,824	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	For a lot of people
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:22,176	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	It's what the aftermath of storm told them which is essentially we don't care about you
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:25,504	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	You're not you're forgotten you don't matter
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:28,064	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	The depth of this wound is
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:29,088	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Just
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:30,112	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Adjust
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,904	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Very very deep
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:36,000	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Now propose in the process of
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:36,768	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Privatizing
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:43,680	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Basically selling itself off piece-by-piece and hopes that a private company or various private companies will
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:46,240	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Be able to deliver a better service and the government
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:47,008	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Has
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:49,312	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	But a lot of people are skeptical

EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:57,504	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Still doing the hot exhausting job of maintaining a 15-story boiler
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:26:00,576	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	You'd like to stop doing such hard physical labor
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:03,904	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	You'd like someone to put them in charge of social media
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:05,440	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Put his other talents to use

EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:16,960	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Hurricane season was in full swing when I talk to her

EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:24,128	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	When people ask me is like I'll be ready for a next hurricane I'm like no
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:28,224	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	We need a break just give us maybe two years
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:35,136	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Just give us that time that window in which our people can keep working keep working key working so that
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:36,672	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Can hold a little longer
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:40,768	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Climate change and everything that comes with it is a reality

EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,400	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	That's pretty scary
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:51,776	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Freddy told me he thinks Puerto Ricans could survive another hurricane if they had to
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:54,592	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Another year in the dark event
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:58,176	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	You wouldn't worry as much about the island devolving into Anarchy
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:58,944	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	As he once did
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:02,016	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	He saw the best of people after Maria

EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:35,808	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Bracero was not the only person in Puerto Rico to take matters into their own hands after Maria
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:41,952	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	All over the island people were stepping into new roles and figuring out DIY Solutions
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:46,048	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	But one time that Daniel Alarcon visited took this
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:47,584	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Really really far
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:51,680	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	The people actually said to hell with meaning on prepa
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:53,728	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	We're doing this work ourselves

EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,056	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	After this

EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:23,488	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	They took a pretty radical step witches that they

EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:30,400	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Kind of unofficial Brigade

EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:50,368	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Leave my vulnerable population without electrical power
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:53,696	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Because a lot of people are older and sick and would have died

EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:00,608	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Which is
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,376	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Super dangerous
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:04,960	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	But how did they even know how to do it like today

EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:25,696	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And they had one guy who had
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:28,000	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	It worked as a lineman
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:32,864	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And another guy who knew a little bit about it and it's say okay when everybody we need help with
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:36,448	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	This brush so we can get to that line enough to that
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:41,824	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Electrical pole over there and then everyone would take out their machetes and help through the line in the new go and
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,360	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And and do the work
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:44,640	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	They
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:46,176	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	Had their whole town connected
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:46,944	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	6

EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,112	| 327_A_Year_in_the_Dark_pt_01 |	And this was just
