EDL	00:00:04,608	00:00:09,216	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Today Show is about a design flaw that might be and I'm not exaggerating here
EDL	00:00:09,728	00:00:12,544	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The single most common design flaw in human history
EDL	00:00:13,312	00:00:14,592	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	If potentially effects
EDL	00:00:14,592	00:00:16,128	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Everything we have ever built
EDL	00:00:16,640	00:00:20,480	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Its consequences are felt by more than half of people worldwide
EDL	00:00:20,992	00:00:22,784	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Most people
EDL	00:00:22,784	00:00:23,552	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Don't even notice it
EDL	00:00:24,064	00:00:25,344	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	But that's changing
EDL	00:00:25,344	00:00:26,880	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Thanks in no small part
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:27,648	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The work
EDL	00:00:27,648	00:00:28,672	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Of one woman
EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:30,464	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	My name is Caroline criado-perez
EDL	00:00:30,976	00:00:33,280	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	I am a writer and activist
EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:34,816	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Who is written an Incredible Book
EDL	00:00:35,584	00:00:39,168	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Invisible women exposing de Tobias
EDL	00:00:39,168	00:00:40,448	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	No wait sorry that's the question
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:42,240	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	What is the Americans
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:45,056	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The copy I have is called invisible women
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:47,104	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Data bias in the world design for men
EDL	00:00:47,616	00:00:49,408	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	British people sweat
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:49,920	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	American people
EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:53,504	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Is this a non swery podcast
EDL	00:00:54,016	00:00:58,112	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Well you can swear all you like we will probably bleep it
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:01:00,672	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	I'll try to I'll try to keep it to a minimum
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:04,768	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And honestly Caroline criado-perez has a good reason to swear
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:08,096	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Because this design flaw in addition to being everywhere
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:08,864	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Is really
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:12,960	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	But like so many of the worst design flaws
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:14,240	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	It can be hard to notice
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:16,800	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The first to demonstrate just how hard
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:18,848	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Caroline start off by telling me a story
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:19,616	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	That begins
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:20,128	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	With a joke
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:21,408	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	About gender
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:23,712	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Basically
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:24,992	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	In this
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:27,552	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Town kukulska. In Sweden
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:29,600	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	They were doing a gender analysis
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:31,904	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	List of all the policies
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:36,512	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	No tearing when having a feast
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:37,280	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Agenda
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:41,888	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And it does sound on the face of it ridiculous how can snakes have anything to do with gender
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:46,240	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	After all the city of karlskoga plaudit streets the way you think all cities with Father's tree
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:48,544	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Starting with the major arteries
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:50,592	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Followed by local roads in Cypress
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:53,920	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	It seemed about as genderless as you could get
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:57,504	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	But actually it turned out
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,272	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	It's gender
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:58,784	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:01,600	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Male and female travel passes
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:09,024	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Men are far more likely to travel in a fairly simple way using a car
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:12,096	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	For a twice daily commute in and out of the city center
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:17,728	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	You can see this in the way that most cities are laid out with major arteries going in and out of downtown and what's
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,264	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	An arterial cyst
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:22,080	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Which makes a lot of sense if you are a man
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,104	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	It turns out
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:24,384	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The weight many women
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:25,664	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Is very
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:28,480	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Women puppies more complicated travel packs
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,552	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Say for example
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:32,832	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Typical travel
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:44,096	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Some groceries on the way home on an elderly relative
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:48,448	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Public transport
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:48,960	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	DirecTV
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,240	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Commercial air
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:56,128	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	When karlskoga snow plowing schedule was first designed all this trip chaining done by women
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,920	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Simply wasn't factored in
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:00,224	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Because it wasn't considered work
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,784	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	But actually this would contribute
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:03,808	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Hugely
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:05,856	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	GDP
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,136	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	They discovered
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:11,488	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	That if you put all the unpaid carrot travel together at 10
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,536	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Travel for those purposes
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:16,864	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	With almost as much as travel for paid work
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:21,728	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Becomes a totally different proposition
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:25,568	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	What's the city planners started looking at the data through the lens of gender
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,848	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Suddenly the idea
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:29,152	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The city of karlskoga Sweden
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,944	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Should plow its major arteries first
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:33,248	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Didn't make intuitive sense
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:36,576	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Because really really great for getting in and out of downtown
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:40,160	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	But it's not very good for traveling Between Difference
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:40,672	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Some pups
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:44,256	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Which is the kind of travel of the women are much more like to eat
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:44,768	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	To do
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:51,680	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	So the city council of karlskoga realizing that it's harder to push a buggy through 3 inches of snow than it is to drive a car
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:54,496	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Decided to flip their snow clearing policy on its head
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:57,312	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	From now on it would be the miners
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,080	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Streets and sidewalks
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,360	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Rocks that were plowed first
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,640	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Followed by the major artery
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:03,712	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Expected it would actually save the money
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,272	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Because it turned out that
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,832	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Dramatic Kira Gees
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,904	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The admissions into accident animations
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:13,952	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Because they were right
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:16,256	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Is much easier to drive a car
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:18,303	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Events push a buggy
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:21,887	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And pedestrians with massively dominating admission syntax
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:22,911	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Accident and emergency
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,191	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And women
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,727	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	With dominating
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,287	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	I'm sorry bites
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,567	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The simple thing is
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,615	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Changing the order in which they play at the
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,919	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	They had this traumatic
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,199	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Effects
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,735	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Healthcare bill
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:39,551	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	That was not an insignificant cost
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:41,855	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Analysis
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,879	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	It was
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:44,415	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	3 *
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,463	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The cost of the winter
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:50,815	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	What the point of the story isn't that karlskoga saved money
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:53,631	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Or even that women suffer fewer injuries
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:55,679	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	It's that the snow cleaning policy
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:58,239	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	I've been poorly designed even though
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:00,287	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	City planners at started out
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,567	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	With the best of intentions
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:07,199	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	You know it's not like to travel, so I know you're let's make women full over in fracture that pelvis
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,223	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	That'll be really funny
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,271	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Faith just
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,295	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Proceed
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:14,367	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Along the presumption that what would work for them
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,415	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Would just wax it Society
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:22,815	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And when the schedule with device
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,375	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	But they forgot
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:27,167	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	As happens so often in
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:30,495	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	I'm to remember that women exist
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:33,567	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And this goes all the way back to
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:35,359	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The fact that you know this isn't just
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,639	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Transport
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,175	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,711	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	This is pretty much everything
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:46,367	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Today I'm talking with Caroline criado-perez about the largest and most persistent data Gap in history
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:51,231	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The failure to collect data on in from women when designing
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:52,511	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Almost
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,559	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And the consequences of
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,095	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Not just for women
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,375	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	But for everyone
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,959	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	So you talked about this a lot in your book
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:01,727	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Which is that
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,007	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	At the root
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:03,775	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	I've almost
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:05,311	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Aldi's design problems
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:07,103	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Which don't seem to take women to
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:11,711	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Is the fallacy of the default mail Daddy and that when we picture a kind of

EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:13,727	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Because of this way that we see men as the default

EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:39,071	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	We do in all sorts of areas I mean another area that Springs to mind is call crashes
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,351	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:43,167	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The car crash test dummy that is being used

EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:05,951	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	To be taken into account but
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:07,999	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	We got this 50th percentile male dummy
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:11,327	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	As of course the 50th percentile male is the 50th percentile human
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,167	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	What is quite
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,471	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Enraging rainy is it
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:21,055	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	This was introduced in the 1950s
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,335	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	About having a female
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:27,967	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	But as happens so often, manufacturers Lovett against
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:29,759	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	On the basis that it would be to expense
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,063	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And presumably it doesn't just affect
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:32,831	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Bus safety
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:35,647	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	They are weak like it that affects the design of the car
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,159	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Exactly
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,463	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The result is that
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:40,255	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Costas
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,583	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	So for example the seat belt
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,631	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Hasn't been designed to accommodate women's breasts
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:48,447	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	We haven't developed a seatbelt that account

EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:25,567	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	That is negligence but I think it gets even worse because it'd have belatedly

EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,655	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	It's a scaled-down male dummy
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:53,215	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Even worse
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:55,263	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	But not this

EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:07,199	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	We'll look at another example that might just provide a blueprint
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:08,735	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Try to do things better in the future
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:15,903	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	I've been talking to Caroline criado-perez about her book invisible women and
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:20,511	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Of all the story is a poor design based on the gender data Gap that Caroline told me
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:24,351	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Perhaps the most instructive was the case of the three stone stove
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:27,935	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Three stone stove is a traditional form of cooking
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,727	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	That's used by 80%
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,519	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	People in the developing world
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,799	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	It is what it sounds like
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:35,871	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Three Stones arranged in a circle on the ground
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:37,919	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	With a pot placed on top of
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:39,455	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	In a fire underneath
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:40,735	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And the problem with
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:42,783	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	This type of stove is that
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:45,087	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The fumes that are given off are incredibly tok
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:50,975	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And it's not just that the fumes are really toxic it's how long women and children are exposed to
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,791	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	3 * 10 * 5 is
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,071	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Not very efficient
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,119	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	So they will be
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,911	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	In a poorly ventilated room
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:02,239	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Two I think one estimate with something
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,799	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The equivalent of more than a hundred cigarettes
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,567	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Today
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:07,871	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And this seems like something like we've had
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:11,967	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Stoves and ovens for quite a long time why wasn't this fixed
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:14,271	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	A long time ago did we even try
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,039	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Yes sir
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,087	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The happiness hack

EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,671	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Is clean start
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:22,975	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	To be cops
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:30,399	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	But we still have the big problem that is incredible
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,423	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Simple it's that
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:34,495	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The album design
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,031	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And asking them
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,055	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	What they need
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:37,823	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	What they want
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:39,871	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	How are they liking
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:40,895	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The Current Designs
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:45,247	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The issues I mean that's hilariously basic
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:47,295	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	They keep developing stoves
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,575	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	That for example
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:51,135	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Increase cooking time
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:53,183	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Are women already cooking for
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:58,047	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	How to spend cooking
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:01,119	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	They often require
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:03,423	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Atmore tending and again
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:06,751	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	When you having to spend so long cooking
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:08,031	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	You need to be able to multitask
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:11,359	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	This isn't something that is being
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,383	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Xidan
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:14,431	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	1
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:15,199	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Clean
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,479	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Start with develop
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,831	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	They require
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,855	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Accession amount
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:27,999	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The design is just assumed I will the household will take care of that
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,535	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	But actually
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:30,815	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Maintenance
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:32,863	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	With a mom's job
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:35,423	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	An amendment
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:40,287	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	He starves because they so well why do I need to know she can just cook them the old style.
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:42,591	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	I want to waste my time
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:45,663	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Another one was similar issue
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,455	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Stop
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:50,783	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Start with cheese small to just put
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:51,551	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Bits of wooden
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:54,111	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	You have to chop it up again
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:56,927	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	What is job
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:57,695	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Didn't get to use fees
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:05,375	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	These all these really really simple things that should have been cool at the design stage if
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:09,983	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	What do you need and they would have said
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:11,775	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	But we need something.
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:16,895	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Means that we don't have to spend more time cooking that weakened the cop truck hits while we're doing it
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:21,247	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	We don't need mental help Swiss because they bite
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:25,343	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Programas de program so yeah I'll see ya his failed
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,623	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	So these really really face it
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,183	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	How many years are we talking about
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,023	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	An enzyme
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,303	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Is that
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:38,399	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Often reports that produce the basic he say that it's the woman's fault
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:41,983	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The women unwilling to learn how to use the
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:47,871	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The stove so the women are choosing to cook in these dangerous toxic fumes
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:49,663	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Radius just insulting
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:55,551	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Yeah I mean it in a 10 minutes remind me to buy call this language in the crash tests
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:59,135	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	You know that that women are the out-of-position drivers
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,415	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:02,463	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	You know it really does like there's a moment
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,743	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Where
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:06,303	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Designers in
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:07,583	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	People studying this
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:10,143	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Finally see women in that is
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,191	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Trying to find someone to blame
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,471	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:15,007	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	I student connect this
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:17,055	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	254
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:22,943	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	This position of will they must be something wrong with the women we go to fix the women
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:26,015	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	That is actually something that we
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:26,527	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Apply to Mac
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:30,623	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	I think it becomes my
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:32,671	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	It's clear when you are looking at things
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,231	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Place initiative
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:39,839	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	You know the ideas are what we need to build up women's comfort
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,423	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Enough said that's why they
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:43,935	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Getting from
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:48,287	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Choosing a subject
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:53,151	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And yet study after study has shown that she has pretty good at
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:53,663	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Assassin
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:56,479	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	That Bass kill their intelligence
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:00,063	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Estimate
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:00,831	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Basculin
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:01,599	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Intelligence
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:03,135	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And so when you see that then you should have
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:07,999	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Maybe it's not that the women write themselves
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,791	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	She likes the men raising themselves
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:11,327	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	I was too high
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,095	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	It just
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,887	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	We just never think of it like that
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:16,447	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	The mail is sativa
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:18,239	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	It's a symbol that must be the right level
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,055	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	So we got to fix
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:21,823	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	What's the weather
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:25,407	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Did anyone bother to design a stove based primarily on the input
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:28,223	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Of women and if so what what did they create
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:32,831	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Have a happy ending
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,855	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Say
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:36,415	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Yeah a few years ago receptions in India
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:38,207	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Instead of trying to create a holster
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,743	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Fake creation
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:41,535	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	This device that you can put on any
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:44,351	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And basically it comes
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:44,863	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Woody's
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,399	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And cuts
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:46,911	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Smite
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:48,703	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Too comfortable levels
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,007	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Very very cheap
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:53,311	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	It's used with recycled
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:54,335	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Metal material
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:56,895	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And it's being picked up
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:58,175	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Not just in India
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:00,479	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	You know they're being studies in Kenya and Ghana
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:00,991	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	With the same device
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,271	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	With similarly puzzle
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:03,551	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Results
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,319	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Menorah.
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:05,855	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	And basically
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:11,487	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Went
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,327	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Revolutionary
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:20,447	| 363_Invisible_Women_pt_01 |	Say what these receptions did that was different was they started off in the basis of what do women actually need
