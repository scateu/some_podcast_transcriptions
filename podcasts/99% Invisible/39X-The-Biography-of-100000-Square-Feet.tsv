EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:47,231	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	But when this dream was overlaid on a real place
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,023	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Just didn't work out
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:51,327	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	I'm not sure if
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:55,423	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Now if I were going to be asked to design this is how much I would change
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:57,983	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	I mean why would I
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:01,311	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	You're talkin about my life's work for Christ sakes
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:08,479	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	I was the first person who ever designed a plaza and Fountain so that people could use it people
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:10,271	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Should not be told you can't
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:11,807	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Get inside of it and use it
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:16,928	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	All places should be usable by people in the city
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:19,744	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Now having said that
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:22,816	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Why would I design something to prevent homeless
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,120	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	I mean
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:27,680	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Homelessness is a social problem
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:33,824	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	That cannot be designed for and in the sense of Aesthetics and culture
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:35,104	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Of course they should be friends
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:38,432	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	That's a real question is what do you mean by friendly
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:42,784	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Nobody is ever said to me I want you to design it unfriendly place
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:45,088	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	But you know it depends on who you talk to
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:46,368	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	When you say
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:48,928	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	You talk to people who say that to other
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:53,792	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Sounds like a pretty stupid thing to say actually
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:57,120	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	I would absolutely challenge
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:58,912	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	I can't imagine that anybody

EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:19,392	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	I first got to know United Nations Plaza
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,952	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Back in 1979
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:25,792	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	I used to take BART into the plaza with my sister I was about
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:26,304	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	12 years old
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:33,216	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	I was not a fast Walker and I remember so vividly my sister walking as fast as she could Up Leavenworth Street because
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:35,264	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	There were men harassing us along the way
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:42,432	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	And I would have to jog alongside her to keep up with her and that was embarrassing to me
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:44,992	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Plan for the redesign had already been drawn up
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:50,368	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Landscape Architects here at the Department of Public Works had made some recommendations for improvements to a
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:54,464	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Things like replanting planter beds with flowers instead of the grass
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,768	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	It's there now something that would add color
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:58,304	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	A little bit of life to the plaza
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:01,376	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	As we went to the Board of Supervisors
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:05,472	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	The fencing around the Planters became a contentious issue
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:09,824	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	In December 2001 the plan drawn up by DPW was rejected by the boar
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:12,384	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	They didn't like the fences
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:15,712	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	A 15-member task force was created by the city
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:19,040	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	The taskforce ask Roma designed to make some recommendations

EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:39,520	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	The first step is you take out the benches then you put little fences around the green areas then you put barrier
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:41,568	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Beers for people so they can sit down
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:45,152	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	And I said frankly I'm not interested in
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,176	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	The negative

EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:27,296	| 39X-The-Biography-of-100000-Square-Feet |	Why would you put it here
