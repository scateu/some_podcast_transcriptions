EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:13,728	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Off the coast of North Carolina
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:17,312	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	There's a stretch of islands called the Outer Banks

EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:25,760	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	These islands are three miles across at their widest
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:28,576	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Only 200 yards at their narrowest
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:33,440	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And there's one part of the outer banks that used to be especially treacherous for ships
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:35,232	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It's called Cape Hatteras
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:37,280	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	That's reporter Gordon Katic
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:38,816	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Of a podcast called
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:39,584	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Cited
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:43,424	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The Cape is known for choppy seas and strong ocean currents
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:48,032	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Since the 16th century these waves have caused a lot of shipwrecks
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:51,360	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Over a thousand according to the National Park Service
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:53,664	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The area has become known as
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:59,296	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The graveyard of the Atlantic so many sailors were dying. In the late 1700s
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:02,880	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Congress authorized the construction of a giant lighthouse
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:07,488	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It would eliminate the dangerous passage and make the Outer Banks less deadly
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:10,816	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The lighthouse went up in a small town called Buxton North Carolina
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,608	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Right near Cape Hatteras
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:16,448	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And the people of Buxton they love this lighthouse
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:20,032	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Generations of families there helps maintain it

EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:28,384	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Buddy ask because this is all a national park
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:32,224	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	This is the tallest brick lighthouse in North America that you all are about to
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:33,504	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	How to climb today so
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,272	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Hope everybody's ready
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:40,928	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It's hard to overstate just how important this Lighthouse is to the people of Buxton
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:44,000	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	There are three Lighthouse gift shops in town
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:48,352	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Practically every business here has a lighthouse in its logo or its name
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:50,656	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Like the lighthouse View Motel
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:54,240	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Or the lighthouse Sports Bar and Grill even the churches
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,032	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Like the Lighthouse Christian Assembly
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:04:01,152	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	But back in the seventies it look like Buxton might lose their beloved lighthouse
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:04,992	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	He was getting closer and closer threatening to swallow it up
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:07,040	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And people were torn over what to do
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,832	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The lighthouse
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:11,904	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Leave it in place and try to defend it against the forces of nature
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:17,280	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Next 30 Years the people of Buxton fought in intense political battle over this decision
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:20,863	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Is the kind of battle we can expect to see a lot more of
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:24,447	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	As sea levels rise and threatened Coastal communities around the world
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:29,823	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It all started with a scientist who had a radical idea about what to do with the light
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:32,895	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	An idea almost nobody like
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:36,991	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Let it fall in nothing is so important that a can't fall into
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,551	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Why don't you introduce yourself
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:43,135	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Oh yeah I'm I'm a horn trophy I'm a retired
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,183	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Marine geologist
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:47,743	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Two started out in the deep sea and ended up
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:48,511	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	On the beaches
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:52,095	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Orange County is a professor emeritus at Duke University
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:55,935	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	He typically wear short-sleeve button-up shirts with
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:57,727	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Two or three pens in the front pocket
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,519	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And she studies beaches
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:02,591	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	But there aren't any beaches at Duke
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:05,663	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Because Duke is right in the middle of the state
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:09,247	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	So in the 1980s or would pack his students into a bus
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:09,759	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Maddie
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:12,575	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	All the way to the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:14,623	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It's usually a pretty exciting place
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,671	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The average wave height
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:21,023	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Cape Hatteras is higher than anywhere else on the East Coast except possibly northern Maine
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:26,911	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Oren would tell his students at the waves at Cape Hatteras don't just calmly roll onto Shore
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,935	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	They slam into
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:30,239	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And spray up into the air
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:33,311	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Paula student stared out into the water or unexplained
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:37,151	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	These waves are washing away the beach we're standing on
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,943	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And soon they'll reach the lighthouse
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:43,551	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The shoreline of the Outer Banks the entire Charles and the Outer Banks is
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:46,623	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Is a routing and partly
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:53,535	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	This is simply a matter of the ways I think of way at the continent 90% of the
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,815	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Azar roading
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:59,167	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Some very very slightly and then some very quickly
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:01,983	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The beach in front of the lighthouse can a road fast
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:08,383	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The rates vary wildly from decade to decade sometimes the coast loses 50 ft air other times the beach
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:11,455	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Actually gain sand is an erratic natural process
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:17,343	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Good morning says climate change is also part of the story it's speeding up the erosion process
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:22,463	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	4 decade a bunch of different government agencies have been fighting back against the seat
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:25,535	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I tried barriers to slow the waves
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,839	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Put down a wall of sandbags
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:30,399	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Even tried this thing called Beach nourishment
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:34,751	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	That's just a fancy way of saying pumping a ton of sand onto the shore
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,799	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Other
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:38,591	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Inventive ideas to
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:40,639	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	They put in what they call Seascape
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:41,919	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It was plastic
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:44,991	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Strips of plastic that floated
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:47,295	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Strips were supposed to act like seaweed
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:53,695	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And keep the sand from washing away and here it was a very cheap way to stop a road
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,719	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	But it didn't even
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,255	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Begin to work
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,791	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	In fact none of that stuff for
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:03,423	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The Decades of fighting back against the waves the ocean was getting dangerously close to the lighthouse
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:06,239	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Less than half of football field weigh
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:08,543	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Basically we would stand
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,591	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Besides a lighthouse
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,127	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And see
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,663	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	How this
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,943	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Precious historic
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:20,063	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Structure was due to fall in I mean it was easy to see where
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:21,855	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	A good storm
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,391	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Would have
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:24,671	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Taking out the lighthouse
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:29,791	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Is it wouldn't have to be a wind blank or storm but it has gotten to that stage
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:33,887	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And so 1974 Oren wrote an academic article
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:36,703	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	He said we tried pretty much everything
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,727	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Texas lighthouse
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,007	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Time to give up
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,799	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Hero quote
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:43,615	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It is difficult but necessary to come to grips
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:47,199	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The ultimate result of living with nature at the shoreline
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:51,551	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And then he started telling the people of Buxton to let the lighthouse go
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:54,367	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Which made them really mad
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,903	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The whole idea of
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:58,463	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Letting things fall in with was absolutely
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:01,023	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Outrageous of course we're going to
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:02,047	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Defender
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:05,375	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Corps of engineer Colonel said
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,143	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	We're not.
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:08,703	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Hold up our hands of slink away
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:13,823	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Most North Carolinians did not want to see the lighthouse fall into the sea
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:17,663	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	In 1981 photographer and conservationist named Hugh Morton
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,455	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Started a group called save the lighthouse
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:23,551	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	School children across the state raised money to support the group
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:27,391	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And they recruited prominent North Carolinians like University presidents
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,183	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Business Leaders and politicians
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:32,255	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The tour guide from the beginning of the story
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:36,095	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	He became the local representative for Save The Lighthouse
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:38,911	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	In terms of uniting political philosophies and
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,727	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	You know contradictory elements of
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:43,519	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Society developers and environmental
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,311	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Everybody
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,871	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Can rally around the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,383	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And that was
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:49,407	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Essentially yes
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:52,223	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	What was going on nothing else mattered
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:54,015	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It was to do right by
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:54,783	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The lighthouse
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,807	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	What's in our heritage in disguise
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:59,135	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Eventually Danny settles on one big idea
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:01,695	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Build a solid concrete wall
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:03,487	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	All the way around the lighthouse
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:07,071	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I think you can pick and choose your fights with Mother Nature you're not going to win all up
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,863	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	You got to pick a fight
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:09,631	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	But you can win
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:16,031	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	That was a very common attitude in those days
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,823	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	My idea was to
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:19,103	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Live with nature at the shoreline
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:21,663	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Warrants at the seawall would be
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:24,735	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Extremely expensive and ultimately counterproductive
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,271	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Busse walls
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:31,391	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	This is one of the more controversial things that I was saying others to that's a wild destroy Beach
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,183	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Orrin had Maps
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,207	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Diagrams of
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:34,719	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	East Coast
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:38,559	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And they showed that seawalls made erosion happen even fast
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:41,887	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	He argued that that's exactly what would happen at the light
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:44,703	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	A wall would make the beach smaller
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,471	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And smaller
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:47,775	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	So now you're a Beach Community without a beach
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:53,663	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	With the seawall plan the lighthouse would eventually become a walled Island out in the water
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:56,223	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Not ideal but even if you were fine with that
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:58,527	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The wall probably wouldn't hold
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:03,903	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Oren said it's hard to imagine building a seawall strong enough for the waves at Cape Hatteras
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:06,719	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Lots of big storms at the cape
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:13,887	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Half the size of the lighthouse the storm server top over the C11 and
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:15,167	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Top of a lighthouse
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:18,751	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Then one day or met an engineer Named Dave fischetti
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:19,775	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Dave Sadler
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:22,335	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	People don't want the lighthouse to fall in
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,383	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	We don't want to see wall
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,175	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	But there's a compromise
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,455	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Nothing can be moved
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:30,015	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It's around 200 ft tall
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:33,855	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	About one and a quarter million bricks in 4800 tons
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,391	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	But believe it or not
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:37,439	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Engineers have moved bigger buildings
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:40,511	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	This presented a pretty good opportunity for Warren
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:44,351	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	He could use the lighthouse to test something that planners call
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,631	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Managed retreat
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,167	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The idea is that
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,703	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	As sea levels rise
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:52,543	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	We won't be able to defend every Coast with a giant wall
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:56,383	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Instead we're going to have to make plans to abandon certain areas
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:58,175	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And move some things out of the way
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,711	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Foreign thot
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:02,783	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Buxton could be convinced to move this big light house
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:05,343	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It might show that managed retreat
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:05,855	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Is doable
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:09,951	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	So she and Dave fischetti along with one of Orrin students
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:10,975	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Steve bush
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,743	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Form their own
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:15,071	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	They called themselves the move the lighthouse
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:15,839	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Committee
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:18,143	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	We met together alive and reproducing
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,679	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Blizzard of papers
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:24,287	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Documenting things about a rosian to think about moving buildings
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:27,103	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Mainly aimed up at the media
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:34,527	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Why did you why did you care so much to spend so much of your time
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:37,855	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I guess I guess I got emotionally involved off
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:42,719	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I wasn't going to let that Lighthouse fall in spite of that first article online
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,535	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	So now you got these two groups
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:48,351	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	They both want to preserve the lighthouse
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,375	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	But they're debating how
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:52,959	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Ultimately it's up to Congress and the National Park Service
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:55,263	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Because this is federal property
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:59,359	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	So the two groups are trying to convince the Feds that they have the better plan
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:03,199	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The town of Buxton flatly rejected orange move ID
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:08,575	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	A local magazine did a poll over 90% of residents wanted to keep the lighthouse in place
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:12,159	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Many were offended by the very idea of retreat
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:15,487	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Hugh Morton said retreating from the shoreline would be quote
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,303	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Cheating man's historic battle against nature
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,351	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And it would make Buxton the laughing
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:21,887	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The coast
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,167	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Danny's group stats
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:24,447	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Save the lighthouse
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:27,007	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	They feel confident they can win this fight
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:29,567	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I didn't like these Outsiders telling them otherwise
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:32,639	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It was a situation of
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:34,431	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Yashow again with a local people
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,199	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Kind of
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:41,087	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Claim ownership of that and how dare somebody with some out-of-state plates come in here and want to tell these
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,647	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	For dwellers on these shifting lonely Sands
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,695	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	What to do with their lighthouse
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:50,559	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I mean we are we're not afraid to pick a fight we're very independent people
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:55,423	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Danny told me a story to explain the tension between orange group in the locals
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:13:01,567	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	He said there was a Duke grad student who would drive down to give talks in Buxton Danny remembered meeting him
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:08,223	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And he proceeded to waltz into a gas station that I was running at the time Filling Station automotive repair shop
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:12,319	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And we're changing out us semi tires for a for a
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:14,111	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Tractor trailers and stuff and Eagles
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,647	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Search wagon
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:17,695	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Finger
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:21,023	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Don't you know that this Lighthouse we're going to lose this lighthouse
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:23,839	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And y'all are obstruction is y'all are you are
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:26,143	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Not y'all he didn't use he one day y'all
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:28,703	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	You said you were holding this up you're holding this project up
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:32,543	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Standing there would like a tire iron in my aunt
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:36,895	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Boren and his group has serious credibility problem in Buxton
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:39,967	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And they understood why people like Danny
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:40,735	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Where it's at
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:43,039	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Of course ofcourse we were outside and we were from
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,599	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	From Land far away in Durham
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:48,415	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Did this ever give you pause
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,439	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I suppose so
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,999	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Going into the community and thing
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,047	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Hey I know the truth
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:57,887	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And after I felt that there was a
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,655	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The pit of arrogance
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:13:59,679	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And Napa
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:01,983	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	What was the choice
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:03,519	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I didn't know anything about her
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:07,103	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	How you deal with people I guess in in this sense
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:09,663	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Hi understood sometimes
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:12,223	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	That I was
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:16,575	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Speaking over their heads are facing things that they that they did not
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,855	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Understand that did not want under
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,159	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And there were other reasons
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,439	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	People didn't like orange group
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:25,279	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Many words a lighthouse was so big and so old
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,303	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	That it would break
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,071	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	If you try to move it
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:31,167	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I just had strong feelings about the location of the lighthouse
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:34,751	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	They said it would lose historical value in a new spot
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:37,311	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And then there were also some big money interests
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:42,175	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Business owners and real estate developers thought a move would hurt their bottom line
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,479	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	If you own something with a name like
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,527	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The lighthouse View Motel
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,575	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	People move a lighthouse out of you
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:56,767	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Throughout the 80s and 90s there were lots of scientific committees commission studies and reports
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:15:00,607	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	They all decided that moving the lighthouse was the best idea
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,911	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	But that didn't do much to convince the local
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:06,495	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Except for these two local Lighthouse historian
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,775	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Bruce and Cheryl Roberts
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,567	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Bruce
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,871	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Nice to meet you
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,663	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	How you doing
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:15,967	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Yeah she'll wasn't around when I met Bruce
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,783	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	She was busy working on a new Lighthouse book
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:21,087	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	My wife does most of the writing in
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:21,855	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I take
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:22,623	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Pictures of lighthouses
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,695	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I'm actually photographed almost every
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:26,719	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	American lighthouse
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:31,071	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Recent Cheryl have basically turn their home into a shrine
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,095	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	4 lighthouses
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:34,399	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I got over a hundred Lighthouse books
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:37,471	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	There's a bunch of miniature lighthouses scattered about
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:40,287	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I see countless Lighthouse paintings and pictures
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:42,591	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And in their study there's a giant
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,615	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	3 panel room divider
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:45,919	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It looks like one of those Japanese screens
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:49,759	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Only it's got the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse painted on it
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:52,575	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	There is something about a lighthouse iPhone
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:53,599	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Especially
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,999	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Back at the time of the controversy
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:03,583	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Bruce and Cheryl were writing a book about the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,887	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	That's when they started to do some research
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,423	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	We had read the reports
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:10,495	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The White House would be lost in
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:13,823	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	We talked to some of the other scientists who have studied
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:17,151	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And made an interesting discovery
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:21,503	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The scientist told them that the lighthouse it's on yellow pine Timbers
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:24,831	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	They're submerged in a pool of freshwater
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:26,367	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It's a strange design
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:30,463	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The Builder who constructed the lighthouse knew that if he kept those beans in freshwater
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:31,999	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	They be preserved
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:33,791	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And his plan had work
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,071	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	For over a hundred years
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,351	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Here's the problem
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:40,191	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The ocean was coming closer and closer to the lighthouse
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:44,287	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The ocean is filled with microorganisms that could degrade the wood
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:47,615	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	If the salt water seeped into the foundation
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:48,639	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The beams wood rot
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:51,199	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And that was the reason that
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,967	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Channel 9
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,783	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Realized that
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:17:00,671	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	If nothing else happened Lighthouse will begin to tip is that what Foundation was eating away we actually
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:04,511	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Went and talked to several of a scientist who it's on the study
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,791	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Saying it had to be moved
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:10,399	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And we got convinced that they knew what they were doing
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:11,679	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	This was a
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,447	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Huge gap
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,727	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	14 move the lighthouse
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:17,311	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Bruce and Cheryl weren't technocratic Outsiders
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,335	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	They were like us finale
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:20,127	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I never seen you look
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,151	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Like it or not
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:23,455	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Scientists are actually right
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:27,551	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Then in 1996 two major hurricanes hit North Carolina
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,087	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Hurricane Bertha
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:35,487	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Hurricane Fran North Carolina and Ocracoke Island and Hatteras Island or under an evacuation map
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:40,863	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Mandate
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:45,983	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Hurricanes are becoming more frequent and more intense
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:48,031	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And this created a new sense of urgency
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:52,127	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	So 1997 Congress started planning a potential move
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:55,455	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	17 years after save the lighthouse formed
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:56,479	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And after almost
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:57,759	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Two decades of debate
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:00,575	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	A public meeting was held to discuss the move
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:04,671	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It was organized by a US senator from North Carolina
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:06,719	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	As well as a state senator from the region
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,791	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It was April 1998
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:12,607	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	About 400 people filed into an aquarium
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:14,655	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The largest building in the Outer Banks
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:16,959	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Children are busting from every school
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:19,775	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	There were 11 news crews their reporting on the event
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:23,871	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The people of Buxton new the fate of the lighthouse might be decided here
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:29,503	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Today they had their move it or lose it signs and then the others are like save not move
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:32,319	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Guy came up to me grabbed me by the arm said here's your sticker
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:36,671	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And I looked at it and said move it or lose it all out on that damn sticker
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:41,535	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Politicians and their aides watched as people got up to testify for each sign
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:43,839	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Every time somebody said something
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:50,239	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	That was beneficial to their side they would a corrupted cheers like you were some of the Roman Colosseum
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,519	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And what about your gladiators
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:54,079	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And Bruce who was there along with Danny
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:56,639	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	But the crowd was clearly against the lighthouse movie
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:00,735	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I think I felt
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:05,087	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	We were going to lose
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,927	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Bruce went back home feeling defeated
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:12,511	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	He was convinced Congress was not going to fund the movie
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:14,815	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I think the back
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:18,911	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	That your tube I heard the phone ring back in the office and Cheryl
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,983	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	We're back in
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:28,383	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	North Carolina state senator Marc basnight was on the other end of the phone
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:29,663	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	He said
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:34,527	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Before the meeting I supported moving the lighthouse but then I saw just how unpopular that was
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:36,831	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And now I don't think I can do it
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,343	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:39,135	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I said wait a minute
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,159	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Here's Cheryl
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:41,951	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Do you know about that
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,511	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Foundation
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,791	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And the danger
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,583	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Collapsing
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,119	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	He said no
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,679	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Bicycle Denmark
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:54,495	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	You should not be making a decision
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,519	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	In this matter
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:57,567	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	You need to listen more to the facts
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,615	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Cheryl told the senator about the
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:01,407	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Pine boards in the saltwater
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:04,991	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	She told him if we don't move it the lighthouse might just fall over
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:06,271	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And he did he say
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:08,319	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	What's a tariff
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,367	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Hour hour and a half
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:13,951	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And she want them over
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:14,463	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	He had to know

EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:22,655	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	This was the critical moment Cheryl got the senator back on board and he urged
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:24,191	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Congress to act fast
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:26,751	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	A few months later Congress funded the Moon
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:29,823	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	In a last-ditch effort the local County sued
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:36,223	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	But they lost it was a stinging reminder that even though it may have felt like buxton's lighthouse
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:36,991	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It wasn't
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:43,135	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Skip Along to the federal government
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:51,071	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Began on June 17th 1999 journalist swarmed
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:51,839	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Boxden
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:54,399	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Because nothing like this has ever happened before
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:59,519	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	No one had picked up a 4800 ton Lighthouse and moved it over half a mile
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:01,055	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	People called it
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:02,847	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The move of the millennium
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:09,247	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Make sure they know we're Romo tape from the truck when you're hearing tape from a documentary made by a local TV station
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:15,647	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Already there have been 1,800 visitors to the park this morning that's about double what they usually seek
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:17,184	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Coming here this time of year
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:20,512	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The Park Service put in Orange fence near the base of the lighthouse
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:22,304	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Antorus lined up along it
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:26,400	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Local sold them t-shirts and hotdogs at everyone waited and
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:29,472	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Brian what do you think about the lighthouse what do you think about it
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,848	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Big
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:36,384	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It sure is big
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,408	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	How we going to move that
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:38,432	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Can I pick it up
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,480	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I'm sorry but
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,040	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It is heavy
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:45,344	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The process was pretty simple
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:48,160	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	First the engineer's cut through the granite base
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:48,672	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Satellite house
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:55,072	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Banana Splits 7 giant steel beams underneath it the beans created a New Foundation
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:58,656	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	A grid under the lighthouse
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:22:05,056	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The pressure at 44 under the steel grid and using hydraulics
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:09,152	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Who sing up onto a track leading to the lighthouses near home
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:20,416	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Ajax the engineer's for all ready to roll
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:22,464	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	They pulled a giant lever
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:29,376	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I know Lighthouse started 2-inch former if you were there that day in the crown
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:33,472	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	This all would have looked inside come after because the lighthouse moved
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:34,240	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:41,152	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Can you see if you couldn't even tell
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:43,712	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The Rangers had to put markers along the track
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:46,272	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Just so you could be sure that it did in fact
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:51,392	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It's just going real
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,184	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And you're lucky to be
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:55,488	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The end of the first day
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:57,792	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The lighthouse it only move 10 feet
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:23:00,864	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	This whole process would take weeks
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:05,472	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	My word is still going out
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:06,496	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Slowly
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:10,592	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Bruce remember showing up one day near the end of the move
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:13,408	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Decide Danny coming towards him through the crowd
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:15,200	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Danny told him
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:16,480	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	They're moving it too fast
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:18,272	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I'm limestone.
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:19,808	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	What
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:23,136	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	What's wrong with Lily get too fast
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,184	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Is his look
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,976	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Every restaurant is
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,512	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Making money
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:30,048	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Kerry Hotel smoking
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:30,816	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Money
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:33,376	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	We have never had friends like this ever before
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:38,240	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	If you can just slow it down till September
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:40,032	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	We'll all be rich
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:43,104	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Slow Down slow down slow down
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:45,920	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Orange
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,840	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	At the lighthouse in to its new home
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:09,728	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It was again 1600 feet from Shore the exact same distance it was in 1870
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:11,008	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	For the sea
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:12,032	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Wash the beach away
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:18,688	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Before the move the people of Buxton felt something terrible and undemocratic was happening to them
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:22,528	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	These out-of-towners were destroying the heart and soul of their Island
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:24,576	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The community fought hard
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,344	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And they lost
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:27,648	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	But in a strange way
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:29,184	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Things actually worked out for them
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:32,256	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I look back at this you know after this is all said and done
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:35,072	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Was moving that Lighthouse the right thing to do
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,352	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Yes it was
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:38,912	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Daddy got a ton of Business from The Tourist
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:42,496	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Is repair shop in gas station had never done so well
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:45,056	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	So he's had a complete change of heart
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:46,080	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And he's not alone
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:50,944	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	In fact most people think that the move was the best thing that ever happened to Bucks
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:54,784	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Something as Monumental as moving America's lighthouse
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:58,368	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Put us on a national radar on an international radar
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:01,184	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And people started thinking about the Outer Banks
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:02,208	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It was a raging
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:03,232	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Success
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:08,864	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Danny doesn't look back now and see the movie as a cowardly retreat
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:11,680	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	He sees it as a testament to human ingenuity
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,728	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Is all makes orange
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:14,496	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Hopeful
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:16,032	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Is if Danny can change his views
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:18,080	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Maybe others will too
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:20,640	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	They'll I think the moving the lighthouse was a
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,408	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The profound event
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:24,736	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	In terms of our response to sea level rise
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:27,296	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I think the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:30,368	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Is kind of a good example
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:32,416	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	We're going to be doing a lot in the future
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:35,232	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	If you can move a 3000 or whatever it is
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:36,512	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Tongue
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:39,072	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Lighthouse you can move a lot of colleges
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:41,888	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	But it's not just lighthouses in Beach cottages
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:45,472	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	There are thousands of miles of vulnerable US coastline
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:50,848	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The Battle of Buxton is just a preview of the tough choices will have to make
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:54,944	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	We have three thousand miles of Barrier Island show and so whatever happens
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:55,712	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Cher
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:57,760	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Is also happening in Galveston
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:26:00,832	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And also is happening and Myrtle Beach and then
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,880	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Jekyll Island Georgia
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:04,160	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And they're all going to be
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:11,072	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Asking for money from the FED that we need money we need money we need to nurse the beach or we need to we need help.
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:14,144	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It ain't going to be there
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:16,192	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	That's why Retreat is important
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:21,824	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	But the year 2100 at least 500 us communities will be at risk from sea-level Rise
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:23,872	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Including major cities
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:25,408	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It's like Miami and New Orleans
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:28,224	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	That's according to the union of concerned scientists
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:31,552	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And then there's the millions of people in other parts of the world
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:33,856	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	In countries like Bangladesh
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:34,624	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Guilin
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:37,184	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Better already being badly affected
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:39,488	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	People get this worked up
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,512	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	About a lighthouse
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:45,120	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Imagine how hard it will be when we start talking about moving entire cities
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:49,216	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	How can you do that fairly and in a way that doesn't devastate communities
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:52,800	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	We're going to be fighting this battle over and over again
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:58,688	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And after all of this the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse will probably have to move again
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:01,760	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It might last 100 years at its current location
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:03,552	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	But some scientists say
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:05,088	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Maybe even less than that
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:28,640	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	We've another high-stakes story of a building being rude but this time
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:30,944	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	All the people were in it when it
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:32,224	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	But after that
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:49,376	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:51,680	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	The cluttered World a man-made sound
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:57,568	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:28:02,944	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and another hearing.
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:04,992	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Voice technology talk to us
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:07,296	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	It is a creation of Sonic trash
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:10,368	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:49,440	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	To talk about it
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:54,048	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	So back in the 1950s City officials in Guadalajara decided

EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:59,168	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And a lot of buildings were just demolished
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:01,472	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	There is a problem
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:04,800	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	There's this one 1700 ton brick structure occupied

EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:16,320	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Why not demolish
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:17,856	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	This building along with the rest of it
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:21,440	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Will it would have been more expensive

EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:38,080	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And keeping the operators at work
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:38,592	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	Inside it
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:47,296	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	I've been pretty nervous

EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,904	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	So his wife Esmeralda

EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:59,072	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And she even took along their seven-year-old son one Jorge

EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:25,952	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	And they didn't even feel the tiniest movement
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:27,488	| 293_Managed_Retreat_pt_01 |	When they moved the whole building and all the Opera
