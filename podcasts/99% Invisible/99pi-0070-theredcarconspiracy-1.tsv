EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:59,583	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	No I mean historically American cities grow organically and Rings you know out of a downtown
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:03,423	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	In Huntington really forces Los Angeles to expand

EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:26,207	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	There's a lot of reasons not to like cities and they were dirty they were crowded

EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:24,479	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	But it was clear already to historians
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,247	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Looking back
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,271	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Set the red car

EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,791	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Is a lot of money spent
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,839	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	A lot of advertising spend on both sides just like
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,863	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Referendums today
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,911	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	And the voters reject the plan
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:21,311	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	People just didn't like feather Pacific they had meddled in California politics for so long
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,079	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Did they called it
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:23,359	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	The octave
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:29,503	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Okay so now remember the original sort of conspiracy
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:32,319	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Theory that the car companies bought up a red car and
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,343	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Tore them down in Belton
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:33,855	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	The freeways
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:37,183	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	So there was a subsidiary of General Motors
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,463	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	It's called National City
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:42,815	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	And they did by Charlie cars and they converted them into
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,327	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Bus routes
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:46,143	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	And their people the time that.
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:50,495	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	It was a conspiracy this was in this conspiracy that suddenly you know people discovered 50 years later
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:54,079	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	But the fact is Pacific electric was doing the same thing to the wrong trolley
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:59,199	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	As freeways became the norm in the red car became a thing of the past
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:04,063	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	You can see how a conspiracy theory could become cemented into the public imagination
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:06,623	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	So when I first saw map of the red car lines
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,927	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	I actually thought it was an early map of
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,695	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	The freeways
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:12,255	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Which makes sense because of the route that people are using to get around
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,815	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	And some cases like the Cahuenga pass
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:18,655	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Trains were actually dismantle to make way for the Hollywood freeway

EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:24,543	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Paved over a trolley route and sometimes you know when I was heading to the 405 I actually
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,055	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Drive over
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,335	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Phantom tracks

EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:35,039	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	A few years later
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:38,367	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	City planners proposed another plan for elevated railroads
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:40,159	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	That was rejected by the city council
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:43,999	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	The last Red Car ran in 1961
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:47,839	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	And you have to think it was in a way a victim of its own success
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:52,959	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Henry Huntington's goal was to connect his far-flung properties and create a decentralized city
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:55,519	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	That you need a mass transit solution
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:56,543	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	To get around
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:58,591	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	The problem was
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,871	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	He couldn't provide it
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:03,199	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Overtime La was so spread out
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,479	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Headed over Tok
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,759	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	What the red car
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:06,783	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Was capable of servicing
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:11,391	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	I like to imagine you know if it's 1960 and I'm driving along the 10 freeway
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:11,903	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	I mean
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:18,815	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Yeah I'm sure there's traffic but it must have been pretty smooth cuz I'm in the freeways that exist now we're the same freeways back
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,583	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	Then
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,631	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	But don't for a much smaller population
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:23,679	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	So they must have seemed like
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:25,471	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	A really impressive solution.
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:25,983	| 99pi-0070-theredcarconspiracy-1 |	The time
