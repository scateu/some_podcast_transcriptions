EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:13,120	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	There was a time they didn't have a barcode
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:16,704	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	It's hard to imagine now a world without barcode
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:17,728	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	A world
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,520	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Without George lure

EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:24,128	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	I'm the one
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:27,712	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The UPC barcode
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,736	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	And symbol
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:31,040	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	In 1973
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:34,112	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Found some of you might be saying to yourselves
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:37,184	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	I thought Joseph Woodland invented the barcode
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:38,464	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Maybe you're saying that to yourself
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:40,768	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	You are a nerd
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,048	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	And I love you
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,864	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	And just hold your nerd horses because
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:46,656	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	We're getting to Woodland ride
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,168	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Now
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,032	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	It started the way a lot of thing
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:54,336	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	People trying to make
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,104	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	More money
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:56,896	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Video
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,664	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Grocery business
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:01,504	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Decided that they needed some way to reduce their overhead
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:06,112	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	One of the main places they felt they were losing money was the checkout line
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:10,720	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	They came up with the idea of having some kind of a scannable
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,488	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Code
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:14,560	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Which would move people more quickly through the line
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:18,656	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	One of the first people that started working on it with an engineer named Joseph
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,168	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Woodland
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:24,544	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	After working on the Manhattan Project Woodland moved on to develop an Innovative way to produce
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:25,824	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Elevator music
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:28,128	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	He was jamming on this project
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:33,760	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Probably set to make a whole bunch of money until and this is according to Woodlands New York Times obituary
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:35,808	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	His father forbid him
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,112	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Getting into the industry because it was
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:39,136	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Controlled by the mob
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:45,024	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	So Woodland moved on from elevator music
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:45,792	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	2 barcodes
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:52,960	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	He was trying to come up with a symbol that when scanned would translate to a series of numbers that a computer could use
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:53,984	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Identify a product
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:57,568	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	So one day he's sitting on the beach in Miami Florida
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,848	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	So the legend goes
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:01,920	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	And Woodlands thinking about his days in the Boy Scouts and more
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:04,992	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	As one tends to do on the beach
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:08,064	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Any kind of absent-mindedly drawing in the sand with
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:08,576	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	His fingers
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,880	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	When suddenly he looks down
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,648	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	And he's got it
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:15,744	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	He's dragged his four fingers through the sand in the shape
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:16,768	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	A concentric circles
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:20,351	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Instead of dot dot dot dash dash dash he thinks
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:23,167	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Can you skinny and wide lines
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:25,215	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Bullseye bullseye
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:28,031	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The very first barcodes were in the shape of a bullseye
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,847	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Actually they didn't call them barcodes yet
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:34,687	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Woodlands convention was called a classifying apparatus and method
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,991	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	I'm really glad that we don't call him that anymore
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,295	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	That was 1948
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,831	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	About 20 years
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,623	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The bullseye idea gathered.
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:49,535	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The scanners and other equipment needed to put the system in place we're just too expensive for any of it to be feasible
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:52,095	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Fast forward to 1970s
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:59,007	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The technology is now a bit more affordable and a group of Supermarket executive led by a guy named Allen have
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,543	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	I like okay
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,591	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Barcode or bust
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,359	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Doing this
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:07,455	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	By that time there were a few other designs out there but none were purse
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:14,623	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	So they put together a list of qualities that their ideal barcode would have and ask 14 different companies to come up with
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,135	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The Proposal
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:17,695	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Could be no larger than one of those
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:19,487	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	1 1/2 square inches
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:21,279	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	How to have a good enough depth
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,559	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Brookfield liquor to read
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:26,911	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	About a foot-and-a-half above the scanner had to be omnidirectional
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:28,447	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	That's George lower again
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:30,495	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	He was working at IBM at the
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:33,311	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The time which was one of the companies competing to make the best
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,615	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	And most people thought
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:37,663	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	That a circular design like Woodlands
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:40,223	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Would probably work best because of the way the scanners were
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,015	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Those days
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:43,551	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Just about every scanner
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:45,087	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Was a single one
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:52,511	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	And you can just picture that if you had a single line and it was going in the direction of the bar it would not read
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,279	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	All the bars
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,839	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Women's original circular design solved
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:58,399	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Because it could be read from any direction
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:02,239	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Batman the checkout person didn't have to take your bag of Cheetos and
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,775	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Turn it in just the right wave
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:05,311	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Before I could pass over the scanner
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:08,639	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	But George didn't think the bullseye symbol would work
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,407	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	I couldn't
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:10,175	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Support
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:15,551	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	That is the solution to what the grocery industry wanted
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:16,831	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Because
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:22,207	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	To me there was no way that it would fulfill their specifications
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:26,559	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	My Integrity just would not let me come up with a
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,095	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Willow
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,375	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Bunch of bull
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,679	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	So George went back to the drawing paper
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,983	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	My wife said life
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:36,287	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Came back and I will work on it day and night
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,079	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Come back at night
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:42,175	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Again most of us was thinking arithmetic
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:45,759	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Trying to prove that this would work
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:51,391	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Also I have to admit how to disprove that some of the others wouldn't work
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:58,559	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Ultimately came up with a rectangular barcode that fit more code into less space which was crucial since
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:03,935	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Grocery manufacturers were already grumbling about having to make room for this new symbol on their packaging
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:07,263	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	But there was still the issue of the one line scanner
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:11,359	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Somehow we got the idea that if we used an X
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,151	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	For the span powder
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:17,759	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Which could be developed very easily with a pair of mirrors
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:22,879	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The barcode can be read by the scanner and no matter which way it was oriented has it passed
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:28,767	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Do even though Woodland came up with the original idea of using lines of various widths
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,327	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	George lure did more than dust
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,607	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Teams that shape
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:34,399	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	From a circle to a rectangle
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,935	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Improved on the symbol
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:36,959	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The code behind the symbol
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:39,519	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	And the scanners that read the symbol
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:41,055	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Even Joe Woodland thought so
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:43,359	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Joe Woodland was
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:45,663	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Very enthusiastic he worked with me
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:48,991	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	In fact he wrote the actual proposal
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:51,551	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	For the submission to the grocery industry
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:52,575	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	But it was

EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:58,207	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Invention of the particular symbol and barcode that we see today
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,999	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The symbol selection
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,535	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Committee unanimously voted

EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:12,703	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	When barcodes became the standard they didn't just make checkout lines faster
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:18,591	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Payload stores to keep track of huge amounts of inventory and the collect data on what we were buying
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:22,431	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Data they could use to keep us coming back for more
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:24,991	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Without bar codes exist
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:29,599	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	But equally small store might need more employees
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,695	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	It's like degrees that
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:38,559	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	That makes a machine wrong that's one of the key you know elements of fun

EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:45,727	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	When you put it like that you can see why for some people
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:50,847	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The barcode has come to represent everything they hate about capitalism and consumerism

EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,943	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	I've been
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:29,247	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Writing software that prints barcodes
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:35,647	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	For 25 years now they aren't bad they aren't good they're just tools but most people look at them and don't even know where to
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,415	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Start
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:40,255	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	So let's demystify for a minute and look at what's inside the barcode
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:45,119	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Again what we're talking about here is the UPC barcode that George lure invented
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:48,447	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Is the barcode that you and I and everyone in the world
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:50,239	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Has had the most interaction with
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,543	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The UPC barcode is divided into
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,055	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	2/2
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:55,871	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	It's actually two barcode sitting right neck
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,151	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Each other
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:11:00,223	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	You can see this visually because there are these longer bars that
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:02,015	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Come down in the middle and on each side
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,063	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Those are called the guard bars
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:08,415	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The guard bars tell the scanner that the code is starting and ending
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:13,023	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The left half of the barcode tells you who the manufacturer is
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:15,071	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	And the right have tells you which
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,095	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Particular product
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:21,215	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	And this was something I didn't realize the scanner is reading both the light and the dark light
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:25,567	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Don't understand the standard just consider yourself
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,591	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The darkroom
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:29,919	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Where the wall behind you as far as painted on it
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,967	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	And you took a flashlight
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:34,015	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	And shined it over your head
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,039	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Across the bars
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,575	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	You would see
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:40,415	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The room got a little lighter when you were over the white bars
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:41,695	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	And it would get dark
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,719	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	When it was over the top
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:49,887	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Black lines that don't reflect the laser light back to the scanner register as a 1 White Lines equal 0
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:54,495	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	They're actually 95 evenly spaced columns on a UPC barcode
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,031	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	I think black line is actually
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:57,823	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	A bunch of ones right next to each other
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:01,663	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The computer add all that together and you get a string of 12 numbers
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,991	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	This number goes to the computer
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:08,319	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The computer no looks up and it's table
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,599	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	To get the information
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,135	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Such as
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:13,695	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	What is the product how much they're charging for it
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,999	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	But that is not in the barcode
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,791	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The only thing that's in the barcode
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:19,839	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Is where the computer should look
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:23,167	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	This number is also printed below the barcode just in case this
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:24,191	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Scanner isn't working
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:26,495	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Which for me really makes
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:28,287	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The whole mystery a little
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:29,055	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Anticlimactic
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:30,335	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	I mean
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,383	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Right there
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:37,759	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	So when most people until recently thought of barcodes they thought of something that was
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,039	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Is a combination of bars and Stripes
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:44,415	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	More recently two-dimensional barcodes which are
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,207	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	They look like crossword puzzles
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:52,095	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Have emerged in most popular being QR barcodes quick response
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:54,143	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	That are scanned by cell phones
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:56,703	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	We've all seen these and maybe a few of us
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:13:02,079	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	I'm actually bothered to pull out our cell phones and download the app required to scan them
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,639	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Yeah there's something about them that I find kind of
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:06,687	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Lame or annoying
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,711	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	You know it's like
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:14,111	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	No Chili's I don't want more info on the Bloomin Onion
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:16,927	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	So anyway I Googled why are QR codes
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:21,791	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Lame and I got a bunch of Articles basically saying they're actually really useful they're just
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:22,815	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Being misused
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:26,911	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Mostly by advertisers who just started slapping them on every single thing
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:28,447	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	But Jerry Whiting
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,471	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	He still believes in them
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:32,031	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	The nice thing about QR barcodes
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,311	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Says they are not Justa
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,847	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	I'll look up number
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:35,615	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	To an external data
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,407	| 99pi-0108-barcodes-1 |	Yes it could be a chunk attack
