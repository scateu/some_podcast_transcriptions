EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:47,967	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	The original structure of the roof
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:52,063	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Sometime in the 20th century the roof had been completely replaced by the military

EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,487	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	That uses
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:05,631	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Wood beams as a network of cantilevers and trusses on the inside to make the roof strong

EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:25,855	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Because the ridge Beast Wade 3/4 of a ton they can only be placed where the hammer beam roof was the strongest
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:29,183	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	This is as true now as it was 300 years ago
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:35,327	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	We got, being rich constructing makeup know how everything works left we want to get it released but we need Clues to be over
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:42,751	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	They found one diagram of a cross-section of the hammer beam roof of the Great Hall from 17-19 but
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:45,567	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Since it's the only record it's hard to know if it's completely accurate
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:52,479	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Since there was no other information about what the roof look like they began researching the surveyors from 1790 New Jersey
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:57,343	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	The diagram and they found that other diagrams they drew of other castles were very accurate
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:59,903	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	So here's our leap of faith this is where
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:00,671	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	You start
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:03,487	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	How to use conjecture in your restoration
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,767	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	To make value judgments
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:08,095	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	And we've decided that we will put the whole of the structure back
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:10,143	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	So this is what we're basing it on
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:17,055	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	So using that one historic document they reconstructed the roof which determine where the heavy Stone Ridge Beast would be
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,079	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Placed on top
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:22,687	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	One Discovery begets another and another and the original building comes into Focus
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:29,087	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	And that's the detective work of restoration careful research Discovery verification sometimes conjecture
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:29,855	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Leaps of faith
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:34,207	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	It's this beautiful amalgam of history science and art
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:39,583	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	The hammer beam roof was completed in 1999 and everyone who sees it including the Sterling Folk

EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,887	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	It looks really great
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,167	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	So far
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:43,935	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	New controversy
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,727	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	But as We Know
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:48,543	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	The roof was not the only thing to change
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,079	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	So the controversy is coming
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:57,503	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	The building was almost completely gray stone that was none of the original
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:01,599	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	But in one corner just under the Best Buy
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:04,927	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	There had been a little lean to shelter
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:06,463	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Built in front of the door
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:09,023	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	I want me to get my refund the complete panel
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,559	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Of the original lime wash
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:15,935	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Limewash is pure lime calcium oxide. The green citrus fruit
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,983	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	It also contains earth-based pigments
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:21,311	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	It's a coding that's meant to protect the stone masonry
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:26,431	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Navigate to Sterling they found a significant yellow ochre layer of limewash
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:31,551	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	The bright yellow was very intentional hundreds of years ago that built world is basically Brown
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,879	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	There was this great

EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,023	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	That this was a place

EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:45,887	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	And we did huge some puddles all the time which is around the building
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:49,983	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	To show people what open mics have look like avocados might have been
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:54,079	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	And we brought a lot of people from the starting area to see this as well
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,871	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Guess what we were intending to do
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:58,175	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Based on the analysis and information had
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,199	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Was to put the finishes by
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:03,551	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	And that is exactly what they did which is why the Great Hall
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:04,575	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Is yellow
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:08,671	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Did not exactly go over well with the people of Sterling
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,231	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Strangely in restoration terms
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:14,815	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	It's the one element that we had the most evidence for
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:20,191	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	They actually had physical pieces of exterior limewash all over the castle
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:22,239	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	The hammer beam roof on the other hand
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,543	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Was based much more on conjecture
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:26,079	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	It's not working right
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:32,735	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	When Peters team was putting on the yellow finish the Great Hall was completely covered in Scaffolding in plastic
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:39,647	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	This may have contributed to the intensity of the reaction from the locals once it was unveiled.

EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:56,543	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	But nobody knew anything about anything else
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:59,359	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	So when the Great unveiling came
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:02,175	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	It was a total
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,943	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Surprise
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,735	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	It just

EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:06,527	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	So awful
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:10,111	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	And to this day I don't like

EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:33,151	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Lots of groups around to see the samples before we went any further but really getting that message out at 3
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:36,223	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	To the media and getting people to understand that is very very difficult
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:39,551	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Tell me when it is a change on the scale
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:41,599	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	I think that possibly
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:43,391	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	A bigger marketing campaign
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:50,303	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Should have come up there this was 15 years ago before Twitter and Facebook made it easier to reach people certainly wood
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:53,887	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Experience from the great hollow as to how I think we should be getting messages
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:57,471	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	If people really understand what you're doing and raylee
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:59,519	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Buy internet from day one
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:01,823	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Then I think it makes it alot easier
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,407	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	All Restorations are unique
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:11,295	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	I don't think the Statue of Liberty should have been returned to Copper when it was restored
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,319	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	As a landmark
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:16,415	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	People fell in love with it and it gained its significance when it was Green
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:18,463	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	It made sense to keep it that way
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:23,327	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	But I found being in the bright yellow Great Hall at Stirling Castle
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,351	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Really exciting
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:30,239	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	I'm sympathetic to the fact that the color was shocking to the residents who grew up with it looking completely different
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:33,311	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	But it's brightness brought it to life for me
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:38,175	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	It made me reinterpret my faded and ultimately wrong image of the past
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:44,831	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	It's nearly all the Greek and Roman sculptures that we know and love were painted bright vibrant colors
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:46,367	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Even though most of us
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:48,415	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Can only imagine them as white marble
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:51,999	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	When I see color reconstructions of ancient statues
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:53,279	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	I think they look
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:54,815	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:14:01,215	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	But I can't help but feel that I know the Greeks and Romans a little bit better after seeing what they thought look good
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:07,615	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	I feel the same about the Renaissance artist who designed the color schemes inside and outside Stirling Castle
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:10,943	| 99pi-0178-thegreatrestoration-1 |	They were mixing colors that ready not much
