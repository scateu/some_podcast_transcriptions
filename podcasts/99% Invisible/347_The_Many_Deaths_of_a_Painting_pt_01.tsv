EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:10,431	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	When repairing a painting
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:13,759	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Irreversibility is a cardinal rule of conservation
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:17,599	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	We make every effort to not use any material that

EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:22,207	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	In the future
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,743	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	For example if
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:26,303	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Conservators add paint to a canvas
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,839	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	They want to make sure that
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:29,119	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Paint can be dissolved
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,143	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	And removed later
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:34,239	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	They do this in case the artwork needs to be retouched again in the future
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:39,615	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Conservators also try to preserve as much of the original material as possible
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:42,175	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Touching only the areas that need treatment
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:43,455	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,479	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	They really study the yard
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:46,271	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	And look at their past work
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,831	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	In order to get a sense of what the artist was
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:49,599	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Just trying to achieve
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:51,903	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	With these rules in mind
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:55,487	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	The state elect phoned up practically every conservator in Europe

EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,631	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	And it's 50 Ft worth

EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,175	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Best way to do it
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:20,319	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	The biggest challenge perhaps counterintuitively was the very Simplicity of the painting
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:23,903	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	The busy texture and detail of a Picasso or Rembrandt
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:26,207	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Often helps mask the repair work
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:30,047	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	But Newman's canvas was mostly just one big swath of uniform color
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:34,143	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Any sign of repair however minor should be sure to stand out
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:38,239	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Most conservators were too scared to try
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:42,335	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Nobody wanted to burn their hands on it
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:44,127	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	As we say
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,663	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	But someone
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:47,199	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Finally came to the rescue
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:51,295	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Daniel goldbriar was conservator based in New York

EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:51,008	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	And that would mean that we need me
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:52,800	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	I know
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,688	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Because our paintings are so vulnerable

EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:24,800	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	The title of the painting translates to man heroic and Sublime
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:27,104	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	It was the size of a billboard
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:32,224	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	It looks a lot like who's afraid of red yellow and blue 3 it's like red

EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:50,400	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	She usually read like this one solid wall of red
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:54,240	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	The painting didn't provoke me
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,520	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	To make me angry
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,800	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Like it did so many others

EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:05,696	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	And they're able to work
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:06,208	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Miracle
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:08,512	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	In what kind of Technology are we talking about
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:10,304	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Let's start with imaging technique
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:17,216	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Like Photography they have technology that allows them to see below the surface of the paint
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:23,616	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Like the layers underneath the painting that is brown talked about in the story
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:26,688	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Read reflect ography and I can get too technical on you they also
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:27,712	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Bring
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:29,248	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Painting
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:35,648	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	To hospitals to have them x-rayed and that's not the only way this field overlaps with medicine actually the cancer
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:38,208	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Servitors who stitched cathedra together
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:41,024	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	In the Netherlands they were actually trained at the hospital
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:44,352	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	To do that I talk to another conservator who had been a pre-med
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:46,400	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Student before going into this field
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:52,288	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	So that they're able to see below the surface of the painting using special types of Photography and end
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,568	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Plano x-rays
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:55,360	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	They're also able to determine what
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:56,128	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Elements
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:59,712	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Are in the painting like in the paint layers
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:04,064	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	So they have this thing it's like it sort of looks like a grocery store scanner and they can
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:07,904	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	All over the painting and it'll identify the element
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:09,952	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	It's like choosing cures Cobalt
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:12,000	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	They can basically map
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:13,024	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	The the
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:13,792	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Surface of
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:14,304	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	The painting
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:16,608	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Down to the atom
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:17,376	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Intrinsic
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:18,912	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Of the elements that are there
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:21,984	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	They're also able to see
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:24,288	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	To how the painting
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,568	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Will fade over time
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:30,432	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	They have these tools that can measure an artwork sensitivity to light
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:31,712	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	And project
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:32,992	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	How it will fade
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:35,552	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	They can only
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:36,832	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	See under the surface of the
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:38,624	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Really inside the pain
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:41,184	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Taking off to see into the future
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:41,952	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	That painting
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:42,720	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Wow
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:43,488	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	That's so cool
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:46,560	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	How do you use that information when you're trying to conserve a painting
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:49,632	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	So you can determine how much light it can be
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:51,680	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Supposed to like for instance
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:56,288	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	If you have a painting that is especially light-sensitive you wouldn't know not to
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,824	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Play sit like maybe in
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:36:01,408	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Like a bright lights of a main hall or maybe design special lighting
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:02,688	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	So that
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:03,200	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:04,736	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Fade the painting fast
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:06,272	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Oh so they're like
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:09,344	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Trying to save a painting before it needs to be saved
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:12,672	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Deception method right trying to save a painting before it needs
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:13,184	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Mitsubishi
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:15,232	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	So in the case of this story
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:18,048	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Whirlpool dryer
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:20,608	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Applied a bunch of this red paint in effort
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:21,376	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	2
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:24,960	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	You fix the painting which allowed people ejected to
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:27,008	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	How would you go about removing
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:27,520	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Paint
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:30,592	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	From a painting without removing all the pay
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:33,920	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Chick-fil-A painting if you really wanted to to put it back to where it originally was
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:38,272	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	So very carefully
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:42,112	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Bet there's a couple different ways they remove stuff from the surface of of
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:43,136	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Of artworks
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:44,416	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	That's an added there that they don't
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:45,696	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Like
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:48,000	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	They use emulsions and gels
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:49,536	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	That dissolve
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:56,448	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Material added to the surface of the artwork but these are gels are like kind of discus you know it's not so it's not
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:57,472	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Liquid it doesn't run
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:37:00,544	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	And they're able to keep it really contain
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:03,360	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	They also use the stuff
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:06,944	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	I don't think it's been used a lot but it's probably the coolest thing I've
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:08,992	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Heard about wealth while researching the story
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:10,784	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	They use atomic
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:15,648	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Oxygen what I'm about to say doesn't make sense but it's literally oxygen from space
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:22,048	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	It's it's an elemental form of oxygen that does not exist in the Earth's atmosphere.
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:23,840	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	You only find it in low earth orbit
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:27,168	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	This technology is actually developed by NASA because
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:32,288	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Atomic oxygen is like they were sending corrosion on satellites in the international
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:32,800	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Space Station
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:37,408	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	They basically either use like a an airbrush and like
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:39,456	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Had it very close to paint where they put
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:42,272	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	The piece of art in a vacuum chamber and pump in the stuff
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:44,576	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	It's really good for removing
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:47,648	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	From fire damaged
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:49,184	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Paintings that you can actually see
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:51,488	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Some photos online
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:53,024	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Obtaining save restored
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:54,816	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	That have been in fires
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:58,144	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	And it's pretty mind-blowing actual
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:00,704	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Like a before-and-after like you have a picture
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:03,008	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Black and ruined painting
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:06,080	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	And on the other you got a completely Lycra
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:06,592	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Restored work
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:11,968	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	The atomic oxygen was always used to most famously to restore this painting
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:14,016	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	By Andy Warhol called bathtub
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:15,296	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	The painting of a
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,064	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Bathtub
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:21,696	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Somebody at a party at the Museum had a had kissed it so there was a lipstick mark on it
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:25,024	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	They were able to remove it using Atomic oxygen
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:27,840	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	In all these cases you know
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:30,912	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Conservatives had basically given up hope
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:31,424	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	On this painting
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:33,472	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	They're like these are never going to
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:36,288	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	So with all this new technology
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:38,336	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Is it possible
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:39,360	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	They could go back
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:39,872	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	2
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:44,224	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Yeah really restore who's afraid of red yellow and blue
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:44,992	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Number three
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:46,784	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	The way that
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:48,576	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	You would feel really want to do lyrics
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:51,392	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Yeso
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:53,440	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	The answer is Maybe
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:59,840	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Near the end of my reporting I talk to a journalist in the Netherlands
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:03,424	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Hood written a book on the state of like his name was Ian lemures great
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:04,192	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Resource
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:07,776	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	In a couple years ago he was able to get the full results
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:09,568	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	From the forensic lab
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:12,384	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Analysis of who's afraid of red yellow and blue 3
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:13,408	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	The one that had
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,688	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Determine that goal dryer
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:16,480	| 347_The_Many_Deaths_of_a_Painting_pt_01 |	Had over painted it
