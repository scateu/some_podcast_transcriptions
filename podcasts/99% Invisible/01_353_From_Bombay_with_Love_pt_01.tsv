EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:50,912	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Dark
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:54,240	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Critical and hopeless
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:55,520	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	We talked about

EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:04,480	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	He told me that his
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:05,760	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	His first crush was
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:07,808	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Hema Malini from Zita and Gita
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:11,392	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	But he actually watched a lot of Hollywood
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:17,792	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	You still didn't make it into the Soviet Union
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:19,328	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Import American phones
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:25,472	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Cold War there just very selective of what they would screen and Stones were heavily censored or edited
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:30,336	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	And Elmer told me about this kind of funny example of a classic film that they used
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:32,896	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Play the one I always think about is

EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:41,344	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Girls only in jazz
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:44,160	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	What is better
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:54,912	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	He told me that no scenes were often cut or edited out order
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:56,960	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Is translated completely differently
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:57,728	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Need to change the contacts
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:28:59,776	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	A lot of them or
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:00,288	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Spicy lamb
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:01,568	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Which was also
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:04,384	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Cleaned up and there were some scenes
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:05,152	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	That were complete
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:07,456	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	LeConte or translated differently
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:13,856	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	But towards the end of the 70s bootleg movies were a lot easier to get ahold of because of the VCR player
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:18,720	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	And so this is how a lot of people like Almar First Watch uncensored American
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:21,536	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	The way you say VCR player is if
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:26,656	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	You are of an age in which he's never touched one really thick
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:30,496	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Plastic dhs's
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:31,776	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	So you should just say VCR
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:40,480	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	So he had a VCR player
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:43,040	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Yeah it's like this is how he first watch

EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:50,464	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	What you told me the first action film he saw was first Blood the original Rambo movie yes
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:51,232	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Sand
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:57,376	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	It's kind of funny you eat like it wasn't even that these movies were exciting because they were illegal
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:30:00,192	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	But compared to Soviet films American films
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,472	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Just offered a lot of
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:02,496	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Stimulation
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:04,032	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	It's kind of like a barrage on the
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:06,592	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	I just remember the violin
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:07,872	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	The blood and
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:09,408	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Sweat and machine guns
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:11,968	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	And yeah
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:14,272	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Sylvester Stallone's bulging muscles
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:21,184	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Can Boost phones were not County Fair shuttle tickets
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:23,744	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	At least in Baku where Elmer's from
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:28,864	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	People got pretty creative with how they scream these movies because they're still illegal at this point
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:32,448	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	I'm so he actually grew up watching bootleg Hollywood films in video bands
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,984	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	So tell me about
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:38,080	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	It's so in certain parts of the Soviet Union like from probably like the
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:39,872	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	70s to about the 90s
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:42,688	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	There is a popular form of transportation called the mushrooms
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:45,248	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Sort of like a cross
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:46,016	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Between a taxi
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,296	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Panda bus
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,576	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	And they were these
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:50,112	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Latvian Maids
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:50,624	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Mini buses
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:52,416	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	It was like The Rock
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:55,232	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	People refer
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:57,280	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Graphics
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:31:03,680	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	So during the daisies were just public transit but at night some of these rough drivers would convert their buses
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:05,984	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Is into many mobile movie theaters
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:06,752	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Interview they have
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:13,920	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	But TVs and VCRs are screens I got to get work really super common for
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:20,064	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	People that own their own VCRs in their homes on so this made it just a lot easier to bring movies to larger groups
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:20,832	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Two people to watch together
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:22,112	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	And so are these
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,416	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Land was he like it
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:30,816	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	What were they like ice cream trucks were they just would show up there what is actually exactly what it was like it was it was
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:32,864	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Weird mouth and there's like no official schedule
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:34,656	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	I compared it to it like
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:36,448	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Can ice cream van or
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:36,960	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	It just showed up
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:39,264	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	People be like the video van is here
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:40,800	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Annabelle the kids
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:42,336	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	The yard
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:47,200	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Did they get inside the van and watch a movie
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:52,320	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	I guess it's kind of like a Alegria version of watching a movie
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:55,392	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	What are those Entertainment Systems in a family minivan
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:32:01,792	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	The television and the VCR would be in the front of the van right behind the bus driver seat and there be curtains
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:04,608	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	On the windows to block out light and make it a little bit
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:06,144	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	More discreet from the outside
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:06,912	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Will Sadler
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:08,192	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Would sit in the bus
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:08,960	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Spacing
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:09,728	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Forward
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:10,496	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:12,288	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	One of my Vivid memories is
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:13,824	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Smell
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,104	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Stale cigarettes
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:17,664	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	They're all day
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,968	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Sometimes people would actually be
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:27,136	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	10 year old smoking in a bus
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:29,696	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	But something that I thought was interesting was
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:31,232	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	The weight of these phones are translated
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:32,512	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	So it was
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:37,120	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	It was really common that the people who dug these movies into Russian
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:37,888	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	She speaks
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:38,912	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Azerbaijani

EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:48,896	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Or journalist or film critics by day and at night they would illegally translate Hollywood movies
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:52,480	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	And usually it was directly over the original soundtrack
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:57,856	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Usually guy and usually in one take
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:01,184	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	Remove the old Dilaudid

EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:54,944	| 01_353_From_Bombay_with_Love_pt_01 |	That because of the way these films were dubbed over with you being able to hear both English and Russian the same time
