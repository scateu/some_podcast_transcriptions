EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,279	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Go to checkpoint
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,815	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	As a counter is pushing you
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:31,935	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	You're also getting pulled by this giant three-story glass window that looks out onto the tarmac
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:35,775	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	UC playing to see the apron the jetway where the planes are parking
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:37,823	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	And so intuitively your drawing
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:42,687	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Do you're playing cuz that's what you want to go you want to get on that plane right and there are less obvious
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:44,735	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Excuse to like the tile pattern
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:47,295	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	In the floor absolutely they see the grid
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,599	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Instead of being on a 90 degree axis
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,879	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	It's only 45
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:53,951	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Annie's tiles going off at a 45 degree angle
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,999	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	They just begging you to follow them
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:59,583	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	It's so if you do that you inevitably head toward security
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:01,887	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	But there's even more going on in the floor than that
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,935	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	And here's where this gets a little banana
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:06,239	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	You turn around and look back here Sammy
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,263	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	You see where the black
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:10,079	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Starts at the door curbside
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:14,687	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	There's another set of tiles inside the dominant grid pattern that I didn't even notice it first
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:21,599	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	It starts black and then it's joined by a set of yellow goldish tiles the kind of Cleves out this corridor
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,111	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Negative space
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:25,183	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Which cut straight through the hall going directly
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:25,695	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	To security
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:29,023	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	I already have my ticket I'm not checking any bags
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:30,815	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	I will need
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,095	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Check in on at
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:34,655	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	The counter I just Follow The Yellow Brick Road song
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:39,519	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	I think that
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:40,799	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Exactly what this is
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,359	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Light bulb
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:44,383	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	It's pretty cool
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:47,455	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	And all this Jim says is 100% intent
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,479	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,039	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Are interior designers
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,575	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Just went through a number

EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:57,439	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Until we arrived at this one
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,463	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	On the other side of the
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:01,535	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Security we enter what Jim Harding calls the transition Hall
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:04,095	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Here's where traveler has some decisions to
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,631	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Weather defined
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:07,167	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Here or whether to get together
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:07,679	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	The Concourse
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,983	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Take a Subway call the plane train for that
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,263	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Or whether to head to baggage claim
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:14,591	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	This is the part where passengers are going to be asking themselves
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,103	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Where am I
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,895	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Where am I going
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:19,711	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Paladar the best way to get there
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:21,503	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Where there are decisions to be made
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:24,063	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	This is where wayfinding is needed the most
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:28,671	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Yeah the visual wayfinding which is the signage
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,951	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Now that you can see each
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:30,719	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Chicken read it
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,743	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	You can interpret it
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,511	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Bajwa round
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:36,351	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	There's also information desk and a newfangled interactive display
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,143	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	I walk with Jim towards the gate
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,191	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Pictures of seven of nine
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,751	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	So it looks like the odds are on the left
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,567	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	All right
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:48,639	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	That's funny to see there
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,431	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	This Concourse is pretty streamline
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:50,943	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Elegant
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:57,343	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	But at older less well-designed concourses which are definitely present at some other parts of the ATL Airport
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:00,927	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	This is where you find yourself in a visual morass
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,207	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	You've seen this before
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:07,071	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Neon signs and brightly-coloured displays all trying to get you to buy magazines
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,863	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Nicolo's
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:10,143	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Or hot dogs
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,423	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	We have advertising
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:13,727	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Yeah concessions marketing
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:17,055	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	All those visual elements compete with the primary message of just
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,591	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	How to navigate to airport
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:22,175	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Answer the key here is to make the signage Stand Out by being dull
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,199	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	And drab
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:23,967	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	And playing
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,991	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Yeah it's very neutral
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:28,063	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Neutral palette gray and white basically
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,855	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	So you can spot the signs just like
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,879	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Tuning out all the glitch
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,183	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Now even though this new international
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,463	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Terminal is fairly minimal
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,023	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	There are still people trying to sell you stuff
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:40,351	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Just beyond the transition Hall towards the gates there's
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,887	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	This to level Commerce area
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:45,471	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	There shopping at ground level and then up an escalator are some food options
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:49,567	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	And of course it's all angle perfectly so you have a direct line of sight
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,359	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Into all the shops as your walk
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:51,871	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Nearby
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,687	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Is unintentional decide to have a shopping Down Below in the
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,199	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	The food up above
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,479	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Yes
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:56,991	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Why is that
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,039	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Well more curb appeal
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,319	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	For your retail tenants
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:02,623	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	People
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:05,183	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	If they're hungry they're going to go find the food wherever it is
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:05,695	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Right
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:09,023	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Airports in a struggle to
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,303	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	To generate Revenue
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,583	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Really yeah
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:13,631	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	And so anything they can do
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:16,959	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	To help increase non-aeronautical Revenue
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:18,495	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Thanks that are not generated Bob

EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,567	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	So
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,615	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Improving their concessions
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,151	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	And Retail
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,687	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Yeah they get a percentage
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,711	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Of all those sales
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:32,831	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	And that's when I realize why there are people like Jim Harding who are paid to do this work
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,391	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	It's not just at airports one
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,671	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	To have a pleasant experience
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,975	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	It's because there's money on the table
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,255	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Think about it
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:44,095	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	So you're trying to make a connecting flight you don't have a lot of time you don't know where you're going
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:44,863	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	I'm stressed
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,935	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	And I don't think I'm going to catch my flight
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,983	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Am I going to take time to open my wallet
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:50,751	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Techno
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:55,615	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	But if I'm cool calm collected I found my gay and I know where I'm going
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:57,919	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	I'm more likely to stop and buy whatever
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,455	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	So
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Yeah that's where we fighting
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:02,527	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Has a real
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:04,063	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	My financial impact
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,855	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Yale to airport
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:06,367	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Bottom line
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:07,647	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Until it turns out
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:12,767	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	Wayfinding isn't just about helping you figure out how to get where you want to go
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:18,399	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	It's about steering the masses anywhere that companies hiring the wayfinders want the masses
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,167	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	To be steered
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,703	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	How much more
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:25,567	| 99pi-0126-walkthisway-1 |	If your consumer choices aren't going to make money for the powers-that-be inside of a closed system like
