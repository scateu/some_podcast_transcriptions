EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:02,880	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	My name is Jeff Maino architecture writer and blogger based in Los Angeles
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:05,696	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	For seven years he has written a website called building block
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:08,000	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Which is about architectural conjecture
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,280	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Urban speculation
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:09,792	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	And Landscape
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:13,632	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	I've always liked the sound of things
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:16,704	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	And the acoustic nature walking to the city or even just the sense that
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:18,752	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	When you're walking down the hall that has really rich

EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:24,128	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	The right side and sound totally different from the left side
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,968	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	I've just always been interested in those sorts of acoustic
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:29,504	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Aspects of architectural space
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:34,368	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Most Architects if a design for sound but they're actually designing to do is design for silence
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:37,440	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Designing to keep sound out of the environments
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:41,536	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	They're designing to make sure that you don't hear the street sounds that are happening outside
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:46,912	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Or that you're insulated from cars driving by or from the gravel plants up the road
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:53,824	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	So it's really an architecture silence that that people tend to be designing for but you know having said that there was an interesting project
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:56,640	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	A couple years ago by an architect named Joel Sanders
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:03:02,784	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Mexican architectural design instead of standard glass windows that would use things like parabolic microphones
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:08,160	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Kind of like those things that you see people holding on the sides of the football field during NFL games
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:14,560	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	These parabolic microphones would be pointed at the sky or they be pointed out into the woods nearby or you know they would capture the sounds
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,840	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Airplanes flying overhead
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:22,240	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Or birds in that in the forest or flat metal kids down the road it's very consciously and clearly brings a couch
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,776	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Sticks into the architectural
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:24,288	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Equation
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:30,688	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	There's an article in a British magazine called The Wire it was an article about
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:35,296	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Generative sound so to speak it referred to it this idea of a quote-unquote Soundgarden
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:42,976	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Rather than being the 1990s grunge band they were talking actually about the idea that you would deliberately plants
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:49,376	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	A certain species of flowering trees in the car thing in your back Garden so that you can sort of time in acoustic
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:50,656	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Event over the course of the year
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:52,960	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	There certain species that when they
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:56,288	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Bloom the seed pod opens up with an audible pop
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:59,872	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	It's going to be acoustic equivalent of the daisies coming up to the ground of the Tulips blooming
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:03,968	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	There's all kinds of other species that have particularly kind of silky leaves that
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:07,808	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Brass against each other in the breeze so you can fall asleep at night too
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:08,832	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	The sound of this kind of
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,112	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Really silken
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:10,880	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Silvery
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,904	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Serta tree brushing sound
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:17,280	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	That's one thing I think is really quite interesting that you can actually deliberately sort of build an acoustic ecosystem
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:21,887	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	You know you can easily imagine that sort of thing being added onto a kind of Botanic Garden
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:25,215	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Said that you need to pay money to go literally listen to plant life
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:28,287	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Desmond was also interested in
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:28,799	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	RKO
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:31,871	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Good question
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:37,247	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	It's basically concerned with what two things not only how would a building have sounded or what would have been the acoustic
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,527	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Effect of a certain building
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:40,319	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	When that building was standing
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:43,135	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	But then also what was the sort of sound culture of a given
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:44,927	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Civilization or Village
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:47,231	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Old Mayan temples were built
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:47,999	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	It's not just
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,047	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Spaz spectacular mountain bike
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,071	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Constructions
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:54,399	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	But specifically is a acoustic devices that would amplify
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,447	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Not only the voice of the priest
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:01,567	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	But also the sounds of things like The Conch Shell that would be played to do ritualistic
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,591	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Music internet service time
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:07,199	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	They building was actually physically designed to be as accurate as possible
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:11,039	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	The buildings themselves were like acoustic resonators or subwoofer so to speak
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:15,647	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	That were deliberately made to help induce a kind of almost like a psychedelic state in people
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,951	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	That's archaeoacoustics
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:19,743	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Indiana Jones meets John Cage
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:23,327	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	I think Architects are too willing to sort of
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:27,679	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Acoustics and sounds be taken care of by sound designers are taken up by other people
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:31,007	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	And I think it really would be interesting to see them think more in terms of
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:34,079	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	How to integrate their building into the soundscape of a city
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:38,943	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	There's a lot of talk with an architecture of how to build something that's contextually specific
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:40,735	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	And early response to its site
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:46,623	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	But the sight quote is almost always literally a question of sight it's an obstacle relationship the city
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:48,415	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	It would really be answering I should think about
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:50,719	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Architects going out to sort of acoustically map
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:54,815	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	The city block where they're building is going to be in in figuring out a nice way to
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:58,143	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Intervene in it and maybe reflect the sound back at the neighborhood
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:00,447	| 21-BLDGBLOG_-On-Sound |	Too much silence is no more interesting than too much noise
