EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:27,808	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	And
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:30,624	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	You can hang out by the wall and watch people
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:34,976	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	But you knew go by
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:38,560	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Not to square miles but it's right outside New York city so it's sort of like
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:42,400	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	You know there's a lot out there to do but there's not actually a lot to do
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:43,936	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Right where I was
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:48,032	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Besides people watching Melissa and her friends are also collected go
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:52,896	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Sweden collect you break your own geodes
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:57,504	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Brown and lumpy on the outside but when you smash my part would be some crystalline structure
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:01:59,808	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	And you've no idea
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:01,088	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	I'm outside what you're getting
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:03,136	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	It time to take a chance on it

EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,440	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Got something great
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:10,816	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Usually Melissa and her friend Liz would buy a few geodes at the store downtown and take him home and
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:12,352	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Smash robot with a hammer
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,376	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	One day
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:15,168	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	When was Louis XIII
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:17,472	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	We are too impatient we just had to know what was inside
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:19,264	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	There's a parking lot nearby
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:22,336	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	It was an apartment building and we decided to start again
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:22,848	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Side of a wall
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:25,920	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	It's hard as we could and hope that it would crack open that way
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:28,736	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	I think that was the first time that we had
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:31,040	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Try to open them that way without a hammer
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:32,320	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Just by throwing a
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,624	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	So I threw mine a few times
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,160	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	And
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:36,928	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Finally did
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:37,952	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Crack open
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,720	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Against the wall
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:42,304	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	And Lucas doing hers and it wouldn't crack opens only one
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,328	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Little window in the
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,120	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Back of this apartment
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:46,912	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	My friend list
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:48,192	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Tarzan
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,776	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	And Lucas wouldn't crack open
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:54,592	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Sorry I threw mine and we saw it
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:56,896	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Going towards the window and then
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:04,064	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Kareem just went wild and
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:11,488	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Then the geode went right through the window breaking with glass and shattering it
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:14,560	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Everywhere you're this huge crashing sound
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,864	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Glasses broken in
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:19,680	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Is now lying all over the parking lot floor
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,216	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Energy it was inside
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:22,496	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	My first reaction was to
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:25,568	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Just pure full-on fear I hate doing things wrong
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,848	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	I hated getting in trouble
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,640	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	And I just got
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:30,432	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Terrible singing
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,456	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Feeling in my stomach
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,760	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	I just wanted to get out of there
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:36,064	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	We were such good kids I mean this is what we did
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:36,832	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Find me
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:39,392	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	We broke up in geodes we never did anything wrong
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:41,440	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	And now you're committed this
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:44,000	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Heinous act and it was sort of like the quintessential
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:48,096	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Wrong thing that kids can do and you always I always saw
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:51,680	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	TV shows are read comic books where kids break a window
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:58,080	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	And then they have their face with a dilemma do they go back
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,616	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	And tell the guy
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:00,384	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	And they did it or not
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:04,224	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	We froze
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:05,248	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	For about 10 seconds
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,552	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	And then
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,600	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	My friend Liz ran forward
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:11,392	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	To reach into the broken glass
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:13,952	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	And grab the Geodon and we both ran
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:25,215	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	After initially running
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,751	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Moral compass started
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,543	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Nothing we realized we had to go back
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,359	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Where to find this person and tell them what we did
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:35,711	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Listen Liz went back to the apartment building
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:37,759	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Figure out where the window
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:43,135	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	LED tube around to the front it was very confusing which door might lead to that window
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:47,743	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	And said that it wasn't their window
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:51,071	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	I did it for 10 minutes and I think we're like well
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:53,887	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	I think we did all that we can do and we're probably really
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,167	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Glad have you tried
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,215	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	But we weren't able to find
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,263	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Who's window it was in the end
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:03,103	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Still feeling guilty Melissa avoided downtown and
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:04,127	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	The window
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,151	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	For a couple of months
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:07,455	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Switch wasn't easy in a small town
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:13,087	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	I thought that we would just go about our business and somebody would fix the window and I would never
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:14,111	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	To think about it again
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:16,415	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	But when Melissa finally did go back to the window
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:18,207	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	It was still
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:18,975	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Broken
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:20,511	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Like a cartoon just like us
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,791	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Jagged Edge
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,071	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Keyshia Cole I was sitting there
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,863	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Even though
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:28,191	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Glass shards had fallen into the parking lot we're still lying there
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:29,983	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	It was pretty much
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,775	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Like in pristine condition
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:34,591	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	From the day that we had broken it until
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,871	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Months and months later
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:38,175	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	It stayed almost exactly the same
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:40,991	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	It was clear that the apartment was aqui
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:43,807	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Actually we could see it TV on inside
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:44,319	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,879	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	So we knew somebody did live there
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:49,439	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	And sometimes the window would be
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:51,743	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Raise up or lower down
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:55,071	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	The song was moving this window around but the whole was always still in it
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:58,143	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	We just could not even imagine
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,423	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Who this person was
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:02,239	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	It wasn't doing anything to fix this window
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:04,543	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	They weren't even putting tape over it
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:07,359	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Are we even go by in the winter and see that
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,639	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	The hole is still there
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,919	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	The window stay broke
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,967	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	Is Melissa finish Middle School
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:15,551	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	And those High School just hadn't gone away like I wanted it to
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:18,111	| 99pi-0067-brokenwindow-1 |	The one with the college and I was shocked to find that
