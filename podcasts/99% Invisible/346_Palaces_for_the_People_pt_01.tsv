EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:14,816	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And doing things that
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:17,376	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Probably promoted inequality
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,680	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The many parts of the world but
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:22,752	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Carnegie was also an immigrant

EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,256	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And he wanted to help

EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:48,352	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And so
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,144	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Over the course of his life
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:51,936	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	He helped

EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,743	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Because we don't have

EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,423	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Is that
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:29,983	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	When we live in places where

EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,591	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Places like libraries

EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:57,119	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	We tend to grow more isolated
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:01,727	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You mentioned that social structure is more invisible than hard infrastructure
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:03,007	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	How is it that you
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,799	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Were you able to see it for the first time
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:06,335	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Yeah well
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:09,407	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The first time I thought about social infrastructure was
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,711	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	When I was a graduate student
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:14,783	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Doing a research project on a heatwave
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:15,807	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In Chicago
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,343	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The city I grew up in
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,367	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:18,879	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I was
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:20,927	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Puzzled by it
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:25,023	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Something very strange in this heat wave it was a disaster in 1995
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:27,327	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Killed more than 700 people
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:28,351	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:32,447	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	As a social scientist II was interested in understanding the patterns
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:37,055	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The first pattern I observed was the most predictable thing that could happen in
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:37,823	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Disaster
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:38,591	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And that's
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:42,175	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Stats the poor neighborhoods the segregated neighborhoods
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:44,735	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	On the Southside in the Westside
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:45,247	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Chicago
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,039	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I had the highest death rate
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:48,831	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	By far than and that's not interesting
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,879	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Politically important because
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:54,463	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Story about where resources go and where vulnerability is but
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,487	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Scientifically it
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,023	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It's what you would expect
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:58,047	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	But when I look
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,327	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Even more closely at
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,095	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The patterns
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,631	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Something really puzzling did emerge
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,935	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And that is that there were a bunch of neighborhood
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,471	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That demographic
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:08,799	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Look like they should have fared very badly in the
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:09,311	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Disaster
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:11,871	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	But in fact proved to be strikingly resilia
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:15,199	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They were safer even in the most affluent neighborhoods
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,991	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	On the Northside
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:18,783	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And even more interesting Lee
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:21,087	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	There are these pairs of neighborhoods where
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:22,623	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The demographics for identical
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:24,671	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The same proportion of old pee
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:25,951	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	4 people

EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:29,535	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:30,559	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They were
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,839	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Separated by just
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:34,655	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Street to the literally neighbor is neighboring Abraham
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,703	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And one neighborhood would have a
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:38,239	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Astronomically High death rate
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,775	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And the other
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,567	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Would be one of the safest places in Chicago
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:42,847	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,383	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The numbers alone
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,151	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Tell
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:47,199	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Story of what was going on so
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,223	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And kind of classic
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:50,783	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Keno ethnographer style I
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:53,343	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Started traveling around and spend time in the neighborhood
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:55,135	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	What I observed is that
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,671	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Places that had
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:57,695	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Lodi three
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:00,255	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I turned out to have
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,535	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	IRobot Surfline
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,327	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Are they had
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:05,631	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Sidewalks and streets that were
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,655	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Well taken care of
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:07,935	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They had
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:11,519	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Neighborhood libraries they had Community organization
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:12,799	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They had
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:14,079	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Grocery stores
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:16,895	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Shops and cafes that Drew people out of their home
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:20,223	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	An into public life and what that meant
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:23,807	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Is that on a daily basis people got to know each other pretty well
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:26,879	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They use the social infrastructure to socialize
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,391	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Until when
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,439	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Chicago
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:31,487	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They knew who was likely to be sick
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,535	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Who should have been outside but wasn't
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:36,863	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And that meant they knew who's Jordan knock-on and who to help
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:40,447	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Meanwhile in the neighborhoods that had really high death rates
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,983	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The silver lamp
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:42,751	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Structure was the
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,519	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Pleated
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:45,311	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	There were a lot of abandoned
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,847	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Properties
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,639	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Empty lots abandoned houses
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:55,551	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Sidewalks were often cracked and broken very little commercial life not a lot of Institutions there and
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,343	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And that meant that people were likely to
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:59,903	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Stay home and if unfortunate during the Heatwave
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:01,439	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	This is a deadly thing to do
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:03,487	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And I realize that the end of that project
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:07,071	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Actually it's it was social infrastructure not the
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:09,375	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Traditional hard infrastructures that we normally think of
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:12,703	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That that explain who lived who died that we can Chicago
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:22,431	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Chicago Heat Wave convince Eric that social infrastructure was vital to public health and safety in cities
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:28,831	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Years later when superstorm Sandy hit the New York area he wanted to make sure people knew that was going to take
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:31,903	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	More than just seawalls to make New York safer
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:34,207	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And more resilient in the face of climate change
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:38,303	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You got involved in a competition sponsored by the federal government called
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:43,167	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Rebuild by Design in again and again he emphasized the various design teams
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:45,471	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The importance of building infrastructure
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:47,519	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That brings people together
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,799	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	But one day
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:49,823	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I was
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:51,871	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Taking one team around the neighborhood and Brooke
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,151	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:59,551	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They came up to me and they said you know Eric we've been listening to talk about social infrastructure and how important it is
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,343	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And we realized that
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,135	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Enid
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:06,463	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The design that we're going to propose for this competition
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:08,767	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I was going to be right in line with that
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:11,583	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	We have this idea for something we're calling a resilient set
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:15,679	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I said wow that sounds amazing and who wouldn't want to resilience Center
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,447	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Can you tell me about it
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,727	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And they said
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:18,495	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Okay so
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:21,311	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Set this resilience Center is
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,103	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Hyena going to be
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:24,383	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	A nice building
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:27,967	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That will put in that in a vulnerable neighborhood in the town in Connecticut
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:31,039	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And I we we we see is a prototype
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,063	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That we could build
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:33,599	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And in cities all over the country
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:37,439	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And it will be open as much as as possible
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:42,815	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It will be spacious it will have flexible uses
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:45,119	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It will be staffed by
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,911	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In a Personnel who are
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:48,959	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Aggressively welcoming
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:54,335	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The job is really to make everyone feel like they're welcome
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:55,871	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I all the time
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,151	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:11:02,271	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You know we know that that very young people and very old people are most at risk
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:07,647	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And most need kind of resilience at home because they might not be as mobile as other parts of the population so
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:10,719	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	We're going to have all kinds of special programming for kids like
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:16,351	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Things like storytime in the morning and since we know the kids come with caretakers in a parents or grandparents
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:17,631	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Star sitters
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:21,727	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Will do something for them to maybe we'll give that me no access to Wi-Fi and
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,495	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Computers
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,287	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And we really see this
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:27,359	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	This resilience Center as an amazing new Institution
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:30,431	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That could strengthen people who live in every vulnerable part of
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,991	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And I said to them
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:36,063	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Wow you know that's an amazing idea
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:42,463	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Cuz I'm a professor and I'm used to telling people first that their ideas are amazing
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:45,791	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And then I said
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:48,607	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Have you ever heard of a library
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:56,287	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Speak because clearly they they had just redesign the wheel and at first I thought it was a little crazy
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:58,335	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	But then I realize that
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:11:59,359	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It was
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:01,407	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Completely predictable
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,943	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And forgivable
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:03,967	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Lie because
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:05,503	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	We live in a moment where
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:09,599	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I so many people think of the library as
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,623	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	An obsolete insta
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,159	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Right we
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:15,999	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Wait we think it's a A Relic from another part of our history
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:18,303	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And that it's
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,583	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Not used much
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:20,351	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Bye
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,375	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	By anyone
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:25,983	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Even though it turns out that nothing could be further from the truth
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:29,311	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And so I realized that I really needed to
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,615	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Spend more time in libraries myself
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:33,663	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And to write something
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:34,943	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That reminded
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:35,967	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	People
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:39,551	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Just all of the extraordinary things that libraries do
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,831	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	As social infrastructure
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:41,855	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Banana because
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:43,135	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They're such
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:45,439	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Valuable institutions for us
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:49,279	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And yet they are taking for granted and in many parts of the world in the country
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,303	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	On The Chopping
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:55,935	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And so Eric started visiting libraries all over the country
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:57,727	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	He went to small town libraries
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,519	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Suburban libraries
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:02,335	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Big City libraries designed by famous architects
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:06,175	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And small neighborhood libraries in little brick buildings
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,455	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	A nice time
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:09,759	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	He found lots of people using the library
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,295	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And many of them
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:13,599	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Using it in some pretty surprising ways
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:15,903	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	One of my favorite programs
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:16,927	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I came from
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:19,487	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The Brooklyn library where they created
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,023	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The Library Lane
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,815	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Virtual bowling league
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,863	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Which meets weekly
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:28,959	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In the basements and can kind of community centers inside Library
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,495	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Common rooms
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:35,359	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And the context for understanding why these things are so amazing is that about 20 years ago
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:38,943	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	A great social scientist and Robert Putnam
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:43,295	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I read a book how bowling alone the complaint was like people
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,575	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Used to do things
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:46,367	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Together collectively
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:50,975	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Informal groups and now everyone like in putnam's nightmare from 1999
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:54,815	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Everybody was just watching television at home together in the living room
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:14:01,215	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You know I think of now that I have kids who have like there on mobile devices that's like a socialist Utopia
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:03,263	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Fantasy
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:09,663	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Oh my God if only we could have a night together watching the same screen and it would be amazing
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,943	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:14,783	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In it what what happened in Brooklyn is that the
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:17,343	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Controlling people realize if there's all the older people
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:20,927	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Who live alone in neighborhoods around New York City
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:25,279	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And it did exactly the people who would have been most likely to die in the heat wave in Chicago
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,047	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The writing
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:28,863	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	A tenant and they have to do special programming for them and
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:32,447	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Some some older people are booked a session and
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:35,519	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	R1 duarte's things with some actually want to be physical and
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:37,311	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And exercise
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,359	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And be social that way and they need to be
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,431	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	So they created this program called Library Lanes
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,479	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And when once a week
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:45,247	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	This group
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:46,527	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Of older people
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,831	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Come together and they put on
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:51,391	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Actual bowling jerseys with their Library name on it
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:54,463	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And a librarian connects an Xbox
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,511	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	2 television
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:15:02,911	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And they compete against other Library teams who and I'll tell you like I'm a sports junkie I spend my weekend
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:07,263	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Ken's following my son around his soccer games I like to go to professional and college games
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:09,567	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I'm not lying Ramen when I tell you that
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:16,479	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I haven't been to a sporting event is exciting and collectively effervescent the sociological
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:19,551	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	As this incredible match
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:24,159	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In East New York where it where likely is this group of older bowlers
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:30,559	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Came back and like encrusted in the final frames to win the match is amazing
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:31,839	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Not so great
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:38,751	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Wii bowling tournaments is not exactly what people think of when they think of a library and probably isn't who certainly wasn't what
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:45,151	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Andrew Carnegie
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:50,271	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	What library is being used today outside of that the conventional like you get a library card you get
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:54,623	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Yeah my goodness I was just thinking about Andrew Carnegie
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:58,975	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You know being told about all the things that these palaces for the people have turned into it
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:03,839	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I hope you would like that I mean let me tell you about some of the things that I saw I mean first of all
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:08,703	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Libraries remain places where lots of early literacy
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,983	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Development happens
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:11,519	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And every morning often
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:13,311	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Before the library would open
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:16,895	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The librarian to open the doors for
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,687	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Groups of preschoolers
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:22,015	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Working a kids from Day Camp who would come in
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:24,319	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I would teachers and get exposed to books
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:26,111	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Spend and be told stories
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:28,415	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And you know there's so many people who judge

EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:07,743	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And I really think that we fail to recognize

EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:37,951	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I think we should stop all the public contributions to them knock them down and replace them with Amazon stores

EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:22,495	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	When I try to think of like what a great social interest
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:25,823	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It's it. The libraries are the only social infrastructure

EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:44,415	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You know one of the things that I've seen is
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:46,463	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	A certain municipalities have
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:50,559	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Recognize the value of libraries and have invested in
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:53,375	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	New facilities that can do other things like
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:58,495	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Most libraries need to have a special room or set of rooms for teenagers now
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:00,799	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Because so many of them come in in the afternoon

EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:05,919	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Also
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:06,687	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	So you see a lot of teen room
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,991	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:13,087	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Libraries have become these institutions of Last Resort for people who
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:15,391	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Slip through the cracks in

EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:24,096	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And and people were really struggling to get by oftentimes
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,632	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	What drug addiction

EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:38,176	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Experimenting
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:41,248	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I went with ways to provide more supportive environments
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:41,760	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Like like that
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:45,088	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Other countries have made massive new investment
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:45,856	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In

EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,560	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Amazing
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:58,912	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And some American cities are beginning to invest in libraries as well
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:01,472	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	But but generally speaking when that happens
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:04,800	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	We invest in time to bright shiny Central Library
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:06,848	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That you know that that patrons are likely to
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:10,944	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I feel proud of rather than in the the branch libraries
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:12,480	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Which I really the lifeblood
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:18,880	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In the book you also talked about crime as an infrastructure issue which is
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,904	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Which was a really
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,696	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Subtle Nuance on the
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:25,536	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Broken windows theory that I found really intriguing yeah
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:26,560	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I don't know how much
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:29,376	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	People know about the broken windows theory of
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:30,912	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Policing
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:32,448	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I'm crying but
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,752	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You know this kind of classic essay
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:37,056	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	This point from James Q Wilson
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:38,592	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Enjoyed killing
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:39,360	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That said that
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:41,920	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	When are broken windows in a neighborhood
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:43,968	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	People perceive the
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:47,296	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Broken windows as a sign that no one is organizing the neighbor
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:48,576	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	No one has social
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:50,624	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:52,928	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The notion is that criminals
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,208	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Realized niche
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:55,232	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Could get away with anything
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:55,744	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In a place like
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:57,536	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And so did
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:59,328	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Intriguingly when
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,888	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The original broken windows article came out
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:04,704	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It was used as adjusted
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:05,216	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Vacation
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:06,240	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	4
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,544	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Green lot more police
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,568	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Cin2
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:10,592	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Poor neighborhood
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:12,384	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Shred-it is broken windows
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:13,152	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Theory got us
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:16,480	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The stop-and-frisk policing and zero tolerance
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:17,760	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Policing
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:19,040	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Cuz the notion was
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,576	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	If you've got
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:21,600	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Disorder
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:24,416	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You need to make sure that there's a lot of extra help
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:26,464	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	How to keep criminals from doing that
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:28,256	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And and that was a
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,536	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Is a big reason that we have
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:33,376	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	System of mass incarceration that's really transformed
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:34,912	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The United States
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,680	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Sand
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,960	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Especially poor neighborhood rain
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:40,032	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And having spent a lot of time thinking about
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,824	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The power of social infrastructure
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,360	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And physical places
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,664	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I found myself asking this question like
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,712	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	What would have happened if
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:49,760	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	We responded to its broken windows
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:52,576	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Not by sending in so many police officers
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:24:00,256	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	But by fixing the damn Windows right. How did nobody ever think of that
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:01,024	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And I went
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:05,376	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And it's really weird like how I went back to the original article when I had that. End
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:07,936	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And I found that if you really closely
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,472	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That the chain of events
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:14,336	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That leads to this idea that we should send in more police and do Zero Tolerance policing
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,104	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Is
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:16,896	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You know a neighborhood gets
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:18,176	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Abandoned
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:19,968	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Property property gets abandoned
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:23,040	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	God graffiti goes up a Windows broken
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:24,576	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And then it thinks going to spiral out of
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:27,904	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	So hot why is it that
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:29,696	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Siri wasn't called
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:31,232	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You know the abandoned property Theory
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:36,608	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	This is a horrible title right broken windows is an awesome title
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:40,960	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Ilia bowling alone and broken windows it was great like catchy phrases
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:43,520	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Better not to justify
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:45,312	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Really terrible social policies
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:51,712	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And in the case of the broken windows thing it didn't even work. So we forgot all about the abandoned property part
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:54,528	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	So I started asking like what would happen
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:58,112	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	If we had fixed the windows if we did fix up their property
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:59,392	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And when I asked it turns out that
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:00,928	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Someone
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,696	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Else
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:04,000	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I would have thought about it much more than I had there's a
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:04,768	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The team of
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,560	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	A scientist
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:07,840	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	At the University of Pennsylvania
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:11,936	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That had been asking a similar question and they want of teaming up with
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:13,472	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The city of Philadelphia
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:16,032	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Which has tens of thousands
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:16,800	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Of
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:17,568	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Abandoned
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:18,848	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Properties
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:19,360	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	An empty lot
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:23,456	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And also the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society which like sounds like
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:28,320	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Like an old person's gardening club but turned that kid is like
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:30,880	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Powerhouse operation that
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:33,184	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Helps to control all this vacant land
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:34,208	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In Philadelphia
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,536	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And they started like one of the most exciting social science
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:39,072	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Experiments that I know of
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:40,096	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Happening right now
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:42,400	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And for more than a decade they been doing the same witches
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,680	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Date they
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:45,216	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Randomly select
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:46,752	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Blocks
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:48,544	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Where they will make simple intervention
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:49,824	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:51,360	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	If there is an abandoned house
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:52,896	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They would
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:55,712	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Board up the building and prevent
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:26:00,576	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Squatters or being a potential drug dealers are criminals from from using
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:03,648	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Property and if it's an empty lot
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,672	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That would have
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:06,464	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Weeds and
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:07,232	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And debris
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:10,560	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	All kinds of garbage that would make it a
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:11,584	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Public health hazard
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:13,120	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They would clean it up
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:14,912	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Motown
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:17,728	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And put in a little pocket park maybe plant
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:18,752	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Tree put in a bench
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:20,032	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Put a wooden fence
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:21,568	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:25,152	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Are they wanted to see what happened in the places where they made the interview
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:27,968	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Pension and what happened in the places that they left alone
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:30,272	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And the results were staggering
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:32,320	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They achieved
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:33,088	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Almost
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:34,112	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	40%
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,136	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Decline
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:35,904	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,672	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Gun violence
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,720	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Around the
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:41,792	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Abandoned properties that they treated
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:44,608	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And that's it that's a staggeringly high number
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,376	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Tic-tac-toe
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,144	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	To get that in
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:47,424	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	MMS has been durable
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:48,704	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I over the course of
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,240	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Decade
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:52,032	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	What's more they
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:52,800	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Babe
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,312	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Hooked up
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:54,848	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Heart rate monitors
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:56,128	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The people who live in those neighborhood
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:57,408	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And they found that
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:59,200	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Even for resident
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:00,224	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	When you walk by
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:02,784	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	An untreated Property 2
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:03,808	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Just an abandoned places
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,088	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Left to
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:06,368	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Become a site of debris
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:08,416	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Are people's heart rates really spiked
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:11,488	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And of course we know that the
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,256	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Stress-related
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,792	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Diseases are especially High
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:14,560	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	A n
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:16,608	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	App for neighborhoods that have a lot of abandonment
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:21,216	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	IBooks but when people walk by a place it's been treated
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:22,240	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And turned into a little Park
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:24,032	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The heart rate hardly changes
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:29,664	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And again looks like I'm amazing thing to achieve with a modest investment
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,176	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In Social and
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:32,224	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And did the crime just
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:32,992	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Move
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:35,552	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	From one place to another or did it just reduce
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,088	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In total
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:39,648	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Yeah so that's what they thought was going to happen that
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:43,488	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Fix up one block and crime just bounces to the next one
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:46,048	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	But the amazing thing here is
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:47,072	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It didn't
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:48,608	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It turns out that
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:50,912	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Unless we think of crime is being about like
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:53,472	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In a bad individuals doing bad things and
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:55,264	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	No. That's part of the story
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,544	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	But a lot of crime is just
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,568	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Situational
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:28:01,152	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I'd like if if you had if you create a city with lots of places
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:03,456	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Where no one is
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:04,736	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Is in control
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:06,528	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And no one feels a sense of
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:09,344	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Responsibility a 10 people have a hard time
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,880	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Managing things
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:13,696	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You create situations
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:14,720	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Where crime is more likely
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,000	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	But if you
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:18,560	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Take those situations away
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:19,328	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The crime
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,096	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Doesn't happen
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:21,632	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And so the answer is no
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:22,912	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I did not get
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:23,680	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Are the crime bounce
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:24,704	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Elsewhere
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:25,984	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It's simply didn't have
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:35,712	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Service bring your book and I think about myself in the in the city and how I interact with people
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:36,224	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And how
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:41,088	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	My lived experience in my ideal Isaac
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:43,136	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	France is sometimes or not in
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:48,256	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Complete concert so like a flower planter at Planters when I pay for it
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:49,792	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Does a person floating through life
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:52,352	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I don't always want to encounter people
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:29:00,032	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	When we live in New York City man I get that when we build social infrastructure
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:04,640	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	How do we make sure we're designing for our true selves and not our idealized self
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:06,944	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Yeah well
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:09,760	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It's my take hear that
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:11,808	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	There's no shortage of
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:13,600	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Places where people can
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:18,208	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Hunker down and get their own private space Tuesdays
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:21,024	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	We've created a whole society
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:23,840	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I based on our idealization
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:25,888	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Of privacy and autonomy
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,424	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Right I mean like
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:28,192	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It is
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:29,472	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It used to be that
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:33,824	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Family shared bedrooms together like family shared beds together
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:37,408	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Now that I know so many people who moved out of their cities
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:42,016	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Because they felt like their kids needed to have their own individual bedroom
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:44,320	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Right I mean it's just
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:46,368	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	So so I feel like I'm with you that
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:48,160	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	We all need
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:52,512	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Spacer privacy and in fact like a library is a really amazing social infrastructure and Park
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:53,280	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:56,608	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It combines you know shared tables and programs and activities
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:30:00,960	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	With little nooks where person can go and and anonymously
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:02,240	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I'll be in the round head
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:05,312	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Righto and Atalanta Park
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:06,336	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Does the same thing
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,360	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Write a park can be a place
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:08,640	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	For Collective life
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:10,176	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And a parking be a place
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:12,480	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Where we go to be like the rest
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:15,040	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Anna and have our own time and space
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:20,928	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I think you're right we always need to be mindful of those things you know we don't want to force people out into the public Realm
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,976	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Hobbit but my sense right now
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:26,048	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Is that the it's the publicly accessible
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:28,096	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Public round that's really in shorts
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:31,680	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I'm intrigued by this idea of them
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:34,240	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Public ownership and how we
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:37,312	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Convey that I mean I think one of the reasons why
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:39,360	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The pocket Parks work and
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:41,152	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Libraries work
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:41,664	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It's because
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:44,480	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	We feel like we own them when they're done right
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:46,784	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You know we feel like we belong
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:48,064	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And that makes everyone
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:49,600	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You know
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:51,648	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Closer connected also just like
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:52,416	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Tube8
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:53,696	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They treat the world better
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:54,464	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	When it's ours
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:56,768	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Private space
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:57,280	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That we
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:59,840	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Can just occupied as long as we
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:01,632	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Are buying that
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:02,144	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Cup of coffee
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:05,984	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	How do we make sure we make things so that everyone feels like
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:06,496	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Like there really a
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:10,080	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Oh man that is such a tough question
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:13,664	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And I've been thinking about a lot you know especially in light of
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:15,712	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The past year we've
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:16,736	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You know we started
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:18,016	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Seymour Public Li
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:20,576	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Just how restrictive
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,856	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	An exclusive
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:23,392	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Some of our

EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:24,672	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Value

EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:30,816	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Remember that that video that circulated
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:31,584	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	About the

EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:03,584	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	If they don't get asked to buy something
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:04,864	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They don't
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:09,984	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Get politely asked to leave they get arrested right then being in this in the shared space
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,264	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Crazy thing
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:13,312	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And until and that context
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:17,664	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	People who get in feel entitled and privileged
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:20,736	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	There's a whole bunch of people who laughed at all together
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:22,528	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And that alerted me to the sent that like
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:27,392	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	To the extent that our public space and are our public realm are shared spaces
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:29,952	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Are part of the commercial economy
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:31,488	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They are really restrict
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:35,328	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You have to be able to pay you have to be let in
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:37,888	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Interlock places especially like in gentrifying neighborhood
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:39,168	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Insidious
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:39,936	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Where
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:42,240	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Your people just know that they're not welcome
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:42,752	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:49,152	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It cost $7 for coffee or $9 for ice cream or they don't take cash at all
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:51,968	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They're their only for people with credit cards right
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:55,040	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And I have to say like one of the most amazing things I observed
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:57,344	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In the public libraries where I spent time
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:58,112	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Is that
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:00,416	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	There places where
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:02,976	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	This impossible community of people
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:05,280	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Who are so different from one another
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:06,048	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Come together
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:07,072	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And all kinds
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:08,608	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Who have real struggle
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:10,656	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Come to because
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:12,960	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	There's just not space for them
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:13,472	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Anywhere else
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:16,800	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And in the year that I spent going to the library
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,336	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Pretty much every day
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:20,384	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I can count on one hand
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:22,176	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The number of times that
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:23,456	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The police had to be called in
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:24,992	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And there was a real site
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:25,504	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Security concern
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:26,528	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	People
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:28,576	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	We know where we're acting out
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:29,088	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Towards one another
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:32,160	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Most of the time when people going to libraries
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:35,232	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	They recognize that they are being respected
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:36,256	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And dignify
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:38,048	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And honored
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:39,328	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And and I think
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:40,608	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It brings out the best in US
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:43,680	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	So so I think it's a great question.
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:45,216	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	What kinds of public places
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:46,496	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Can do that
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:48,544	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Redken exalt are
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:50,336	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Experience in the world in the way that the Libor
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:54,176	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And and what can we do to make sure that the places that we built
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:55,456	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Do that even better
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:34:00,320	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Is there any momentum towards more social infrastructure are there
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:02,880	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I mean do we require a modern-day
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:03,904	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Carnegie
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:10,304	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Do we require a government to do more to eat require us to just demand more what what is it going to take and
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:11,840	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Evidence that
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:12,608	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It's happening
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:14,656	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Urgent
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:16,192	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Question you know how we going to
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:16,704	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	To pay for this
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:17,728	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:20,544	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It's true that Carnegie was a
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:21,312	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The philanthropist
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:24,384	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Austin philanthropic dollars went to build a bunch of libraries and
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:27,456	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Am I close the book by noting how strange it is that
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:30,016	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	You know we live in a world with these kind of
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:31,808	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Titans of the information age
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:33,600	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Who have
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:34,368	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Made
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:35,392	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Billions of dollars
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:38,720	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	We have a things like social media
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:39,744	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And computing
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:42,304	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And who haven't made contributions to
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:44,096	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Social infrastructure
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:45,632	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In a way that
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,912	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That I would like to see
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:47,680	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	In fact like
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,448	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	1A
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:50,496	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Really off-putting things for me about
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:53,568	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I like Mark Zuckerberg's use of the concept social infrastructure is
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:54,336	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Is that
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:56,640	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	He's been promoting Facebook as
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:34:59,968	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Social infrastructure he uses the language
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:03,808	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The 21st century and says you know Facebook is where we'll go for Meaningful
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:07,392	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Interactions and yet if you go to the Facebook campus
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:08,928	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Menlo Park
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:15,840	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Like no one on earth has spent more money on actual physical social infrastructure than marks
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:22,240	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It's it's a workers Paradise there right in front of the bike paths in the yoga studios in the shared spaces for
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:24,032	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Serendipitous encounters and
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:25,056	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I know that
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:30,176	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Massages for people while they're coding at their desks like it's amazing there
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:30,944	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:34,272	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Emmett in fact people who work in those companies don't let their kids
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:38,880	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Go on the devices cuz they know how dangerous a phone can be as social infrastructure
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:41,440	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	So on the one hand I kind of want to see
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:44,000	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The big philanthropist of our time
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:46,048	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Spend more on things like libraries
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:48,352	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	But I also know in my heart that
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:50,144	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Enough
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:51,424	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Philanthropic dollars
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:52,960	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Are ultimately inadequate
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:58,336	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And I kind of like randomly distributed to the places where the philanthropist 10 to spend time
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:00,640	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And that if we're ever really going to make this work
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:03,200	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It's going to have to be through a public commit
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:05,760	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I got a major public works program
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:07,040	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:10,112	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I think it's just a matter of time until we do that
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:14,208	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Yeah but but clearly we're going to have to muster up the
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:15,488	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The collective Will Ferrell
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:21,120	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And we certainly can't eat a rally for it and call for it if we don't have a name for the thing that we want
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:25,216	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And that's one reason why I hope that social infrastructure
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:30,080	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	This is sticky that it means something cuz you know what we have no problem paying for infrastructure
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:32,128	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	When it comes to
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:34,176	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The things that we think of is critical
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:39,808	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	The infrastructures like one of the few things that both Trump and Clinton agree that we needed rent a few years ago
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:43,136	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I just hope we can recognize the need for social and fish
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:43,904	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	Structure
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:45,440	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	And find some way
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:47,488	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	To persuade the people who are running our government
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:50,304	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	That without their support it will never have
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:52,864	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	It's Weenie like a social infrastructure week
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:59,008	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	I'm thinking more like a decade at least
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:03,360	| 346_Palaces_for_the_People_pt_01 |	A-10 look like if you look at any report that comes from you know the World Bank
