EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:32,191	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	The baseball uniform that they truly get out about
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:35,007	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	The intersection between the pant leg
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:36,031	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	And the sock
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,823	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	Basically the whole area
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:38,591	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	Below the knee
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:41,663	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	And it's the the least legislated
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:45,759	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	Least regulated and released uniform
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,039	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	Part of the uniform
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:53,439	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	Even though baseball teams have been historically named after the color of their socks there is no rules governing the
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:56,511	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	The length of the pants or whether or not you will actually see
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,303	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	And that has really changed

EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,007	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	Had essentially knickers
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:09,311	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	And what do you wear with knickers you wear
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:10,079	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	Stockings
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,359	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	And that's what really baseball
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:14,943	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	And over the course of the 20th century
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:18,527	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	Those knickers started getting longer and longer and they said
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,087	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	Tripping a little lower a little lower and then
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:22,111	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	What's a mid calf
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,391	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	Pain in lower calf and then
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:26,975	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	Little lower and now we have so many of the players

EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,327	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	Are there shoe tops like footie pajamas
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,887	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	And then you have a handful of players like
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,167	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	Say Alex Rodriguez and
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:42,079	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	Curtis Granderson Ichiro Suzuki Hawaii to hike their pants up high so there are minority but there is a faction of
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:44,127	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	You do that but there's no uniformity
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:46,687	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	And I think it's a shame
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,455	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	Tragedy

EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:52,575	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	The pants all the way down to the shoe tops because when you cover up the socks
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,879	| 99pi-0111-mastersoftheuni-verse-1 |	You're basically dishonoring
