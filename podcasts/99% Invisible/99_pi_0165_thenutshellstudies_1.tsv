EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:17,056	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Earlier this year I went to the Ted conference in Vancouver and I gave it talk about flag design
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:19,360	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	It was an incredible experience
EDL	00:01:19,872	00:01:20,896	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And even though
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:23,712	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	There's a little bit of skepticism when I started the talk
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:24,736	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	You know when everyone
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:31,648	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Learned that it was really going to be about 5 design the talk totally won over the crowd and I got a standing ovation
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:33,952	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	It was a real highlight of my career

EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:51,616	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Like a radio piece instead of the normal Ted talk I'm sitting down and playing audio clips and talking over music

EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:23,807	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And then came to realize that people were getting away with murder literally
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,599	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Police would routinely pot

EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:30,463	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	They would contaminate crime scenes move bodies do things that
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:32,767	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Today will be obviously you don't don't do that
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:35,071	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	But at the time they didn't know any better
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:40,703	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Beyond that the police just didn't know how to get information from the scenes
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,751	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Another might not realize the significance of

EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,687	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And the other thing was

EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:55,295	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Either weren't being done at all or being done by doctors
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:57,343	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	With no specific training in forensic
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:02,207	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Eventually Lee's parents and her brother passed away

EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:09,119	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And she finally had access to the family money and agency to do what she wanted

EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,879	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	She wanted to displease some other things

EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:46,495	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	We decided to build miniature death scenes for the police to study each one will be based on a real

EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,687	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	That Concept in the design and
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,223	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Carpenter would drop

EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:17,471	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Finally those Society lady skills
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,751	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	For being put to use
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:23,359	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	She wouldn't it the stockings with needles aside to straight pins using a magnifying glass and of course

EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:34,111	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	The figures in the nachos also sometimes show rigor mortis which is a post-mortem stiffening of the body
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:40,511	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And lividity which is the way the blood pools or settles in the body after death both provide clues
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,303	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Set the how and when a person die
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,631	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	The detail in the nutshells is bordering on abs
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,399	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Excessive
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:49,983	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	In one an ashtray overflows with tiny cigarettes

EDL	00:10:56,383	00:11:02,783	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	The coffee pot she has there's a stranger inside and coffee grounds in it
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:05,343	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	We were life is you know you going to somebody's home
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:07,647	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	They can have a bag of drugs
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:10,975	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	But a weapon over here and I have a heart attack it may or may not mean anything
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:17,119	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Frances glessner Lee spared no expense on her dioramas

EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,287	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Each one took about six months
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:26,079	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	At around $6,000
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:30,431	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	That's about the same amount of time and money it would cost
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,455	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	To build a real house
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,479	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	The 1940
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,759	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Lease out like if
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:36,063	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	The policeman looked at them
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:38,111	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And so any fault in her
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:39,647	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And take some seriously you know
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:41,439	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	They won't learn from them
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:41,951	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	So
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:44,255	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	That's why she felt like everything had to be
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,023	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Be done
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:45,535	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Perfectly
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:52,191	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Of course Frances glessner Lee was always trying to be taken seriously and they all male world
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:52,703	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	She had entered
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:57,567	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	She was ultimately both respected and adored by the police that she worked with
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:01,151	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	The week-long seminar she led were thought to be the best
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,455	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Training homicide detectives could receive
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:06,527	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And they're still thought of that way actually even today
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:13,439	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	After Frances glessner Lee died in 1962 the program so you find it at Harvard including the week-long summer
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,463	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Branded
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:16,511	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	In the nut shells were put in storage
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,047	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Possibly headed for the trash
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:24,959	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And then the medical examiner in Baltimore at the time a guy named Russell Fischer who was a former student of
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:26,495	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Please programs at Harvard
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,543	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Stepped in and said
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:32,383	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Will do it will do somewhere and it will just pick it up here in Maryland
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:39,039	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And they brought the Nationals down and so it's been the seminar and the Nationals been used here since 1969
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,063	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	68
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:44,927	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Going up
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:51,583	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	The building that houses the medical examiner's office in Baltimore is fairly new it was built in 2010
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:57,727	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Bruce is giving me a tour of the building
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:13:03,871	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	It has some pretty unique features including a full-size apartment that investigators can use to stage
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,639	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Stuffing
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,175	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Right behind us we got it all
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:06,687	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Dining area
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:10,783	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Bruce refers to it as a life-size nutshell study
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:14,879	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And the most violent room in Baltimore
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:20,767	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	They also have a parking garage that in an emergency can quickly turn into a huge mark
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:22,815	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And they have a biosafety
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,887	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Facility to deal with death from highly contagious diseases
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:27,423	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Holy solution Suites
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:30,495	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And it has its own power generation is on ventilator
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:33,823	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	As we walk around the autopsy floor
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:34,591	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Second floor
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,639	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	I'm on high alert
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:40,223	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	I'm basically terrified of running into something I'm not prepared to
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:40,991	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	To see
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,271	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Or smell
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:48,415	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	If you go to the deep end. If you want to stop and turn around 6 will be fine with me.
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:54,815	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	What will hold it together mangle
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:56,351	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Totally not being cool
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,655	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	But we go through and the
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:01,471	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Fine I mean DS there are dead bodies
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:05,311	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And I have many existential feelings about that that I won't
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:05,823	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Cher here
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:10,431	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	But mainly this place feels like a really clean Hospital
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,199	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Protect people
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:14,271	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	If you like yeah this is how it should be
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,807	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Francis
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:16,575	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Believe
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:18,111	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:18,879	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Science
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,647	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Based death
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,695	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	The
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,743	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	The whole institution top to bottom
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,023	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	I think it is
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,583	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Probably
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,351	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Fullest
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,631	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Embodiment of
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:31,423	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Her philosophy
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:32,959	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And for approach
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:37,055	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Bruce is talking of course about Frances glessner Lee
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:41,151	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	He says not only is this building and embodiment of her philosophies
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:46,271	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	But so is the whole Maryland system for dealing with death investigation
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:54,207	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	If you die unexpectedly in the state of Maryland your death is likely to undergo a thorough investigation in
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:58,559	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Putting an autopsy by medical examiner with specific forensic training
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,351	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	But this is not what you get
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:02,911	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Everywhere depending on where you die
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:09,055	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	You could end up in a facility like Maryland are you could literally end up on a makeshift table in someone's garage
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:15,199	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	From state-to-state and even county-to-county there can be huge variations in quality
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,527	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And there are definitely no federal regulations
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:22,111	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	There's a lot of substandard work
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:24,159	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Unfortunately being done in that
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:27,999	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Field it's not like CSI it's not like what you see on TV very often
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:30,303	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	That's a c Thompson
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:34,655	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	He did a bunch of reporting on this for propublica a few years ago very often
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,679	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	It's
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,727	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	People working under
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:39,775	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Dismal conditions
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,335	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	For very little money
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,359	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	With very little oversight
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:50,015	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	When someone dies in the US and Authority has to issue a death certificate with a cause of death
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:53,599	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	If you die from an illness in hospital this is something your doctor would do
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:57,695	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	If you die unexpectedly like if you murdered or a fall down some steps
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:01,023	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	A death certificate is issued by either a corner
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,559	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Or a medical examiner
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:04,607	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Maryland is on a medical examiner's
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:09,471	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	South Carolina Colorado and several other states are on corners
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:13,311	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And then you have states that are weird mix
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,079	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Both
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:14,847	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Depending on what
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:15,871	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	County you're in
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:20,479	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	In Frances glessner Lee was actually really passionate about abolishing corners
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:22,015	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	In favor of medical examiners
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:23,039	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Because
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,087	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Well I don't know if she would have put it
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:28,927	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Like this but basically Corner system is crazy
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:34,303	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	It's it's Bonkers and it's a scientific thing from another era
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:39,935	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	First of all you don't necessarily have to be a doctor to be a coroner
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:44,287	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	That is to be the person who issues a death certificate with a cause of death
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:49,919	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Like I'm a high-school graduate in a lot of places I could just roll out and say I'm running for coroner
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:55,551	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And be the County coroner now I would typically work with an MD who would do the autopsies
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,831	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	But I'd be the one
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:58,111	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Who make the final decision
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:16:59,903	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And that's the other thing
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,183	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	The coroner
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,207	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Is an elected office
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,743	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	When you have
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:06,047	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Medical professionals
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:08,863	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Professionals who have to run for office
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:11,679	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Based on what happens in the morgue
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:13,727	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Satsop
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:15,263	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Potential conflicts of interest
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:20,639	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	One of the situations where you might see conflicts-of-interest are cases where someone dies in police car
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:27,807	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	AC actually did some reporting on this very thing in New Orleans what you see in New Orleans
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:30,879	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Over and over and over again
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,415	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Is that when
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,951	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	People died in police custody
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:36,511	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	1 people died in Jail custody
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:41,119	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	That would be pretty good evidence that something
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:42,655	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Untoward had happened
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:44,191	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	They've been neglected
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:46,751	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	They've been severely beaten
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:47,775	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	They've been attacked
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:51,103	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And what was happening with the corner there
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:53,919	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Was basically trying to pretend that these things didn't happen
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:55,199	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	He was ruling death
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:57,759	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	To be accidental that should have been ruled as
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,271	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	What's homicide
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:05,439	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	His name is Frank Minyard he actually was a doctor but he wasn't trained as a medical examiner
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,975	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	He was an OBGYN
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:09,279	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And he seemed to have a bias
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,559	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Toward protecting the police
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:14,143	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Maybe because he constantly had to campaign to keep
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:17,983	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Job who does he want to endorse while he wants the police to endorse him
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:21,567	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	And if he's got a big spat with the police
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:23,359	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Is that going to look good for voters
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:30,527	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	In New Orleans BFDI finally stepped in and did some of their own investigations and some police did eventually go to jail
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,551	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	They offer some of those deaths
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:35,903	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	But Minyard was never fired by the voters or anyone else
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:38,207	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	He served as coroner for 40 years
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:40,511	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Finally retired in 2014
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:43,071	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	So it's worth noting when you're talking about
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,375	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Incidents involving a
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:47,679	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	Edith the police shoot somebody
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:50,239	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	The coroner medical examiner is going to say
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:52,799	| 99_pi_0165_thenutshellstudies_1 |	It was a homicide can't really get around that
