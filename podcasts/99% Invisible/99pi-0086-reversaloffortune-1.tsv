EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:57,119	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Chicago's location with perfect

EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:07,871	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Actually didn't jack up the street from cells they just pile dirt on top of the old streets to make them higher
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:10,943	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And some of that dirt came from the river bottom which of the
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:12,479	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Dredge to make room for
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:15,295	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	All of the stuff that they were about to dump in there
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,343	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	They did Jack up the building
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:21,951	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Literally has a lot of Jack Spurs and start cranking
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:28,607	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Bisquick picture for 1857 it shows a massive Hotel big is a city block

EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:50,623	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And this kind of thing happen over and staying open while they're getting cranked up Just for kicks
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,671	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Another fancy hotel

EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,991	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	But by that time project number 2 with already done
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:23,391	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Because it didn't take too long after the sewers went in for Chicago to realize that there was a big question that they hadn't given enough
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:24,927	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Start 2 on the first go-round
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:26,719	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	We're did the sewers take all this out
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,999	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Into the river
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:28,767	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And where the river
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:31,839	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And it'll wake and where was the drinking water coming
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:35,679	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	It's okay such as bro how about this
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:37,471	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Who build water intake
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,775	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	2 miles out from Shore
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,311	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Way past where the river
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,359	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Don't turn Mac into the lake
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:46,943	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And I don't mean digging the biggest deepest longest tunnel Everett
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,735	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	What do you think
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:53,599	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	They all said fine and they did it and it was amazing the city is growing people making money
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:56,159	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And everybody agrees they'll do whatever it takes
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:57,183	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Keep this thing rolling
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,975	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	So it's on round 2
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:00,255	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Digging the tunnel
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,791	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	In 1864

EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:04,607	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Start digging the tunnel out from the city
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,143	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	60 feet down from street level
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:07,935	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	After that
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:09,983	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Install a giant structure
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:12,031	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	2 miles out in the lake they call them
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:15,359	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Crabs and start digging a tunnel in from under that
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,383	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Back towards Shore
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:18,943	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	The work went on around the clock from both sides
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:21,503	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	One true dug by hand for 16 hours a day

EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:37,375	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	You know this is just Ball by side
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:39,167	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Everybody agreed with a
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,447	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Genius and a half
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:42,495	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Except they hadn't really solve the problem
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:48,639	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And they were dumping more
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:51,455	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Of their business into the river than ever
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,223	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Which
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:52,735	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Stank
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:56,063	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And before the water for the new intakes even started flowing
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:59,391	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	The union Stockyards open on the River South Branch
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:08:59,903	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Up the ante
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:05,535	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	320 Acres of slaughterhouses and meat packing plants
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,559	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	All of them
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:08,095	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Dumping whatever they couldn't use and
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,143	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Just imagine what that would be
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,679	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Into the river
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,727	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	For the estimated the Stockyards were
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:14,495	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	The equivalent of a
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,335	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	A million people in the city
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:19,871	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Yeah that's true
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:23,199	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	That bit of the South Fork still goes by the name and got then
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,735	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Bubbly Creek
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:28,063	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	All the discarded animal stop wood rot at the bottom of the river
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:31,391	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And eventually about methane which would double up to the surface and burst
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,415	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Also
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,695	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Sometimes a confiar
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,231	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And sometimes the sewage
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:38,815	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Got swept more than 2 miles out and found the water intakes
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:42,399	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Later they dig these even further out there's one called The Four Mile Creek
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:47,007	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And meanwhile the city kept growing by 1880 we're talking half a million people
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,287	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	End producing more X
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,335	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	The Stockyards group 2
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:51,359	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	A lot
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,151	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	When engineer would say
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:57,247	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Chicago produces more filth per capita than any other City
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:59,551	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And now typhoid was going to be a problem
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:03,647	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Turn Chicago started pushing for a new state law to help undertake the biggest
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,415	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Baddest
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,951	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Craziest idea ever
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:10,559	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	They decided to dig a gigantic new Canal that would reverse the river entirely
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:13,375	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Reversing the river would bring in fresh water from the leg
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:17,983	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And keep Chicago's mug from polluting the drinking water pulled from that same leg
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,751	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:21,567	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Flush all the sewage down to the Illinois River
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,615	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Which would then take it out to the Mississippi
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:30,015	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	It took a few years to get the new law prude the town of Joliet so a river of crap coming its way and try to mix it
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,551	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And then it took a few more years
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:33,343	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	To get plans laid out in contract issue

EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:45,887	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And then an engineer detonated to massive loads of dynamite
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,679	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Dynamite was there
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,191	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Preferred weapon

EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:57,055	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	You know so many people know about the Panama Canal but it was
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:57,567	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Really
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:59,359	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	In building this canal
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:00,383	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	I figured out everything
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:01,919	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Pennywise in the
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,223	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And a lot of the engineers
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,551	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	In the game
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,343	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	St.Louis got gas
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:13,695	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	We're talking 1899 all major digging has been done for years
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:19,583	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And the fine-tuning stuff is getting wrapped up all the construction of bridges and extra digging in the river Downstream
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:20,351	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Akira Chicago
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:22,399	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Water for the Mississippi and whatnot
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:25,215	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Is very very close to finish
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:29,055	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And this is when st-louis figures out that all that water

EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,071	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Thing is
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:53,375	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	It takes awhile to get a lawsuit ready
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,143	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	A few months
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:59,007	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And Chicago start humping it to get the Dam's ready to open for St Louis can get an injunction

EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:20,255	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	The trustees arrived at dawn
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,791	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	One of them bring shovel
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:24,351	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Most of these projects have these beautiful gold shovel
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:26,143	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	But one of the trustees
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:27,423	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Just stopped at a hardware store and bought the
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:28,959	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Timmy old
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:31,775	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Rihanna work show is like stopping at Home Depot
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:33,055	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Hey it's 5 in the morning
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:36,639	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	I had an awful time getting the shovel this time of day says any laid them out
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:38,431	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Couple reported are taking notes
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,503	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	At least they try to
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:44,575	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	First off you should note that was in January in Chicago so
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,855	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	You know you don't shovel anything
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:50,719	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	That would said that the ground was absolutely Frozen and they were going to actually know where
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,743	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	So they bring in a dress
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,023	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Which also goes nowhere
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:54,815	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	So they go get some Dynamite
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:58,911	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Which is a dud
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:00,447	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	There was a lot of profanity
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,471	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Number one
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:06,079	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Trustees control it out and then the dynamites not working and then the shovels I work
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:07,615	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Working in the end you know this was like
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:12,223	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	An insult to the kind of masculinity that I can't we can even you know open this thing up
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:13,759	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	A couple hours later
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:14,527	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Pain in the morning
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:16,831	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And maybe a hundred people have gathered
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,599	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And the dredge
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,367	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Get to work
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:21,183	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Just get good Scoop
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,719	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And it grabs it
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,743	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Yeah baby
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:31,679	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Dammit water starts dropping into the canal 24ft
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,703	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Straight down
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:34,239	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And where it goes
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:37,567	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	It is the Niagara of Chicago one of the trustees says
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:43,199	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Almost there but there's still one last and open up and down the river which needed the governor's okay
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,479	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	It's a gate that's already been made
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:46,271	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	It's just a matter of turning the
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:46,783	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	We all set
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:48,575	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And once the gate was
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:49,343	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Open the water could not be
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:55,231	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Meanwhile St Louis is still during a lawsuit
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:58,559	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	They're always worried about Saint Louis actually file a lawsuit that would stop
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:00,351	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	That was enjoying them
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,119	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	From actually opening it
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,935	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	This day I can't figure out why
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,263	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Why they were so slow about it
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:11,871	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Chicago still had to jam a few last pieces into place to get the governor's okay took 2 weeks
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,175	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	St Louis could have filed any day
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,455	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And then
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:16,479	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	January 17th
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:19,807	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Trustees took one more early morning track to lower the dam
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:20,831	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	They turn the crank
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:23,391	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Pose for a picture in their fancy coats and top hat
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,695	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Then put it back to Chicago for a big ones
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:30,303	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Bother eating and got where the st. Louis had indeed file for an injunction that day
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,327	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Too late
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,119	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	They brought a knife
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:37,471	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	To a gunfight they brought a little piece of paper into a torrent of fight
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,263	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Late I might add
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:41,567	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	They waited till just after the flood gates were open
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,103	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	I can understand that
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,127	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Legal philosophy
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:47,199	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	The story made the New York Times with the headline
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:50,015	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	The water in the Chicago River now resembles liquid
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:52,575	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	St.Louis push their case to the US Supreme
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:58,207	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Chief justice Oliver Wendell Holmes noted that it is a question of the first magnitude
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:01,535	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Weather the destiny of the Great Rivers is to be the sewers
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:03,071	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Of the cities along their back
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,887	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Which is an important philosophical question but
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:08,959	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	To paraphrase the waitresses on Spanish that opinion
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:10,239	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Whatever man
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:14,335	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Settling a question that big it wasn't really the courts job especially
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:18,943	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Since Missouri allowed St Louis and other towns to dump sewage into the Mississippi and send it
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,223	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Straight to Memphis
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:23,807	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	So in a very real sense there was no stopping it
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:29,183	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	The canal and River reversal was later called a civil engineering Monument of the millennium
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:33,535	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	It was a functional Monument to our dominion over the natural world
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,839	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Or so we thought
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:38,143	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Fast forward a hundred years right about now
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:41,215	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And the forces of nature are looking for another go-round
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:45,823	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	There have been some big efforts to clean up the river itself in the last two decades
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:49,407	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	And by 2015 the treated sewage is actually supposed to get disinfectant
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:53,247	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	When Rich cahan liability bubbly Creek looking for bubbles
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:56,063	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	We may have seen Signs of Life there instead
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,343	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	I see bubbles
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,231	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	I think that's a fish
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:03,999	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Is it
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:05,023	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Write down there
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:08,863	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	It's some kind of living thing right there
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,399	| 99pi-0086-reversaloffortune-1 |	Yes
