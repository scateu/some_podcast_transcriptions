EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:51,071	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Fitzroy was appointed head of the new meteorological office
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:54,399	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And he poured all his energy into the study of airbrush

EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,567	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And then one day
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:03,103	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	In 1859
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:07,199	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	A ship called the Royal Charter was sailing from Australia to Liverpool

EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,623	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	They were almost home
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,159	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	When suddenly
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:20,511	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Huge storm blew up in in the RCN chase the ship out of the coast
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:25,887	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Robert Fitzroy was sitting in his house in London at the time of Jesus
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:29,215	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	On the wall
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:31,519	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	So I knew that was a big storm somewhere
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:34,079	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	In the vicinity of Britain and Ireland
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:37,919	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	The captain of the royal Charter try to ride out the storm
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:41,503	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	But eventually the winds blew the ship onto the rocks

EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:46,367	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And over 450 people drowned

EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:54,303	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	They can want anyone
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:58,655	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Fitzroy decided to devote the rest of his life to saving lives at sea
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:00,191	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	By predicting the weather
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:06,591	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Which in Victorian times was pretty controversial because here they are they're very religious people and anything that kind of sounded a bit like

EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,455	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Concerned
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:13,503	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	So we decided to use a synonym
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,015	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	4 prophecy
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:17,343	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	That didn't sound quite so Twitchy

EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:41,663	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And well they were often ridiculed by readers at the time

EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:04,575	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Plenty of people still listen out at sea
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,111	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	But these days

EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:40,671	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	But the point is the British Bob the shipping forecast

EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:06,271	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Peter had all kinds of other responsibilities at the BBC
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:09,599	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	But you could never really Escape his association with the forecast

EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:37,503	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And then one day after learning some bad news
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:40,063	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Peter made a mistake

EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,735	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Peter was fired

EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,311	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Flask podcast
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:30,175	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Okay so the shipping forecast became a bedtime ritual for a lot of people
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:31,455	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Accidentally
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,247	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	In the same could be said of our show
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:38,623	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	About this week's episode might be a bit of an exception most of the time we're not trying to put you to sleep
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:42,207	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	But I'm here with you Ackerman who is the creator of a podcast called sleep with me
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:44,255	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And the whole goal of his show
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,791	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Does that help people doze off
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:49,887	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	ESO sleeping me is a bedtime story podcast for grown up
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:52,191	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And the whole idea is
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:55,519	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	To take the listener's mind off of what's keeping them away
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:56,287	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Wake
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:20:01,151	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	To disengage them enough so they can pay attention to the story or to what I'm saying
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:04,991	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	But where they don't feel the pressure to keep listening
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,783	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And there's also the risk of like
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:09,087	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Is this compelling thing coming at my show
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:13,951	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	A steer right around the compelling farts and I go into the Indian details
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,999	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Is my cat a specialty
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:17,535	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:21,119	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	It is it's just like a bedside companion
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,655	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	That's meant to be there
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:27,007	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	In the my grip on The Listener ideal he's just loose enough that they feel like they could just let
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:30,591	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Go my hand and drift away when they want to
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:33,407	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	I think that if you were to
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:37,247	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Look up what a relaxation videos on YouTube there's a
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:43,135	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Harp music or a whooshing sounds or people whispering or something
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:47,231	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	This appeals to the swerve the intellectual monkey mind
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:47,999	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	That is
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:53,375	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Tripping wait you at your day and you create something enough of a narrative that people can latch onto
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,655	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	But it's loose enough
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:57,727	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	That people can also drift away from
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:21:01,567	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And how did you come up with this as the way
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,079	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	2
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:05,407	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	To be that type of bedtime companion
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:12,831	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Hellboy I have this controversial belief that I didn't want to bring up on the podcast but I call that kind of part of our brain
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:13,599	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Brain brain.
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:14,367	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Should I believe it
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:17,952	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Then my brain and maybe other people's brains are populated by these little
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:19,232	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Droid
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:21,792	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	In all these Droids that they serve these different

EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:56,000	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	I can just get to the place where the people
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,280	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Instead of laughing
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:58,560	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Define
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:01,888	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Oh yeah that's pretty good
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:08,032	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Drew's approach the storytelling is quite unique but over the years he has tried to fall asleep to
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:09,824	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Lots of different types of audio
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,104	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	When he was growing up
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:16,480	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	There was this comedy radio show called Doctor Demento and he like to listen to it late at night
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:17,504	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Helping get to sleep
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:20,576	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	So when I was a kid and I had trouble sleeping
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:27,488	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Remember I was telling this one classmate like I can't sleep at night and then Sunday nights are the worst because they started having anxiety about
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:29,280	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	School ever been at school a few days
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:34,656	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And he said my other my older brother listen to this radio show is on Sunday nights from 9 to 11
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:37,472	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	It's a comedy radio show they play parody songs
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:43,104	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And I turned into it and I guess one of the things I wanted in the in the Doctor Demento provided
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:48,992	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Like this can be like an overused word or sound over-ambitious but like
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:51,296	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	It really is this idea of compassion
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:57,696	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	When you break up the word like is suffering with or suffering together and I'll dig documentary knew that but it was like dr.

EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:06,656	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:11,776	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	When I can't sleep I have this story about myself running through my brain about the past about the future
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:16,128	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And I want to just misdirect people and say Hey listen to the story over here
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:18,688	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	It's a it's a nicer story you're not a character in it
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:25,856	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And it's just here to keep you company in here sitting you don't even need to listen to it to fall asleep at like I'll just be here to tell you

EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:27,904	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	End
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:30,464	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Pegasus of what I wanted as a kid 2
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:36,096	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Haven't you been doing sleep with me for a few years what kind of feedback have you gotten from the listeners of the show
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:37,632	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:40,960	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	It was in the first leg a 8 months of the show
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:46,848	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Occasionally the end that would make jokes like a and I think it was because I was new to podcasting in May
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:52,480	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	It was really afraid I would make you do that self-effacing jokes like oh no one's probably listening to this
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:54,784	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	At this point in the show
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:57,088	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	I got three emails in a row from people
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:59,648	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Please don't say that like
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,672	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	I am awake
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,952	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	At the end of the show
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:03,488	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And I'm listening to the show
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:07,328	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	To be distracted like because I'm not going to fall asleep
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:10,144	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And it's painful for me to be reminded of that
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:13,728	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And it brought me right back to that memory is like lying there
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:17,056	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	When I went to the doctor men told there was no hope of me falling asleep either
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:20,128	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	So that was one piece of feedback is that
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:24,480	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	It's pretty powerful and then it's like just getting feedback about what people are afraid of
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:26,272	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	And then trying to steer around that
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,040	| 316_The_Shipping_Forecast_pt01 |	Leica
