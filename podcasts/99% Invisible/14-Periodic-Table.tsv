EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:39,136	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Precision and predictive power and here's where we should introduce
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,416	| 14-Periodic-Table |	The hero
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:40,928	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Of the story
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:45,792	| 14-Periodic-Table |	All the hero of the story is Dmitri Mendeleev Russian science
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:50,912	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Mendeleev was the first to come up with a periodic system there were five others before him
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:54,752	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Still periodic table Mac Daddy
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,800	| 14-Periodic-Table |	He came up with the design and
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:57,312	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Incorporated
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:00,128	| 14-Periodic-Table |	More elements than the other scientist
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:04,992	| 14-Periodic-Table |	He also knew enough to predict that there were
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,528	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Pools on the periodic
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:08,320	| 14-Periodic-Table |	You left gaps
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:10,368	| 14-Periodic-Table |	That would be filled by later Elam
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,160	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Discovered
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:16,768	| 14-Periodic-Table |	I said he knew enough to be able to predict the properties of new elements
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,791	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Based on
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:20,351	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Where exactly the holes were at this was

EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,167	| 14-Periodic-Table |	A scientist
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:28,287	| 14-Periodic-Table |	I'm in the way of love his table but everyone else was about to discover how awesome it was
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:30,847	| 14-Periodic-Table |	When the first gap of the table was filled in
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:33,919	| 14-Periodic-Table |	What element newly-christened galleon
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:37,759	| 14-Periodic-Table |	This was discovered in 1875 by a Frenchman
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:41,599	| 14-Periodic-Table |	The Galleon filled in the Gap right below aluminum and because of that
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:47,999	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Mendeleev said should have properties like aluminum for the French scientist who discovered and named gallon found at the melting point
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:48,767	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Was different
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:55,679	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Then what Mendeleev predicted using the table
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,447	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Check your results
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:59,263	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Which is pretty insulting to say to another scientist
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,567	| 14-Periodic-Table |	I'm in the lab is not about Consulting anybody
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:06,175	| 14-Periodic-Table |	And I after another year or so it turned out that Mendeleev was correct
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,991	| 14-Periodic-Table |	And the Frenchman had to retract his results
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:12,319	| 14-Periodic-Table |	The entire scientific world of chemistry was astounded
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:16,671	| 14-Periodic-Table |	That Mendeleev sitting in his office in St Petersburg
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,207	| 14-Periodic-Table |	For he knew nothing about the
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:23,327	| 14-Periodic-Table |	But he had been able to see the properties of gallium more clearly than the person who would actually do
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:29,471	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Discovered it in Paris who actually held it in his hand just because of the table because he knew exactly where it was on the table
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,007	| 14-Periodic-Table |	And what
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:32,287	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Properties it should have
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,591	| 14-Periodic-Table |	That's when the periodic table
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:40,223	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Stop to pee just a clever and nice looking arrangement of elements and really became a scientific
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,503	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Tool that had real
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,271	| 14-Periodic-Table |	Predictive power
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:45,087	| 14-Periodic-Table |	But for most of us who know nothing of the Alamo
