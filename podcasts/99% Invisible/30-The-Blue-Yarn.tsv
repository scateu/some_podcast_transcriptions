EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,656	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	So back to the story
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:20,032	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Is that loss is at Virginia Mason Dr Kaplan start studying how other hospitals are managed
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,824	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	We started scouring the country
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:24,640	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Looking for a hospital with a management system worth it.
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:26,688	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And if you're anything like me when you hear the phrase

EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:43,072	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Tarted up with unnecessary jargon but really all you need to understand here is that
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:46,912	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Dr Kaplan was looking for a hospital that have processes and procedures
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:49,216	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Or better than what it was already using
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:51,264	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	But he never found one
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,544	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	So instead

EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:21,472	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And the changes were based on a car company
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:25,568	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And that the doctors and nurses should refer to their new teachers as sensei
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,360	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Response
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,384	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Was not pretty
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:30,688	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	There was a lot of Anger from

EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,272	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Led by the doctor
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:39,136	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And this whole multi-year overhaul started with a ball
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,416	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	A blue your
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:45,792	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	The staff met with a Sensei and he took out the ball blue yarn and a map of the hospital
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,072	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And he told the staff
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,888	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	To trace the path a cancer patient would take
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,168	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	On a typical visit
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,704	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	For chemotherapy
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:54,496	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And then the yarn when

EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:57,056	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Couple inches and then it maybe went up
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,104	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	5 in
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:00,384	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	To where they'd have
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:02,944	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	To get their blood drawn and then they would go up
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:06,528	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	To the 14th floor and on the cardboard that was like maybe 4 in
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:11,136	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Which is above that Joellen is a nurse manager at Virginia Mason
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,904	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	To come
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:18,303	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And see their doctor which was in a different location was so big on our board that we just had to keep wine
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:24,703	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Finding it around itself that sucker Henry Otero creating kind of this circular maze like
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:28,031	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	You would wind a yo-yo when we looked at it we were amazed
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,823	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	At how far patients
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:30,591	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Travel
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:33,407	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	We were asking oncology patients who are
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,735	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Their oxygen carrying capacity
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,271	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Password is compromised
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,295	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Because the chemo
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,063	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Therapy
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:44,415	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Destroys a lot of red blood cells so that makes him short of breath
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,207	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And here were asking patient
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,999	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Things to do this who are short of breath.
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:48,511	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	To begin with
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:49,791	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	So is this
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,071	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	It was appalling
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,863	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	To us and I think it was
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:58,495	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	That mapping of the flows of medicine and the patient understanding the patient Journey was
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:00,287	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	That I
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,567	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Eye-opening moment
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,335	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	That you realize
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:04,895	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	You don't really know what
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:09,759	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	What's going on the blue yarn told the story of what Virginia Mason was doing wrong
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:12,831	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	We just didn't we couldn't conceive of it intellectual until we saw
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:19,231	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	In the story it told was not a good one to dr. Otero thought he was providing exceptional care for
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,791	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	They basically came into my
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:22,303	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Exam room
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:23,583	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And they laughed
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:29,983	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And I really said I'm a great doctor look at this great care I give I see them I send them out and
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,263	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Another day just mess
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,287	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Feel like temperature
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:34,335	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Great experience of having care here
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:36,895	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Then he saw the twisting path of the blue yarn
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:39,455	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Oh how awful it is for them
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:40,991	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	How awful it must
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:41,759	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Speed to really
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:44,575	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Weight everywhere along the way
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:46,623	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And that I was contributing to that
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,135	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And that
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:49,183	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	It became an intolerance
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:49,951	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Spell 82
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:51,999	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	I couldn't accept it anymore
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,071	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Six months after that first meeting
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:57,887	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Doctor Mecklenburg the hospital's chief of Medicine
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:00,959	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Let a group of staff on a 3 week trip to Japan to meet with a
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:06,335	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And so they pulled out the schematic essentially an architect's drawing
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,383	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Various parts of
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:09,919	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Virginia Mason Medical
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,711	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:14,271	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	The Sensei kept pointing to these areas
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,575	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Saying what is that and
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:17,343	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Dr Mecklenburg
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:18,879	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	I would say well that's a waiting
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:21,183	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And this happened over and over
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:21,951	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Again
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:24,255	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	The waiting area and as this was happening
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,023	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	That's a waiting area
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,303	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	The sensation
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:28,095	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	To him to be getting increasingly angry
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:30,655	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And he says to Mecklenburg
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:32,191	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Why are there
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:33,215	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	So many waiting
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:33,983	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Areas
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:34,495	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Throughout this
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:36,799	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Who's waiting
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:39,103	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	What are they doing what are they waiting
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,407	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Dr. Mecklenburg
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:42,943	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Says those are patient
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:44,991	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	They're waiting for us
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,039	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And the sensei
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,831	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Long pause
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:50,879	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Looks quite
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:52,927	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Furious
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:55,231	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Looks directly at Doctor Mecklenburg
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:57,535	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Front of Mecklenburg steam says to him
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,071	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Aren't you ashamed

EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:27,487	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	The staff completely redesigned the cancer center
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:31,839	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And they hired an architect who had first-hand knowledge of cancer treatment as a patient

EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,039	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Offices there
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,063	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Do you want something that really
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:54,879	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Was difficult for me because
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:57,695	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Play I think we're always in the right direction with
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,463	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	The patient
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:02,047	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	I think for others who may be didn't go through that process

EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:11,519	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	You know I had to Great office the great win tonight putting me in this cubicle you know and I'm on the guy does all the work you know

EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:16,127	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	The big office some doctors were so angry that quit

EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:20,223	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Did everyone who stayed realizes
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:21,247	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	It was the right thing to do for the
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:26,111	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	When I go there and I see them there and I see them looking out and I
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:26,879	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	II
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:30,719	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Recognize that's a much better place than be gratified that
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,487	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Decision was made
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:32,511	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,047	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	It's totally worth the right
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:35,583	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Decision it's not even a question
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,375	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Should have doubted relocating patients
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,399	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	It was just the beginning
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:40,447	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Today the new cancer center has been dubbed
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,727	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	The cancerous
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,239	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Spa
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:44,031	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	It was designed to
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,567	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Create an environment of

EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,127	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	So it has
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:52,479	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Real pretty pale yellow color we use colors of nature
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:52,991	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Nature cell

EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:02,207	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And we have a water wall there's two of them
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,743	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Actually it just so you don't think
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,511	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	But this new manager
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,047	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	System resulted only in
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:07,583	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Natural

EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:14,495	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	The whole reason why this blue yarn was unspooled to begin with was to save the hospital money
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:15,775	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And it did
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,055	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And it also
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,103	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Made it a safer place
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:21,663	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	From 2007 to 2009
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:23,711	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Virginia Mason was so much safer
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,735	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	But their insurance
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,015	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Expensive decline
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,807	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Astonishing 37

EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,815	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Still scoff at the idea of Toyota in
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:39,327	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Inspired manager
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,631	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	I was on a boat once
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:46,239	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And someone said to me so you are you guys still building Toyotas in your basement
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:49,567	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And that was that was a real
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,335	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	I mean I was
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,103	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Send it
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:55,455	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Because I knew that what we're doing here is a really good and I said to him

EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:08,511	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Stemmed from a single thread of blue yarn
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,559	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Became especially poignant
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,607	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	When the staff visited Japan for the first time

EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,215	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	It was an automatic Loom
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:22,335	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	That was where the team learned that the Toyota production system was in fact born quite literally
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:24,127	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	From a single thread of yarn
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,431	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Might have even been blue
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:29,247	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Toyota was originally a textile
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,551	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	In 1902

EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,903	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	I would stop
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:37,951	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	The thread was broken or woven incorrect
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:43,327	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	That this the museum is a story of continuous process Improvement
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:47,423	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	You start with backbreaking work on a manual Loom
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:50,495	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	That is producing defective product
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:53,823	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	And you put in the first components of ergonomics
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:55,871	| 30-The-Blue-Yarn |	Putting the person sitting up in
