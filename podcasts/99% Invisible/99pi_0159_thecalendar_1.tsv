EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:07,840	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	This is 99% invisible
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:09,120	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	I'm Roman Mars
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:16,032	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	30 days has September April June and November February has 20
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:18,336	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	He ate alone all the rest have 31
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:22,688	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Except in leap year that's the time when February's days are 29
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:24,480	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	That doesn't even rhyme
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:26,528	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The poem I grew up with was
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:28,576	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Slightly different
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:33,696	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Thirty days hath September April June and November
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:35,232	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	All the rest have 31
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:39,840	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Except for February which has 28 days clear and 29 in each leap year
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:46,496	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Okay I think that rhymes actually worse both poems to say the same thing which is that months don't make any logical time
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:49,824	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	A month is hardly a unit of measurement
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:52,896	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	I can be anywhere from 28 to 31 days
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:54,688	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Sometimes it's four weeks

EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:59,552	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	You have to buy a new calendar with new dates
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:01,344	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Every single year
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:03,136	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	It's a strange design
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:06,720	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Well the year that we now have
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:09,536	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And basically consider almost a writ of God
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:11,840	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	You know somehow it's just indivisible there it is
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:14,912	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Actually has had an amazing history
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:19,264	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	That is David Ewing Duncan I am the author of
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:19,776	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Calendar
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:24,384	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Humanities epic struggle to determine a true and accurate
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:24,896	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Goodyear
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:27,968	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The calendar that the world really uses right now
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:29,504	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Is mostly
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:32,320	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	A sort of joining of the Roman Calendar in the Egyptian calendar
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:35,392	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	It's basically when Caesar and Cleopatra
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:37,184	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	What kind of hanging out and doing their thing
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:42,816	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Which is to say when Roman Caesar and Egyptian Cleopatra we're having a torrid love affair
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:45,376	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	This was before Cleopatra got together with Marc Anthony
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:46,912	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	She was 21
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:48,448	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And Caesar was 52
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:51,264	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	But they got together and they did what lovers do
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:54,080	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Discuss the true nature of the Earth
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:54,592	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Flirtation
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:58,688	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And Egyptians long before the Greeks came
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,968	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Actually discovered
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,736	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The true length
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:03,296	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Of the year 365 days
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:05,856	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The Egyptians knew about the length of the year
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:08,672	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Because of the Nile River
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:12,256	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	It was basically a series of steps that went into the Nile
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,024	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The Nile
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,048	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Actually flooded
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:15,328	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	At the same height
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:16,608	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Virtually every year
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:17,632	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	It's on the same day
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,680	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And they were just simply Mark each year
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,216	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	When it hit its height
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:28,128	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	But the Egyptians also figured out that the year isn't always exactly 365 days
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:33,504	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	So they added an extra day every four years just to make sure that the calendar matched up with the season
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:34,784	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	In other words
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:36,832	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	They invented the leap year
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:39,392	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And this was all fantastic news to Caesar
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:42,976	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Because he had a feeling that the Roman Calendar wasn't quite right
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:47,840	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The Roman calendar year at the time was around 354 days long
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:48,864	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Obviously that's a few days show
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:50,400	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	11 days
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:51,936	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	How to Short
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,216	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Natural solar
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,776	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And when you lose 11 days
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,568	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Year after year after year
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,616	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The season starts
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:01,664	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Spring in the winter
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:02,944	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Winter in the fall months
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:07,808	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And those 11 days were missing because the Roman Calendar had always been base
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:08,832	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Based on moon cycle
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:13,696	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Cleopatra inspired Caesar to switch to a calendar that would be consistent with
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:15,232	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The Earth cycle around
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,000	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The Sun
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:18,303	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	When Caesar return to Rome from his dalliance
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:19,583	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Cleopatra
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:21,119	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	He introduced the leap year
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,143	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Call Julian
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:25,983	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Julius Caesar also added back those 11 missing days
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:29,823	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And the Julian calendar was instituted throughout the Roman Empire
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:31,103	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Just to say
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,663	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Still a bit
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:35,455	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Did you encounter wasn't entitled
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:36,735	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Accurate
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:37,503	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Itself
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,783	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	11 minutes 14
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:40,575	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Each year
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,599	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Eventually you had
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,879	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	We are losing days
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:43,903	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And then
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:45,183	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	There was a week
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,743	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And buy 1582
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:48,767	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Pope Gregory
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:50,559	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The 13th at the wherewithal to say
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,607	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Okay we are actually we have an inactive
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,375	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Your calendar will worship
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,655	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	All of our holidays
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:02,335	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And with a few small adjustments to realign the year with the seasons we have the Gregorian calendar
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,871	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Named after Pope Gregory
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:06,943	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And that's what's on your wall or your phone
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:09,247	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	We all use it we don't think about it now
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,015	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:11,807	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	For that reason
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:13,343	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	There has not been a huge
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,623	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Momentum to try to
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,391	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Change things
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,159	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Basically live with it
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:20,767	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	But there are a lot of smart people out there have been for centuries
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,303	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And come up with better calendars and there are better,
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:28,447	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	One example of calendar redesign came after the French Revolution
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:32,031	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The French decreed the first year of the Revolution was the year one
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:37,407	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Animed the week 10 days long this was actually instituted for over a decade
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:40,479	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Then Napoleon put the kibosh on that when he became emperor
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:44,063	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And later another Frenchman created these so-called
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:44,831	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Positivist
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:48,159	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Calendar the positivist calendar was created in

EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,967	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Wonder didn't really take off
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:15,807	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	It was mostly meant as an inspirational Memorial to glorify great thinkers
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:18,111	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And Fina patriarchy
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:18,623	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	However
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:21,951	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	There was another radical attempt at calendar reform
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:22,975	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	That actually
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,743	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Kind of happened
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,095	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	I wrote the death and life
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:28,863	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	13 month count
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:34,751	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	This was a highly rational 13-month calendar meant to appeal not too romantic
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:37,055	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	But to industrialists
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:42,431	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Because the wonky weirdly divided Gregorian calendar was difficult for accountants
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:46,783	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Who had to track monthly numbers and for the people who had to make the trains run on time
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:49,087	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And Moses because it's worth
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,111	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Was both of those people
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:53,439	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Moses B cotsworth
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,975	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Was analytics guy
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:56,767	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Mostly working in the
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,047	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Railway industry
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:02,655	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Codsworth was a British Railway Man and he was all about efficiency
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:04,959	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The Gregorian calendar wasn't cutting it for him
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:06,495	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	So it's a
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:08,287	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	There's a month where this extra Monday
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:11,615	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	What is a month for the next Saturday that would throw out the numbers
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:12,895	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	A month to month
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:15,711	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And that kind of frustrated cotsworth
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,015	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	So he created his
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:19,295	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	13 month calendar
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:25,695	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	In 1902 codsworth presented a design for a calendar of 13 months worth every month was exam
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:27,487	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Exactly 28 days
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:28,511	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	No more
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,279	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	No less
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:30,559	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	4
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,583	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Perfect week
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:35,167	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And this meant the dates were all standardized as well
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:37,983	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	You always know that V was a Thursday
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:38,751	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	No matter the month
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:41,567	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	First was always a fun day
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,615	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Attempt was always a Tuesday
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,639	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	There be a Friday
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,407	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The 13th
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:48,991	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Every single month rational railway man we're not
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:52,575	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Superstitious clearly all the months names would stay the same
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,623	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And then that additional month
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,415	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Another 28 even days
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:59,231	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Would fall between June and July
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,511	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And this additional month
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:01,791	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Would be called
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:04,863	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	SOL SOL SOL
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:05,887	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Standing for
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:06,655	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The month where the
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,167	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Somersaults
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:11,519	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And leave your day would be added at the end of Soul not February
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:14,335	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	So every 4 years old would have 29 days
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,919	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Alright so 20 days * 13 months
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,967	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Is 364 days in a year
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:23,039	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	That is one day less than the actual solar year of 300
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,319	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	5
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,599	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	How to make it 300
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,367	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	65
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:28,415	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Codsworth added a new holiday
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:31,487	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Right before the new year for lecture day at the end of the year
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:37,887	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Called your day and your day was just a floating day not part of any particular month and it would be a sword
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,167	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Global Sabbath
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:44,287	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And aside from your day all other vacations would be moved to a Monday
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,847	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Holidays would always be practiced or observed
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,431	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Don't worry about certain months where
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,735	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Wednesday
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:59,647	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And maybe since I have Wednesday off they want to schedule Thursday and Friday off
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:01,439	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	No Wednesdays off
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:04,511	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Codsworth pitched his perfect calendar around the United States
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,303	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Giving talks about its Myriad benefits
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,095	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	You can find many takers
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:12,447	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Except for one of the wealthiest and most successful businessmen of that time
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:13,983	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	George Eastman
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,775	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	George Eastman
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,055	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The founder of Kodak
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,103	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Mr. Eastman had a lot of
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:25,503	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Unique interest in addition to his company and his philanthropic work but this I have to say is probably one of the
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:31,903	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Weirdest interest that he hadn't pursued Cathy Connor is the curator of the George Eastman house in collection in
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,671	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Chester New York
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:37,279	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	When he had an interest in anything he always put a decent amount of money into
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:43,423	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Getting other people to buy into his ideas as well and he did exactly that with the 13-month calendar
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:47,519	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Eastman basically took it upon himself to promote cotsworth calendar design
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:51,103	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And he started a calendar League headquarters in Rochester
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:54,175	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Income tax office gave a little office to this
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,967	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Calendar reform
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:59,039	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Group and it was there that they
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:05,439	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Published in printed some different Flyers to hand out a local businesses actually convince a few local
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:09,279	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Benefits to switch to a 13-month calendar including of course
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:11,071	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Mr. Eastman Zone company
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:15,167	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	They adopted it at the Eastman Kodak company in 1924
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:18,751	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And they continue to use it until 1989
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:22,591	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	So that is 65 years
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,871	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Until 1989
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,919	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Apparently employees found it useful
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,967	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	When I did sales
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,991	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Porting program
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:34,367	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	I didn't have to worry about love this is a 28-day month is a 31-day month is
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:38,975	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	I acclimated it very quickly
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:40,767	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	John saracco worked at Kodak
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:43,327	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	From 1986 to 1992
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:45,375	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	He actually like the calendar so much
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:47,679	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	He tried to bring it with him Beyond Kodak
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:52,543	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	A couple of times I've actually tried getting company that I work for
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:55,103	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	2 going use 8:30
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:55,871	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Team.
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,151	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	You know
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:58,687	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	4 weeks * 30
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:03,039	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Calendar but like Moses cotsworth in George Eastman beforehand
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:07,391	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	John Scirocco just couldn't convince other businesses to take it on
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:08,927	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	That said
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:10,207	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Even within Kodak
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:14,047	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Eastman couldn't fully Institute the 13-month calendar and it's
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:14,815	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Truest form
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:17,375	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The calendar as John do it
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:19,167	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Was kind of a modified version
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:22,495	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	I only knew it as this is the financial calendar
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:24,543	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Company
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:29,151	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Kodak employees didn't observe solar year day or change every holiday to a Monday
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:33,759	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	It was like how some bankers work in quarters or some schools function in semester
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:36,831	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Kodak's internal schedule with organized
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,855	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	It's a 13.
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,903	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Just called. One

EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:43,743	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Instead of saying that today was March 2nd
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:45,791	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	We would say that
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:46,815	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Today is
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:49,119	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The third. Date

EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,007	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Forhow July 4th
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,543	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	It's kind of like
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:29,567	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The perfect
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:30,847	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Example of how Campo
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,407	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Mentally adjust
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,455	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	New calendar
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:37,247	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	That's journalist Mark Burns again
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:40,575	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Okay so on the 13-month calendar schedule
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:42,879	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	July 4th would have to be moved to a Monday
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,159	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Like all the holidays
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:46,207	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	So then they'll really be July 2nd
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:49,791	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	But when you add in Soul and Shuffle the dates around accordingly
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:53,631	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	That actual day on the solar calendar wouldn't fall in July
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:57,215	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	It would actually be Soul 17 but
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:58,751	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	That falls on a Tuesday
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,031	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	You got to make
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:02,335	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	That Monday so would end up as Soul six
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,639	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	So there's nothing is
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:05,663	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Patriotika celebrating
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:09,503	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	This is why the calendar and it's
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,295	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Truest most regulated form
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,575	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Couldn't fully work at Kodak
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:15,647	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	I mean you have to give your employees a vacation on July 4th
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,439	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Even if it's not on a Monday
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:23,839	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	So Random holidays in off-days persisted
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:25,375	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Kodak couldn't do it alone
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:29,215	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	He would have to convince the rest of the world to make the switch
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:31,263	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	He and mr. Cox worth
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,543	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	They went to bed
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:33,311	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	A few times
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:36,127	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	In front of a lot of different committees at Congress
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:39,199	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And in our government to try to justify
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,735	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Explain the rationale
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:42,783	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And this was taken completely serious
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,831	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Calendar reform
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:46,623	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Became an actual
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,391	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Issue of
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,415	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Debate forum
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:54,559	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	League of Nations the League of Nations as in the precursor to the UN there are a hundred 85 plans
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:56,863	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Before the League of Nations to look at
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,143	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Four County reform
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,423	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,191	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Codsworth
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:00,959	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Eastman
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,495	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Puzzle was one of the
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,031	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Few finalists
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:07,359	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Even after George Eastman passed away in 1932
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:10,431	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	League of Nations continue discussing calendar redesign
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,455	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Basically
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:13,247	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	League of Nations can come to a consensus
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:14,783	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And then
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,831	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The rise of Hitler and World War II made
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:17,855	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Thoroughly
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,135	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Unimportant to them
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,719	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Hitler ruins everything
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:26,559	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And we just haven't really considered calendar reform since
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,351	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Perhaps because
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:32,959	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	When designing time and the way people operate you have to consider custom and culture
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:36,031	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	It has to be done entirely and completely
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,055	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Or not at all
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:41,151	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	So who knows perhaps if everyone decided to adopt it
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:44,479	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	A regimented calendar could really work better for
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:48,575	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	No finances and planning but on the other hand
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:51,135	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	I think it's kind of fascinating that are year is not
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:51,903	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Perfectly regiment
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,951	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Out of our control

EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,335	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	Really
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:13,151	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	A bizarre anomaly of History
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:15,199	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	That this calendar the starter was his

EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:23,135	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	It it's now
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:23,903	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	The calendar of the world
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:27,487	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	And all we have to help us remember it is a stupid rhyme
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:29,535	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	That doesn't even rhyme
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:51,039	| 99pi_0159_thecalendar_1 |	By the way we talk to another longtime Kodak employee for the story my name is Robert
