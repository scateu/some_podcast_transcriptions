EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:17,568	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	When you're a comic book fan there's always a surge of excitement when they announced a film adaptation of the
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:21,152	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Character you love the chance to see your hero punch
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:24,736	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	In Twisted movie through the air to make spaghetti
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:31,136	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	But there's always that fear that Hollywood is going to screw it up that the screenwriter won't get the care
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:37,536	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	The way you get the character because you know how it's supposed to be you know Mary Jane came after
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:40,352	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Gwen Stacy it doesn't make sense the other way
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:47,264	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	But the first indication whether you're going to be buzzing with eager anticipation while you're in line on opening day
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:53,664	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Card reading each step while you're in line on opening day because let's face it you're going to go no matter what
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:02:00,064	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	First indication of how good or how bad it's going to be happens months before when they reveal the design
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:01,088	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Of the suit
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:07,488	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Superhero suits made real with a real Fabric and real people are very hard to design
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:09,792	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	But we will judge them not know why
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:10,816	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	That is our job
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:16,960	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	You reckon much more mellow over the years or the suits have gotten much much better
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:19,520	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Eric molinsky has noticed this too
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:25,920	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Eric has done a couple of great episodes for us at 9 p.m. over the years but now he has his own podcast called imaginary world
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:28,480	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	About sci-fi and other fantasy genres
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:32,320	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	How we create these worlds and why we suspend our disbelief
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:38,720	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	This is an episode that he produced in 2015 about designing comic book costumes for movie screens and I really like it and I
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:42,048	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	I know that you're going to like it too it's called fixing the hobo suit
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:50,240	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Let's not stand on ceremony here
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:55,104	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	If you haven't seen The Dark Knight Rises
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,664	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Tom Hardy plays the villain
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:58,432	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Bait
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,968	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	And for some reason
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:02,784	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	The voice is a cross between Sean Connery
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,064	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	And Darth Vader
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:08,160	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Given that the character is supposed to come from a fictional Latin American country
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:09,952	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	It was a very weird choice
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:16,864	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Darkness is your ally you merely adopted the dark
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:18,400	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	But it was so weird
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:20,960	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	It was kind of amazing
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:23,520	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	And led to all these really great parities
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:31,456	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	I believe I would like two packs of AAA sauce thank you
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:38,368	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	But for all the buzz Around The Voice
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,672	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	I was surprised more people didn't talk about the
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,184	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Costume
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,976	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Which I thought was ingenious
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:46,816	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	So in the comics Bane looks kind of like a Mexican wrestler
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,608	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	He's got a black hood over his
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:50,912	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	With a white design the middle that
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:53,472	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Kind of looks like a skull with red eyes
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,008	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	His strength
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:57,312	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Comes from tubes going to his back that
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,592	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Pum pum full of liquid
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,104	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Steroids
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:03,456	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	And back to shoulders are so huge and bulked out
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:07,040	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Artist like to draw his head below his neck
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:10,112	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	It's no way you could do a literal version of that
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:13,952	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	But that didn't stop Joel Schumacher from trying
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:15,744	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	In his 1997
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:16,256	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Catastrophe
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,536	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Batman and Robin
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:19,071	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Freehold
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:21,375	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	We Are Evil killing machine
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:23,423	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	I call this little number
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:33,663	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Of course Christopher Nolan's Batman to play some kind of a semi-realistic universe
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,735	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	So he and Lindy Hemmings costume design
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:41,087	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Turn beans liquid steroids into a gas that he inhales
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:44,927	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	But it doesn't make him super strong and actually dulls physical pain
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:51,839	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	His breathing apparatus is the same shape as the design on the hood in the comics but
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:58,239	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	The breathing apparatus is black in the design in the hood with white course not wearing a hood in the movie
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:02,591	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Instead we see the actress bald head so if you squint
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:07,711	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Beans head in that movie looks like the exact same design as the comics
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:13,087	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	But the negative image of it of course they couldn't give Bane like cartoonishly huge
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:13,855	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Shoulders
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,647	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	So instead he wore a coat
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:19,231	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	They had a very high round wool collar
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:22,303	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	They gave him the same silhouette at the comic books
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:25,375	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Like I said it was a brilliant design solution
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,167	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Impossible
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:29,983	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Superhero costumes used to be
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:30,495	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Cringe-worthy
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:34,847	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Even the cool ones like you know Batman from the Tim Burton films
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,383	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	The costume was so bulky
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:38,943	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Michael Keaton couldn't turn his head
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:42,015	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Or fight unless they bad guys basically ran into his fists
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:46,111	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	So what happened how did the costumes get so much better
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:48,671	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	I Michael Wilkinson and I'm a costume designer for film
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,207	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Michael worked on Manor
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:52,511	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Steal any upcoming sequel Batman verse
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,023	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Superman
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,071	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	He got a lot of heat from a new bat
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,607	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Because the first images
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:58,655	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	It look like Ben Affleck
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,935	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Was wearing a thick rubber
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,983	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	How it wouldn't be able to turn his head with
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:03,263	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Feel like a step backward
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:06,079	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	But newly released images
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,359	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Show The Dark Knight turning his head
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:14,271	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	I feel like I play When the world has a really good look at the the Cowell then we're as
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:17,599	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	I have people like it's a lot of work went into
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:20,927	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	The construction of that is all sorts of amazing
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:23,487	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Things going on inside that cow
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,023	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Let's make it
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:28,351	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Easy to move in and I have a full range of expressions
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:33,471	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Superhero costumes stand-alone works of fashion which over
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:35,007	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Time became dated
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:35,775	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Cringe-worthy
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:38,335	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Even if they were designed by a genius
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,127	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Like Edna Mode in The Incredibles
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:47,295	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	What do you mean
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:49,087	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Distracts from the now
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:51,391	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	If ground beef
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:58,303	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Something classic
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:01,887	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	She had a crazy look in the boots
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:05,471	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	One of the big changes is that costume designers
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:07,775	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Are now looking more closely The Source material
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:12,383	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	When Michael Wilkinson and his collaborator James Atchison worked on Man of Steel
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:15,455	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	They research the history behind Superman's costume
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:18,015	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	The Genesis of that idea was
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:21,599	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	That you know II perform as the weight lifters and

EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:53,247	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	And what immediately came out with
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,295	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	In 1963
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,599	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	Discovered

EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:04,255	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	So we kind of went down this route

EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:44,959	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	You got to follow those lines around the body three

EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:57,759	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	One thing we discovered is that no matter

EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:20,543	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	That's why the costumes were usually just one or two maybe three colors
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:23,103	| 99pi-0190-fixingthehobosuit-1 |	What's good I mean I kind of left off the page
