EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:10,175	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Yeah this game took place in Hawaii and it was an exhibition game made up of servicemen
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:13,759	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Pitching was kind of a lanky goofy looking guy

EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:27,327	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	And packing just snaps

EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:31,423	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	This is the picture okay he jumps off the mound
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,959	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	And runs after DiMaggio
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:36,287	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	People thought he was like going to attack him or something but actually he just
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:38,847	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Ran behind him mimicking his home run trot
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:41,407	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	And the crowd just went nuts
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:47,039	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	So he kept doing this act throw those servicely exhibition games
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:47,551	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	A picture
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:51,391	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	His dick was sort of a mix of Jim Carrey in Ace Ventura

EDL	00:06:56,767	00:07:00,607	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	And when the war was over packing stop being a picture and was hired by the

EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:10,079	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	It was the first time a mascot did more than just stand around being lucky
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,615	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	He entertained people
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:15,199	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	God knows people need that a baseball game
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:19,295	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	So now thanks to pack and we had this idea of a mascot as a diversion
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:24,159	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	But there's still a big evolutionary step to get to the mascots we know today
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,695	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Yeah that the turning point
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:28,511	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Certainly has to begin and end with the chicken
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:33,631	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	The San Diego chicken who can really only be described as a dude in a chicken suit

EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:03,327	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	And the Padres were such a bad team that people started
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,143	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Going just so they could see the chicken perform
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:09,471	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	And that's where the San Diego chicken kind of was born he was this

EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,335	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Suddenly became bigger than the team itself
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,663	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	She was eventually fired from the radio station because

EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:49,919	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Even so by the late seventies the mascot scene was still pretty Barren by today's standards
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:52,479	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Only a handful of baseball teams
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,503	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Technically had Mass
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,807	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Like the Philadelphia Phillies
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:59,135	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	They had a pair of characters called Phil and Phyllis
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:08:59,903	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Steel prop
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:01,695	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	They weren't mascots they were props
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:03,999	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Picture if you dressed a couple of those

EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,607	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	They were these big
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,143	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Plaster characters that would
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:12,959	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Kind of waddle out for the national anthem or if there's a homerun
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:17,567	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	So when the Philly saw with the chicken was doing in San Diego
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,335	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	They were like
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,359	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	We got to get us some of that
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:25,759	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	The Phillies found someone to custom design a mascot to entertain their fans
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,295	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	And before she came on board
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,575	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	They warned her that
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:30,623	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Fans in Philly could be a little
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:32,671	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Unforgiving
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:34,463	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	They said well we just want you to know

EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:49,055	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	But Eagles fans did one spelled Santa with snowballs during the game
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:51,359	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Bonnie had no experience

EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:20,031	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	I wonder if there's anything she is
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:22,079	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Choosing what show to be on
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:26,687	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	She also worked with Henson on making life-size version of the Sesame Street care

EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:33,343	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	So she knew how to make a costume that people could perform and move
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,903	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Which was A New Concept when it came to mask
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:41,279	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Chobani got to work on this new mascot in the meantime the Phillies had to find someone to
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:44,607	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Stuff inside of it and face those Santa hat clean crowns
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:48,959	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	They needed the lowest man on the totem pole the intern to raise his hand and say yes
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:51,775	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Message Dave Raymond who was that intern
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:53,567	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	He was brought on board to do things like
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:55,103	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	County all star game voting
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:11:00,223	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	He had no background as a performer aside from some dabbling with
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Disco
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:02,015	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Nevertheless
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:04,575	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	She would be the performer inside this new mask
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:10,975	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Because of some delays we didn't see the costume until the very night that I was going to wear it end and that that's when I started getting
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:14,815	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Little bit distress because I started realizing everyone else thought this was a stupid idea
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:17,631	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	And and I was truly going to be thrown to the wolves
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:21,215	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	The Phillies weren't even promoting the fact that they were getting a new mascot
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:23,263	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	In case the whole thing just
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,031	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Completely backfire
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:30,431	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	They can do like mascot mascot did you see a mascot I didn't say mascot but I was reassured when I first
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:34,015	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	I opened the box and I was blown away with how
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,551	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	How perfect it look
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,623	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	The Phillie Phanatic was born
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:43,231	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	If This Were a superhero movie this would be when the dramatic music comes on
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:46,815	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	But the fanatic is definitely not a comic book superhero
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:54,751	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	It's all green fur like very furry fuzzy fur
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,799	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Very very large and rotund
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:12:01,663	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Pear-shaped body with a huge belly and a kind of a duck butt

EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:06,783	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Perfect you know that's not all make sense
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:12,927	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	No no it doesn't make any sense that the Phillies mascot would be a big googly eyed monster
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:17,535	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	But it turns out that every part of the fanatic is like
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,047	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Omastar

EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:21,119	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	For starters
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:21,887	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	He's green
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:24,447	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Not the standard Phillies red
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,983	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Right exactly
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:27,007	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Police always easy to
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,287	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	To spot The Fanatic in any of these
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:30,079	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	And the Duck Butt
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:36,479	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	And a pear-shaped body no matter how you move in that costume if you're a human being and you put one leg in front of the other
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,759	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	That costume looks funny
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:42,111	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Now when I look at the fanatic it's so clear that there's Muffet DNA
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:45,439	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Even the placement of a cartoon googly eyes
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:48,767	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Is something that Bonnie learned from her time designing Muppets
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:50,815	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	You are asking for all my secrets
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,607	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Well if you put ice

EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,191	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	They will look older
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,983	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	He put them down closer to
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:58,751	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	To the nose
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,799	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	They'll probably look younger and more childlike
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:04,127	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Plus there's other mascot first that she borrowed from the Muppets
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:06,431	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Like she designed the fanatic with licensing
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:07,455	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	In merchandising

EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:12,063	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	And like all the characters
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:14,111	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	The Fanatic even has his own origin
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,927	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	He's supposedly from the Galapagos Islands
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:18,975	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	The Paddock is Goofy
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:23,839	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	You know he rubber ball dude head or rip off the hat of someone cheering for the wrong team
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:25,375	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	And usually he gets away with it
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:29,471	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	It's just damn near impossible to get irate with a fuzzy green thing
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:34,335	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	The one time he did get pummeled by Tommy was sort of the coach of the LA Dodgers
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,615	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	What I had
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,151	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Had it with the fanatic on TuneIn
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:39,455	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	That's the quickest time he's moved all year
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,759	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	We got a Mark that down

EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:54,047	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	And of course that just made the Phillies fans love him even more
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:14:00,447	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Dave Raymond play the Philly Phanatic from that first game in 1978 until 1993
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:03,007	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	He only ever missed five home games
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:08,127	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Now all but three major league baseball teams have mascots and most of them are big

EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:21,695	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	After we did The Fanatic
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:25,791	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	The next one that we were asked to do because of the popularity of the character
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:29,375	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	I was for Montreal for the Expos
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:32,191	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Yep Bonnie Erickson also created you
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:35,519	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	And when I told her about the inordinate amount of a
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:37,055	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Affection my dad had for the mascot
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:42,431	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	She recalled once seeing a big Burly guy coming to the Expo stadium with some up dolls in the shop
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:46,271	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Dieta position them so that they would have their heads
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,039	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Sticking out
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,575	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	As if they couldn't breathe
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:49,343	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	If they fart
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:51,647	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Skip it and I thought that was very touching
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:57,279	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	The mascot still lives in the sort of limbo between the two worlds he's not quite part of the team but not
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:59,327	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	Quite part of the fanbase either
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:01,119	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	I think that's the power for mascot
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:06,495	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	What fan of a team wouldn't want to be able to have that freedom to mock the other team and get a response
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:14,431	| 99pi-0151-lamascotte-1 |	I think a big part of it for my dad was this aspect of living vicariously
