EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:20,031	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	They seem to be selling the story of the haunted house
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,823	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	And of the haunted mrs.
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:24,639	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	In a lot of people seem to be buying it
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,431	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	But not everyone
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:29,247	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	The mythology about her
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,807	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	It's not only insulting to her
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:35,391	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	It's insulting to me as a consumer of
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:36,415	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Popular culture
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,463	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Insults
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	A person's intelligence
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,791	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	That's Mary Jo ignoffo again
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:44,351	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	And she doesn't believe the haunted mrs. Winchester
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:48,703	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	She wrote a book about Sarah Winchester the challenges of the myths
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:52,543	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Sarah herself didn't write a memoir or speak to the prize
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:57,919	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	The Mary Jo did find documents that helped her understand who the real Sarah Winchester may have been
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:02,527	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	There were incredible original sources that hadn't been used by anybody else
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,831	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Letters that she wrote
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,879	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Correspondence with her attorney
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:07,903	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Property records
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:15,071	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	After pouring through documents Mary Jo has come to believe that a lot of the really strange things
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	That we see today and that are emphasized in the mythology about Sarah Winchester
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,471	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Are completely explainable
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:28,383	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	The stairs to Nowhere for example they probably did lead somewhere once rooms were constantly being tweaked and Ramon
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:31,455	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Plus the 1906 earthquake had a major effect
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:33,503	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	There are no original blueprints for the house
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:37,855	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	But we do know that the earthquake destroyed the front of the mansion and the third and fourth story
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,391	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	She felt like
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,439	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	The defects of the house
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,207	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Really
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:45,279	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Came to the fore in the 1960 earthquake
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:50,399	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	And so she kind of was chagrined at her own workmanship that this would happen
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,679	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Instead of rebuilding
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,703	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Sarah had workers
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,751	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Clear away the rubble and make the place safe
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:57,055	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	And then just boarded up the front of the house
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:02,431	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	It's very possible that the stairs led to a room that got destroyed in the quake
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:06,783	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	As for all those thirteens Mary Jo doesn't put a lot of stock in them
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:10,623	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	And she believes that some of them might not be from Sarah Winchester
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:13,183	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Couple of the man who worked on the house
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:19,839	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	They stated in the 1920s that those references to the number 13
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:20,863	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Where added
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,631	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	After her death
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:27,775	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	As to whether Sarah Winchester conducted seances in her supposed Sam's room
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,799	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	It's possible
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:33,919	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Spiritualism in Santa's we're actually fairly common practice in Sarah Winchester's time
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,735	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	But still Mary Jo find it unlikely
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:40,319	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Partly because of the location of the room in the middle of the house
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:46,463	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Anybody who knows about spiritualism or seances know that those are really public
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,231	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Affairs
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:49,535	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Social Affairs at the very least if not
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:51,327	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Public and you would have that in your front
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,095	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Parlor
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:56,703	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Then again Sarah was a very private person so maybe she did her seances alone
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:58,495	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	The ranch Foreman also
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:01,567	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Stated that he had actually stayed in that room and it was
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:02,847	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Not related
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,895	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Spiritual
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:05,919	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Or superstitious
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:12,831	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Events at all and lastly in the popular legend about Sarah Winchester her whole building Endeavor was set in
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:18,975	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Lotion after seeing a medium by the name of Adam Coombs when supposedly put her in touch with her dead husband
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:25,375	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	But Mary Jo gained access to a list of mediums and spiritualists that would have been practicing and New England during

EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:32,543	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	The name that usually associated with having seen Winchester is not there
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:35,359	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	Adam Koontz may never have existed at all
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:38,175	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	There's some things we'll never know about Sarah Winchester
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:43,807	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	But with Mary Jo does feel like we can know for sure is that Sarah wasn't out of touch with reality
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,343	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	On the contrary
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:47,135	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	She was rational and savvy
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:50,463	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	This is a woman's so far ahead of her time in financial math
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,999	| 99pi-0162-mysteryhouse-1 |	And her real estate invest
