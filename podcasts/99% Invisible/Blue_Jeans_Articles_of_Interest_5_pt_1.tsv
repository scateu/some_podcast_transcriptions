EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,112	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Kind of
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:10,880	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Pants
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,160	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And they have a couple Hallmark
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,952	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	For the most part
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:14,720	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	They are blue
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,256	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And they are worn in
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,559	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	They basically look
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:19,327	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Like this
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:20,095	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	This
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:24,191	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	But you're looking at is the oldest pair of blue jeans in the world
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:27,263	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	It dates to about 1879
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,031	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,567	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	This is
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:32,895	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	The blueprint for all blue jeans today
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:35,199	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	World's oldest pair of blue jeans
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:36,479	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	They looked
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,271	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Classic
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:43,903	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Meaning they really don't look very different from the kinds of genes you find in a thrift store today
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:46,207	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	They held up well
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:52,607	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Yes they were patched in a little stained but if I wanted to I could have totally put them on right there and walked out of the
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,375	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	The archive wearing them
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:56,703	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And the security guard would have even noticed because they're still
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,239	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Jeans
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:00,031	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	The differences
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:01,055	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Are subtle
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,591	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	This one only has one pocket
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,359	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	In the back
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:09,503	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	We didn't add the second pocket onto the back until 1901 and here's a really cool thing about
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:14,879	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	But most of our clothes we try to keep them pretty pristine and avoid spills and rips and tears
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:21,535	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Denim so hard wearing and hardworking I just kind of a mess as more and more signs of wear
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:24,863	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	You can just text a pair of old jeans like an archaeologist
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:27,679	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	You can actually see how someone walked
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:32,543	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	You'll see all of this where this honeycombing as we call it
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,847	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	That's simply wear and tear from
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,895	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Keep all the men who were wearing it
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:37,919	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And we think
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:42,527	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	That there were as many as three men who wore this
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,295	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	This particular
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:46,367	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	You can tell by looking at the Impressions on the knees

EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,671	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Go up and down is several
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,439	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Places
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,975	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Because they are in several
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:51,487	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Locations
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:52,511	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	We know the sea

EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:58,911	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	They get passed around they were sturdy enough that you could do that
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:00,703	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Which is kind of romantic writer
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:02,495	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Because this is

EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:19,135	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	But the jeans you and I wear today may look like those original Levi's

EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,575	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Are true color
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,671	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Sew denim with around
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,439	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Levi Strauss
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:57,023	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And blue denim trousers were around before Levi Strauss
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:00,095	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	But here is what Levi Strauss did
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,375	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	That made the blue jean
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:03,935	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	He patented the rivet
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:04,703	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	On the pocket
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:11,359	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	The innovation of the rivets is that you could take at a little tiny piece of metal atom to the pockets
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:15,199	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And they became much stronger so if you're putting your hands in your pockets
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,223	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	They're not going to chair
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:18,271	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	The rivets were the big selling point
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:20,319	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Not necessarily the denim
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:24,671	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And when they use denim it wasn't always necessarily blue
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:26,463	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	It doesn't have to be
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:28,255	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Blue is just tradition
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,303	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Denim can be any color
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:34,911	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Lynn Downey is a biographer of Levi Strauss and the former Levi's corporate historian
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:35,679	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Before Tracy
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:38,751	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Over the years the company did make blue and gold denim products
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,079	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Red and white
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,615	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	But
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,639	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	It was indigo
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:45,919	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Indigo blue
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,455	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Dyed thread
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,247	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	That was
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:50,015	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Easiest
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:53,855	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	That seems seem to last the longest and people just gravitate
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:58,463	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	It's hard to explain why humans are so attracted to Indigo
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:01,791	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Historically the dye had massive power
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:05,119	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Indigo used to be very rare and expensive
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:10,239	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Especially since that process of dying is so special and magical
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:14,847	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Blue was a symbol of status and or wealth all over the world
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:21,503	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Indigo has its roots in India and its name and variance grow in Vietnam in West Africa
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:23,551	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Anywhere where it's humid
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,599	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Humidity
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,367	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Humidity
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:28,415	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	The same conditions as rice
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:30,207	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	So Indigo was also able to
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:30,719	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	The drive
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,511	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	In South Carolina
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:34,559	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Indigo had first been cultivated
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:36,863	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	In the United States and
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:40,703	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	1740s by a woman oh by the way Eliza Pinckney
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,239	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Really a girl
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:44,543	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	She was 16 years old born in Antigua
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:49,151	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And her family then had plantations in South Carolina and she and her family moved there
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:50,943	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And her father has sent her some Indigo Seas
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,991	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	From the Caribbean and she thought
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:53,759	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Let's try this
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:57,855	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	She was able to cultivate enough Indigo to make it a cash crop
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:02,207	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	American Indigo have kind of a cool feminist success story
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:03,743	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	But
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,279	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	When Indigo became a cash crop
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,815	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	If you can master
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:07,583	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Produced
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:12,191	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And so that labor-intensive magical process of making indigo
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,471	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Scaled-up
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,519	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	With slave labor
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:18,335	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And I can just imagine the slaves and
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:24,735	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	The women especially or are stirring these Indigo Vats they were processing this die
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:31,135	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And their hands are blue before the American Revolution before cotton became king
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:35,743	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Indigo was the second largest cash crop in the colonies after rice
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:42,143	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Indigo plantations all across the South and some of them lasted well into the Civil War
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:48,543	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Virginia South Carolina for sure the story takes place in Georgia this is an Mass Eye and she has this amazing
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:51,103	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Using story about her grandfather's grandfather
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:57,503	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Who was born as a slave on an Indigo Plantation his name is John John Henry
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:03,903	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And it was very common for them to swaddle the babies in the blue cloth so when baby John was born
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:06,463	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	His parents decided to escape
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:10,559	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Play wrapped baby John and indigo and headed north
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,351	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	They crept through the underbrush
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:15,167	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Creeping their way up about an hour after they set out
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:22,079	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Their dogs barking in the distance and the screaming of the voices if they recognized was the overseer so they ran
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:28,479	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	They found a place to hide the secret of themselves and baby John started to whipper and fuss
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:34,879	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Somebody came over and it was investigating this noise was the overseer he
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:37,439	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Look down just as the moon came out
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:44,607	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And the baby John jump them screamed out and suddenly the overseer ran away like
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:51,007	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Yankees are the union Army's uniforms
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,543	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Girl get out the blues are here
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:56,639	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	He saw a baby John swaddled in the blue cloth
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,919	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	The Indigo cloth
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:02,271	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And the overseer thought that that was a Yankee and his blue car
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,831	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Hiding and they are going to be
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:05,855	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Ambushing this
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,647	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And they got out
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:13,535	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	This story that Anne has is a rare one passed from generation to generation
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:14,815	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:18,655	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Hearing about an Indigo Plantation nestled in the Land of Cotton
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,167	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Plantations
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:21,727	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Centos add ready-made symbolism
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,799	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Because cotton and indigo
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:26,847	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Go really well together
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,615	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Cotton gloves
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:29,919	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	The cotton reel
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,943	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Loved soaking up
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,479	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And this
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:35,295	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	According to Lynn Downey is part of why jeans are blue
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:39,903	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Not only was Indigo a beautiful color that humans have always been attracted to
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:43,231	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	It was the color that could cling to fabric best
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:46,815	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And it was a color that was very present in the United States
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:48,607	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And it was relatively easy to
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:52,959	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Procure the time
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,007	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	There was a system in place
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:58,591	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	For textile manufacturers to get their indigo
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:01,919	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And this is where our idea of blue jean kind of got
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:03,199	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Frozen in Time
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,991	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Need to last forever
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,527	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	100% cotton
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,319	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	100% indigo
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:10,111	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Are jeans still made with
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:12,159	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Actual natural indigo
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:12,927	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Not
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:14,463	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Really big lines of them know
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:16,511	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Indigo's magic concoction is
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:23,423	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Too fickle and expensive and complicated for a massive industrial-scale most
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:28,543	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Synthetic Indigo synthetic indigo is not without its own kind of Cruelty
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:33,407	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	It's often made with petroleum mixed with heavy metals and other chemicals
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,943	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	I got the chemicals that is used

EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:55,679	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And it's runoff chemical water gets disposed of in the rivers and basically poisons them
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:58,239	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	The thing is that the waters might be Juiced
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,007	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	For the

EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:55,615	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	It's plastic
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:19:00,735	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	This is as much applicable to Denim as any other part of the industry

EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:09,439	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	We've never had so many clothes available with so much
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:09,951	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Plastic
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:11,999	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And no one knows what

EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,703	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Plastic Stone Age well
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:24,287	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And we don't see it because we throw it out before we see it at that
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:27,359	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	In the future our genes

EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:35,807	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Like those jeans in the Levi's archive
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:38,879	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	This is what people need to realize plastic
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:43,231	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Sometimes age in such a way that they are attempting to go back

EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:46,047	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Or they want to go back to a liquid
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:50,399	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	So that means that if you feel your sneaker sold

EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:57,055	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Rid of it because it is
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,639	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	What we would call
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:04,479	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Weeping other terminology it's going back to its liquid state
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:07,039	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	It's toxic you don't want to touch it
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:09,087	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Same with something if you keep

EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:15,743	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Or a tupperware container you never know in

EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:20,095	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Drawer so you don't open it for years
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:21,631	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And then you open it and you find shark
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:23,679	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	It means it explode
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:27,007	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	It literally combusted at some point and you will smell it
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:29,567	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	These things are giving off noxious.
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:35,967	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And again we don't tend to see this because we see plastic is disposable but that's what this stuff is doing in
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:36,735	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	These landfill
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:40,319	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And the vast majority of clothes do end up in landfills

EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:10,527	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Denim is easily isolated from the rest
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,295	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Of the clothing industry
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:12,831	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Because
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:13,599	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	It is
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:14,111	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	So

EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:24,096	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	So when you have numbers

EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:37,920	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	What it took to

EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,808	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	In examining genes
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:48,416	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	You realize that it's nearly impossible to create a morally perfect

EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:52,512	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	At least one that's affordable
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:54,048	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Redo

EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:08,640	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	What are those priorities are local labor some people are all about local
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:12,736	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Are natural fibers not using pesticides or chemicals or comfort

EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:20,928	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	The reality out there in the world
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:24,000	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	That's very difficult or nearly in
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:24,512	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Impossible
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:27,072	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	So I think what people should do
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,864	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Who are listening is that they should
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:30,656	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	Pick what's most important to them
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:32,704	| Blue_Jeans_Articles_of_Interest_5_pt_1 |	And your dollar is the vote UK
