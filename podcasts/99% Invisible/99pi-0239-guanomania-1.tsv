EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:45,215	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	This is all happening
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:47,519	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	Against the backdrop of European Colonial

EDL	00:09:56,991	00:10:03,135	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	The United States had taken over much of North America and violently stole territory from indigenous people

EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,287	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	So the United States
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:22,335	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	Did that and has always conceived
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,127	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	Of itself as

EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,223	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	And distinguished itself

EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:39,743	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	And so even though in the case of the guano Islands they're talking about cleaning uninhabited rocks
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:43,583	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	Some Senators think that this looks a little too close to colonialism

EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,543	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	So

EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:56,383	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	As the Senate goes to a series of drafts

EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:05,087	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	Describe is not as part of the territory of the United States or subject to the sovereignty of the United States those words drop
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:08,415	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	About they are described as appertaining

EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:10,719	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	It states as in
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:13,023	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	A sort of fancy old fashioned way of saying
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,559	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	Belonging to

EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:20,959	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	I think about that word was that at the time no one really knew what it meant from a legal perspective
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:23,775	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	But it was softer than saying we own this
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,055	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	The towers
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:27,103	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	The Senators also included in abandoned

EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:37,983	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	As a justification for creating this

EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:43,615	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	And went on to say that these new territories were

EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:04,607	| 99pi-0239-guanomania-1 |	They're never quite sure what you know all we know is this is the way of kind of holding a place at arm's length while still controlling it
