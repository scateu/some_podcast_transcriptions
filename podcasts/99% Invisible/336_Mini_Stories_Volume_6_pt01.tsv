EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:54,848	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Exactly
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:56,640	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The point
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:58,688	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is that regardless of what's Happening
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,968	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	In film
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,784	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	All of these Ali scenes help

EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:04,832	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is on the same eye
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,928	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But New York is a city of
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:09,440	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Thousand
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:11,232	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Each with its own
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,560	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	This one time from
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:15,584	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Which is better
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,120	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	There are no
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:22,496	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	They can't be true it's hard to wrap your mind around because we've all been
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:25,312	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Raised on this myth that New York has
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:27,616	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And there are some in the Attleboro
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:29,408	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But like if you spent time in
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:32,736	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And you really search your memory you will not remember
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:36,576	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	At least not like a classic Ali
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,856	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Between two Street
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:40,672	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	At the fire usually maybe at Beth like it was like a glorified
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:46,816	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Right right I can't specifically remember when you're right but that seems amazing to me
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:52,960	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Do I think there is
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,496	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And then why aren't there
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:56,800	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is there a question
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:59,104	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Right right what's up what's the first why aren't
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,128	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And this is because
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:03,968	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	When the city planners laid out the grid for Manhattan North
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:04,736	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Houston Street in
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:06,272	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	1811 and something called
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,296	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Commissioners plan
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,856	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	They purposely did not include out
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:13,440	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	They figured that they didn't meet Ali's cuz I got the high frequency
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:14,464	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	East west
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,256	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	You're much closer to
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:18,047	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Gather to each other in the north-south streets
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,351	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Kind of obviated the need for
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:20,863	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Shortcuts
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,655	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Or anything else that might break up
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:24,191	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	They're wonderful
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:30,079	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But also and this is probably the real motivation it was a way to maximize
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:33,919	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Because this way without any Ally cutting through the blocks
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,735	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Badlanders can squeezing more housing
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:37,503	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	In Orlando
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:41,343	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And after that almost no alleys were built because
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:43,647	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Why on an ally when you can own a large
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:47,487	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And so the result is that today Manhattan
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:49,791	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Best a dozen things you might call Ali
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,559	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Weather all
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:51,327	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	South Canal
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,863	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Oldest part of the
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,191	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	That's amazing
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:58,495	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	We know that you mention it
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:01,055	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The thing I noticed the most when I'm walking in the streets of New York
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:03,615	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is the piles and piles of trash
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:04,127	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Which
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,919	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	When I live in Chicago
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,199	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	That's putting me out
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,223	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	That is not on there
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:08,991	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Streak
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:09,759	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Chicago is like
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,295	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The antithesis
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,063	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Chicago
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,855	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Mm
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,647	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And it said it's so cute to the egg
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:19,743	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But you know
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:23,583	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's weird people don't put this together including
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:24,863	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	New York
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,519	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	One of my favorite things to do is
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,543	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Just like I always asked
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,079	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	People
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:35,871	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	When was the last time you remember
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:38,175	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Thanks I'm going to get somewhere
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,711	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The quickest way to get there would be
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:40,479	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Did you take the alley shortcut
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,783	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's not it's not a thing
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,855	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's only when you pointed out to them that they kind of step back and go
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:50,207	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So this is Nick car and he's a film locations
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:50,975	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Route to work
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:51,743	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	In New York for many years
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,047	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	What's the world

EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:06,591	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Ve got another New York
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:10,431	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	When your television shows turned into a movie
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:16,575	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And he says disbelief that New York has alleys
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:17,855	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is like the bane of his

EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:44,127	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And yet it's
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:46,431	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So I can pick up such a degree that if you walked
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:46,943	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Buy it
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,991	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	You weren't actually notice it
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,271	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Because it would feel
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,575	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So intensely
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:56,927	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It was like you've been there you know like even if you'd never sets wooden

EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:02,815	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So I'm pretty sure that whatever the first time I said
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:05,119	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I walk down that alley it might as well have been like
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:07,167	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The hundredth time I walk down that alley
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:09,983	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But you're looking to get especially weird because
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:16,639	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The reason Cortland looks like the platonic ideal of a New York Ali is precisely because it's been used in Soma

EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:36,351	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Because when a director has location of mine
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,143	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He has created the perfect location
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:41,983	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And no location you ever find will ever match up to what it is right
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:43,775	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Portland is what you picture

EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,039	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	TV shows and then go and
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:57,087	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	What are we created when they do their own filming
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,647	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Sad truth is that

EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:11,423	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	All it's used for is filming by
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:11,935	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Basically
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,471	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Everyone always

EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,743	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Like even the one Ally

EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:42,911	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Doesn't really function as an ally it's basically a film set
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,447	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Hollywood
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,983	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The degree to which it's like
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,287	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Treated as a film set in Hollywood zeal

EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,663	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Like a story often calls for an ally to be like
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:54,687	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Double trash
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:58,783	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Concept
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:04,927	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Of course real trash and grime would be hazardous to the cast and crew of the first thing they do is actually clean
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,463	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Would like pressure hoses
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,231	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Disappoint
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,279	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And then
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,047	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Yuan
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,327	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Buy movie trash

EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,911	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Large plastic bags like trash bags
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:17,215	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	That are filled with
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:17,983	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Approved
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,007	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Logo
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:21,823	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Sort of trash so it's like generic milk bottles
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,591	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And cereal boxes
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,919	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Each bag of movie trash is about 40 to 6
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,943	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	$60 a bag
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,479	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So there's an industry just
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:31,295	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Mally's look like look like Ali
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,343	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	What kind of interest me about all this
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,647	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is it I think with
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,415	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Some cities
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,463	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	We don't really know much about
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,767	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So they can
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:41,535	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	There might be like
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:45,631	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Shades about San Francisco Chicago but no one outside of
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,911	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Francisco like truly things
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,215	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But New York
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,983	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Perhaps more than
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:50,751	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Any other City
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,799	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	In some sense it belongs
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,591	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Everyone feels
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:55,615	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The thing
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:59,199	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Right because they seen it in a million movies
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,735	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It is like
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,015	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	American city
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:02,783	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	How many people
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,575	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is the city
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:08,415	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Level granularity
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,183	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Uptown
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:10,975	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Downtown
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,559	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Like like there are more like
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,095	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Household name
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,655	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Totally
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,679	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Now that makes sense
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:22,495	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's also kind of like you know but they don't
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:26,079	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And the result is that at some point the idea of New York
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:30,943	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	As overtaken the reality of New York kind of takes cultural precedent
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,735	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Human Mind of a lot of York
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,247	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Crazy never rely
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:38,367	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's just sad because it's almost like an actor that's Typecast
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,671	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Right looks like an actor that's being asked
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:46,559	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Play the same old roll cuz he did that one roll really really well back in 1977 so keep doing it for another
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,327	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	50 years

EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:29,215	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	His name is Daisuke anyway
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:29,983	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:33,311	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	As you can imagine he loves music
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:36,127	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I read this interview with him and I found out that
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:39,455	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He started working as a drummer when he was still a teenager in high
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:44,319	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	School and after he graduated he was perpetually in a Travelin Band that did Cabaret music
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:45,855	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	9 years
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:48,927	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And I think that's a really big achievement but
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,719	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Hey in his interview he likes to
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,535	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Zoe says
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,839	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	One night I realized that
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:57,119	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	No matter how much I practice
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:00,447	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I could never be as good as someone with god-given Talent
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:06,847	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And I was enough to change my life as a band man and after nine years on the road
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:10,175	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Many tails and no regrets I want home it seems like
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:13,247	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It was more than just his musicianship that
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:14,783	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Took him out of Road life like it seems like
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:17,599	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It wasn't really compensated fairly all the time and
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:20,415	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	People he was working with like there
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:24,511	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Really they partied a lot and they drinking all their money away
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,279	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	ISO
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,303	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He was 28
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:28,351	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And living with his parents in Kobe Japan
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:29,375	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	After all that
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:31,679	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	1968
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:37,823	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Karaoke is kind of already like a social activity but it's done with live instruments so
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:38,847	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	They're like bars where
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:44,223	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	You have like a musician playing a single guitar or keyboard or something and people singing along
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:50,367	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And this was one of those kids regular gigs when he was living there with
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:50,879	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Parents
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,159	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And he says
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:53,439	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Playing the drums

EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,399	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Humblebrag
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:06,751	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Because then he says because then he goes on to say that
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:09,823	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Cute like but everytime I try to learn more than 300 songs
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:13,919	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I like I just would forget them all the time mixing them up
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:20,575	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Wow so yeah that case is pretty down on himself okay
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:24,415	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So he's working at these karaoke bars
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:25,439	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:28,511	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He's got like a bunch of regular karaoke singers and

EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:37,727	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The kind of changed everything this businessman was about to travel for work and he wanted to be able to sing for his colleagues on the trip
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:40,287	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And I say recalled the business man saying to him
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:43,615	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Your keyboard playing is the only music I can sing to
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:45,919	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	You know how my voice is and you know what it needs

EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:05,535	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So the music on these first 8-track tapes were they the ones that
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:08,607	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Did did he compose those or how did he how did he get the music
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,399	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So they were
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,703	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	They were popular songs and the
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:14,751	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Thanksgiving recorded them with his band
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,799	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Actually I guess
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,591	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He recorded his
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:22,687	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Band playing the songs he says that early on in the process they fired him from playing
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:30,367	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Again poured a skateboard
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:32,927	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So he just focused on recording and mixing the music
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:38,047	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Which is really important part totally totally
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:39,583	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	No karaoke machine
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:42,399	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Recording and mixing thank you Sharif
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:50,591	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And it's funny to me because even though it was fired from his own van he was
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:52,127	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	A real Hustler
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:55,711	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He got bars all over, to lease these machines from him
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:58,783	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He got contracts with major record labels to use all these Poppy

EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:05,695	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He didn't patent the machine no
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,207	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He says
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,743	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	When I first made the Jew Gates
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:10,559	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	A brother-in-law suggested I take out a patent
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:11,839	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But at the time
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:16,703	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I didn't think anything would come of it I was just hoping the drinking places in the Cobra area
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:18,495	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Use my machine
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:20,287	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Most people don't believe me when I say this
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:23,615	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I don't think karaoke would have taken off like
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:26,175	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	If there had been a patent on the first machine
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:28,735	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I think that's actually a pretty fair
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,247	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Assessment
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:33,343	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	You know it's a really nice and joyful thing even though I've never
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:39,487	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	This machine is really really lovely in it
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:40,767	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is it nice to think of it
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:43,839	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is it just existing in the world to make the world better and not necessarily to make
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:45,631	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But money
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:48,447	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It does make some people money
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:49,983	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	This other person
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:52,799	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Did take out a patent on a LaserDisc karaoke machine
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,103	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But he's not part of the
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,127	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Right now
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:58,431	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I know that's right amount of History yeah
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,479	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Ozon
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:07,135	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Besides I didn't build the thing from scratch the amp the microphone the 8-track player even the hundred Yen box machine all had
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:14,815	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	You think so yeah I don't know anything about that
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:17,375	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	About Patton especially Japanese patent law
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:21,727	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Well I don't know about dabbing patamon actually I'm no expert of US patent law but
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,519	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	If you come up with
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,799	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	A new use
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:26,079	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Or even own thing
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:28,639	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And prescribed that you since I have the patent
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:31,967	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It doesn't have to be three machines that could be one machine to do a search
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:34,015	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	A little something and change it
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,319	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He totally had the right to it
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:43,999	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So this is just more of him talking smack on himself I really love about this story on a whole is that he seems
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,791	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Pretty okay with how all of this turned out
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,839	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He talks a lot about
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,351	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Just like
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,143	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	How glad he is
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:53,471	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is that this brought so much joy into the world and he says
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:20:00,127	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I may not have the original patent some say I would have made 80 million dollars last year and that was a bad year
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:03,711	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But I have good friends and a family I love
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:05,759	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And I can't help but smile everyday
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:08,063	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	There were things some uppers
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:09,343	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Yeah I guess the last thing
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,111	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I just wanted to
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,391	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Say that
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,159	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Daisuke says
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:14,463	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	To honor karaoke
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:17,023	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And his wife and daughter and three granddaughters
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:19,071	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Get out of song book once a week
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:20,607	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,911	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	See who can sing the most
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:27,263	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Songs before going horse with
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:27,775	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Sounds
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:34,687	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So crazy that's a way harder than I want to party
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:37,503	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And yeah and there's more to his story
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:41,599	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But I think it's better told from him so we'll put a link to that on our website
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,367	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Nice
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:42,879	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Alright then
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:46,975	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And we should totally go karaoking sometime I think we could make that
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:47,999	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Text
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:21:02,335	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	About a year ago our senior editor Delaney Hall move from beautiful Downtown Oakland California back to New Mexico or she
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:08,479	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	She grew up she now works for 99p I remotely and her mini story is about this phenomenon in the new city where she live
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:09,759	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Santa Fe
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:12,063	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The phenomenon is called
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,087	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Zozobra
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:16,928	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Does Oprah is a big deal here in Santa Fe
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:17,952	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Basically
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,976	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Every year
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:21,024	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	A group of people in the city build
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:23,072	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	This enormous marionette
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:23,840	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	That's named
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:24,864	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Sosobra
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:28,704	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And in Spanish is over that means anxiety
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:29,984	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So he's like
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:33,568	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	All of the city's Collective sorrows
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:34,592	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Embodied in this
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:39,968	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Wow
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:42,016	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	That's amazing so what is he what does he look like
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,320	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	50 ft tall
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:47,392	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	She is dressed in a long white
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:52,000	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He has he's very dark Angry Eyes they're usually
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:53,024	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Rimmed
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:55,328	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Green or black
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:57,888	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And what happens is that
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:59,424	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Every fall.
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:02,752	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	This group constructs a new Zozobra and about 50
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:04,032	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	50000 people
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,312	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Gathering one of Santa Fe
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:05,824	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is biggest parks
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:13,504	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Wow they burn them yeah yeah they it's a very
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:15,296	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's a very intense
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:19,904	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Kind of pig feeling events
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,440	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I mean basically the crowd chant
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:27,328	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Burnham Burnham Burnham and he's he's set on fire and he is
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,864	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Slowly engulfed in flame
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:35,264	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And I assume they burn him so they can burn their Collective anxiety that he represents
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:36,800	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Yeah yeah exactly

EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:41,664	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's this way that the
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,432	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The city
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:43,200	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Purges
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:43,712	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Sadness
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:46,528	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:48,576	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	People get to participate in these interesting ways
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,624	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And one of the reasons
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:51,648	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Sosobrat is
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:53,696	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The flammable is that he is
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,208	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Stuffed with
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,256	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Bushels of shredded
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,304	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And where that

EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,376	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Leading up to the burning

EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:15,456	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Which at least in the past has been located
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:16,736	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	In the office
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:17,248	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	This Is Us
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:18,784	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	One of the local news
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,576	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Papers that people contribute
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,344	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Police reports
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:23,904	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Mortgage documents
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,792	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It reminds me of other Thrift
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:32,096	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Bonfire rituals like
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:34,912	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Like burning man or something with a lot of people go to around here
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:37,728	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Yeah I mean it's a soda has been around a lot
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,264	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Longer than Burning Man
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,032	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Turn around since the 90
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,616	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	There are definitely some similarities like
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,408	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Those were developed by
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:48,480	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Artists both events began relatively
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:50,528	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Small like in someone's backyard around him
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:53,600	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And then grew into something much
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:57,184	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Bigger and I'm both actually drawn other Traditions they go back
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,208	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Even farther
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:00,512	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But one thing that's
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:02,304	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Pretty neat about Cisco bat is that
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:04,352	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Because he's a puppet
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,144	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Capable of
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,960	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Kind of rudimentary movement so
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:13,056	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Arm swing around his jaw is hinged
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:15,616	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So his mouth opens and closes
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:17,664	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And he also makes
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:18,432	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Sound
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:20,224	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So I'm going to play
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:26,368	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	A little bit of sound of the event so you can hear it
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:35,584	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Flailing at the same time
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:36,608	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Yashow
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:41,216	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Wailing his mouth is opening and closing
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:45,056	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's really it's actually really troubling event
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:46,080	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	To go to as a
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:49,664	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Kid it is sort of seared into my memory
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:52,992	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	This is actually like the thing I most want to tell you about the
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:54,016	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Because I
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:56,832	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I recently learned just in the past year or so
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:25:00,928	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	That the voice of Zozobra is performed live
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:06,560	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And there is one guy who's been doing the voice for about 20 years
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:10,400	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And I learned this thanks to
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:13,216	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	This Gem of local reporting from
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:13,984	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Koe tea

EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:23,456	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The character that I get into
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:25,248	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	This

EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:48,800	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Just hope his voice battles several emotions

EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:59,552	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I'm not going to let you do this to me again

EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:15,168	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The big night is always exciting
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:16,704	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I'll sit down and have a sandwich
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,472	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Dictionary after
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:19,776	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	After that
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:20,544	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I've got butterflies
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:22,848	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I won't have it
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,128	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Until after it's all over
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:25,408	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	On Friday night
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:27,200	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Those butterflies join all of him
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:28,480	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Gloom
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:28,992	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Vinsmoke
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:30,528	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Yeah I just
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:36,672	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I love this news clip so much I think it's one of my my favorites ever and
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:42,304	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is the combination of the reporters seriousness or maybe Mox
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:44,864	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Serious Mass and then just like
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:50,752	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The sublime Ridiculousness of what you're seeing which of course people can't see it but
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,288	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	To describe it
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:54,080	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's Michael Ellis
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,872	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The voice of Sombra
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:58,432	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Performing the sounds of Zelda butt
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,200	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	To this big
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:01,248	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Empty baseball
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:01,760	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Field
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:06,112	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Which you know probably later in the night will be filled with 50
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:06,880	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	3006
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:08,160	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	50000 screaming people but
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:10,720	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But at the moment is just entirely
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:15,072	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So good
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:19,680	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So you get like a little taste of what my glass is about but what is he really like
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,728	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Yasso
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:24,800	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	This was the only thing I could find on the internet
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:25,312	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	About him
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:29,152	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And from seeing this clip I definitely wanted to learn
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:32,736	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And so I looked him up and went to
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:33,248	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	To talk with him
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,552	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And what
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:37,600	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	What I learned is that he was
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:38,624	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Born and raised in San
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:41,440	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And Michael told me that
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,976	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	You know Isaac
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:43,488	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Kid
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,024	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So silver was like this
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:46,048	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Figure this monster
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:49,120	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Almost seemed real life
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:51,680	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	5 +
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:54,496	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	That sense of realness was this thing
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:56,288	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	That the community
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:58,080	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Continues to really play into
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:27:59,616	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Cultivate
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:00,896	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Throwing up bile
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,408	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I remember
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:02,944	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Belittle stories
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:07,296	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Newspaper talking about how sober has been spotted
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:09,856	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	In the Royals in the east side of town
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:12,416	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	You would hear stories of
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,184	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	She
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:13,696	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Being missing
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:14,976	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The area
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,512	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Things like that
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,560	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Play into
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:19,584	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Trying to make
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,376	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Seem real
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:24,448	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And so from there how did Michael actually become the boys
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:25,216	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Does Oprah
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:27,008	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So as a high-schooler
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:28,288	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He started volunteering for
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,848	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	She would help with
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:31,872	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Building the puppet
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:34,432	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Like that and he just kept being involved
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:35,456	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	A little more each year
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:37,760	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Eventually
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:38,528	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He was asked
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:39,808	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Asked if you wanted to help with the voice
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:44,928	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I was just sort of a matter of hanging around for long enough
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:51,072	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And so did Michael do it any differently that he had something special to the voice when he took over
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:54,400	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Michael didn't have any formal voice acting experience he's
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:56,960	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He's done various jobs throughout his life
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:29:00,032	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Including working at Lowe's hardware
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:01,824	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Running a DJ business
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:06,944	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But he told me that the main thing he wanted to bring to soba was that sense of real
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:07,968	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	That kind of alive
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:09,248	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But I was
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:09,760	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Talking about Earl
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:12,064	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:12,832	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	To do that
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:15,392	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He said he had to find ways to really emphasize
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:20,000	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Which celebrity has grumpy old man and to see the whole event
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:21,024	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Unfolding from
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:22,816	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	His perspective
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:23,840	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Knowing that
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:26,400	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Everybody wants his demise
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:28,704	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	They want to see it happen
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:30,240	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So I
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:31,264	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I do my best
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:31,776	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	To try to
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:33,056	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	To fight
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:34,336	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	With
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:35,872	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	You know with my voice
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:39,200	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	There are times when
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:41,504	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Almost sound like
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:43,040	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Scrying
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:51,488	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He's going to be able to do to stop it
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:55,840	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Of course in our conversation and I was like pushing to try to understand is there some
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:59,936	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Salumi memory or
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:00,448	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Experience
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:03,264	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Did Michael Taps into in order to
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:03,776	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Perform
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:06,336	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I asked him about his personal
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,104	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	History
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:10,944	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I asked him about some health problems he's had recently
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:12,736	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But he said
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,272	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Not really
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:17,600	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	When it's needed
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:21,184	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	You just got the red Aaliyah
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:23,232	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Accessible grumpy old man right there
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,536	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I guess
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:27,840	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	APS a little bit of that deep inside
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:30,912	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So that's
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:37,312	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	That's the voice of Sabrina and I I really like thinking about the fact that when I went to see so so but I burn
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:38,336	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Back in the 80s
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:41,664	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It was Michael performing The Voice
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,688	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Tell me if I take
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:43,968	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	If I take
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:44,736	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Fiona Ma
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:47,040	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	My daughter next year that it will probably be me
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:57,536	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Up next is our technical producer
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:58,560	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Sharif Youssef
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:03,680	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	All right
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:05,472	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's a Roman if I told you
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:08,032	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	That I had another Maps
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:08,544	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Story
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,104	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	How excited would you be
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:17,504	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Okay cool if you can Master it all I know maybe
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:18,528	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I made it here
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:20,320	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Just go to Google Maps real quick
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:27,488	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The main thing we're going to be looking at today is the border between the u.s. and Canada and pardon my eyes
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:32,352	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Siblings I have some dental work
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:34,400	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And I think we need to pay attention to his
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:37,984	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	49th parallel in the Pacific Northwest of America
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:40,800	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I'm so glad that you're okay
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:41,568	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Yeah and you can like
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:43,104	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Probably
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:46,432	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Maybe now can notice a little something that looks off
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:49,504	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Are you talking about Point Roberts
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,040	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Sticks out right here
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:51,808	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:55,136	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Point Roberts on that little peninsula
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:56,672	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Tsawwassen peninsula
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:32:00,000	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Maybe you can just sort of describe what you're seeing
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:02,304	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:04,864	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Robertson Upper Peninsula off of
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:07,168	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Bay Area Vancouver
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:09,728	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It looks like it's completely cut off from the US
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,520	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Except by water
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:14,592	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	You have to buy land you have to get to it
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:15,872	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	To Canada
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:17,152	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's got a few
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:18,688	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Very very gritted
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,200	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Streets
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:27,136	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	A couple
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:29,440	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It is kind of like an exclave
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:30,976	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But but not
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:34,560	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Yeah it's it's a it's a it's a semi
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:35,328	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Exclusives
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:39,936	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Space but it is difficult to get into so innocent exclusive
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,776	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So yeah
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:46,592	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Point Roberts is actually in Washington State
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:48,384	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Heart of Whatcom County
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:50,432	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I first heard about Point Roberts
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,712	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Scrum podcast

EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:07,840	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Cuz it's only 20 miles away or so in order to pick up packages because
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:11,680	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Shipping across the border is actually quite expensive
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:13,472	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I'm and also to get cheaper gas
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:16,544	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's also rumored to be the site of
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:19,360	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Federal witness protection program
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:20,896	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Like where they relocate
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:27,296	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And I just happened to be in Seattle a little bit ago and I also wanted an excuse to go to
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:31,904	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Vancouver and how do you pay for it so I decided to go

EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:33,952	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Border
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:37,024	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Crossing my first board
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:39,328	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	This is the Peace Arch border
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,376	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	From Washington signature
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:42,656	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Exactly

EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:53,920	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Border crossings to get to

EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:05,952	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I think there's a there's an instinct that arises in every Arab
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:08,256	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Crossing a border
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:13,376	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Also funny story the last time I crossed the Canadian border
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:14,144	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I was
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:19,008	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Three or four years old going into the American side of Niagara Falls
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:21,312	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And the Border guide
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:22,848	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	LinkedIn was like
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:24,896	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is everyone in this car American
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:29,760	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And it has like I'm Egyptian she's American and
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:33,600	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He's American in the back and I don't know I'm French I'm being kidnapped
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:39,488	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Oh my God there's there's some decent ROM around the Canadian border
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:42,048	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I'm sorry if I was a little

EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:05,600	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Border crossing guard
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:10,976	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Did ask if I had been arrested which apparently is a thing like if you've been arrested you
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:11,744	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Can't
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:12,768	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	You have to get like
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:17,120	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Special permission to get into Canada if you have a criminal record in the states
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:23,776	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's another 20 or 30 minute drive to border number to welcome to Little America
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:25,056	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I just crossed the
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:26,336	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Border entry point
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:27,872	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Scenic Loop
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:28,384	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Gateway
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:31,200	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	That sounds like something I would do
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:31,968	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	I like seeing it
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:39,904	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And I basically immediately to my right after I cross the border there's a place that receives
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,952	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Packages open 24/7
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:45,280	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Automated retriever
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:48,864	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Vacuum Brew Coffee Parcel Services
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:50,400	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It seems like there are a lot of places

EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:41,343	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Michigan Central Station
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:48,255	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It was like a big train stations were like Grand Central Terminal type train station
EDL	00:44:48,255	00:44:49,279	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Central
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:51,327	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Much taller in downtown Detroit
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:56,191	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Yeah it's really visible when you're coming in on the highway it's in like one of the most visible
EDL	00:44:56,191	00:44:57,471	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Tallest structures on the side of the Sun
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:00,543	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Baste still in Detroit
EDL	00:45:00,543	00:45:01,055	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Bought this
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:06,943	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And suddenly there is all this news around the fact that they're going to come out do this big press conference
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:11,295	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And explain to the city what their plan was for this old building that have been
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:12,575	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Deserted for so long
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:14,623	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Big press conference
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:16,159	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Someone anonymously approach
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:17,439	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The Ford Museum
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:18,207	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	With this
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:18,975	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Surprising artifact
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:25,375	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It was this big round antique clock that used to hang really prominently on one of the walls of the station
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:26,655	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Let's face it
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:28,959	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Train passengers needed to know the time
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:29,727	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Show the clock
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:31,007	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Puge
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:33,823	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's been gone for very long time
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:36,383	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	He couldn't believe it when a secret approach with me
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:37,919	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	To get that clock back
EDL	00:45:38,431	00:45:42,271	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Somebody must have really loved it and loved the train station cuz I took very good care of it
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:47,135	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So somebody stole this gigantic clock from the train station and then they returned it when they heard
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:48,671	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	That the transition can be renovated
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:55,071	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Yeah it's pretty remarkable and we don't really know much about the person who returned the clock and then maybe they just took it
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:58,143	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Get to try to help preserve it maybe they were in the original Thief
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:05,055	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's possible they bought it or found it on eBay or inherited it only really know for sure is that
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:06,335	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	They carefully wrapped it up
EDL	00:46:06,335	00:46:09,151	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And then told the folks at the Ford Museum where to find it
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:13,503	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Play me where to buy it like they left it somewhere and they like
EDL	00:46:13,503	00:46:18,879	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Like along side of the side of a building their pictures of this you can see it like he just kind of wrapped it up in like
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:25,279	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Strapped it in Fahrenheit
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:27,071	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The clock but bring a couple guys and a Truck
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:33,471	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Wow it's felt so inspired to give it back and then I think this is sort of a Civic icon
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:36,799	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Carlos this stunning massive Bozarth structure
EDL	00:46:37,311	00:46:40,639	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It was designed by the same Architects as Grand Central terminal in New York
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:44,735	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Mdid originally was that it would be the Grand Central of the Midwest
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:46,783	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Wood handle all this passenger and Freight traffic
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:48,831	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And be kind of you know
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:50,367	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is landmark in the city
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:51,391	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Sleepy puppies
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:53,951	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It's filled with all these beautiful details.
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:54,975	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Marble walls
EDL	00:46:54,975	00:46:56,767	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Vaulted ceilings copper skylights
EDL	00:46:57,535	00:46:58,047	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And it's cute
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:47:02,399	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	18 stories tall so there are restaurants and shops and below
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:03,679	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And then office spaces above
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:09,311	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And so but obviously it's on hard time swimming wrong with the Michigan Central Station
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:11,615	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Well a lot of things arguably but
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:15,967	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The rise of the car definitely help drive it out of business
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:18,527	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	We're driving out to the suburbs in the city itself
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:19,807	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Anesthesia
EDL	00:47:19,807	00:47:20,831	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Found Odysseus
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:22,623	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	At first the office has cleared out
EDL	00:47:22,623	00:47:25,951	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And then the shops and restaurants that closed down and then finally in the 80s
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:27,487	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	The ticket booth shut down
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:29,279	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And basically the whole place was
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:33,119	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	They just abandoned it was left empty at that point
EDL	00:47:33,119	00:47:35,167	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Yeah and there was talk over the years
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:38,495	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Tearing it down but it had this statuses
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:39,263	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is landmark
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:40,287	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And that
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:41,823	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Protected from Demolition
EDL	00:47:41,823	00:47:42,847	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	You know they came up with
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:44,383	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Attempts to try to reuse this like
EDL	00:47:44,895	00:47:49,503	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Ideas to turn into a police station or a Convention Center or even a casino
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:51,039	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And none of those panned out
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:52,319	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So the building just kind of
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:53,855	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Insulting changing hands
EDL	00:47:54,367	00:47:55,391	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And the owners
EDL	00:47:55,391	00:48:01,535	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Before Ford finally did do some work on it like they drain the basement and they added some new windows and they put up a security fence
EDL	00:48:03,071	00:48:06,143	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Obviously that must have happened after the clock was stolen
EDL	00:48:06,143	00:48:12,287	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Yeah yeah they definitely were aware that things are disappearing from the building and I had to put a stop to that
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:16,895	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Explore it but
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:18,431	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Along the way hundreds of artifacts
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:21,247	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	So the clock is really just one piece
EDL	00:48:21,247	00:48:27,647	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Is the bus there is lots of little things taken from the story about imagine over the years yeah a really large bees that took you to
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:32,255	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	But definitely one of many things and returning it actually started this kind of bigger movement
EDL	00:48:32,767	00:48:34,815	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Because once Ford have the clock in hand
EDL	00:48:35,327	00:48:38,399	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	They were able to put out a call and say hey it looks my return this clock
EDL	00:48:38,911	00:48:39,935	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	If anybody else has stuff
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:46,847	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Maybe you can bring it back too and you won't get in trouble no-questions-asked leave it on the side of a building
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:48,127	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	It works
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:51,967	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Doesn't the people have now come forward to offer up old station artifact
EDL	00:48:51,967	00:48:56,575	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Plaster medallions light fixtures
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:49:02,975	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Yeah in Fort actually has a wishlist to they want back things like the ticket window grills elevator transom
EDL	00:49:02,975	00:49:04,511	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And all other clocks
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:06,047	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Spiritual years
EDL	00:49:06,559	00:49:08,095	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	And basically you know anything that
EDL	00:49:08,095	00:49:14,495	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	That is sort of considered critical to the historic character of the building right in what are the other planning to restore it as it was
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:16,031	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Really plan to do with all these artifacts
EDL	00:49:16,543	00:49:20,895	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Well something's will probably go back into the building and others will end up in local museums
EDL	00:49:21,407	00:49:22,943	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Acai benefits
EDL	00:49:22,943	00:49:23,711	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	What is that
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:25,759	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	Silly things can be used to model copy
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:28,575	| 336_Mini_Stories_Volume_6_pt01 |	These two rights if you have one planet
