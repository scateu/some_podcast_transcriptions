EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:36,287	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Where 1942
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:40,127	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Mayor LaGuardia ordered the NYPD to round up all of the machine
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:41,407	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Then
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:42,687	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	In a press event
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:46,015	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Damier personally shattered some of the machines with a sledgehammer
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,063	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	It had to be dumped into the Hudson River
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:55,487	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	LaGuardia later reported that mm new police billy clubs would be made from the wooden legs of old pinball machine
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:59,583	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Perfect for knocking the heads of pinball plain Hooligans
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:04,191	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	LaGuardia did not succeed in ridding the world of pinball entirely though
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:06,751	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	It was still legal in some cities
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:08,031	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	And even in New York
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,055	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	It didn't totally does
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:09,823	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Disappear
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,847	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	It just moved
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:12,639	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	In the City Underground established
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:16,223	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Meanwhile the game designers were still developing new features
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,759	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	The most important of which
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:21,343	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Were the flippers that first appeared in 1947
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:26,975	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	It allowed you to swap the ball around the play field by pressing two buttons on either side of the machine
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,279	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	In other words
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:33,119	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	The flippers gave you some control over the outcome of the game
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:35,679	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Remember when pinball machines were first band
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:37,727	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	The games are considered a game of chance
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:40,031	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	He basically put your quarter in
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:42,079	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Pull back the plunger and hope for the best
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:44,127	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	When The Flipper was added to the pinball machine
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:46,431	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	It should have changed the games legal status
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:50,015	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	It wasn't a game of chance anymore you can finally control the ball
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:53,343	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	If only they could find some way to
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:53,855	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Prove it
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:57,695	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Ladies and gentlemen I give you Rodger Sharp
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:00,511	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	I guess it one point I was considered to be
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:04,095	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	It's not the best player in the world one of the best players in the world
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:07,167	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Nearly 40 years after the introduction of The Flipper
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:09,471	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	In April of 1976
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:13,823	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Roger Sharpe was called upon to prove that pinball with a game of skill
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,871	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Before a meeting of the New York City Council
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:18,687	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	On the day of the hearing tensions were high
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,711	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	It was packed
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:21,247	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Lot of camera Crews
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:24,831	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	The New York State coin-operated Amusement game Association
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,367	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	How to arrange for the hearing
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:28,927	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Need hauled to pinball machines into the meeting room
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:31,231	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	When that shark was to play
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:33,023	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	And another that would serve as a backup
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,815	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	In case the first one suddenly died
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:38,399	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Start going over to
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,935	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	The game would have been designated
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:42,751	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	The council have been pretty antagonistic to Sharp
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,775	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	They thought he would cheat
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,335	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	And right before he was supposed to play
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:48,127	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	A council member stopped
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:48,895	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	You should know
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:49,919	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Not that game
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,455	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	That came over there
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:57,087	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	I think that the head of the city council thought the vacuum was somehow rigged
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:09:01,439	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Let's go with the game that's been turned off and nobody paid any attention to this over there in the
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,207	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Corner
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:04,255	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	The council session took a 20-minute recess
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:08,095	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	So that the camera crews could change the lighting from the original machine
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:08,607	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Into the new machine
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:11,167	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	And then Rodger sharp steps up
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:11,935	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Then starts playing
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:14,495	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Back that I was able to really show off
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:18,591	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	So it was very nice to be able to call my shots and just do whatever I want to do
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:21,919	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Breaking Bad cams and shots for right to left or left to right
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,967	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	And then for the grand finale
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:26,271	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Wanted to prove that even the first shot
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:32,415	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	The one that involves just pulling back the plunger and Let It Go but even that shot can be perfected
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,439	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	With skill
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:35,231	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Return to the council members
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:38,815	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Says if I do this right it's going to land right down the center
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,863	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Hold back the plunger
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,703	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Straight down the center
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:49,823	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	And the guy was Hershey concert at represent
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:53,919	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	And I was right which way to keep on playing. It was having fun
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:56,479	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	City council voted 6-0 to pass
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,503	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	The legislation
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:00,831	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Sharpen said in the past that he got lucky with this Sean
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:03,135	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	But now he says that he was being modest
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:04,415	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	That his Plunge
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,439	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Was not luck
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,719	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	To do what I did
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,999	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	That was skill
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,559	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	To have done it the way that I did it
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,071	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Was
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:14,399	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Pure naivete
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,679	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Pinball was legal again
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,959	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	In most place
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,471	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	This is across the country
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:20,031	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	But not in Oakland and Alameda
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:25,151	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Whereas we heard in the meeting the show pinball just became legal in 2014
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:31,295	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Even with the rise of video games the pinball industry continue to experience waves of success until the 1990s
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,599	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	But over time people lost in

EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,935	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	After decades
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:51,007	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Fighting to prove that pinball could be a game of skill
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:55,615	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	It turned out that the most lucrative bet for game Acres was on games of
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,127	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Chance
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,151	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Gambling

EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:41,439	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	And the mountains of hyperbole heat on the promotion of the game
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,719	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	It never really caught on
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:46,047	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	Which is probably because if pinball still has any appeal

EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:05,247	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	It is because people are longing to get away from screens and from games that they play at home alone
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:07,039	| 99pi-0135-foramusementonly-1 |	So was Tim all you can kind of
