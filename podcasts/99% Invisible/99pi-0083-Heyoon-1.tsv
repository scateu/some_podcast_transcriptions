EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:52,640	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	How magical it was too to see this thing that just doesn't seem real

EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:05,440	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Don't know where we're going to go it's a secret
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:11,840	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I was really lucky to grow up in Ann Arbor we had a great record stores in Ann Arbor
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:12,864	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Palace movie theater
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:15,424	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And of course Ann Arbor is the home of the University of Michigan
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:17,728	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	So there was a lot going on for small town
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:20,032	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	But it was a small town
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,056	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And I
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:21,568	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Was a misfit
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:24,640	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And like a lot of young Misfits in small towns
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:26,432	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I was bored and disaffected and angry
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:29,504	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	That Misfit is Alex Goldman
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:33,088	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He's a producer at the radio show on the media may now lives in New York City
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:37,952	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I hated High School I was a bad student and most of my friends went to different schools
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,232	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	In fact
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:41,536	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Although I come by Alex my entire life
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,816	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	That's actually my middle name
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:44,352	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	My first name is Michael
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:47,424	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And for at least half of my high school career
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:49,216	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	My teachers and peers all called me Mike
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:53,568	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It was like I walked around pretending to be a completely different person for most of my way
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:56,384	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I felt like I didn't belong anywhere
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:01,504	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I desperately wanted to escape this oppressively small town that felt completely devoid of wonder
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,552	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And then I found her
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:17,888	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Okay where are we
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:25,312	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I hope someone brought a flashlight

EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:36,064	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The only way you found out about Hayden was if someone took you there
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:39,136	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It was like there was the secret Club of kids who knew about it
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:41,696	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I got initiated when I was 15
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,256	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	You drive out in the middle of nowhere
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,536	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Deep in the country
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:48,864	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Impark alongside this dirt road
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:51,168	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	We've got to get over that fence
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:53,472	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	There's this fence that you had to climb over
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:59,616	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The sign on a guy's I don't know about that the sign read turn back on back
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,408	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	This is private private property
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:03,712	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	You're not welcome here for any reason
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:04,992	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Please

EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:09,088	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Turn back and leave in peace turn back and leave in peace
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,904	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It almost felt like a dare
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:15,488	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	This is going to change your life
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,536	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Once you are over the fence
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,327	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	You pass along side a white farmhouse
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:20,607	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The guy that owns that house
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:29,055	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	That he shot a kid full of rocks off reading near his house
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:33,919	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	In the kid alive
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:39,039	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	A path behind the house led to this thin line of trees but once you made it through the trees you're in this huge field
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:41,087	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And there was something else there in the field
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:45,695	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Something man-made something really big
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:59,775	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Forgot to do when we get up to that clearing
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:05,919	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Fast as you can until you see it
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,679	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Whoa
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:29,983	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Welcome to Hae Eun
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,775	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It's beautiful
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:36,127	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The structure is made mostly of wood
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:39,199	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	With a canopy of Teflon and nylon stretched over a metal frame
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:44,319	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	From the base there were stairs leading up to a platform about 10 feet off the ground
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:47,391	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Suspended over a boulder up about the size of a Volkswagen bug
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:51,743	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	At the top of the stairs there were these two pieces of glass in the floor
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:55,327	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And one night a friend stood underneath with the letter while I look down from on top
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,631	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	There was an etching on one of those pieces
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,423	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It said
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,447	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The Hayden Pavilion

EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:17,343	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Designed and carefully put together for more than 2 years

EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,551	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	If you are here you shouldn't be

EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:08,543	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Some of the no trespassing signs may have backfired a little bit
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:13,407	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Because there was like this I feel like there's a sort of contrariness two teenagers where it's like

EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:21,599	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I rounded up a few of my high school friends and talk to them about hey you
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:24,927	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It seems like it's still as entrenched in their mind
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:26,463	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	As it has been in mine
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:29,279	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It was a blue my mind first time I saw it
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,559	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I'd best describe a union
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,375	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Who's never seen it
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,447	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Biggest
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:42,847	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	That's maybe the size of a small house or Hut and it looks like a hot air balloon with a jellyfish mushroom mushroom
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,127	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Assertive
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:44,895	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Telescope
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:49,503	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Observatory spaceship a rocket ship
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,551	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Or something that looks
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:52,319	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Very alien
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:56,415	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Foreign sitting in the middle of that Big Field
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:58,207	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The place definitely has a Stonehenge
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:04,095	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	There were a number of myths about why he was there
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,655	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	That was built to commemorate the owners dead daughter
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,703	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	There was built along Ley lines
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:14,335	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	That was created for a wedding ceremony that it was designed for paganistic rituals are for stargazing

EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:31,647	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The first time I made out with someone who became my girlfriend happened while we were sitting on Hayden during a rainstorm
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:36,255	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It was otherworldly and magical it fell out of time
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:38,303	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And it felt like it was ours
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:43,423	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Going to visit a unit was the perfect mixture
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,703	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Danger

EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:49,567	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	To capture fifty-year-old Alex's imagination
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:52,895	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	For the next decade-and-a-half
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:55,199	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Even after I moved away in 2001
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I was fixated on trying to find out why it was there
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:02,367	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	7 mm and 9 I wrote a letter to the white farmhouse we always snuck past on our way to hey you
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,159	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Asking them if they were the owners

EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:10,047	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Rita and Peter Hayden
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:14,143	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	That's when I realized that what we've been calling the Hayden Pavilion 4 years
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,935	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Was actually the Hayden Pavilion
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:19,775	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	That Gaelic font made the D look kind of like a second o
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,335	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And we'd only ever seen it in the middle of the night
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:25,919	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	If the names Rita and Peter heydon sound familiar
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:31,295	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It's probably because they're nonprofit the Mosaic Foundation has been underwriting public radio for decades

EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:52,287	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I sent the Hayden's a letter
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:54,335	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Apologizing for my youthful indiscretions
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:56,383	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And asking them if I could interview them about hey you
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:58,431	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Peter Hayden Road back
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:06,367	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	So you're one of the little too invaded our privacy by visiting our Pavilion when you were told at many places along the way now
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,135	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Not to be there
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,487	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	This was in 2009 before I was a public radio for
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:14,303	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I was just a guy New Yorker fix computers
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:17,119	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And a guy who used to trespass on the Hayden property
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:21,215	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The rest of his letter was friendly but he wasn't too keen on talking to me
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:25,311	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I couldn't let it go that I communicated with the creator of Hae Eun
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:27,615	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And that the mystery could be solved
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,151	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It drove me bonkers
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,455	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	So in 2012
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:33,503	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	After working in public radio for a couple years
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:35,807	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Now I had a better excuse to try to talk to Hayden
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:37,599	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And I decided to try again
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:40,159	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Peter Hayden can be a hard man to read
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:42,719	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He doesn't use email he doesn't always answer the phone
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:47,839	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He was reluctant to give an interview for fear of attracting even more people 2 a.m.
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:50,655	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	But after a couple phone calls in a few facts messages
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:53,471	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He agreed to meet me for an interview about Hae Yoon
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:54,751	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Hey you
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:57,055	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It was like meeting the wizard

EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,367	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Let's go back up there

EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:36,479	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Thank you so much for agreeing to do this yeah
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:41,855	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I have mixed feelings about as you can imagine the at-bat in my effort to try and respect the Hayden's privacy
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:44,927	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I offered to refer to the Pavilion only as hey you
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:45,951	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And not use his name
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:49,279	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	But he told me from the beginning that he wasn't interested in an annuity
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:51,071	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He was interested in privacy
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:53,631	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I don't think that I want this to be anonymous
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:56,447	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I wanted to be with my name is
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:56,959	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Attached to it
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:13:01,567	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	But that doesn't mean to say that we have to violate our privacy we don't have to tell where it is we don't have to
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:05,151	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	To say whatever I mean if you said Ann Arbor that's good enough note most people would not know
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:09,503	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I was actually going to be even less specific I was going to say Southeastern Michigan
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:15,903	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	To give people less of a so my name from our credit in PR

EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:29,983	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Peter Hayden told me that Hayden was designed by a friend of his
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,775	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	An artist and designer named Joseph kinnebrew

EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:38,687	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	When a massive blizzard came through in snow the men
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:42,783	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	We were trapped in our house down at the bottom of the hill for 5 days

EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:46,111	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	We got to know each other quite well during that period
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:49,951	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I think Joe is nuts and I like being around him I find him

EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:08,639	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	We had planned and he said I'm going to build you a pavilion I said okay will do this invite by dusk
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:11,455	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	But we decided we come out here and look at this field

EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:26,815	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He said

EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,127	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And so
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:44,735	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	That was exactly the spot where I was standing with his burning newspaper

EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,831	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Golang pack and sew for me
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,623	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	This Pavilion was always sort of that
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:55,391	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It was
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,159	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Something that
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:57,695	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Was
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:00,255	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Place for contemplation in place for
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:01,791	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Pleasure
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:05,375	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	For enjoyment for conviviality with people that I chose to be here
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:09,471	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Peter's relationship with Hayden feels like an echo of the possessiveness
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:10,495	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The secretiveness
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:13,055	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The ownership that me and my friends all feel for
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:16,383	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The only difference is that Peter actually owns it
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:18,687	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Like us he feels protective of it
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:19,967	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Unlike us
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,503	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He's actually responsible
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:23,295	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Over the years
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:27,391	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He said to clean up the mess left by drunk teens and even some damage left by Vandals
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:31,743	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Unlike you I'll explore some heads that came out here and actually did some damage
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:34,559	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	So we had to repair that is ax
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:35,071	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The cut the
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,095	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Covering
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:38,655	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	We know there were parties out here we had
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:42,239	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Candles and things like that sometimes it looks like there maybe it have been
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:45,567	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Religious things going on here that may have been
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,871	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Poetry readings and it was
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:49,151	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	You don't think of him as a sex
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:53,503	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	You know I don't think you were orgies out here I think a couple would come out here and
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:54,783	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Weather Berea
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:57,343	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Compelling to be part of nature out here
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,135	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Ynobe
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:01,951	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	When was the nature especially in full moons and stuff that was always a very
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,767	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Seem to be the tractor times
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,279	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	People be out here
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,607	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I'm sure you know
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:12,191	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Was talking to my friends about the signage that's out front and the
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,983	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The first sign the sign that says you know
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:18,591	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Prospectus and leave this in peace congratulations this is your reward for finding this
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,783	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	But anyway please continue
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:30,111	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Well I have the reason I say that is because one of my friends said to me
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:32,415	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I kind of believe that they wanted us to go out there
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:34,207	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	They wanted us to find it and
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:36,767	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And that's why there are so many signs daring us to
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,047	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	To visit it
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:42,911	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	No that's absolute fabricated that's that's wishful thinking on your part nothing like that of the sort we wanted
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:46,239	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	If I Choose You Liza that's my business that's my religious
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,007	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Experience
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:47,775	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It's not a
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:49,823	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Kumon Temple for everyone to utilize
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,871	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It's funny you should put it that way
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:54,943	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Because that's exactly how my friends and I all felt about it then
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,711	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I still do now
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:57,503	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Even though we ourselves
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,015	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	For trespassers
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:01,343	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	One of my friends I talk to you for the story Jason vanmatre
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,111	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Put it this way
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:04,159	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	They were like certain kids who would I would talk to her
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,951	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Oh yeah that
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:07,487	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	That Pavilion out there I
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:08,511	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I took a six pack
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:10,559	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Wasted out there
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:13,887	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I feel
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:15,167	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	A little bit hurt by that
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,727	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	You just going out there
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:18,495	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Drink
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:19,007	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He's talking about
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,543	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Your 30 pack of
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:21,823	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	People riding zebras
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:22,335	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Dalian like
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:24,895	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Sacrilege
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:26,943	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It's like my shirt
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,455	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It's like
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:28,991	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Sacrilege
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:29,503	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	My church
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:33,087	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	When we found trash at Hayden left over from other people
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,623	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	My friends and I would clean it up
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:36,415	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Or at least try to minimize our impact on the
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:38,719	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Buffer Peter that doesn't matter
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:40,511	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	We are all just a bunch of
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:41,535	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Interlopers
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:43,583	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Did you go to Pioneer High School
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:46,655	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Actually went to all three I went to Pioneer community and
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:53,055	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And here on in the course of my troubled High School
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:56,127	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The English language you were able to read things especially something it's
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:58,175	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Subtle like that like that
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:03,039	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	But I would challenge you to say that was an invitation it was not an invitation was really meant to say look
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:06,367	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Here's the fact you're here
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,927	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	You come to this place
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:13,791	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I don't want you to do any damage and I don't want to piss you off so here's what I'm telling you
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:16,351	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	You know leave
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:19,167	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Admire its beauty but leave
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,959	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Don't stay here leave
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:25,567	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And I think that was the message that I wanted to I wouldn't want them so I didn't because you know spending
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:30,431	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	20 minutes in your sock drawer as opposed to 5 if it's for 2 minutes in your sock drawer
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,455	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It's just
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:34,015	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	It's okay if you can kind of
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,575	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Fluted to me in some ways when people
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:42,719	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Didn't know didn't invite had nothing to you had no knowledge of and who
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,767	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Whose values and whose
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:48,351	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The sense of Aesthetics are not the same as mine I felt that he has a personal violation
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:51,679	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Talking with Peter I can see how much he values privacy
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,471	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And having control over the stuff he owns
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:57,823	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He hired a former cop to drive a decommissioned police car around his property
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:02,431	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Scott lights and sirens and a logo that says rph security
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:04,223	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	As in Rita and Peter Hayden
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,271	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He says it's mostly to keep out Hunter
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,319	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	What I say is like we don't allow
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:09,599	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Hunter's we allow
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,367	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	A hunter
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:11,903	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Who hunts this property
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:14,719	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He's entitled to take one Buck a year
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:19,327	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	His many doses he wants and when he did catch kids that we're out there to sneak into Hayden
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:22,655	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He make them give their names and addresses and make them write letters of apology
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:24,447	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He still has a lot of those letters
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:27,519	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Gift for all Peters possessiveness of Hae Eun
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,799	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He doesn't actually do a lot with
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,847	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	You know the place itself
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:33,663	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Is not meant to be used
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:35,199	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	For me anyway
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:37,247	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Another words it's it's
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,015	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Perfectly
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:40,319	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Good being by itself not having any Auto
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:41,087	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Kittens
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:46,975	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Peter has private wine tastings winter twice a year and he Yuan and maybe he'll Wander over to it from his house from time to time
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:47,999	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	But that's pretty much it
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:49,535	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And it doesn't really matter
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,839	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Peter's the actual owner of
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:53,119	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He can do anything he wants with it
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,655	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He can use it
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,423	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	You cannot use it
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:58,239	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Even talk to me about how he thought of tearing it down
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:00,287	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And you can it's his prerogative
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,847	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	The way he can get to it doesn't get you
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:05,151	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Is under total control of the Hayden
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:07,711	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	But when you think about design intent
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:09,759	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	What humans actually designed to do
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:14,111	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Then one other person for whom it might be fair game to weigh in
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:17,184	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	This guy so happy
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:21,280	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	In spite of Peters unhappiness about Interlopers
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:22,048	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	That
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:22,816	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Young people
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:25,376	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Amen to sneak a peek

EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:33,888	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	Even though I'm sure it pisses peterhead enough to say this
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:36,192	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I can't help but feel like part of a unit belongs
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,776	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	I think that other people I know have a similar feeling
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:42,336	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	There were a couple of people who refuse to talk to me

EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:58,720	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	He did not want the secret getting out on his watch
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,536	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	And I have to admit I understand where they're coming from
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:07,168	| 99pi-0083-Heyoon-1 |	When I put out a call to friends on Facebook to see you would talk to me about
