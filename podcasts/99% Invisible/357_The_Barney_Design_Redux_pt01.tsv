EDL	00:01:09,120	00:01:11,424	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The Bulls were the best team in the league
EDL	00:01:11,424	00:01:12,704	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And the Raptors
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:13,728	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	We're pretty terrible
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:16,288	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	36000 fan showed up that day
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:18,336	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And the Raptors actually beat the Bulls
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:21,152	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	But it was a mostly meaningless game at the end of

EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:27,040	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	What's the weather is going to be about this game isn't who won or how the teams play
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:28,576	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	But the way they look
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:31,904	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	There's the Bulls were just classic NBA
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:34,464	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	I've had the same logo since 1966
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:39,840	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	They're wearing the red away jerseys that looks basically like every Chicago Bulls jersey ever
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:43,424	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It's red with the word bull was written across the front and black and white lettering
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:44,960	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It's simple
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:45,472	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Classic
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:52,384	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	But then there's the Toronto Raptors the team is wearing their
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:58,784	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	White home uniforms which have Jagged silver and black Pinstripes as if they were cut by slashing
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:05,184	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Raptor Claws and then across the whole front there's a giant red basketball playing Dinosaur
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:08,768	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Who himself is wearing sneakers and a uniform a totally different uniform

EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:12,608	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And that was just their home uniform
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:15,424	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The real jerseys that you're even more fun
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:16,960	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	They were bright purple
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:24,128	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	All this including the Raptors name had been inspired by the Velociraptors in the wildly successful movie duress

EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:26,944	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	But these jerseys got compared to a different
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:33,600	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Much friendlier 90s dinosaur
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:42,816	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	That's now known as the Barney design because

EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,408	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Top-level
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:01,504	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The Raptors jersey may have been particularly garish
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:03,552	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	But it wasn't the only Jersey of its kind
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:07,392	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The 90s were this insane decade of NBA uniform design

EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,608	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And haven't been seen since
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:22,752	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Like the Atlanta Hawks red and black Jersey with a fierce-looking hawk swooping in across the entire front of it

EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:35,040	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	So awful it was great
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:39,136	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	They had this you know this purple garish purple and green color patterns
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,672	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Ridiculous butt

EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:46,048	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	They push and extended
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:49,632	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The idea of what a basketball uniform could be or should be
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:53,216	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And many of these designs can be traced back to one man

EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:12,160	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Dream job
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:15,232	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	My first day at the NBA was just filled with excitement
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:17,536	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	I meant I'd always been a big sports fan
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,559	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And I loved
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:20,095	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Design and
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:27,007	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	I studied graphic design here Columbia College back in Chicago and so when I walked in the door and Junior 1990
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,799	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	I kind of had a pinch myself cuz I really didn't
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:30,335	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Believe it was happening
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:36,991	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Before Tom O'Grady join the League most NBA jerseys looks something like that classic Bulls jersey
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,295	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It's simple two or three color schemes
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,831	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	With the team names across the front
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:45,183	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	There might have been strike here or there may be a cool font but that was about it
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:48,767	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And they weren't designed by designers
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:52,607	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The process of Designing team uniforms is mostly left up
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,631	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The team equipment managers
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,447	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Because they were responsible for getting
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,727	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The players outfit
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,751	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	To play the games
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:01,055	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Most of this consisted of the equipment manager
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,079	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Flipping through a catalog
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:04,383	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Choosing a design they like with the right color
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:07,711	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It was not a sophisticated business let's say that
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:09,759	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	They were happy just to get Uniforms on the players back
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:12,319	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	But that was all about to change
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,855	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Because in 1988
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:16,671	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Charlotte Hornets introduce a radical new idea
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:18,463	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The color teal
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:22,047	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	In this archival news footage from 1988

EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:39,199	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Teal was not a traditional NBA jersey color
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,735	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Not NBA red
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:45,087	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It's not NBA blue it's not Celtics green it's not Lakers yellow
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:47,135	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Tom O'Grady had nothing to do with a teal Hornets
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:51,231	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	But he took it as a sign that the league was ready for Boulder designs
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,535	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It was I was at the kind of a leap of faith
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:59,935	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Fiddly to say you know this is not really something we've seen before it but as an expansion team will probably let you have this one because
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,727	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Maybe there's something that we can learn from
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:06,335	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It turned out fans loved the teal Hornets Jersey
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,359	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It look fresh
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,127	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Indifferent
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:10,431	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It was really very popular they
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,455	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Soon became
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:13,759	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Known as the men of teal and all sudden
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:16,831	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The Charlotte Hornets have gained great recognition
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:18,111	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Before they never played basketball game
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:23,999	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	When Tom O'Grady was hired as the NBA's first creative director two years later in 1990
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:26,815	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	He wanted to push Jersey design even further
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,095	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Not just the colors
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,119	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	But the designs
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:29,887	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	On the uniforms
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:34,495	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Until the early 90s there have been real limits to how Wild you could get with these design

EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:42,175	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	To do any kind of complicated graphics
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:44,223	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Would have taken a massive amount of embroidery
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:47,295	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And all that thread would have added additional weight
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:48,575	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	I made the Jersey hotter to wear
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:53,951	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	But soon after Tom O'Grady join the NBA he would get some new tools to work with
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:56,511	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Computer programs like Photoshop and illustrator
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,303	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Helped him dream up new logo design
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:01,887	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And it was a new technique to get those drawings onto a Jersey
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,935	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It was called dye sublimation
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,727	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Sublimation changed every
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:09,823	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Sublimation is a process of printing dye directly into the fabric
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:12,639	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Now for the first time you could design something in Photoshop
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:15,455	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	You can make it big and you could add a bunch of different colors
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:19,807	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Then with sublimation you can basically print that design straight onto the material
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:22,111	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Without any embroidery or extra weight
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,391	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,439	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It allowed us to start to take things
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:26,719	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	We would never normally even
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,487	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Consider doing
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:28,255	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	On
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:28,767	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	A Jersey
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,815	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And we started doing more
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:33,375	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Outrageous uniforms and stuff because we could
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,655	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	We can so we will
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:37,727	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Comes first big design was for the Phoenix Suns
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,775	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	We're celebrating our 25th year in the league
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:42,847	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	They were moving into a new Arena and they wanted a new look
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:45,919	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Soto met with their team owner Jerry Colangelo
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:50,015	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Jerry is great he was a fellow chicagoan so as soon as he heard my accent he's like
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:54,879	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	I think we're going to get along you know I think us your car guys kind of get this here's what I want to do
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:08:01,279	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	I want to have a logo that's going to last for the next 25 years I don't want to have to change it so I want something futuristic
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:01,791	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The classic
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:04,863	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	So Tom and his team started on the Suns redesign
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:07,935	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	They come up with this big basketball that's
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:08,703	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Also a son
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:12,543	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Aziz long red to orange gradient sun rays coming off
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:17,151	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And then they print this and a bright purple background under their New Jersey
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,455	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It's not exactly what I would call Classic
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,223	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	But it is born
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,015	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Definitely both
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:26,367	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	As luck would have it the Phoenix Suns made it to the NBA finals last year
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:29,951	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And the whole country got to see that bright purple jersey
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:32,255	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	With its blazing basketball Sun
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,791	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	All over national TV
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:36,351	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	We got exposure that uniform that
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:36,863	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Was
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:37,887	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Priceless
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:40,703	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	That changed everything
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,495	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	For us we were able to do
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:46,847	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Things with uniforms that we could not imagine even two years before that
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:53,759	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Like a teal Detroit Pistons jersey with a flaming horse head logo or a Pinstripes Houston Rockets Jersey featuring
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:56,063	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Cartoon rocket with an angry face on it
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:09:00,671	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Over the course of the decade 2/3 of NBA teams got new uniforms
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,463	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	With new logos and new color scheme
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:05,023	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	There was a lot of teal and purple
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:08,607	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	3D lettering and oversized Graphics were everywhere
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:12,703	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	We look back on its a while to some of the stuff is pretty outlandish but
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:17,311	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	That's okay cuz that's what was happening at a time the technology let us go wild
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:21,663	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Atoms boss NBA Commissioner David Stern
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:24,223	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Gave him the freedom to keep pushing the designs further
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:27,807	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	He said you know if this is what selling any of your telling me this is what's going to
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,855	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Work at retail
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:31,647	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Count Me In
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:34,975	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Before the 90s the NBA wasn't doing much with merchandise
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:41,119	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	If a fan wanted to buy a jersey they had to pay the full cost of a genuine stitched NBA game Jersey
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,423	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Which was sometimes over $200
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,471	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	But with all these popular new design
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,031	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Tom and others at the NBA got thinking
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:49,567	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Why don't we
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,847	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	You know have a
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:54,431	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	A jersey that we can sell for about 45 to $50
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:56,479	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	That looks similar to the game Jersey
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:59,551	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And we saw this business explode
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:02,367	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Let me know when five years and went from a almost like
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,391	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Baseline of nothing
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:07,743	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	A multi-million-dollar business largely in New Jersey
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,023	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	We were designing
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:13,887	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The era of outlandish NBA uniforms Richards Apex in 1995
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,935	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Wechat Jersey we talked about at the beginning
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,471	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	That one from Toronto
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,775	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	One that some people call the Barney design
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:23,359	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	We were told directly by the team owner at the time John bateau
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:26,431	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	I would like to Happy Meal box of uniform designs
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:30,015	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	We can't look at him pose like what did he mean by that
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:36,927	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	He said I'm not going to wear this uniform forever I don't you know kids don't eat out of Happy Meal box forever but if you going to get the kids
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,695	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Insecure
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,207	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Store
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:40,255	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	You're going to win him over
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:44,351	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Happy Meal design isn't a term yet I'm making it one right now
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:47,679	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The goal was to convince hockey loving kids in Toronto
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,215	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	That they should care about this new basketball
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:52,031	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And so we created is purple uniform
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:57,407	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	What these Jagged Edge claw Pinstripes that look like a raptor, drip tip
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:00,223	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And then I slapped a big dinosaur right in the middle of it
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:01,759	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And they made it red
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:02,783	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Because
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:04,319	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Canada
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:06,623	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	You wanted red wraps up to represent Canada
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:08,415	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Which made all the sense in the world
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:11,999	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	I don't know how much sense it made but that Jersey its soul
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:16,607	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	I think it was the top-selling expansion team logo we ever did even today
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,399	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Sales were through the roof
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,983	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Before they ever played a game
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:25,055	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Before the team had even signed a single player
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:27,871	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The Raptors were seventh in the league in merchandise
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:30,943	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	What is the nineties came to an end
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,711	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Change was afoot
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:35,039	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And stuff with about to get a lot more
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:35,551	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Boring
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:40,159	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	By the early 2000 the NBA I become a booming Global in Des
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:43,743	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And Wealthy business people were suddenly interested in team ownership
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:47,839	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	People like Howard Schultz who turns Starbucks into a multibillion-dollar business
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:51,167	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	In 2001 Schultz by the Seattle SuperSonics
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:54,239	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And he came into the league with a whole laundry list of changes to make
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:57,823	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	He wanted to replace the hip-hop you'd here in the arena on Game Night
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:58,847	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Jazz
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:01,663	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	He wanted his team to stick to the fundamentals
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,455	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Best flashy dunks in showboating
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:05,503	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The favored Team Bass
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:07,295	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Basketball over individual Stars
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:11,135	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Who's actually really bad for his team because it pissed off their actual Stars
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,671	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Also Schultz
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:14,207	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Hated the sonics 90s love
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:16,767	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It had been designed by none other
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:17,535	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Bernard Powelton
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:21,375	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	We were able to take this kind of basketball spinning around
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:22,911	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Space Needle and kind of have the
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,959	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Superman font
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,519	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And then added for Sonics
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:30,335	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	In there and they change the colors from green and gold
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:32,895	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The dark green red and a metallic bronze
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:36,223	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Old Howard jazz instead of hip-hop Schultz
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,503	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Was not a fan
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:40,063	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	So we hired Seattle design firm

EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:44,031	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	So I'm in the studio with Chris Berube

EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:58,111	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	I genuinely can't believe this is happening. I have been a Raptors fan since I was 8 years old
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:00,671	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And I'm in my early 30s so it has been

EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:09,119	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	What accounts for all that suffering to me why has it been so hard to be a fan of the Raptors
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:12,191	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	In the early days it was really tricky because

EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:25,759	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The basketball team wasn't ready yet so they set them up in this baseball stadium
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:30,111	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And if you had like 15,000 fans like that's a good number of basketball fans
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:32,927	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Baseball Stadium seats like 45000 people
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:35,999	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	So they just had these rows of empty seats with

EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:29,247	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	A place that
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,039	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	You know player is not seen is like a
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,063	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Desirable location
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:33,087	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	4 player stand up
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,111	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And then
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:34,879	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	You know we had
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,671	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	To wear this uniform in the really early days
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:41,535	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	With the Raptor on it and the bright purple and lots of players didn't like
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:43,839	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Lots of players were saying like yeah this is
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,119	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The only profession where like
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:46,911	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	You hit the very top of
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:48,191	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Your field and then you have to
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:49,727	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	To wear a purple dinosaur
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:54,591	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Unifour unless your field is being Barney the dinosaur that's the only other one
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:59,199	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	But it sounds like people kind of like that Jersey now right
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,991	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It's true I think
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:04,063	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	People have really come around on it especially
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:05,599	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	With
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,367	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Playoffs
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:10,463	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Happening now so you know I've had all these friends who have been going up to
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:15,071	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	UPS out the door and all the dinosaurs stuff
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:18,399	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	For the most part is just completely sold out
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:19,935	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And I went
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:20,959	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	To dispense it store actually
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:23,775	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Fairly close to where I am called in vintage We Trust
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:25,567	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It's run by this guy named Josh
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:26,335	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Computer
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:30,175	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Raptors merchandise forever Auntie is Toronto
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:30,687	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Born and raised
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:32,479	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Mission solar
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:33,247	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Torontonians
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:37,087	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	We would say torontonians but you would say Toronto
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:42,463	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Am I missing something what is the difference between
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:47,327	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Yeah well torontonians if you hit that last t
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,863	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	That shows that you're not from here
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,399	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	People who are from your sake Toronto
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,703	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	OIC
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:53,471	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	I say
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:56,543	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	So it's the Toronto Raptors now the Toronto Raptors
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:58,847	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Yeah if you want to sound credible the next two days you say that
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:02,687	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	So Josh and his partner Chantelle they run
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,711	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Vintage store
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,735	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And he says the last
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:08,063	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	She weeks he's been getting requests like every half hour
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:12,415	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Some version of the purple dinosaur uniform from the early days
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:15,231	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	He's like everybody he knows
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:17,535	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The dinosaur is a pretty ridiculous look
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:20,351	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It almost makes no sense like
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,887	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The actual logo
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,935	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Is a
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:25,215	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Dinosaur
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:26,495	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Turn
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:28,799	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Full dribbling a basketball one way
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:30,591	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	He's turning around the other way
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:33,407	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And his toes are coming out of a pair of sneakers
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:36,991	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Completely absurd and ridiculous
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:38,783	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And not only is it like
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,831	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	A logo on hat as a fan
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,391	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Players are wearing
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:45,951	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Literally wearing this logo on their Jersey
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:48,511	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It's insane
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:51,839	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	So everyone wants to bar New Jersey but also everyone
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:56,703	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Terminologies that's a little bit silly so why do people like it now
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:58,495	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Talking to Joshua came away with tooth
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:00,799	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	So the first is bad
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,079	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The team is winning
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:04,127	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And nobody wants to look like a bandwagon
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:06,175	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	So nobody wants to look like
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:09,247	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	They heard about the rules of basketball in the last two weeks
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:10,527	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	They just
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:11,807	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Realized
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:15,135	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	This is something very fast with so everybody wants to make it seem like they've been there since
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:17,696	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Beginning running
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:19,488	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Look credible
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:22,816	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	A really obscure player like just told me he's been getting requests
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:25,120	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	People like Oliver Miller
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:31,520	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	To I had to look up I had no idea who that was shared about the feet forever so people are spending like all this money
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:32,544	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	To get these jerseys
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,568	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Of players no Visa
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:35,616	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:36,384	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Nostalgia
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:41,248	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Brightness LG does not have to make sense it doesn't have to be something that is pretty or nice
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:44,576	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And this is what Josh says vintage is all about it's about
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:46,368	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	What the logo Evoque
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:48,416	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	For people it's what time it sends you back to
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:51,744	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	When you look at that Raptors uniform when you look at that
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:55,328	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	A purple on the Jersey that is the diet
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:58,912	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Reminds me of like Space Jam of like this gyro when there was so much
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,680	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Billy Bass
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,448	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Football stuff happening
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:03,264	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Send you back to that time
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:04,800	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The logo
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,312	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Who is
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,592	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Cartoonish and it
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,128	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Very
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:10,432	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Reminiscent of a specific
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:11,200	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Era
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:12,736	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And people love
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:13,504	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Reliving
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:14,528	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Parts of their lives
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:16,576	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Tangible items
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:18,624	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Things that they can touch you
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,904	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Feel that's why
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:20,672	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	People are
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,440	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Peeing out
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:23,488	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	To own it original
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,816	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Because they're investing in their path
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:31,168	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	So obviously the Raptors are not wearing purple
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:35,776	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Uniform for the night he's in the finals right now they're wearing their current uniform is
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:39,104	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Pretty simple it's pretty clean it's like a white uniform
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:40,128	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	With the black
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:42,176	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	San serif fonts the word Raptors
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,200	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Across the front
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:45,248	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And then sometimes they wear
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:48,064	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	A red uniform with a white San serif
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:51,136	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Raptors across the front and then room in this is where it gets
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,160	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Very exciting
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:53,184	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Davis third uniform
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,720	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Which is black
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:55,744	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	With a white
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:56,768	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	San serif Raptors
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:23:00,864	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It gets really exciting mix it up
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:05,728	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	But I have seen this one that's like it says North
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:06,752	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Sonic
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:08,032	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Describe that one for us
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,824	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Yeah they call that the
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:13,664	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	City Jersey it's a red jersey it has like a white Chevron
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:15,712	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	So it's like this white arrow pointing up
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:22,624	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	And it says North on it I actually think that one's pretty stylish like I like that one
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,904	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	With all of them it's like
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:26,720	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	They're good design they're very clean
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:29,024	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	They're very simple and ultimately they're very safe
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:30,560	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	The current Raptors
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:31,840	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Uniform
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:33,888	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:34,912	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Have a lot of
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:41,568	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	It's kind of weird for me to look at a Raptors jersey with no purple
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:46,944	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	I didn't like you out of what you want to move away from the purple for a few years but like
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:48,992	| 357_The_Barney_Design_Redux_pt01 |	Why isn't the dino Jersey
