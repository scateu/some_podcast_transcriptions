EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:48,960	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Honestly it should be called the issue lien

EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:40,160	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	You can see that it's not quite so symmetric and
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:41,696	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Nice little sharpest Edge
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:45,280	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Summer sharp all along the entire perimeter sum art
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:47,840	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Summer perfectly symmetrical and summer not
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:53,984	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	But those hand axes in the UC Berkeley basement aren't actual primordial hand axes

EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:00,384	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	There have been courses here in which

EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:04,992	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	In the point of this challenge for the graduates to
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:10,112	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	It's a see how involved this process is and making one of these pointy rocks
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,648	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	The way the early humans would
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,696	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	You break off big pieces

EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:30,335	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Someone weekly practice at it can make

EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:51,743	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	So this requires cunning
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:53,535	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Yes but crafts
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:55,071	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Not really
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:58,143	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	So early humans understood the importance of oldowan tools

EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:06,335	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	So it's not just adventitious products

EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:11,455	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Spandex he's the first designed object
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,223	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	At least we can find
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:17,087	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	If there were any wooden tools that are human like ancestors made
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:18,623	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Those have long since to centigrade
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,671	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	But even if there are other example
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,487	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Hand axes are really significant
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:26,559	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	With issuing a hand actually issue lien

EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:30,399	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	We suddenly now fine people
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:34,239	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Making people I say they're their ancestors making tools
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:38,079	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	With an end in mind and making them in advance
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:40,127	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	They almost certainly have to carry them with them
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:43,711	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	They don't just make them on the spot there they take time to make them they take
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,735	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Thought to make them
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,271	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	And you're shaping them
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,551	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Towards a particular shape
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,087	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	For some particular use
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,367	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Which we today don't
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,159	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	We don't know
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:52,927	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	We don't
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,951	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Know how they were used
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:57,023	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	That's the crazy mystery here so
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:59,071	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	This is where we get into the entry
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,607	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	That will live well again
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,911	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Dirt their ideas right so smart people.
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:05,727	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Are working on the problem and in there are like
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:06,495	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	3
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,007	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Theories
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:13,407	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	There are more than free if you want me to talk about more theories I can talk about more theories but I'll stop at 3 unless you tell me otherwise
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:14,687	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Will ledwell has
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,967	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	3 favorite
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:17,247	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	As to why the hand-axe.
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,551	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Theory number one
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:21,343	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Right of the powers uses the multi-tool
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:25,695	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Set theory number one is that the SLI hand-axe
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:27,231	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Was the original Swiss Army knife
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:29,791	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Primarily used for butchering me
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:33,887	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	But it's also good for breaking up in knots and digging up grubs or whatever else he might be
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,679	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	And so the strength
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:37,215	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Of this Theory
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:40,799	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Is it fits with where patterns do you see on a lot of the hand axes that are found
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,103	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Here's the problem with Theory number one
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:47,967	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	In some cases the full perimeter of the axe is sharp and remember this is a hand axe
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,503	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Holding
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:50,015	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Palm of your hand
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:52,575	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	So if you wanted to use it
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:55,391	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	There be this sharp blade digging into your palm
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,671	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Another problem with everyone
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,719	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Is that some of the axes are symmetra
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:01,279	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Which is a lot of extra effort
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:05,375	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	That isn't really necessary if you're just using it to break up nuts or cut meat
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:08,447	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	And so to address some of those problems
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:09,983	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	We get into Theory number two
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,775	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Nothing this is my personal favorite
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:14,079	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	The sexy handbags
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,383	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	The current quote
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:18,431	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Sexy handaxe Theory
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:21,503	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Proposes that these tools didn't have I used
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Per se
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:25,087	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	They were created mostly as a way of showing off
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,367	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Like the feathers of a peacock
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:29,439	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	The goal wasn't to create a functional tool
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:29,951	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Butchering
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,999	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Are symbolic tool
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:32,511	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	For me to track
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:36,351	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	And making these things is really really hard
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,911	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Why spend so much time doing it
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,447	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Unless you're showing off
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:43,007	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Raintree showing the opposite sex what you can do
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:48,895	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	But there are a lot of experts were doubtful of this one including Anthropologist Terrence deacon
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:50,175	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Not all of them are beautiful
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,687	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Teardrop shape
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:53,759	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	They weren't all that nice and neat and symmetric
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,575	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	There is one interesting except
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,343	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	I mean one
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:04,255	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	One beautiful 350000 year old exception
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,279	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Bottom of a kind of whale
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,559	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	In southern Spain
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,119	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	It looks as though
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:12,703	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Bodies were tossed down here and one of these it found in this
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,239	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	This whale so to speak
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:15,007	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Make it just up
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:15,519	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Cave well
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,591	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Is a hand axe was made of
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:20,639	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	A kind of
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:22,175	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Rose quartz looking Stone
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,455	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Really pretty
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:25,759	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	It doesn't look like it was ever used
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:28,575	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	I'm not a sexy hand axe
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:31,647	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	But this may be the first indications that they're beginning
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,159	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	To sort of
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:35,231	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Grieve over the death of someone
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,791	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	What if there is some kind of ritual issue here
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,071	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Wichita beautiful
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:39,839	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Hand axe
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,119	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	It's about playing a role
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:41,887	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,679	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	The world's third favorite Theory
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,703	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	It's still a really fun one
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,239	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Number three is pretty fun
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:51,615	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Number 3 in in a closed follow onto my favorite too sexy hand-axes the killer frisbee
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:55,455	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	And so in the killer frisbee Theory
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Right hand axes were made to be
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:58,527	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Projectiles
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,575	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	The throne in the passionate

EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:04,415	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	A lot of hand axes are found near Riverbank
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:09,279	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Hunters would wait for herds of animals to come and then
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:11,583	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	They wouldn't taxes
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:14,143	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	This might not be enough to make a Kill
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:17,983	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	But the stones would name a few and give the hunter is an opportunity to charge
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:20,543	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	This hypothesis right explains
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:25,151	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Why it looks the way it does right by the hand axes sharp all the way around
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:28,479	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Wyatt so symmetrical Wyatt so aerodynamic
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:30,271	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	William not all of them are
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,575	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Sharp all the way around and perfectly symmetrical
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:35,391	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	He was like a frisbee was use like a weapon
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:37,951	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	I really have my doubts about that
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,999	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	I like the Swiss Army knife
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:44,095	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	In part because it looks like it's a one tool fits all
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,655	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	It was clearly something that we see
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:49,727	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Again and again and again and again all over
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:50,751	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Other world
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:52,799	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	That means it was very effective
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:57,407	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	And if you don't find a lot of diversity of tools it was almost certainly use for more than one thing
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:01,503	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	But whatever the hand axe was used for it must have been a really good job because
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:06,111	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	This basic design was used for a mind-blowing Lee long time
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:07,135	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Xiamen adult

EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:21,215	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Write it just crazy long
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:26,847	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	So long that our human mind can barely wrap our heads around it
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:30,943	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Understanding of history is only what may be five thousand ten thousand years
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:33,503	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	That's our biggest understanding of History
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:35,551	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Sonia stayed the same
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,831	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	Culture that was constant
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,111	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	For a million years
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:39,135	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	That's pretty remarkable
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:42,719	| 99pi-0131-genesisobject-1 |	And no matter what the issue in hand axe was actually used for
