EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:17,056	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	It must have been

EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:31,136	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	But you're such an outdated term now but whatever that's what it was called I think all he told us was
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:33,184	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	You should wear clothes of the opposite

EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:37,536	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	They probably said it in a way that slightly more you know literate in the difference
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:39,072	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Between gender and biological sex
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:40,352	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	What I just said
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:43,168	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	It was a strange way to make First Impressions on each other
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:48,800	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Not because we were scared of wearing dresses or backwards baseball caps or whatever we were that night
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:53,920	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Is because for many of us we could borrow clothes from the other people in our Hall

EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:05,952	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	In the Hall of the building she's close with it
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:08,256	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	I remember I loaned peers

EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:12,864	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	From the sixties that I bought from a thrift store
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:14,400	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	And I have no idea if he would
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,936	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Take care of it or even return it
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:17,728	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Peers tried it on
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:21,568	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	He went to check himself out in the bathroom down the hall
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:23,104	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Here's what happened.
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,664	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	I immediately locked myself out of my room
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:28,480	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Oh no my Keisha from my room
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,016	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Because I did never put them
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,552	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	The dresser
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:34,624	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Piers is brand new roommate let him back in
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,392	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	But then he went to sleep
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:38,208	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	So peers wanted to make sure he didn't make that much
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:38,976	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Mistake again
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:41,792	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	He couldn't lose his keys at the party
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:45,632	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	We all ended up in the big dance hall where there's really loud music and it was like
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,168	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Unbearably hot
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,936	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	All the ladies
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:50,496	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Eyebrow pencil mustaches were running as their teeth
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,800	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	With sweat and things like that and
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:57,408	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	I believe I just clutched my keys in my hand and thought about it really hard all night
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,176	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Which sounds crazy
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:07,904	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Articles of Interest a show about what we wear and so maybe the ideas about clothes
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:14,048	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Ideas about to a piece of cloth
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:18,656	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Wear clothes
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:22,240	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	But if you ain't got the attitude install the carrot off

EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:28,384	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Is littered with fake pockets
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,152	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	But don't open
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,176	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Or shallow pocket
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,456	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Guess I could hardly hold a paperclip
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,504	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	If there are Pockets at all
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,552	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	They are just smaller
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,576	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	And they sent
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,856	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Less than men's
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:38,624	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	It's due
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,904	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	And you have to take my word for it
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:43,488	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	We are going to the police supply store
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:46,816	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	I want to find an example of a uniform that had pockets
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:49,120	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	And compared those made for men and those for women
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:52,192	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	This is the shop that provides the uniforms for the Oakland Police
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:56,288	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	When I asked the store manager if I could look at the men's and women's uniforms
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:58,336	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	This is what he told me

EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,528	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Really that's your eye
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,576	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	But there is a women's
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:11,136	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Well I've got some over

EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:15,744	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,280	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	The pockets are bigger

EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:22,079	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Cling to the body
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:26,943	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	So when you get to the 1800 and that empire style wear the waist
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:27,711	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Is pretty much gone
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,015	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Can't think of Jane Austen movies
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:33,599	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Do you have the columnar silhouette silhouette like a straight Greek

EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:38,207	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	And some of these columnar dresses have slits for Pockets but a lot of them
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:41,023	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	R2 body-hugging to accommodate extra bulge
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:45,119	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	There's no space for pockets and so suddenly women begin to carry little person
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:51,519	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	And there's lots of ridicule about women having to lose their pockets and having to carry these silly bags
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:00,991	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Teeny teeny tiny little drawstring pouches

EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:07,135	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	He's but like
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,159	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	That's it
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:09,183	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	And you could

EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:14,047	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Which was another reason why it was considered ridiculous
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,095	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	You have to remember to carry it is
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:18,143	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Easy to lose people can steal it
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,423	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	That's the
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,703	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Formal difference
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,471	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:23,263	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	It's kind of price you pay for a fashion

EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,631	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	These products haven't taken off in the way they were supposed
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:48,447	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Wearables were foreseen a long time ago and we
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:50,239	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	We still feel a little anxious about their use
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,263	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	I think there's just
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:53,311	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Too much doubt at the moment about whether that
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:54,335	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Utopia can never work
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:58,943	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	And perhaps one day we will have all of our tools and planted in our skull
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,735	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Or embedded on an accessory with

EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:05,599	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	And then when we get there
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:08,671	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Pockets will seem just as ancient as rudofsky

EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:14,559	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Already it seems so Antiquated that clothes are needlessly gendered in the way they are
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:17,631	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Because we should all have access

EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,959	| Pockets_Articles_of_Interest_3_pt_01 |	Or at least a place to put our hands
