EDL	00:00:16,384	00:00:18,944	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	To learn the trade names of the book imprints
EDL	00:00:18,944	00:00:22,528	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	That published the druggie contemporary fiction that he was starting to get into
EDL	00:00:23,296	00:00:24,832	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And in 2003
EDL	00:00:24,832	00:00:26,112	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	You dropped out of college
EDL	00:00:26,112	00:00:28,928	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I moved to San Francisco to work for his favorite publisher
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:30,208	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Mcsweeney's
EDL	00:00:31,232	00:00:32,256	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It was my dream job
EDL	00:00:32,768	00:00:34,560	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And working there exacerbated my already in

EDL	00:00:37,120	00:00:43,264	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I got to live out my fantasy of being an ink-stained wretch even if that meant logging 12-hour days an in-class computer
EDL	00:00:43,776	00:00:46,848	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I edited essays and interviews played out articles
EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:49,920	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It's a weird amount of pleasure and typographical minutiae
EDL	00:00:49,920	00:00:51,456	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Like italicize in Camas
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:53,760	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And rewriting headlines so they fit the frame just so
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:57,600	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Havoc Sweeney's books and magazines whenever just containers forward
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:00:59,136	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	They were works of art
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:02,720	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And I was trying to take as much care with the look
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:03,744	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Can feel if the print
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:04,512	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	As I did with you
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:05,280	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Expression of the idea
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:09,632	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But as much as Andrew love to print Pizza love
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:15,776	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	He also has a condition that will eventually change his relationship to it pretty radically
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:18,080	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I'm going blind
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:19,616	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Really really slowly
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:22,432	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Right now it's like I've got a foot in both world
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:23,712	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Blind and sighted
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:25,504	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I have a degenerative retina
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:27,552	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It's giving me severe tunnel vision
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:29,344	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	So basically no peripheral vision
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:32,160	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It's like I'm peering at the world through a toilet paper
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:34,976	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	When it gets a little narrower every few months

EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:41,376	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I'm going to try to read this
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:42,656	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	See if I got it right
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,216	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Can

EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:52,640	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	My retinal specialist told me that I probably don't need to worry about losing the ability to read
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,664	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	For another five years or so
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:57,760	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But I've already started using a special digital program to learn Braille
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:58,784	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Which is not easy

EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:19,264	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Can we recycle a metal can
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:24,640	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I know I'll still be able to experience books for the rest of my life
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:27,456	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I'm lucky to be going blind in the digital age
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:33,856	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And the Golden Age of audio there's an abundance of well-produced audiobooks and technology that can read aloud
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:35,904	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Almost anything that appears on a screen
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:38,464	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Puzzles
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:43,584	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Chinese can ride a unicycle or two puzzles
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:48,192	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	My niece can ride a unicycle or do puzzles
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:52,800	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Does that mean my niece
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:59,200	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Can do no such thing despite all that there's still some mellow tragedy
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:03,040	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Any idea that in a few years I'll probably no longer be able to read print
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:09,184	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	After a life spent loving books there's now a real urgency for me in the question of how blind people experience literal
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:14,816	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I find myself deeply curious about what graphic design might mean to someone who can't see
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:17,888	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	So I started looking into the history of reading Technologies for the blind
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:21,728	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Traditionally books are visual objects
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:28,128	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And for centuries now blind and sighted designers have been arguing over the most effective way to translate
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,920	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Habitual ink print book
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:33,248	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Into an accessible form for people with outside
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:39,648	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Pres long as blind people have been reading there's been this tension between systems that try to stay close to the
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,928	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Original form of a book
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:43,232	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And systems that dramatically depart
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:46,048	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Tomorrow ideas of what a book can be
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:52,448	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Designers have made incredible breakthroughs to create non visual forms of reading for blind people
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:58,592	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Find critic pointed out the designers have a bad habit of quote talking to the fingers in the language of the eyes
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:04,736	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	So the history of blind reading is really the history of finding a new language for the fingers and for the ear
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:09,600	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	One that captures the Essential Elements of the ink print book but
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,368	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	In a new language
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,672	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	That's Unbound from the visual
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:16,000	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And that history centers around two main shapes
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:17,791	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Lines
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:18,303	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And.
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:26,239	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Our story starts in 18th century Europe before Braille was invented before blind people were even taught
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,007	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	To read at all
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:29,567	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	First off no one thinks that it's possible

EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:38,015	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The museum director at the American printing house for the blind in Louisville Kentucky
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:39,295	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And if they could
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,063	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	No one knows how to do
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:42,367	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Without access to education
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:44,415	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Blind people were overwhelmingly poor
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,951	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And employment prospects were dim
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:49,535	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	If their families had enough money and time to support them
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:53,375	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	They usually lived at home like adult children sitting idly around the house
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,935	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Many others were forced to beg on the street
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:05:00,287	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Dora handful of institutions in Europe to support the poorest cases
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,311	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	What a Pity the blind
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:02,335	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Hid them away
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:06,431	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Within this guy named Valentino he comes along
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:09,759	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Are we was born into a family of Weaver's in France
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:11,039	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Yes and he was a skilled linguist
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:14,879	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	He was first inspired to help the blind in 1771
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:17,695	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	We saw a group of blind people being mocked
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,487	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Potable in Paris
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,535	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	They have been given dunce cap
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:23,071	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And giant fake glasses
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,351	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And they were made
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:26,655	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Play musical instruments and pretend to read book
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:29,727	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	So are we founded the first known School for the Blind
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,519	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It was called The Royal Institute
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:32,543	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	In Paris
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,847	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But even as he's getting the school going
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,871	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	How we kept aside

EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,679	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Basically the beginning
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:33,471	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The idea that blind people can be educate
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,263	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But there are a few problem
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,799	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Well

EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:41,407	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,967	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	That's because the books are messy
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:45,503	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And prohibitively expensive
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,063	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But they're also just really hard to read
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:51,903	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	They're filled with ornate 18th century letter form
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:55,487	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	With their curlicues and flourishes which are confusing to the fingertip
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,047	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It's not until many years later

EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,727	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	When that uses dots instead of lines
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:12,127	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It starts when a captain from Napoleon's Army visit the school to share a system that he developed for French soldiers
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:17,759	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The captain describes how the system allowed his men to silently communicate with each other on battlefields at night
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:20,831	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	This is a clip from a very Lively educational movie about the
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:28,767	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Melee
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,071	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I called it
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:37,727	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The director of the school at the time let a group of students
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,263	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Experiment with the emboss
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:41,311	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Pages that the captain had left behind
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:42,847	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And in that group
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,895	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Was a 12 year old blind cat

EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:49,759	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Over the next few years he began to adapt that military code

EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,767	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	No
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:04,863	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I got it so that all the letters of the alphabet
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,911	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Are represented by race.

EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:12,799	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Louis Braille simplified the military code in maximize its efficiency
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:16,639	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Keep substituted D12. System developed by the captain
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,431	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Into a 6. System
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:22,271	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Which allows blind people to read faster by recognizing a letter
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:24,319	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	With a touch of a single finger
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,623	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And while this code was inscrutable decided
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,439	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It was a system that blind people need it
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:34,047	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Designed by a blind person who understood intimately the needs of those reading by touch
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:37,631	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Another advocate for the blind would say of Braille
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:39,423	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It Bears the stamp of Genius
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,703	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Like the Roman alphabet itself
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,775	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But despite its effectiveness
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,823	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Braille didn't catch on right away
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:48,639	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It wouldn't become the dominant system in France
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,175	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	For another 30 years
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:55,039	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It'll be nearly a century before it became standard for blind readers in the US
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,087	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Because it was effectively suppress
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:09:00,415	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	My well-intentioned world famous visionary
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,439	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Education
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:06,815	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Around the same time that Braille was quietly developing his new readings
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:09,887	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	An American named Samuel Gridley Howe
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,911	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Came to visit the Royal insta
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:14,751	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	He was doing research in anticipation of opening the
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,287	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	First School for the Blind in the US
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:20,895	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And I wish I could tell you that well in France how discovered the wonders of Braille
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,943	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But that's not how it went down
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:26,783	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Instead he saw the raised letter books and he was intrigued
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,343	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But in true American fashion
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:32,671	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	He found all their fancy flourishes impractical
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:34,719	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And typical of European Xs
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:39,327	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	So we decided to make his own system that improved on the Europeans were
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:45,471	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And he came back and he he modified it a bit
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:49,311	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Which how established in Massachusetts in 1829
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:51,103	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Because they were using a more
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,663	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Gothic style font that
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,431	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	He felt was
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:55,711	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Was a little
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:59,039	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Two ornamental and more difficult to read
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:09:59,807	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	By touch
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:04,159	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	So fun about ways French books look sort of like an ancient tome in a horror movie
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,975	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Whose letters rise up in fleshy protuberance
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,535	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And how system is similar
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,815	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But it looks more runic
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,327	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Kokanee
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,351	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Elvish
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,911	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	How sharpen his letters curves into
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,959	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Points to make them more distinct under the finger
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,263	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Alero for example
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:20,287	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Is shaped like a diamond
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:22,335	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	How cold is new system
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,103	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Boston line type
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:26,431	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Boston line type is is really the beginning of
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:30,783	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Literacy as we know it as a movement for
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,551	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	People who are blind
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,599	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	In the United States
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:39,487	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And like the older French system Boston linetype was designed to be read both by blind and sighted
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:43,071	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	If you're able to see and look at one of these books
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:43,839	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The letters are
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,119	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Totally easily
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:45,631	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Legible
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:49,727	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Boston line type allows blind people and sighted people
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:54,079	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	To sit down together and to read there's no barrier between them
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:57,151	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And this idea was really important to how
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,455	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	She didn't want my people to use a system
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:02,015	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Mike Brown it was separate from what side of the Equator
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:06,879	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Starwood isolate blind people and prevent them from integrating into the wider world
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:10,719	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Long before the concept of Universal Design has been articulated
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:14,047	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It was informing house thinking about how to design for people with disabilities
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,351	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I know so you can imagine
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:18,399	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The arch well we want our
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:18,911	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Kids that are blind
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,471	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Compared to use the same system that are cited
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,263	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Right.
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:25,055	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Sounds good right
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,335	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But it turns out that
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:27,615	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Racers are just not as good
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,687	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	So it's harder
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:34,783	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It just is harder it's that's not intuitive to people who recited
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:39,647	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Those letterforms are just not unique enough
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,415	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	From each other
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:41,951	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Siding people look

EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,727	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And not only that

EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,807	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	By the 1860s
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:09,855	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Some schools of the blind in the US
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,903	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Had begun experimenting with Braille

EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:19,839	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The blind students who were exposed to Braille
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:22,911	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Argued passionately for its superiority to raise letters
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:29,055	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The Missouri School for the Blind students passed each other notes and reportedly even love letters in Braille
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:32,383	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Since they knew their teachers wouldn't be able to read them if they got caught
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:38,783	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But how had invested a massive amount of time and resources into developing Distributing and promoting Basta

EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,439	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	He was a master fundraiser
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:51,071	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And key to that fundraising apparatus was the spectacle of a deaf blind girl named Laura Bridgman
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,607	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	To have taught to read
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,631	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Using Boston line time
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:57,983	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Bridgeman was the first deaf blind person in history to get in education
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:00,799	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	More than a full generation before Helen Keller did
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:04,383	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	This achievement made Laura Bridgman and Howe

EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:08,735	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Which Hal leverage to make Boston linetype

EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:14,111	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Like how
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:17,183	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Many of the directors and faculty of schools for the blind were cited
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,999	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And many of them believe that they knew which sister
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:20,767	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The most best
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:23,327	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Well it's easy for me reading a print letter so
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:25,375	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	How do you say for them with their fingers she now in
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:30,495	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I think it's a failure of imagination or failure of empathy or

EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:18,879	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I think how probably made a good-faith effort to create a universal system
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,671	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	One that predicted Universal Design

EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,303	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Paradoxically
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:29,887	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The committing so strongly to the universal page of Boston line time
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:35,007	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	How help delay the adoption of a much better system by close to a hundred years in the US
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:37,055	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Assistant with a blind person
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,847	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Louis Braille was the expert
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,919	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But the early Twentieth Century how had died

EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:59,327	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Deformed the American foundation for the blind
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:04,447	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Bafb quickly became the most powerful blindness organization in the US
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,239	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	One of their first priorities
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:08,799	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The dominant system
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:12,127	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But Americans being Americans
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:14,175	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The same thing happened at it happen with raised letters
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:16,223	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	We decided that we could design things
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:18,015	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Is better than those pretentious Europeans could
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:20,319	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Soho cottage industry a rose

EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:22,879	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Real knock off
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,183	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:27,999	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Now we're heading into what we call the war of the.
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:29,023	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Have you heard of that

EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:41,311	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	There was another 50 years of competing tactile systems
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,615	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	This. Drove many blind readers banana
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:48,223	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Because every library for the blind was filled with book printed in these multiple

EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,671	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But at one point
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:57,951	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Ahead of the

EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,519	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Finally came in 1909
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:15,359	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Cities like New York or rapidly growing and for the first time
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:19,711	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	They had enough blind children to start building day schools for the blind

EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:04,352	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	He's a blind guy who worked at the VA
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:06,144	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Testing all kinds of Technology
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:06,912	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	For the visually impaired
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,216	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	When you turn on the machine
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:10,240	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	You here
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:11,776	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	All the sounds in the ear
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:18,176	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	This is Harvey using an optophone
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:18,944	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Kind of scanner
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:23,808	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	That would look at text and turn it into a series of tones representing the shapes
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:24,320	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Cast of the letters
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:27,648	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It's another spin on Universal Design for blind readers
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:29,440	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	With an optophone
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:31,744	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	You wouldn't need to create special books
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:33,024	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	For the blind at all
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:36,352	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But training a blind person could read an ink print book
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:38,144	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Using one of these devices
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:41,216	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Delta phone was first developed in 1912
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:42,752	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But this recording
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:44,032	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Is from 1971
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:46,080	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Reading sounds like this
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:48,384	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	First off the line
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:55,552	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And then we'll read
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,600	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Incredibly
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:59,392	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Some people actually learned how to read
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:04,768	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	After a lot of practice they can hear the sounds and decode the words they represent it
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:08,096	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Reading entire novels using what came to be called musical print
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:15,776	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It said the necessary functions of the
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:20,384	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Using the devices he tested for the VA
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:22,432	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Harvey could read by vibration
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,456	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	True musical Prince
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:25,504	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Plus Braille and super speed up talk
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:26,016	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Bucks
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:28,320	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	He reads using more of his body
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,344	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Worth his senses
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:30,624	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Perhaps anyone else on the planet
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:33,184	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	His colleagues called him a cyborg
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:37,280	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	She walked around with these devices dangling around his neck wherever he went
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:39,328	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Emitting vibrations in synthetic Musical
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:42,656	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Got to go to the I had a turn up the trash or after
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,424	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Empirical
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:49,568	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Bar told me that this sometimes lead to funny incidents of confusion
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:54,944	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Like the time Harvey walked into a 7-Eleven and heard all these electronic tones coming out of the various machines in the
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:55,712	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Play Store
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,992	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	He tried to coating them
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:59,040	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Because it seemed to him like they should be alphabetic
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:00,576	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And then he realized
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,344	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Nope
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,624	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	There's just electronic tones
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:13,376	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Harvey's mistake in the 7-Eleven suggest to me away that my future as a blind reader might actually signal something
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:14,400	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Other than a total loss
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:17,216	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Linus could add something to my life
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:18,752	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Even if it takes something else away
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,056	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Learning to read in new ways
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:22,336	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Through new senses
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:23,872	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Could increase my appreciation
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:24,640	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	In for the world around me
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:31,040	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Harvey told Mara that he finds the electronic tones and chords of the optifoam beautiful
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:33,856	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	He said they remind him of Debussy music
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:35,648	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Which gives me hope
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:38,208	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	That whichever way I end up reading
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:41,280	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	To spit up synthetic speech for Braille
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:47,424	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Or maybe some high-tech post-op to phonics cyborg system that's yet to be invented that I'll find the beauty in that kind of
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:48,448	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	2
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:59,712	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I really should use the other earphones and plug in the other speaker
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:09,440	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Hypothesis are
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:15,584	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Replace it with a more adequate one
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:20,704	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Failure to find
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,832	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Does not miss sellers
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:59,360	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Give me the park composer Sean real
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:05,760	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Al gives us a short lesson in Reading with the up the phone and break down the music they can pose for this episode using OptiFine
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:06,272	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Phonic letters
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:12,928	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	After this
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:26,752	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	So I'm now in the studio with Sean real so the song at the very end
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:28,032	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The story was a
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:30,848	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Special song that related to the episode
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:33,408	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	So you can you describe I like how you made the music
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:34,176	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Traductor
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:35,200	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Piccolo section of the episode
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:38,016	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Yeah so when we were doing our edit
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:39,552	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Like
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:41,856	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Everyone was just like
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,648	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	So fascinated
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:50,048	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	By the optophone at the end of the story and throughout that whole section everyone was just going
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:51,840	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Like the sort of sounds of it we're just
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:54,400	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Prancing and so
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:58,240	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I had I was just like taking with howling music low as and I was
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:00,032	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Like this would be really cool thing to use this
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:03,104	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	An instrument and so then I asked Andrew
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:05,408	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Buddhist Peace FM
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:07,456	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	There was a way to get samples of
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:08,736	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The alphabet basic
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:10,784	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Not only like make
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,064	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Music out of
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:15,904	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The sounds but liked actually like spell something out in like make
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:17,696	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	IMessage
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:19,232	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Have been lyrics to the song
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:24,608	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I found out that it's very hard to actually write with with
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:25,632	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Optophone
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:29,216	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Samples but I'll talk a little bit more about that later
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:32,288	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I want to play you some of this because
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:34,336	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	When I was listening to
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:36,128	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The tape of like all these different letters
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:39,456	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I was really struck actually with how intuitive it is
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:40,224	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Cool
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:41,760	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Okay what's your sign
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:44,064	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	First thing I'm going to do is going to play you a no
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:44,832	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	So here's a no
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:48,928	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	What the other phone is doing it's actually scanning tags
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:50,464	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And so it's
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:52,512	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Basically making an auditory
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:58,656	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Shape of the letter so the O meaning of like the left of the oh you're going to have kind of like
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:04,032	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	To Midtown like very close to the middle and then as the circle opens up
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:05,568	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	You're going to have a tone
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:07,616	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	That is high on a tone that is low
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:10,944	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And then they're going to close back up back up okay so yeah
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,736	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Teutones the middle
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,272	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And then
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:17,344	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Expanse high and low and then goes back down to
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:18,624	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	To be in the middle in that crate
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:20,160	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It's the shape of a now so weird
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:20,928	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Skating across
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:21,696	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	What's a letter
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:23,488	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	As if it's just printed
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:27,840	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Yeah I'm so here's here's that same oh again but slow down so you can really hear it
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:31,424	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:42,432	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Another letter that I thought was the best letter x
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:43,200	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Actually
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:47,040	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Is is a w in Philly this one I think you'll really be able to hear this
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:48,320	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:51,648	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Unlike the or actually most of the letters in the alphabet
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:53,952	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	VW doesn't have any like
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:57,024	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Vertical stacking so it's really just like
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:59,328	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It really you really do like read it
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:00,864	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Left to right
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:06,752	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Like at a time so like you don't hear two tone simultaneously so you should be able to trace
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:09,312	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The W as it goes high low
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:10,080	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Hi-Lo
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:12,384	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Exactly
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:13,664	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	So here's the w
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:20,064	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Then here it is
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:25,696	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Do that again
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:31,584	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Yeah but I really love is that like
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:35,168	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	You can tell that the midpoint of the W is lower than the other
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:42,336	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Turn the outside right and so they're choosing a certain type of w it doesn't go all the way it is Anna.
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:47,456	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	W with a middle goes all the way to the Top Line and then which one what goes in the middle
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:50,016	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It's extremely specific to whatever
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:53,600	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Whatever font you have whatever page your reading make sense

EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,800	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	This type of him
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:14,080	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Just
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:15,360	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Reading numbers
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:17,664	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I'm just like really getting a kick out of it
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:23,552	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	There's an open for by golly

EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:41,472	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	He developed the other phone so like
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:47,872	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	He's probably the person most fluent in optophone he's in the world but like you said like this is us
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:49,152	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Scanner that goes across
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:53,504	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Any print that there is so it's like he's reading
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:54,272	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Ascertain
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:59,136	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Display qunar sometimes you know like I make a 7 with a crosshatch
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:00,160	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Example
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:01,440	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And so that would
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:04,000	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Sound different than a normal 7 without a cross
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,536	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Across the middle of
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,816	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	But yeah so even though
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,352	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	You know he knows
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:10,400	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The optimum better than anybody

EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:24,480	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	So inspired by the APA
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:25,760	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	The phone you compose
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:30,368	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	A couple of songs and one of them was at the end and it had a message inside of it
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:31,136	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	That was a
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:32,672	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	A true optophone message
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:34,464	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Inside of the song so what did it say
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:38,304	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Very true about the phone message and said OptiFine
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:44,704	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	That's great cuz I always what you can kind of figure out and see
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:48,800	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Stuff like that simple yet and that's and that's exactly like leading to my next Point like
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:55,200	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I tried out a lot of like different messages cuz I originally thought like who I could like have like a hole
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:56,992	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Sentence or something but
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:59,296	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	I noticed that
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:01,088	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Because these sounds are coming just
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:03,136	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	One letter at a time
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:05,952	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	It was actually really like
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:08,000	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Milotic Liam
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,280	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Portent I found
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:11,584	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Multiple letters
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,632	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	That that repeat
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:16,448	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Optophone actually kind of has a pattern to it is
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:18,496	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Opt
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,520	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Oph
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:24,384	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	Oh and so it's I can so actually every three letters is an o
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:25,920	| 01_360_The_Universal_Page_pt_01 |	And so
