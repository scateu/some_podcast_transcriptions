EDL	00:01:05,792	00:01:07,840	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	This is 99% invisible
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:08,864	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I'm Roman Mars
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:16,288	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	In the late 1800s as more and more people began to have electric lights in their homes utility
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:21,408	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Companies began looking for a good way to measure how much electricity each customer was using
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:23,968	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Actually way back when Thomas Edison built
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:25,504	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The first electric power stations
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:27,552	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	There were no electric meters in people
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:32,160	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So he build a monthly fee based on how many lightbulbs they have

EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:34,976	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	New Hampshire Public Radio
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:37,536	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	That billing / light bulb system
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:41,632	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Wasn't great so people came up with a meter that did the job well enough
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:44,960	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It's the same basic meter that most of us in the US have in our home
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:45,728	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Holmes today
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:51,872	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And the way it works is when the electricity comes into your house a little dial turns forward and shows how much you've used
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:56,480	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And even though the original designers in never really intended for this to happen
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:58,784	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	If you send electricity back into the grid
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:00,320	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Dial turns backwards
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,856	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Yashow electricity leaving your house
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:07,744	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	If you like me there's no electricity leaving your house
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:09,024	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It's only coming in
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:12,096	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	If you're like Sam who has solar panels on his roof
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:14,144	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Electricity is leaving the house
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,168	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I'm going back
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:15,936	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Into the grid
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:16,704	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:18,240	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	That's because my solar panels
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:20,032	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Create more energy than I can use
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:22,080	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	That excess energy goes back in
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,104	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The grid and
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:23,872	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Out to my neighbors
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,920	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	In my state New Hampshire
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:28,736	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I get credited for that extra energy I create
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:31,040	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It's practice called netty
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:31,808	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Metering
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:33,856	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And for a while it was totally
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:35,648	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Not controversial
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,672	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	But now it is
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:39,488	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	There are huge political battle
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,256	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Being fought over this
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:47,168	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Sam his colleagues at New Hampshire Public Radio actually did a whole episode of their podcast outside in about net mean
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,680	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Because
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:50,496	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	They are even earlier than we are
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,544	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And I'm actually just going to hand it off to them now
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:55,872	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So here's Sam in a little bit you'll hear the voices of his colleague
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,408	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Maureen McMurray
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,176	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Ann Taylor Quimby
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:04,320	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So before we get into the controversy over net metering
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:08,672	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I want to go back and introduce you to the guy who accidentally started it all
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,208	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	His name
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,232	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Steven Strong

EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:14,816	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Despite
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:15,840	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Appropriately
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:17,376	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Anime cat plugin
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,400	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	To like me
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:20,448	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Steven is in energy nerd
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:24,544	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	He's a guy who went Toyota came out with a Prius he got his engineers
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,568	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Hack the thing
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:29,920	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	What are sub gives driver looking at here
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:30,432	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Battery pack
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:33,248	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The shoehorned into the spare tire
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:36,064	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So he and his engineers
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,344	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Made a plug-in Prius
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,880	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Hundred years before the car company
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:42,720	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And also Toyota WinCo Nana's when we told him we were doing this
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:46,048	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The way back before he started messing around with Priuses
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:49,888	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Steven founded the company called solar Design Associates
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:52,448	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	This was at a time when solar power
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:55,520	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Besides being something on satellites in outer space
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,800	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Wasn't really
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:57,568	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Vignette
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:04:00,128	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	When was this again is the 70s
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:05,504	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It was a heck of a hard way to make an easy living in the 70s and the 80s and the 90s
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:07,040	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So Steven Strong is this
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:12,160	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Hard-charging ready to drop everything and get his hands dirty kind of guy
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:14,464	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And he kicked off would eventually became
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:17,024	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Kind of a revolution in the way a lot of
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:18,047	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	People are getting their energy
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,607	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	He did it by putting solar panels
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:22,143	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	On an apartment building
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,423	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	For people with modest income
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,959	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Barely acceptable
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:29,567	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Oh wow it's huge
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:34,431	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Pretty wife looks kind of like a big college dorm
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,199	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It's brick
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,479	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And pretty unremarkable
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,527	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Supposed to drive this way
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,039	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Well
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:42,111	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	That's The Story of My Life
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,135	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Boone was built
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:46,207	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	How much proof that was this massive array of solar panels
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,743	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	When the first-of-its-kind
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:50,559	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	This was one of the largest
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,351	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Source for most systems in New England
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,119	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Candid
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:56,447	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Met something like 80% of the annual hot water required
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:03,359	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	But this was this was like the early days of sources is solar thermal is just like heating hot water didn't make electricity solar
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:03,871	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Thermal
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:08,223	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	All uses solar panels but all it does is heat up hot water
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:08,735	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,015	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	That was
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:12,319	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It was cool like the simplest technology
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,599	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It's so simple
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,879	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Big Boss
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,671	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And on the inside you got some tubes
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,207	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	That are colored black
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:21,535	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And you put water in it or some sort of coolant refrigerant in there
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:23,583	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And The Sun Shines on the black tubes
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:28,959	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And heat it up and then you can circulate that back into a tank and that's all it was as I feel like I could come
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:33,567	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I think that's that's like on the level technology-wise of like using a magnifying glass
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:35,359	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Digital access
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:35,871	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Pizza Patron
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,151	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Wait
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:39,199	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The solar panels at Carter put on the White House
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,991	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Where does the solar thermal once
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:44,063	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Stupid water at the White House
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:44,831	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:47,391	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	In any case it was mostly
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,415	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Solar thermal panels
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:52,255	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Steven Strong convinced the developer to let him install a couple
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:55,071	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	A solar photovoltaic panels to
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:58,655	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Photovoltaic panels are the ones that actually make electricity
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:00,703	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And that time they were brand-new technology
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:04,543	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Not as soon as the technology was available we were employing it
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:05,823	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	But there was this question
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:08,383	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	How should I do the wiring
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:14,783	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Wait what do you mean so whenever the sun is shining obviously the electricity will go towards running all the stuff in the bill
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:19,903	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Building you know water pumps hot water heaters whatever
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,439	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Or what happens if
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:23,743	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The sun is shining and there's nothing going on in the building
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:26,047	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So what are you decided to do
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:26,815	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	We should configure
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:30,911	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	No son the building would work just like any other building
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:33,471	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It would buy electricity from utility company
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:36,543	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I'm a little dials on the electric meter would roll forward
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,335	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	5 kilowatt hours
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,871	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	10 kilowatt hours
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:43,199	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	20 30 40 50
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,735	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I don't I don't know what a watt
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:50,111	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Money
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	He don't have to know what I want
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,951	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	What a kilowatt hour is
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:58,047	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	You don't have to know all you need to know is that it's the measurement for electricity
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,607	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Just getting back to Steven solar panels
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:03,423	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	What he did that no one had ever done before was too wired up
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,191	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So that it's
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:04,959	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The Sun
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:06,239	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Was shining
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:08,543	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	In the building wasn't using any energy
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:12,383	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The unused electricity would flow out into the grid
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:14,175	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	A little dial on the meter which is
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,223	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Roll in the other direction
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,247	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Backwards
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:19,039	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	50
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:20,063	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	40
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:20,575	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	30
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:21,599	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	20
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:22,623	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	10
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:28,767	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	At the end of the month when a person comes to check the meter the owners of the building would pay for whatever the dial set
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:33,119	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So like if they use 60 kilowatt-hours but they put in 40
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,399	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The guy with a 20
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:34,911	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And it would only pay
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:37,727	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Who was just
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,519	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It was intuitive it was almost like
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,823	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	That's just the way it should be
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:48,479	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Looks like we're producing electrons that are just as valuable as the ones provided by the coal plant or the heavy residual
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:49,503	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Fuel oil drum
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:50,015	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Implant
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,575	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Why shouldn't they
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,855	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Receive the same value
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,671	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And enjoyed it just made sense
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:01,791	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Did you talk to the utility at all what did you show them your design and say this is what we're going to do
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:03,583	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	No
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:05,119	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The Developers
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:09,983	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	You should don't you don't worry about that you just got the technical side of this done and
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,007	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And get it get it working
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,055	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And we'll take care of it
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:15,103	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	We're going to be interfacing with utility
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,383	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I turned out that
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:19,711	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Did they didn't say anything about the system to the utility purposefully
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:21,247	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I am
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And told me if
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,039	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The time
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:27,391	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	There's one thing in your career that you should learn early in that is it's easier to ask for
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,927	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Forgiveness than it is to ask permission
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,327	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And that
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:38,655	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Ladies and gentlemen is how we got a little policy
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,423	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Call Net metering
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,519	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It's electric so why wouldn't he tell them
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,055	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Well
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,335	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Uncharted waters
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,871	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I would say
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,407	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	He don't want to be told no
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,455	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The net metering
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,223	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It's the net of
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,783	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	When a meter goes forward and goes backwards
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,063	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	What's in between
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,855	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Yeah net as in net
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:58,879	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Versus gross
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:01,183	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I mean the only reason it was designed that way
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is because that is what the meteor could do you know that little
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,535	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Spinning disc
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:08,351	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Electric meter all I can do is Bend forward and backwards
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:09,119	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	That's what I use
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:11,167	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	But it was well and truly the first one
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:14,239	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	That was connected to the utility grid
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,287	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Outside the fence
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,055	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The government Laboratory
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:21,407	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Okay so puts in the solar panels on the roof of this building what would happens
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:25,503	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So the utility company they were actually fine with the whole thing in fact
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:27,551	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	They praised Stevens innovation
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,599	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	But the solar panels didn't last very long
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:32,159	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Baxley blue off the building in the first year
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,183	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I didn't like
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,487	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Kumon or whatever
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,791	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is it gets windy
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:41,119	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So not a terribly auspicious start
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:44,959	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	What it did was kick off some intense interest in this idea
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:50,335	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	That solar could serve the needs of a home but also produce electricity for the grid like a tiny
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,615	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Part-time power plant
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And this concept of homeowner as power plants is actually important in thinking about how people with solar panels
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:58,527	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	On their homes will be
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:09:59,807	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Hade
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:00,831	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	For the power they're producing
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:05,951	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Because big established power plant sell power to the utility companies
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:07,999	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	At a cheaper wholesale cost
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:10,047	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And then the utility companies can
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Sell their customers at powered higher
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,375	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Retail row
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,655	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So they can make
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,423	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Profit and
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,191	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Pay for their cause
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,983	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Send the question becomes
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:19,775	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Do people with solar panels
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:25,151	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	They become like the mini power plant should they be paid the lower wholesale rate or the higher
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:25,663	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Retail row
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,991	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Are they like Costco or are they like mom-and-pop
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,295	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is that what is that it
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,575	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Elegy
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,111	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I think that's pretty good
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,159	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	In any case
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	States eventually started passing laws about
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,767	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Dairy question
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,815	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And that was all through the 80s and the 90s
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:46,911	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And for the most part these laws that the utility company should pay people
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:47,935	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The higher
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,215	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Retail rate because
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,263	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Inexpensive solar panels
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:53,311	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Your house and this would incentivize solar
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:54,591	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And eventually
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:11:00,479	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	41 States passed laws allowing people to get the tire retail rate for net metering and utility companies
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,503	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Have the time
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:03,039	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	They didn't put up much of a fight about it
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:08,159	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Jibbitz utility companies at this point they're like dancing with the devil and they don't even realize it
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:11,487	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Yeah and nobody nobody had any reason to say
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:14,047	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Oh this might not be a good idea because solar was just like this
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,839	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Weird thing
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:18,143	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Probably would never going to be cost of a
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:20,959	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And that's how it was for a bunch of years
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:24,543	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Until
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,335	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Suddenly
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,615	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Solar star
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,383	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Where to get cheap
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:32,735	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	For decades or power was so expensive and unwieldy if you can afford it
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:37,087	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And that is changing in a mind-bendingly rapid pace
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:39,391	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Solar related stocks rally.
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:41,695	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Wednesday on the news that Congress planes food
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:44,511	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Extend a solar investment tax credit
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:46,815	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	During the mid 2000
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:50,655	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	A bunch of really ambitious Well Finance Company start saying
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,191	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Hey we can make some money doing
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:57,311	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And so from 2009-2010 amount of solar in US doubled
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:12:03,711	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It doubled again from 2010 to 2011 doubled again from 2011 to 2013 and from 20
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,991	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	2013 to today
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:05,759	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It soundtrack
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,295	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Triple A game
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:09,599	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Okay so so what is
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:12,159	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	What are these companies doing that's different like how are they
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,695	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Making money what's their motto
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:15,231	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	What they're doing
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:18,303	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is there offering people solar for no money down
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:21,887	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	They pay for the cost of the panels and exchange they take
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:24,703	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	A chunk of the money that you would earn by producing power
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:31,103	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So if you had someone come and knock on your door and say hey want to be part of the next renewable energy are
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:37,503	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And you can have solar panels on your roof right now is not going to cost you any money and we're going to give you a discount on your power bill
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,015	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	That yeah
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:40,063	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And that business model
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:42,111	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is made possible by net-metering
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:44,671	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	By getting this higher retail rate
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,975	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	But our people are producing with solar
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,535	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And I think it's fair to say that the utility company
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:51,071	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Basically did not see this coming
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,119	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And so now
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:54,143	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	They're starting to push back
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,447	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	They don't want to be paying the retail rate
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:59,775	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	They think people generating electricity with solar should get
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:00,543	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The wholesale rate
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:01,823	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Just like a power play
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:04,895	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So where where are the fights happening now
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,943	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Where were the really high-profile fight over
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:10,783	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Well so the obviously Arizona is the number one
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:14,623	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So that's Christy shallenberger who works for this industry new psychology
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,903	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Utility I've attract all the
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,975	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	She points out that we've seen a net metering battles
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:19,999	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	In California
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:22,559	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And of course you have Nevada which has basically become
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,351	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The byword for what
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,375	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	You don't want to see
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,911	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Nevada's fight got really
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:29,471	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Huge huge blow back from
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:34,335	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	All walks of life basically up celebrities your presidential candidates
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,663	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I do not often get involved
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:40,223	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	State or local issues other than my own state
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:42,527	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	But I find it rather in
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,039	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Incredible
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,343	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Seattle public utilities
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:47,135	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Commission Nevada
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,719	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Has made a decision
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,767	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Which makes it hot
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,047	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	What people
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:14:02,495	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Play who's that Bernie Sanders
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:11,455	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Really that's crazy obscure policy that's getting tons of attention
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:15,807	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Hillary Clinton talk about it when she went to Nevada and talk to local newspapers there
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:16,575	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	They're fighting
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:20,927	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Iowa Texas Maine Vermont New York Utah Hawaii
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,719	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Of course right here in New Hampshire
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:24,255	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Isabel what's happening
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,023	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	All over the country
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,559	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Dubai state
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,839	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The local electric company
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:30,655	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is pushing back and all the solar installers fighting against
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,167	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Utilities
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,727	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Local
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:40,127	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Flavor to this argument but I still don't understand a little bit about this fight like why would me having solar panel
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:40,895	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	What's on my roof
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:42,687	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Why would it make the utility company like
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:43,967	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:45,247	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Angry is it just money
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:47,551	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Of course it's about money
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:48,319	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	With whose money
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,647	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Do utility companies want to reframe this argument
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:52,927	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Slipknot
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,951	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Just about there in
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,743	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	But it's about the interest
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:56,511	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The people who
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,023	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Don't have
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,351	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Here I talked to Michael herring
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:01,631	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Who
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:04,191	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Cure New Hampshire he used to be one of the guys who regulates
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:05,471	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It's a
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:08,287	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Taking from the not so
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:10,591	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	People that have not so much and giving his
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,103	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	People have more
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:15,967	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Say I was retired school teacher Manchester living in an apartment is no way I'm going
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,015	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Roof
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:21,599	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And get any benefit from that meeting but I'm going to have to pay for it
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:22,367	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Because
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,647	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Some guy in Bedford
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,671	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	She's bedford's example
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,183	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Nothing to do
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:30,047	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Bedford if you're not from New Hampshire is a wealthy suburb of Manchester
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:33,119	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Which is our biggest city 4000 square foot house
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:38,751	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And he said if I do this net metering thing in five or six years I'll be getting basically free electricity
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:42,847	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It's a reverse distribution of wealth when the way we normally do
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,127	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	United States
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,919	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And I don't think that
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,431	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Right
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:53,599	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I get it so it's like someone ultimately has to pay and all of these people who are people of means we're homeowners have
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:57,951	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Solar panels than the cost of the other utility will go up
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,999	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And that means that people who are renting
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:02,815	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Or anything like that they get screwed because I want
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,839	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Solar panels on my house
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,655	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	This is how rate structures work
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:08,191	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Write a utility is
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,471	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	A big
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:10,495	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Company that invest
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:12,287	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	What's a ton of money in
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:14,079	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Poles and wires
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:16,383	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is in energy to send across those poles and wires
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,407	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And then they take
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:18,687	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	All of the customer
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:22,271	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And they divided the cost of that up between all of them
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:23,295	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Spread it around
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,575	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And under that business
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:29,439	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	If they 50% of the people in the US went solar and started at me during
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:33,279	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	A big chunk of the money that their saving is money that's not going towards
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,815	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Paying for the poles and wires
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:37,375	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So this is the argument against net metering witches
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:38,655	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	You
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,423	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Or anything
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:45,823	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	USA me because I actually do have solar panels on my roof right because I don't screw and you yeah me putting solar panels on my roof
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:46,335	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Cost you money
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,383	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	What the hell Sam
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:49,407	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Except
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:50,943	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The problem is
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,479	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	We're not 100% sure
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:56,063	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I got to look something up cuz
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:59,391	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	This is another former regulator Cliff below
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:02,719	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	He's the one here in New Hampshire who wrote
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:06,815	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The first initial net metering law here in New Hampshire
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:08,863	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Even then
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:11,935	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	There was this intuition like this feeling
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:13,215	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	That maybe they were actually benefit
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:16,799	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So the feeling was solar Mike
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:19,359	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Higher-than-average in in value
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,639	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And I think the evidence is
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:24,223	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is proven that out over the years that solar tends to produce at higher than ever
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:24,735	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Average price hours
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:28,063	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Toe clip below is literally saying the exact
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:32,415	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Opposite thing from Michael Harrington he's saying that me 20 solar panels on my roof actually
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,183	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Saves you guys
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:35,743	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Okay but this is a pickle I don't know if I believe
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,559	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I don't think I don't think it's going to save enough money
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:39,839	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Alright so
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:42,911	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So let's first maybe dig into why it might be
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:47,775	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Even though we pay the same amount for every unit of energy on our electric bills
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:49,567	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	All electrons are not
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,079	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Created equal
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:55,199	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	In reality every 5 minutes there's a new option for energy so every 5 minutes
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,479	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	We got a new
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:57,247	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Price for Energy
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:59,295	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	When demand is low
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:01,855	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Prices are low and they can actually go negative
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,879	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Like power plants
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,415	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Us
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:06,207	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	They don't have to shut down
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,743	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Usually that's at night
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:10,303	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And when demand is high prices can be in
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:13,119	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Saying like a hundred times higher than normal
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:15,935	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And again do utilities take all of those costs
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:18,751	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The average them all out and they divide them by their customer
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:20,031	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The thing is
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,311	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Solar panel
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:22,847	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Those are producing at times of day that
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:23,871	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Really high value
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,407	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Sunny hot
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:30,015	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Desert usually times where where electricity is expensive and that's when you're producing solar power
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:32,063	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And so by feeding back into the grid
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:34,367	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	We're cutting usage
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,391	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So much that
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:36,415	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	That it lowers the price during the
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:37,695	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Exact
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:40,255	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And so Cliff below's arguing
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,791	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	These people are actually
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:43,839	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	You don't even though they're getting paid
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,631	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	More than a regular power plant
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:48,191	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	They're actually getting paid less than the energy
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:50,495	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And that means that there's
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:51,263	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Saving
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,287	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Things for every solar panel
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,055	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Can you put on the grid
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:58,943	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I would read but that's only true up until a certain point right I mean if you suddenly tip it and it's
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:03,039	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Goes from 20% of the population on solar panel to 5270 then
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:05,599	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I'm sorry clip your math doesn't work out
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,879	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	That is exactly right
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,671	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	You should go work for MIT
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:12,767	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	People do have ideas about how to solve office
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:14,559	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Which we can talk about
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:16,095	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Or we could not
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:19,935	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The most interesting to me
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,471	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is from a guy
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:22,239	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Call Don Creech
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:25,311	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Do you think of the way
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:27,103	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	That we pay for electricity
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,383	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is it dumb
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:31,711	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Deleting question yes
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:33,759	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It is clearly inappropriate
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:37,855	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	In today's technological age
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:42,975	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	To continue to charge people the same price for electricity 24/7
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:46,559	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	When the cost of providing people electricity varies
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:51,167	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Sometimes by orders of magnitude depending on the time of day and the time
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:51,935	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Year
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:53,471	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And the great condition
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:53,983	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Randstad apply
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:58,079	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So is it not then by extension also kind of dumb
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,615	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	To not very the
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:01,151	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Price that were paying
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:03,455	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Customer toward generating solar power from the roof
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:05,759	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I agree with that as well
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,319	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Don is Stacy
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:10,623	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Consumer Advocate his job is to watch out
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:12,671	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	For people who pay electric bills
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,951	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So basically he's supposed
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:16,255	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	We keeping costs down and looking out
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:16,767	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	A little guy
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:19,071	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	It simply isn't
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,583	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Fair
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:21,631	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	To take a you know
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:24,447	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Tired school teacher living on a fixed income in
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:28,287	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Manchester and force that customer
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:31,103	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	To pay subsidies to a
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:34,431	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Wealthy hedge fund manager living in Bedford
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:37,247	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Who has a mcmansion discovered in solar panel
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:44,415	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is there is there some actual retired school teacher in Manchester and some actual hedge fund manager in Bedford because my
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,183	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Michael Harrington gave me p
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:47,231	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Exact same as how could she
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:51,071	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	At not not that I'm aware of
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:52,863	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	There totally is
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:55,167	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Where are those
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:59,007	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	But anyway I mean Don Kris
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:01,055	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Also thinks that this cost
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:01,823	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Shifting thing
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,615	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is a problem
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:04,383	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And so this
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:05,919	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is what Don Chris wants
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,455	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Called
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,735	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Time-of-use rate
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:14,879	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Isn't you get paid more if your solar is going during those high-priced times like later in the afternoon
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:15,647	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	But
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:16,672	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	You also
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,976	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Hey more if you're using more energy
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:19,488	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The afternoon
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,024	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	SO2 make
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:23,840	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is really simple everyday there be a different price
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,120	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Higher price
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:27,168	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Between 2 p.m.
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:27,680	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	At 8 p.m.
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,472	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	What's the weather like for cities prices
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,104	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And this
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,664	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is cracking open the door
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:39,712	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Tor radically different weight
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:40,224	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	To pay for energy
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:42,272	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Instead of abiding by the
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:44,576	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Crazy illusion that every electron is worth
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:45,344	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Same amount
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:47,392	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is acknowledging that when demand is high
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:49,184	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Expensive
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:50,976	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And maybe we should let people know that
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:52,768	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I think that we can
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:56,352	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Provide that Morad frequently updated information to Consumers
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:58,144	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So this is Jessica Transit
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:02,240	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	She's a professor of energy studies at MIT I think that that should be possible yeah
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,776	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	But she wants to take it even a step
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:04,800	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Farther
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:06,336	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Remember there is
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:08,896	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Constantly a new price for electricity every 5 minutes
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:11,968	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And she thinks we should have a display in our houses
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:12,736	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is it says
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:13,760	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Here's the price of energy
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:14,784	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Right now
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:20,928	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Play something literally follows like the 5 minutes every 5 minutes to Market clears you get a new price
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:27,328	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Well maybe hourly you know I think 5 minutes 5 minutes might be a bit too much but but hourly
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:30,400	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	So if if you ever find a utility that wants to
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:32,192	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	To do that I'm I'm ready to sign up
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:32,704	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I'll be in the pilot
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,752	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I think I'll be fine
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:37,056	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Okay great I'll let you know I'll let
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:43,968	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Messi I actually find that really interesting because I had no idea that it buried at all and it
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:49,344	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Varies wildly and you know I don't think twice about turning the light switch on if there was a flashing
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:51,648	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Red high price alert or something
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:52,416	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Yes right
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:55,232	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Now there are some really important caveats
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:56,000	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	This pouch
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:58,560	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	41 rolling out new meters everywhere would be
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:22:59,584	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Expensive
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:04,704	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And this would be a very big maybe very difficult change in the way utilities operate
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:05,728	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	But for two
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:06,496	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	The market
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:07,776	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Can be brutal
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:11,616	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Dip their prices that can go up like a hundred times the average which is
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:12,128	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Crazy
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:15,712	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And that's why even Jessika trancik thinks that they should have
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,480	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Have a cap
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:19,040	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And why Don Chris wants this
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:19,808	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Sort of
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:22,368	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Declawed version of that
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:23,136	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Which is
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:27,232	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Look like a slightly more expensive. From 2 to 8
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,000	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	P.m.
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:30,048	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Verses really following the mark
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:32,352	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	But they both
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:34,144	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	I think it's time we looked at
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:36,960	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Redesigning the way our electricity is metered
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:38,496	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Because solar
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:39,776	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Has made everything
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:40,288	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	More,

EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,384	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Metering started
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:48,224	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	There Was An Architect guy and yeah
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:49,760	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Actually talk to him
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:56,928	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Really so you know that like he just did it without asking anybody
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:57,952	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Run backwards
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:59,232	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Just why are my building up

EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:05,632	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	But the fact is that it
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:09,984	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	You know it it was like a commission on uniform state laws got together and said
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:14,336	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	What's design a net metering statue that will promote the development of distributed generation
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:18,176	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	You know when it's really large go rigorous way

EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:24,064	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	And now it's everywhere and so it is high time for everybody to take a look at it
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:27,136	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	See what a rational well-designed and public policy would be
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:34,048	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	Is it will promote the development of distributed generation

EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:46,336	| 99pi-0257-reversingthegrid-1 |	See what a rational well-designed bit of public policy
