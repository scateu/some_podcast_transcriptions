EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:15,424	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The paper is
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:15,936	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Just wright
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:18,496	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	All these small design decisions
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:19,264	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	That contribute to
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:21,568	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	To creating a cohesive visual world
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:22,080	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	For the fountain
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:27,200	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	A scarf designs film already have two main priorities when we start designing any
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:27,968	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Proper set piece
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:31,808	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The first is to set the. And the second is deceitful okay
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:37,696	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Patient so that when the audience start watching a movie they know immediately where the story is being told and when it's 2
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:42,560	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But I think the other thing that we have to do is we have
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,328	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	2
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:45,888	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Also try to tell the story of hand as well
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,168	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	With graph
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:49,728	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So for example
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:55,104	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	If you see a sign in the backgrounds of a New York Subway scene
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:57,152	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It says Walk Don't Run
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:02,272	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You can bet any seconds after you see that the characters are actually going to start running
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:05,088	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	All the graphic design you seen a film has a job.
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:07,136	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It's moving the story forward
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:11,488	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Easy background signage seems to have a kind of a subliminal message
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:15,840	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It's always put there on purpose everything that we put in front of the camera
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:17,376	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Is that for a reason
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:21,984	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I met Annie Adkins at the aiga national design com
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:24,288	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And I interviewed her on stage and I just
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:26,080	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Loved hearing her talk about a work
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:26,848	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So I asked her to
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,664	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And today
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,944	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	We're just going to run
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:33,248	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So let's start at the beginning
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:34,784	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	How did you get into this
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:40,672	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	My very first job was on a TV show called The chutas which we made here in Dublin and Ireland
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:42,464	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	About 10 years ago now
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,024	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And I went for an interview
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:48,096	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	For the job as an assistant the art Department
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:51,680	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But when they sell my portfolio they realized I came from a graphic design background
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:54,752	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	They said we're actually looking for full-time
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:55,520	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Graphic designer
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,056	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	On the show
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:57,824	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Gradle
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:58,336	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Pieces
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:01,152	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And I couldn't understand this because
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:03,200	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It didn't make sense why they would need
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:07,040	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	A graphic designer on a show that was set in a. Before graph
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:07,808	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Designer
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:12,416	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I confirm this advertising background while we were making
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:14,720	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Logo design website
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,512	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Magazine layout
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:18,047	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And there were none of these things in
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:19,071	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The cost of
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:20,607	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Henry VIII
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:24,703	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But then I learned very quickly when I started the job.
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,727	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Just because
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,519	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	They weren't any graphic designers
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:33,407	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	In the 15th Century doesn't mean that wasn't graphic design is just that at that time it would have been the craftspeople who are the designers
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:34,175	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:34,943	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	For example
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:38,783	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Hannity 8 forms to chop his wife head off
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,831	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	He's going to need a death warrant
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:43,135	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And if he needs a death warrant
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:44,671	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	He's going to need a calligrapher
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:46,463	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Because at that time
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:49,791	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It would have been the calligrapher who is responsible for the layout
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:52,351	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The Royal Scrolls and documents and also the
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,119	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Style at the light
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:55,679	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So you become the graphic designer for the
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,703	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	15th century
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:57,983	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:04,383	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Exactly so now it's the graphic design is Rolling Stones a day to try to imitate both across teeth would have done weather.
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:05,407	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:07,711	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Ironmonger all the Glazier
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:09,247	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	All the stone Mason
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:12,831	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Talk us through the process like how do you begin how do you know
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,879	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	What your job is going to be what does it mean to
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:15,903	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	To be a graphic designer on
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:16,415	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	For certain
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:22,303	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	First of all I never know what my next job is going to be so I can't really
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:27,423	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I can't really prepare myself and I can't really learn every skill that I'm going to need
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,215	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It's like I don't know if my next job is going to be
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:33,823	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Sex in Victorian London or if it's going to be on a spaceship
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,103	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	200 years in the future
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:42,015	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So what happens is I got the call I arrive on sats I set up my tool cast I sit down with the scrap
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:45,599	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And they go through the script on by mock house and a thing that sounds like it might
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,391	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	A piece of graphic
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:47,903	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Design
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:51,487	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And while I'm making this list which we call a script breakdown
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:54,559	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I'm also beginning to research the periods
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:56,095	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	All the genre all the
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,887	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The storyline that I'm designing
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,935	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I do that for about 6
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:03,775	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Six to eight weeks prep and then shooting starts during that time
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,823	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Time is always against me and I'm
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,359	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Stuff out
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,407	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	How often are you making stuff
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,199	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Right before someone else
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:11,967	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	To hold it on
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,479	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Film
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:18,367	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Will we try to get everything made if it's a prop then we tried to get it made at least a week
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:20,415	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Before it's shots on
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,487	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Because inevitably going to be some
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:24,511	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Changes that need to be made
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:31,167	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	When I was working on the Grand Budapest Hotel I had to make a notebook for a fine to start to do stuff
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:33,215	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Andrew stuff is very
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,263	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Precise character
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:37,823	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	When refunds came in for his costume fitting
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:40,895	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	He had his notebook and all the other props that he needed
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:41,919	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The first character
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:46,783	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And he just noticed that they would no lines in the notebook could give him and made him a notebook with
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:47,807	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	App like pages
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:52,415	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Question. Because is Khartoum so precise he thought maybe it would have
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,207	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It should have lines in it
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:57,535	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So we took the truck back up to the studio and we remade the notebook
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:59,327	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Send it back down again with lines and I was fine
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,863	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But then
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:05,215	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	After the film came out and I started doing some magazine interviews about
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,751	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Designing graphic props
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,775	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I use this is my
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:11,615	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	An example because I thought it was quite interesting and quite a good example of
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:13,151	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The level of detail that react
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:13,919	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You going to
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:16,991	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But of course all the gentlest head was that
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:19,807	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I was saying that Ray Fiennes are some kind of Diva
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:25,951	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So actually I actually stopped using that as an example of because that's not what I was saying at all you know
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:29,023	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It's really it's his job to make sure that
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:35,423	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The props are rice and this our job to make sure that the props arise and this is just the kind of back-and-forth the everyday biking.
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:37,215	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Let me go straight when making things for phones
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,519	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So when you're doing that script
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,287	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Breakdown
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:44,895	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	What are some of the keywords that you're looking for that indicate that you have work to do
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:45,407	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	In that scene
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:47,967	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	That always stops me in my tracks
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,247	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	When I'm reading a script
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:50,015	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Would be the word of
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:53,599	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Because offices are just absolutely full
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:54,623	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Of paperwork
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,439	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You know like notice boards
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,207	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Filing cabinets
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:01,023	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Covered in all kinds of paper whip
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:03,583	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So that's a huge that's a huge step for the graphics
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,351	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Apartments
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,887	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	There are lots of scenes it
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:07,167	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Have a very low volume
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,447	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Graphics not really like
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:10,495	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You can kind of skim read
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,007	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Sexy
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,543	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Do you have a
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:16,639	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Liberty have a pulled out a newspaper I'll start looking in the mouth
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:19,711	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So funny
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,527	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Let's talk a little bit about so once you get
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:27,135	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The list of things that your have to work on you begin to research
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:30,719	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	What those things are what they are like
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,743	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	For this phone
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,023	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:36,351	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Could you describe what the research is
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:36,863	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Dislike
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:41,215	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So I start my research I do a little bit of research online
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:45,055	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But I find that looking things up on the internet can be misleading
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,079	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Trick of the reasons
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,127	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Festival
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:54,527	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Nobody really ever labels anything property online like if you find if you find a beautiful vintage map
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:59,391	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Tan Tumblr that's absolutely no way it's going to tell you what year is From about the dimensions of it are
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:03,231	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And then also it's really difficult to judge
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:05,023	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	By looking at pictures on a screen
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:08,095	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Scale of things and also that extra things
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:10,911	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	If I have to make a telegram
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,423	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	For example
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:13,215	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I really need
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:15,007	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	To go to a flea market
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:17,567	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Cast and find an old hologram that I can hold in my hands
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:20,639	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And then I know what kind of paper to make it out of Amino X
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,991	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I'm so I do a lot of my research
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:30,111	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	NC markets in junk shops buying old pieces on eBay
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:32,159	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Rating my grandmother's elastic
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:32,927	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	That kind of thing
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:37,535	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	What are some of the other sharks like so you do everything by hand when it
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:38,815	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Would have been done by hand
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:40,863	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	What is it
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,631	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Take-two makeup
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:42,911	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Paper love
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:43,935	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Cold
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:46,495	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You know you're making it brand new and handing it somebody
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,519	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	How do you make a
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,543	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Cement feel real
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,591	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The aging process
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:51,871	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	For Prague
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:54,175	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Is a little bit of a tricky balance
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:54,943	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Tightrope
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:55,455	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:59,039	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The pieces usually should have been brand new at the time
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,599	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	At the time that the show is Seth in
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:04,159	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	When you're making a. Drama
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,719	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	A lot of the time audiences needs
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,255	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	See a little bit of beijing
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,535	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	To really believe
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,583	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	That there in the.
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:15,679	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You know it's like we need we need to see the cracks in the converse of the oil painting
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,727	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Because that's how we see it in the gallery
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:20,543	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	We need the paper to be
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,335	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Off-white so slightly yellow
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:24,127	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Because that's how we look at all.
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:24,639	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Commence now
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,711	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But if you go too far in that direction
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:30,271	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Then all of a sudden everything looks a bit like
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,063	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I do not like an old pirate map
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:32,575	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Rice
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:39,999	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	There's a tricky balance and it varies from show so show some directors and production designers wants to go for real kind of CP
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,279	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You look and everything
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,559	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And then other directors
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,607	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Wants to
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:48,959	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Really work with the colors that they would have used at the time which is one of the reasons why it was so
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:52,799	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Wonderful working for Wisconsin because he really
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:54,079	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Like embrace
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,615	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The the colors of the periods
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:59,711	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Instead of doing that whole sepia-toned thing that we do a lot of
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,479	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The time before waxing
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:01,759	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Some kind of
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:04,063	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Drama
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,087	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Right
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:07,647	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Is there another I want to get back to
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,183	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Grand Budapest
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:10,463	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Hotel and West Anderson
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:10,975	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Second butt
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,535	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Are there other examples of
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:14,815	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Things that
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,095	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:18,911	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Researched and you know what is accurate
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:21,471	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The time for example of something being new when it was
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:21,983	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It's actually new
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:23,519	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:25,311	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You're balancing that against
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:27,359	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Expectations of what
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,919	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Want or expectations of
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,431	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Of the story
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,455	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So that
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:35,039	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	For some reason the accurate representation is not the
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,831	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Proper representation for
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,879	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Thing that you need
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:39,903	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	What to do in that story
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:45,279	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So we try to start every single prop that we make for a film with a real historical artifact
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,303	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	That we can
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,327	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Coffee bicycle
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:51,935	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And that means that we we're making things that feel really authentic instead of
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,215	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Like a movie prop
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:56,799	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So what example would be newspaper design
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:59,871	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Newspapers to use the Lost info because they're really
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:01,151	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The really good storytelling
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:04,479	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Advise if you need tell the audience that there's a war being fought
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:07,295	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You can show a newspaper headlines thing that the Bull Run
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:11,903	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Rather than she used to say she seconds possible sequence which is going to cost
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,695	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	How much money million dollars
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:17,279	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So we would start with the real reference of a newspaper
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:20,095	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Actually a lot of the time in
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,399	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Particularly in England
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:27,007	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	In the beginning of the twentieth century the broadsheet papers didn't actually have
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:29,055	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Newspaper headlines on front pages at all
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:30,847	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The front pages were covered in
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,383	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Small Lots
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,175	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Advertising local businesses
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:35,199	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Awesome things for sale
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:42,367	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So what I do when I start a project is I'll talk to the director in the production designer about this scene about bring them there
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:45,695	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Information and tell them that this is actually what a newspaper front page was like
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:47,743	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And then they make the call
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:49,791	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Whether they want to stick with historical accuracy
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,095	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Or they just want to ignore that
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,631	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Designed the newspaper
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,423	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	To suit the story that that's how they
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:58,239	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The line that gets bandied about
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,775	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Fill knots Papa
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,823	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And it always goes something like
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,919	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	We're not making a documentary about 19th century newspaper layouts
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,967	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Telling story
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,551	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Is there a part of you that
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:14,367	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Really enjoys it when it's really accurate or is it
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,135	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Do you
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:16,671	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Get more pleasure from it just
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:19,487	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Being really good in serving the story
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:19,999	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The best way possible
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:23,839	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You get the most excited when you can just going to marry the two
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:26,143	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It's exciting
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:28,447	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	To study real references
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:32,031	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Because what I find a lot of the time is that
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,335	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The truth is more info
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:39,967	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You know like if if I started a prop with just a blank page in illustrator
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:43,807	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I wouldn't be able to create something as interesting
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:50,463	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	As water is actually being designs before me ride like my imagination can't compare to the collective imagination of
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:53,791	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Hundreds and thousands of craftspeople that have
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,071	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Gone the family of the last
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,119	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Hundreds of years
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:01,471	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So it's interesting to look at something real
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:07,871	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And then develop it with the director and the production designer to suit the story because then you can make something the feels
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,407	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I'm sick but it's also
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,455	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Interesting visually
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:14,015	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Until when I'm watching you work
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:14,783	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And movies
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,063	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You put a lot of time into
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,343	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:20,159	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Do you want me to notice them
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,695	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Or do you want me to
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,463	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Kind of ignore them
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,583	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I kind of feel the
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:31,679	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	If the audience is looking at my pieces of graph
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,447	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Design
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:34,751	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Then this film isn't necessarily worth
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:39,359	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Congrats to the attention of the audience should really be on the drama that
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,639	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Unfolding between the car
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:43,711	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Like the drum the drama between the humans
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:47,295	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I think you should notice it but only subconsciously
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,831	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Like we are building a world
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:51,391	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Under using graphic design
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,159	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	To do that
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:55,999	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But the pieces is so fleeting I don't think you should really
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,535	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Register
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,815	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Everything consciously
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:01,887	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	When I watch things that I would come back with my m
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,423	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Mosa
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:05,983	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I'm always very keen that she notices everything
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:11,359	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I made that I made that and she's always like boss
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:15,711	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	This is a conundrum of almost
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,479	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Design that
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,015	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The best stuff
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:21,087	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Is meant to work in
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:22,111	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Do its job
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:24,671	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But kind of not be noticed in is there a
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:26,207	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Estate of mind that you
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,999	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Gotten into where you can
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:29,535	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Except that
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,559	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Or is it
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:31,327	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Just come naturally
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,143	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I've never felt
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:36,959	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Shih tzus in anyway. My work
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:38,239	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Doesn't get
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,031	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Screen time
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,823	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I only have a feel
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,871	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Thrills when it does get a little bit of screen
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,943	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	There's something thrilling about
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,479	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Having your way
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:50,271	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Shown on a cinema screen
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,551	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I don't know what it is
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:57,951	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	When I worked in advertising years ago you know I would design Billboards but I never got really excited
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:16:00,511	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Driving past a billboard that I designed where is
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:03,583	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	If it if I'm sitting in the cinema on something gets like a
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:07,423	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Fraction of a second of blurry
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:09,983	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Screen time then just some reason I'm really excited by
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:14,335	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I don't know what that is I suppose it's like the whole
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:17,407	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	How Hollywood star system thing getting to me
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:23,039	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It's fair you give yourself that enjoyment
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:23,807	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I'm peeing on a movie
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,319	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Screen
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:25,855	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Have you ever
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:28,927	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Really labored over something that got caught from a scene in that
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,695	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The pain you at all
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:36,863	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Yes you will come things all the time that you put a huge amounts backed into that just never gets seen
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:37,887	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	An adult on the
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,167	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	On screen or by the camera
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:42,239	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I'm actually say that most of my work
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:42,751	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It's like the
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:47,615	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	There are people who see it
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:50,943	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And the people who see it all the actors and the director
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:56,319	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And it's really like it's really exciting to Bill say for example a street scene
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:58,623	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And put up all these then
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:04,511	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Street posters in shop front signs and hunting signs and pieces of like. Advertising
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:11,423	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Amazon CV axles arrived on SAS in the morning I'm taking the surroundings and really you can see them feeling like that
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:13,215	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I've been transported to another time
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:13,983	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And then
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:17,823	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You know they go and they do that right thing and I I hope
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:18,591	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But maybe
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:24,991	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	As film designers contributes little bits to them really getting in Spyro
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:26,527	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,319	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Have you ever had an instance where
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:31,391	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	An actor really fell in love with a
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,671	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Proper something that you made
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:35,487	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I remember when we were shooting Grand Budapest
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:37,791	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	That was a prison scene
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:40,095	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	With Harvey Keitel and Ray Fiennes
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:45,471	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Ray Fiennes was admiring the prison escape map
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:48,543	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Harvey keitel's character ludvig
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,055	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	A drawn
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,847	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Gustav
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:54,175	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The character played by Ray Fiennes at Maya's it's autistic
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:54,687	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Promise
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:59,039	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Remember when I read that script page being really excited because
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:00,575	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It's very rare that
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:03,135	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Characters in The Script admire a piece of graph
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:05,439	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So I need
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:07,999	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I knew that this is going to be a big one for the graphics Department
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:11,839	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So we may as we made his prison escape map
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:17,215	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And dab it was thrown up on the back of a piece of packaging paper so we also included
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:19,263	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Packaging labeling post

EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:23,103	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	We really went all out song
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:24,127	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Jason Mewes
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:25,663	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	These pieces for this imagine

EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:30,015	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And the Empire zebrowska that was it created
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:33,599	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	When Harvey Keitel arrived over from LA
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,391	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	To do the scene
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:38,719	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	He suggested that he and all the people in the
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:40,767	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	All the other actors
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,279	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	In the scene
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:45,631	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Actually go and stay in the prison it was a real person that we were shooting in
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:47,679	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Don't stay overnight in the prison
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:50,751	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I'm take these props with them so that they could get into character
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:54,079	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So that was really fun the thought of them all going off
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,615	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	To this remote prison in the east
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:57,151	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Germany in the middle of February
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,431	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	In the snow
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,991	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I'm taking the props that weed made
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,271	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	How to get into cars
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:06,367	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	If you were to pick up a script tomorrow what would you read in the script
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,927	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	That would make you really excited
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:09,695	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	To make that
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:16,607	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I like designing things fast you have to design as a character in the film rather than as a graphic designer
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,911	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Example of prison escape map
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,703	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It's not really a graph
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:23,007	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Set designers jobs traditionally
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:23,775	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Designer
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:24,543	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Stride
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:29,663	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Set the prisoners job to draw it out themselves so you really haven't get into character and try to figure out
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:32,223	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	How that character
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:35,551	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	What tools they would have used
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,087	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	To do it you know what
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:40,927	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But they've had access to Pennzoil charcoal crayons
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,719	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	What kind of paper with Dad
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:45,023	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Access to and what would that style be like
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,327	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	What's that you mention that
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:49,119	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You've the most part you work
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:50,143	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Isn't noticed in the
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,959	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But with the
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:54,239	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	World of
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:20:00,639	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You know streaming video and the internet where people can pause in and discuss the graphic design of things
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:02,431	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You know people do notice
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:03,199	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,479	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Probably notice
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,247	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Mistakes
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,015	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:10,623	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Is absolutely full of continuity errors
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:12,415	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	On the loss of them are about graphic
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,183	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Pieces
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:15,231	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So one example is
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:17,023	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	When jumping is at the gas station
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:20,095	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The calendar on the wall says October 1932
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,887	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Vchos Oktoberfest
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:24,191	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	12/19 + 26
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:24,959	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Sundays
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:28,287	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	In 1932 those dates fell on Wednesdays
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:33,919	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	When we made the calendar we didn't think to check the day's against
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:38,015	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The dates of 1932 but then we didn't think anybody else would either
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:41,343	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I can read that kind of thing thank
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,879	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You know the Titans
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,415	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But that right
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:48,767	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And when I look back at the pieces that we made I see that yes there is never that
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:54,143	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The next job I went on to it would have been Spielberg's Bridge of spies which was a true story
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,679	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	We made a lot of
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:57,471	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	A lot of newspapers without phone
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:01,055	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And I remember speaking to check the dates against the days because I want some
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:01,567	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	To get it right
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:07,967	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And then eventually the prop Master said to me you know what I think we just going to leave the dates off
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:08,735	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:15,135	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It wasn't clear the sequence of these things going to be shown in on he says you know if if you leave the days off altogether nobody
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:15,647	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Look fresh
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:19,232	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But if you put something bad that's wrong then it might jump house
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:22,560	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	We went with no dates in the end suppose mean
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:25,632	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So when you were doing the design for the Grand Prix
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,400	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Best hotel
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:27,168	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	There was
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:27,680	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	An error
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,984	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I called him after we do a bunch of the war
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:33,312	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And it was only little pink cake boxes and
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:35,104	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	From the fictional bakery called Mendel's
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:36,640	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Can you tell us a
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:40,992	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Halfway through the chute
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:45,344	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Wisconsin section says I think there's a spelling mistake in the Mentos bulk
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,648	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And I said
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:49,184	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I don't think so because
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:53,792	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Take such great pride in my spelling and grammar
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:57,376	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And he said that has two T's and patisserie
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:22:01,472	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I looked at the box and I realized that he was right
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:02,496	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And of course
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,288	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I had a blessed.
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:06,336	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Suicide never gone through
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,104	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Spell check
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:14,528	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You know it's a word of French origin I really should have double-checked that I should have triple checked it and I just didn't
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:17,344	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And at that point we had shot
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:19,392	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So many medals boxes
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,416	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Wichita I think
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:21,440	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	2000 of them
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:24,256	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And it has to be fixed in post-production
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:31,424	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Which is great it's it's great that we have the option fixings and post but it's it's a kind of a lengthy process because you have to
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:31,936	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Change
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:35,008	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Whatever it is 25 frames per second
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:37,824	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I am so it can be quite expensive as well
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,104	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So that was embarrassing
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:46,272	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Since the film was released the mendl's box is kind of Taken on a life of its own it's kind of become a bit of an icon
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:47,808	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Come to the film so
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:54,208	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	People that people are selling them online and people making their own fake boxes and selling them and trying to pass
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:56,256	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Real props from the movie
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:58,816	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But I know when I look at them
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,120	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But it has two T's and patisserie
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:02,656	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Then
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,936	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It was really in the movie
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:07,776	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	If you have to see a box with two T's in history
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:08,288	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You should buy it
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:13,408	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And these were really iconic looking and therein
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:14,432	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	IOS movies
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:14,944	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Pink Accu
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,224	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And so
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:17,504	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	They're really up
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,016	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Very active
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:19,040	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Part of
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,576	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Of the scenes at the ran
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,344	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	2
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:23,904	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Yeah they're what we call a hero prop
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,440	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Superhero props
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:27,488	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Is any profit cats
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:31,840	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	A bit of screen time or has a kind of character of its own
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:36,192	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You can generally tell what a hero prop is because it will have a description in the script
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:38,240	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Like a lot of things that we make
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:40,032	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Can't even mentioned in the scriptures
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:40,544	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Like
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:43,360	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It doesn't it doesn't office scene
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:47,200	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And it's just assumed that we will know what's address instead of
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:50,528	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Festina the script won't go into details about notice boards and fighting cops
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:53,344	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But a hero prop will always be at least
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:55,648	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Names and mentioned and sometimes described
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:01,536	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	When we come back we'll hear from Annie about when the most difficult
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:18,944	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:22,272	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:23,552	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	If
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:29,696	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,328	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Technology talk to us
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,632	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It is a creation of Sonic trash
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:40,960	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:44,544	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:46,336	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	To make them more human
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:50,176	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Turn the living room lights on
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:51,968	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:54,528	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Dim the living room lights to 50%
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,576	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:25:02,976	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:09,536	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The movies
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,584	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And the challenges that profits on his face
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,864	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Creating a currency that
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:15,680	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	That's a look real but not so real that they get busted for counterfeit
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,984	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The preview that story
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:20,288	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I asked any icons about her experiences
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,568	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Designing money
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:24,128	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So most of the time when I have to
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:27,712	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Create currency for movie I'm really recreate
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:29,504	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Because most movies are set
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,040	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	The real world
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:34,880	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So I'll find vintage banknotes and I'll scan them
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:37,696	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And reproduce them
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,256	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	There are problems with the
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:42,560	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I think I was a shelf you know doesn't
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:44,096	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Let you do this it tells you
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:46,912	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It's it's an eagle that you can get around it with a
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:47,424	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	A little hot
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:53,312	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	And then for things like Grand Budapest Hotel I was creating a
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:54,848	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Fictitious currency because it was
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:56,128	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Fictitious Empire
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,920	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:58,688	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	That was
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:04,576	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	It's in the sense that I didn't need to worry about legal Terrence but it was really tricky because
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:05,856	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Designing a bunk gnosis
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,904	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Really difficult I'm sure it takes
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:13,280	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	People months in years to design banknotes and you know we had whatever it was
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:14,560	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Fortnite
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:16,096	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Brother legal considerations
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:18,400	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	When you're designing banknotes
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:21,728	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Well yes you needs you need to get it past legal clearance
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:27,104	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So things have to be changed slightly I mean I haven't actually made any Malden
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:29,920	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Money because I've never done a contemporary movie
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:36,576	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	But I have designs things for example for the CIA and the FBI for true story
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:40,160	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	So we wanted to use the real logos
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:41,440	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Of course because we want everything
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:45,280	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Feel authentic but that doesn't get pastelitos parents so you have to do things like
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:48,608	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Flip the eagle on the Department of State logo
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:54,240	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	You know you know in the the American seal it's an eagle holding things in his claws
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,776	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Yeah like terrorism
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:59,872	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Yeah you have to change what the eagle is holding him which way his head is facing
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:03,456	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	I guess this ain't the same
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:04,224	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Currency as well
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:09,344	| 284_Hero_Props_pt_01 |	Do you want to hear a lot more about the dangers of Designing prop money
