EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:07,744	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Due to this artist that I was going to meet that's why I was
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:12,608	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Walking through the neighborhood and what's his name his name is James Gulliver Hancock

EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:25,152	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	And I'm thinking
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:28,224	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	What do you know about the new one you live in Australia
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:28,736	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	James

EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:35,648	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	But the thing about James Gulliver Hancock is that
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:38,208	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Just knows this city
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:41,792	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	So intimately he did used to live here
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:42,560	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	From about
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,608	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	2010 to 2012
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:49,472	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	And back when he lived here in this is why I was going to meet him back when he lived here
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,240	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	He started this
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:53,056	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Pretty obsessive little project
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:54,336	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	That ultimately culminated
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:58,944	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Yes so I have the book I'll gret and the name
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:02:59,712	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Of the book
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:01,248	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	How to say I love
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,016	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	The title is
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:02,528	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	So earnest
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:03,808	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Is
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:06,880	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	All the buildings in New York all the buildings in New York
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:09,696	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	That I've drawn so far
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,256	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	It's like what I said
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:16,352	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	6 year old what is that what it was
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:17,632	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	It implies that you're going to
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,424	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Drumore
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:20,192	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Sure
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:22,752	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	I like the first part of the title of mice
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,080	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	So
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,616	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	He's saying he wants to
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:29,152	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Show all the buildings in New York
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,688	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	I think he would like to
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,992	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	How many buildings are there in New York
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:37,344	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Hunter 2000 building
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:41,440	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	It would you would probably need to spend a lot more time here
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:47,840	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Sure I actually look this up later in the New York City Property Tax annual report of 2011
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:51,936	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	It said there were 1030202
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:56,544	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Parcels but I think Parcels also includes separate condominium and rental units
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:00,640	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	And then I found myself on the website of something called emporis
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:04,480	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Which bills itself as a global provider of building information
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,272	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	And the number it said
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,296	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Was closer to
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:10,112	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	720 8452
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:14,720	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	They're closer to that closed in the book there are only about a hundred
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,256	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	70
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,791	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Most of them in Manhattan
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:20,095	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	But you'd also dry around here in Brooklyn and
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:20,863	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Everyone
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,399	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Bronson
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:22,911	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Linda Burrows
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,983	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Try to mix it up a bit
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:29,055	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	He's hit every Borough except Staten Island so he did
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:30,079	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Draw the fairy
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:36,479	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	And despite the title these are not all the buildings in New York that he's drawn so far the book is just a sampling of his
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:39,039	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Blog of the same name as blogs is called

EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:53,631	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Some of them are just black and white and Wiggly sketches others of these really loving

EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:58,495	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Just one per page mostly

EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:25,887	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Little squiggles and dots hovering above the rules
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,167	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Is that the building you're saying
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:27,935	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Lookout
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:30,495	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Maybe
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,031	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	I mean
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:34,591	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Exactly right yes okay so
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:36,127	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	What's on this project
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:38,943	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	In different fashions in different cities
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:41,503	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	I've done all the rain in London in
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:43,039	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	All the cars in Los Angeles
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:45,599	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	And all the bicycles in Berlin but
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:49,439	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	He was just passing through the city's so we didn't dig in like with the building
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:51,487	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Looks like it would parachute into a place
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:55,839	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	And immediately trying to find its noun
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:57,887	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	The thing that the city was
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,167	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	About in
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:05,567	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	I'm in Berlin mine I'll be about box Forever on that when I was there ever run out of by Candlebox all over the place
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:07,615	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Just focusing on one thing
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:09,663	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	I'm getting to know that one thing about that place
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,711	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Trying to record it as obsessively as opposed to
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:15,807	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	New York was definitely the building
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:16,831	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	And that's
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:19,135	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	When I'm going to go when I'm here
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,415	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	I just thought of doing it
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:28,351	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	James and his wife move home when she got pregnant so they could raise their kid in a place with more than one blade of grass sprouting
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:34,751	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	I can't even enjoy a blade of grass unless I know there's a Subway Andy book and the blog
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:35,263	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	Buzz
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:42,175	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	A big newspaper write-ups and a lot of mentions on the blogosphere including one that due to a glorious type
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:46,527	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	I said James is on a mission to draw the buildings in New York
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:50,111	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	A lot of coverage really frames James is a kind of Don Quixote
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:53,695	| 99pi-0092-allthebuildings-1 |	With a pen okay so how's it going so far
