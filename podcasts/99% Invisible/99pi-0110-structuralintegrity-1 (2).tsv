EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:59,104	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	It was that bad
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:05,504	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Set at the corner of the lots and when the church sold Atlantic City called it was on the condition that they built
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,528	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Build a new church

EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:14,464	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And in the airspace above it
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:16,512	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	So a plan was hatched
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:18,303	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Flute the building over the church
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,583	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Hence the stilts
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:22,399	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And because the church was in the corner of the lot
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:23,935	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	The measure put the stilts in
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,727	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Kind of weird place
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:29,055	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	You couldn't have columns in the corners where they ought to be

EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:37,247	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Placing the Cullens at the midpoint of each side rather than in the corners made the building lifts table

EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:59,263	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Skin because there was so much drama going on at the bottom and at the top anyway
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:03,871	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Should know if you're going to have any diagonals I don't ever want to say them

EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,391	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Is it so light White
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,671	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	The wind the wind blows
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:21,279	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	It is more dynamically excitable than the building that weighed twice as much
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,071	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	In other words
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:23,839	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	It movie

EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:27,935	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Which most people find really unsettling
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:29,471	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Understandably right
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:33,311	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Lamesha added something cold a tuned Mass damper
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:38,175	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	The tuned Mass damper is a massive concrete which is 29 ft
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:38,943	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Square

EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:53,023	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	It offsets the Wind Gap
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:58,655	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	So to recap we have a 59 Story Tower floating on 115 foot still
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:03,775	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Still switching not in the corner where you'd expect them but Rob it in the middle of a side of a

EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:13,759	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And to stop it from swaying in the wind there's a 400-ton block
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:15,039	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	The concrete on the roof
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,831	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Totally ingenious

EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,383	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Let's remember how we got here
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,431	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	This building was on stilts
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Because they had to build over the church
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:07,135	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Instills place at the corners would have been just fine except the church was at the corner of the lot
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:10,207	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	So the stilts had to be in the middle of each face
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:12,511	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And that could have been a okay
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:17,631	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Except the offset stilts led lamesha to use an ultra-light Chevron bracing
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:20,959	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Which would have been perfectly adequate except in the end
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:24,543	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Those Chevron V's were bolted not welded together
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:26,591	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And even that could have been fine

EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:52,223	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	So when she heard lamesha reference
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:52,991	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Students
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,527	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	A male student
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:56,319	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	I of course assumed you know
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:56,831	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Gosh
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,623	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	There was some guy
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:00,415	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Studying the building as well
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:03,487	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And wow you know how could I miss this
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:03,999	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Wow
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:09,375	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	So it was pretty remarkable but I have course assumed at the time that
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,911	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	There was another fellow who
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,447	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Been a better researcher than I had
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:16,287	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	In fact I never even considered that she might be

EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:18,591	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	That is
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:20,639	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Until she went to Princeton event

EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,479	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	When I
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:25,503	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Showed up at event
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,527	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	David said
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,575	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Well have you ever heard
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:30,879	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Of the problems with the citicorp center
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,927	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And I said yes
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:35,743	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Isn't that pretty remarkable I wonder who it was
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:38,047	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	That discovered this problem
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:43,423	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And you said you know there are very few engineering schools in New Jersey
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:44,703	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,239	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Quite frankly
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,519	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	I know all of them
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:49,311	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And I know the heads of the program
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:51,615	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Of all of them and I've talked to all of them
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:54,431	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	There was no other student from New Jersey

EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,503	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Except for you
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:02,879	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	So it must have been You by I don't know about any other student

EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:09,791	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	That's my name is David Billington that's correct and I'm an engineer
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:10,303	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Respect
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:13,119	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	53 years at Princeton
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:13,887	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Faculty member
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:18,239	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	I was dying Hartley ceases advisor she wrote the most
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:22,591	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Outstanding pieces
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:24,383	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Two big volume

EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:28,991	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	To hear Diane Hartley and David Billington
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:31,807	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Diane wasn't some in-your-face nodal
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,343	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Here's her version of the events
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,647	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	So I was 21 years old
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,695	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And there was a senior
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:40,511	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	At Princeton University where I was studying
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:43,327	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Architecture and urban planning
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,375	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	My thesis
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,399	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	I had
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:48,191	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Selected the topic of the
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:49,215	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Citicorp Center
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:49,983	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	In New York
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:53,055	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Which had only recently been completed and knocked
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:56,639	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	She reached out to limit his son to get the calculation
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:57,407	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Diagram
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:00,223	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And then she tried to replicate the math
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:00,991	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Hisself
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:04,575	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	To do the work again from the start and see if she got the same answer
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:05,855	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Tesla motors engineers
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:11,743	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	David Billington her adviser asked her to ask him about the quartering
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:15,327	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	The quartering wind I thought that was a problem
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:18,911	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And that it should be looked at so I
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:21,727	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Obtain calculations from the design engineer
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,775	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	I'm from the measurers off
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:26,335	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And I concluded the governing
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:27,359	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Loading condition
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:29,407	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Was the wind hitting
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:30,943	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	The corner of the building
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:34,271	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	The math just wasn't coming out right
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,063	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	I was struggling with the calculations
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:38,367	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	I assumed
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,135	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Of course
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:41,695	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	That the engineer had done the right thing
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,975	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And any
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:44,511	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Inconsistency that I might find
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:46,047	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Would be mayor
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,327	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Back in the building was standing
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:48,863	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	After all
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,655	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	She was just a college senior
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:52,703	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Elementary established
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:54,751	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Internationally-renowned
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:55,519	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Professional
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:57,055	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Structural engineer
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:20:03,455	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Diane got back in touch with the measures firm although she never talked with the measure herself I never called
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:06,783	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	I never said these things that
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:11,903	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	That were documented in the in the various reports that have been published today
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:17,535	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Diane Tito to Junior engineer the measured New York office named Joel Weinstein
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:23,935	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Calculations but at the end of the day no I didn't I didn't feel that I
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:26,239	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	I had put my finger on a major problem
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:28,031	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	I assumed I was wrong
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:34,431	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And wasn't understanding things
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:38,271	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Play it didn't think there was any imminent threat I mean I don't think either of us
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:41,087	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Really were in a position to say it
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:41,599	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	The time
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:44,671	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	You got to do something bill right away
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:45,695	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	We didn't have that
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:47,231	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Feeling I have the feeling that
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:49,535	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	She should talk to the designers
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,583	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And find out
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:55,423	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Weather this quartering wind has been considered and
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,447	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	So what is it
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,215	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	What was the outcome
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:21:04,127	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	But somehow dianthus cover ain't got silently passed out the totem pole within the measures firm
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:05,919	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	I said well I better check with Bill
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:09,247	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	That would have been the logical thing to do and he probably did that
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:11,551	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	I never heard that you never heard it I guess
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:16,672	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Yes we are still one staying the engineer about meeting Diane and what happened afterwards
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:20,256	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	He says he has no memory of this either way
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:22,560	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Diane remember
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:23,328	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Speaking to him
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,096	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Send it
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:24,864	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Probably happened
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,400	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And in such a sick
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:28,448	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	He would have talked him message
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,472	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	On television
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:35,872	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	So it could be that's why the measure remember speaking to a male student he was complaining Diane Hartley the student with Joline
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:36,896	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Weinstein his own staffer
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:41,248	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Now of course it is possible that there was a male
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:44,064	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	The third man is somehow
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,088	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	The same data
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:47,392	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Is Diane and actually did
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:49,184	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Hoksila measure on the phone
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:54,816	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	But I find it really hard to believe that such a person didn't come forward and claim the spotlight after the story broke
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:57,632	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Gendercide Diane definitely doesn't fit
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,424	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Poches student
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:03,264	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Chatted about a problem without even recognizing
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:04,032	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Significance
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,056	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	What she done
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:06,336	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Decades
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,896	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	It's not that I did some
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:11,968	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	It's that perhaps
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:13,248	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	What's my questions help
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,016	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Someone
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:14,528	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Figure something
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:17,600	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Perhaps my questions were meant to be
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,904	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	I think if I had
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:21,696	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Really realized
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:22,464	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	If there was a problem
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,512	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Put my finger on it
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:26,560	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	And raise it up the flagpole
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,608	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	I could Pat myself on the back
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:29,632	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Having done
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,168	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	Pretty remarkable
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:33,728	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	But at the end of the day
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:36,032	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	I feel like I was a bit

EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:39,360	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	That had a happy ending
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,944	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	So yes she deserves
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,224	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	More credits
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:47,808	| 99pi-0110-structuralintegrity-1 (2) |	You can tell her that
