EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:57,504	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So I was getting ready to make a presentation

EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:14,400	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Okay so it was a proposal for a brand new
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:15,424	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Emoji
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:18,240	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You know those little pictograms we used to text
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,008	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Each other
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:22,592	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Thumbs up the woman dancing for the little yellow faces that
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,360	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Smile
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:24,128	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Winker
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,664	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It works sunglasses
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:31,296	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Okay I know what an emoji is Mark Z's I'm not battle
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:41,792	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You sound so nervous I know it's
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:43,584	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Really really embarrassing
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,680	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I'll let you know how it goes
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:55,616	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Okay so before you tell us what your emoji was and what they got approved
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,640	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I feel like
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,920	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	We should start with something like
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:00,480	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Why why am I doing this whole thing
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:02,528	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Exactly why are you doing this all day
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,064	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Right so
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:08,160	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Create Emoji it was not too because I actually planned on
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:14,048	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But you do cover this stuff you have a podcast called Welcome to Macintosh you cover things like the intersection of Tech & Co
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:16,096	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Culture and service seems to be part of your be
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:18,912	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Exactly and you know I think emoji
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:20,704	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	They're kind of right at that intersect
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,728	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	They've become this
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:25,056	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Really interesting part of the way that we communicate
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:25,824	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	There's kind of
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:29,152	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Universally spoken language of pictures
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,944	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But going into all this
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:33,504	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I didn't really know that much about emoji
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:35,552	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So I reached out to Jeremy Burger
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:37,856	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	He's the creator of emojipedia
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,136	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	My job is
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:45,792	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Keeping on top of any new emojis and serve documenting how they change over time so it's her a real
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:49,632	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Set of History lesson. Emoji they started in Japan in the 90
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:57,312	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	The first set of emojis was designed for a Japanese cell phone company by this guy named chica Taco Cody.
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,080	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	In 1998
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:01,408	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	When texting was still really new
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:04,992	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	There's only a hundred seventy six of them and they were 12 by 12 pixels
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:09,344	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So that's really low rats for an emoji that's super Lopez
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:13,440	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But these were like the first images that can be sent by a text message
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:15,232	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Before photos or anything like that
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,280	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You see the Japanese Wednesday
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:23,167	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Very basic abstract pixel art
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:26,239	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So these super low res emojis
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,775	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Became really popular in Japan
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,823	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And quickly
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:32,383	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Almost all Japanese text messages became
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:34,175	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Dotted with these cute little pictures
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:37,759	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But they were still only available on Japanese cell phone
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:41,599	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Depending on which carrier people in Japan were using
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:44,159	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	These emojis could be different from phone to phone
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,327	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	That's that's a problem
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:54,143	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It seems like in our modern world of computers
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,191	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	This should not be happening
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:05:02,335	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But the reason that this was happening was that when different cell carriers in Japan added these images for their customers
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:04,383	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	The encoded them
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:10,015	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So when are you taking just a minute to explain what character encoding is this is Mark Davis
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:13,599	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Every time you see a character on the screen on your
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,647	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Mobile or laptop
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:18,207	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It's always represent internally by a number
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:21,279	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So there's some number associated with the letter A
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:23,583	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So the problem in Japan was that
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:25,631	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	The companies weren't coordinating about
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:28,191	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	What emojis were assigned to what number
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:31,007	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So one company might have the hamburger in coded as
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:33,055	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	46790
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:37,663	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Well another carrier would have the Pooh raincoat it is 44790
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:40,991	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So when American cell phone companies decided that
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:43,039	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	They wanted to enter the Japanese Market
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:49,183	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	They do that thing he did the coating for these emojis to become standardized and they turn to Mark and his organization
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:51,999	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	A group called the Unicode
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:56,351	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I'm the president of chicken care Consortium
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:57,631	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	People behind the curtains
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:00,447	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Making sure that everything works
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:05,311	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Can like plumbers you know you don't notice them as long as the water keeps flowing
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:08,127	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	They're doing the 99% invisible work
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:09,151	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	The internet
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,175	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	If you will
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:12,479	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I guess all that was
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:16,831	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So the Unicode Consortium had already been working on standardization for a while
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:18,623	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Emoji with text
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:22,207	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	The Consortium was founded back in the early days of the internet
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:26,559	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	When there is no Universal standard for encoding texter
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,583	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Anything else you saw online
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:34,239	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	People at the time we're really used to getting emails or looking at websites and they would see.
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:38,591	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Jumbled up garbage on the screen because it was the wrong encoding
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:44,223	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	The internet used to be so ugly like when you were baby you don't even know the internet
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:47,807	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Yeah I have I have heard stories
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:50,367	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Unicode they were founded to help with that
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:52,159	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Most of the work has to do with length
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,951	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You're making sure
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:56,767	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But even little known languages are legible across
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,303	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Websites and Platt
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:03,935	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	That seems totally fair that make the World Wide Web worldwide make sure everyone can be represented
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,727	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And ultimately
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:09,055	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Unicode became the be-all end-all text encoding
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:12,127	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So since people were already relying on your coat
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,663	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Standardized testing coding
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:18,527	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I thought why don't we get these guys to do Emojis for us to
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,295	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Though
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:22,879	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	When Unicode was first approached about emojis in the early 2000s
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:23,647	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	They weren't interested
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:26,207	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	They thought that these cute little pictures
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,511	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	They're probably a passing fad
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:34,143	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I think we were all kind of hoping and praying for that emojis are here to stay
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:37,727	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And Fighters later around 2006
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:40,543	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Unicode realized emojis were not going any
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,871	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So they decided to take on the project of standardizing
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,407	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So they looked at
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:48,735	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	All the different emoji that have been created by the Japanese carriers
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:50,271	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Sorting through them to establish
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,063	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	An initial core Library
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:54,879	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So what was in that original set of emojis
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,415	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It was
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,695	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Kind of a hodgepodge
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,743	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	2 camels
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:05,119	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	That for mailboxes 5 train
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:10,239	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It's really important and so once they had that core Library
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:13,311	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Unicode decided that all additional emojis
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,591	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Should be considered very careful
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:17,663	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And voted on and approved by Davis and the rest of the
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,455	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	No more
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Two camels
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:20,991	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Slipping through the cracks
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:26,367	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Each emoji that we encode we really have to think does this sort of break new ground
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:30,719	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Does it isn't going any direction is it going to be
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:33,279	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Extremely popular because we know the faces for exam
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,863	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You know the parts are very popular and so
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:40,959	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So we try to wail these factors when we pick us up
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:46,591	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Guys really do pick all the emojis that are on my phone that they they are the ones who decide
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:48,127	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Yeah yeah exactly
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:49,919	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	4 times a year
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:52,991	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Unicode meets to consider all the proposal they have for new emoji
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:56,319	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And they are the final say in which ones are free
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,879	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And once an emoji is approved
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,159	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It never goes away
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,207	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Emoji can only be added
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Once an emoji always an emoji
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,279	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Get out
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:09,887	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And who comes up with these new ideas for emojis like who gets to submit proposals
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:11,679	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So I had this question 2
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:15,007	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And I asked Jeremy the guy from emojipedia
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:19,359	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And this is what turned this story from idle curiosity
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,895	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Into a year-long
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,199	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	The Proposal
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,991	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Like who is actually
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,271	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Responsible for
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,295	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Bringing these
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,087	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Emoji into the world
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:31,135	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Richly anybody anyone on the planet
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:32,671	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Can send a proposal in right now
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:37,279	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Unicorn would look at it and there's a chance that it could become an actual emoji
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:38,815	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So so like
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,351	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I could do
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,631	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Like I could send
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,143	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I could send it
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:43,679	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Yes
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,471	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So of course
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:47,007	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	When Jeremy told me that
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:51,359	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I knew that I had to submit a proposal for an emoji
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:54,175	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	What better way to understand the process been to go through it myself
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,455	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:57,247	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I didn't really have an idea for
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,271	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	What I wanted
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,039	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Propose
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:01,343	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So Jeremy gave me a few basic guidelines
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:08,255	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You should be trying to prove this old ready to man before you got involved don't start a petition and generate demand
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:10,815	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	He said that Unicode wants people writing proposals
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	To cite evidence of demand like
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:15,423	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	#usage on Twitter Instagram
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,447	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Or Google search
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:20,287	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	He also said that my proposed Emoji it should be visually distinct
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:25,663	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	If it looks the same as something else it doesn't matter if it means something different emojis about what they look like
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:26,687	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,735	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Two specific
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:33,087	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But it can't be for this one really specific kind of dinosaur whatever
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:35,391	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And at the opposite end of the spectrum
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,415	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It can't be too big
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Know if your emoji with just dinosaur
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,023	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You might need more specificity
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:42,815	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Like T-Rex
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,375	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	What's a pretty fine line but I think I can
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:45,887	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,423	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Another thing
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:49,215	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	They don't want to add an emoji that
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,727	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Potentially just
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,287	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	A fad right I get that
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,567	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	That so you don't want an emoji of like a
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:56,895	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I don't like a fidget spinner or something like that
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,919	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Yeah yeah exactly
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:58,943	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Fidget spinners
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,223	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Who knows how long those will be
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:03,295	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You also can submit logos
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,319	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Brands
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:06,111	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Pacific people deities
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:08,159	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Etcetera Superman and Batman
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:12,767	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Starbucks and those are just not going to be included they have to be generic
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:13,791	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	They're already like
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:19,935	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Do you thousand emojis right there's 2666 as of hasn't recorded
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:27,615	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	If you're not going to do Batman and Superman what doesn't exist yet that you could actually propose
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:30,175	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So I actually asked Jeremy this
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,967	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	What do people really really want
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,247	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And this is what he
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:34,527	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Sorry
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,831	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	There is a yoga
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:43,231	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Because what's up popular activity little lot of people around the world do if somebody decided to submit yoga and all meditating
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:43,999	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I think that would
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:44,767	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Eclectic
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,071	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:47,583	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I'll be honest
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:48,863	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I've never done you
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:53,471	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I never meditated strong feelings about either one
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,007	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,543	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I wanted to pitch in emoji
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:12:02,943	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And this had good odds of being approved so namaste
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,479	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I went I went full Namaste on
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:09,343	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	All kinds of research about yoga and meditation
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:16,255	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Did you know for example Roman that there are 35 million Instagram post with hashtag yoga compared to
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,023	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	#running
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:21,119	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Paltry 31 million
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:23,679	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	There have to be an emoji for yoga SF
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:25,471	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	What would you use to represent that
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:31,615	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So I actually decided to go with an image that I felt represented both meditation and yoga
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,151	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	A person in Lotus
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:36,735	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I'm at the one where you said cross-legged and you have your hands
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:41,855	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Face up on each near and yeah
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:42,623	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Famous
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,903	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Cross-legged sitting
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:45,183	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Yeah and so
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:47,743	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I found some clipart on the internet to illustrate
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,535	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	What the Emoji might look like
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:52,607	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And in the end I put together this eight page proposal
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,119	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	To submit to you
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,935	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I don't pretty good about it but
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:59,263	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I wanted to run it by someone would actually gone through the process
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:04,639	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	My name is Jenna Fraley and Isaac's actually proposed a 🥟
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:09,247	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Her middle name is actually the number 8 which is so cool and she was actually in an episode that we did about
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:09,759	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Fortune cookie
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:12,575	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Yeah and she actually successfully made of
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:14,111	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	A 🥠 as well
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,391	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Anyway
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,415	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Back in 2015
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:20,255	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	When we was working on getting the 🥟 added into
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:23,327	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	She learns that Unicode is this nonprofit
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:26,655	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But it is controlled by a small handful of
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:34,079	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Yeah that one hit 11 full voting members of $18,000 a year to vote so
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:37,407	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	11/8 of them were us multinational company
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:41,503	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Does oracle IBM Google Apple Facebook Yahoo
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,783	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Microsoft and Adobe
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:45,343	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Of the other three
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:47,647	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	They were the German software company sap
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:52,767	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	The Chinese Telecom company Huawei and the government of Oman
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,559	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Did she say the government of Oman
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:56,095	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Yeah because
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:14:02,239	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Remember most of what Unico does has nothing to do with emoji and mostly to do with in coding language on the
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:08,383	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So the government is there to advocate for greater Arabic language support on computer
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,151	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Oh that makes
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,431	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:13,247	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And now we is a part of the Emoji subbed
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:18,879	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You can't vote on which Emoji get approved but she is able to help novices like
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,647	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Myself
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:21,183	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Navigate the difficult path
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:21,951	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Two emojis
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:24,511	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So I showed her my proposal
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,047	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It looks
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,839	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Pretty solid yes
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:30,911	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But I think your emoji characters are little bit ugly
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:32,959	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	No
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:33,983	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Well
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:36,543	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You did use clipart
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,311	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Fair
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:42,175	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Fair probably not the standard of emoji characters I don't know where you got them but you might do them
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:47,039	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	In more like either the APA style or more of the Google style she was right
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,319	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	My design
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:48,831	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Was not great
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:50,111	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:52,159	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I ditched these clipart images
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:52,927	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And hired a professional
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,719	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	A woman named Abby Messer
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,279	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Just to let my case would be stronger
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:15:00,863	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And unicode would have a better idea of what this Emoji could look like
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,911	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I polished my proposal
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:04,703	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Person meditating
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:05,471	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And submitted it
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,007	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Wright Avenue
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:09,567	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And then a few weeks later
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:12,895	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So I'm just coming into the studio now I just got an email
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:14,175	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	From unicode
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:15,967	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	She let me load it up
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:19,807	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Says
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:24,671	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	The Emoji subcommittee has decided to forward your proposal to the UTC
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:29,023	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Docket number will BL2 / 16 -
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:30,303	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	279
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:31,839	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Regards
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:35,167	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	All right
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,191	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	All right that's it
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:44,895	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So that sounds like good news but what does that actually mean basically means that I got through the first round
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:47,455	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	That Unicode was going to hold
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,991	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Unofficial vote on my emoji
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:53,087	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And at this point you know you can sit back and see what happens
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:55,903	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Or if you are extra excited
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,671	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Like I was
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:16:00,255	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You can actually show up to a quarterly meeting of the Unicode technical committee
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:02,047	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And present your proposal in real
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,863	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Is it that brings us back to you being
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,655	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Super nervous before your presentation
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,703	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Back in November
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:09,727	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:13,055	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It is Monday
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,103	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	November 7th
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:16,895	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	2016
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:20,735	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Today is the day that I'm presenting to the Unicode
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,527	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Technical committee
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:25,343	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But before we get to that
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:28,159	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I want to talk about someone I met while I was there in the Bay Area
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:30,975	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	She was also there to make a presentation to you
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,023	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Her name is Rio Alameda
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:36,863	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	My name is Rafael from Brady I'm 15 years old
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:40,959	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	She's 15 years old like in high school and she wrote up one of these proposals like you did
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:43,007	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Yeah this is
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:44,031	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	No small task
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,567	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I've never written any
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:49,407	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Proposals whatsoever the closest thing I've done we're lab report
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,687	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Inside slots
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:51,455	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But for real
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:55,039	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	This whole thing just had a totally different level of importance
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:59,391	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You mean that some people do this not just to make up cool radio psoriatic
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:01,183	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Folkyeah
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:03,231	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Because emojis represent culture
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:07,583	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And just like it matters to see a representation of your culture in
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,375	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Television in the movies
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:13,215	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Turn yourself in an emoji can feel important in the same way
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:13,983	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I mean
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,775	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Humans all over the world Shenzhen like
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:20,383	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	6 billion of these little things to each other everyday totally there everywhere
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:20,895	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:23,711	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And so in The Last 5 Years
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:26,271	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Unicode has tried to represent more people
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,039	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	By adding
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,831	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Characters with a range of different skin tone
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:33,695	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	They batted some gay characters and gender-neutral androgynous ones as well
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:36,767	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But there was still no one that looks like Ray you
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,279	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Because
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,071	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	She wears a hijab
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:42,399	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Aikido be nice for me to
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:45,727	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	On the keyboards
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,495	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	That I could use
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:52,895	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Felt like her Emoji would help other women who wear hijabs feel more represented in mainstream
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:18:00,063	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Even though it is something small I think it will you notice normalize the hijab you'll definitely be
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:01,343	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	That might be the coolest like
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:03,391	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Coolest kids
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,671	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I like it because it does
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:10,559	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Pause I just told her friends were going to have to sell cupcakes
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:12,095	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Even for the teachers
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,375	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It be something so amazing
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:14,399	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Hopefully desk
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:17,727	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Well now I'm totally rooting for you
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:23,615	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Choose more than one rabbit you can root for us both if it's between you and her
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:25,663	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It's definitely her
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:28,223	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Okay that's that's fair that's
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:32,575	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So are you tonight we're both presenting to Unicode on the same day
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:36,927	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	11:30
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:43,327	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	When it was my turn they made me turn off my microphone
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,375	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So I don't have tape of what I say
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:49,215	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But basically I gave a little spiel about
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:52,031	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Why the world was in dire need of a yoga emoji
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:54,847	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I got a few laughs heads
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:57,663	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It lasted about 5 minutes
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,943	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Then I took a few question
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:01,759	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	After it was over I stood there
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:03,551	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Waiting for some indication of
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:05,343	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Weather in the committee liked it
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:06,623	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And if they like it
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,647	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	They wouldn't say
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:11,231	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Finally someone told me basically you need to leave so we can vote
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:13,279	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I left
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:16,095	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I just figured that they'd be in touch soon
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:19,167	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Okay yeah
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:22,239	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So if your emoji is approved
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,519	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Then what happens next
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:28,383	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So even though I submitted this really beautiful visual for my person meditating emoji
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:31,711	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It's really more just to demonstrate what it could look like
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:33,247	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Ultimately
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:35,039	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	If emojis approved
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:38,367	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Google Facebook and apple and all other platforms
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:43,487	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Will get to decide what exactly person meditating looks like in their own platform Style
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,791	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So I talk to someone from Google
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:50,399	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	My name is Rachel being I'm a creative director at Google
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:52,447	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	On the material design team
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,215	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Butts
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:54,239	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	She has another title
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:56,799	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Oh yes
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:59,359	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I am also
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,383	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Funnily enough
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:02,431	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	The creative director of emoji
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:03,455	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Google
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:08,575	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Once Rachel bean and her team get the list of new emojis and their codes from unicode
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:11,903	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Those are the images to be used on all of Google's Android phone
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:14,975	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And what kind of guidance do they get from Unicode about
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:16,767	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	How to draw them how to make them look
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:19,071	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Right so they don't actually give them
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:24,703	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	All that much they give them the name of the emoji and a few key words of things that might represent
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:27,007	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Occasionally they might give
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:28,543	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	A little bit of guidance of
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:29,311	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You know
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:31,359	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	The Bagel Emoji it should be drawn slice
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:33,407	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So that people won't confuse it with the donor
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,711	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	To it
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:37,759	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So that makes it so that Google emojis
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,551	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I'm different from Apple emojis and they look
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,367	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Twitter emojis are all different
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:43,647	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Exactly
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:45,183	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Characters might be facing in a
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:46,463	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Different direction
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:49,791	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	A different outfits on or maybe dancing another Style
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:52,863	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But it's all illustrate the same basic con
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,655	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And recently
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:58,751	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Rachel be in entertainment Google have redesigned the entire Library
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:20:59,519	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Of Android
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:02,079	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Broly emojis that weren't
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:03,359	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Disembodied faces
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:05,151	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	The team had to deeply consider
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:06,943	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	All the clothing and accessories that they were
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:08,735	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Because
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:10,271	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Designing for a global audience
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,575	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Take for example the farmer
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:19,232	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Originally we had designed the farmer Emoji very American Gothic style
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:20,000	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,024	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Pitchfork
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:23,328	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And wearing overalls
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,096	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:26,144	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	A lot of farmers all around the world
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:27,424	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	They don't actually use
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:28,192	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Pitchforks
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:31,520	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It's kind of an old and very American characterization
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:34,080	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And also the overalls to some degree
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:38,432	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Weren't necessarily the outfit the most Farmers globally where
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:42,528	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So you change the actual profit the farmer was holding into a grain
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:45,600	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So to really put more emphasis on what
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:49,184	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Grown University versus tools that may not be universally used
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:52,768	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And this kind of global inclusivity
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:56,096	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Is the same stuff they'll have to consider with the Emoji that I propose
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,888	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You know other person meditate
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,680	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	What will it wear
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:01,472	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Like what's the color of the clothing
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:02,240	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Is
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:04,288	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	He or she or they going to be wearing
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:06,336	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Games
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:08,384	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Leotard tshirt
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:10,688	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You know it's good that they're thinking about this but
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:15,552	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	The Google designers and never going to really be able to fairly represent all culture
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:16,832	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Right
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:19,136	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And unicode is this governing body with
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,416	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	A bunch of Representatives
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:21,952	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But they're all mostly from these
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:22,464	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Big Tex
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:25,792	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And so this whole system it
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:26,560	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Kind of works.
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:30,656	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Is not a good system you shouldn't have to ask these people's permission
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:36,032	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	This is Keith winstein I'm Keith winstein I'm an assistant professor of computer science here Stanford
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:40,896	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And he says if there is not an emoji that represents you order
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:41,408	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Your culture
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:44,736	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Unicode process for getting one is not exactly
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:49,344	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But having to wait until two or three years for it to end up in the standard and that's a long time
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,392	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It doesn't take
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:54,208	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Quite that long anymore it's closer to 1 or 2 years
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:56,000	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	But still
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:59,072	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Winston points out that are already platforms like
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:02,144	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Swac that let you take an image and make an emoji size
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:08,544	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	You don't need to go through Unicode yeah totally because a critical stat on our staff he does this any makes a
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:11,616	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Mod for every episode of we shared when the episode comes out
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:15,200	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And is this a little picture it's not really an emoji
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:15,712	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Exactly
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:19,040	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And so there is no special encoding process
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:19,552	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Required to make
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:23,392	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	This is a much simpler way of doing it rather than trying to cram everything into
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:23,904	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Unicode
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:28,256	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And even though I think Winston gets at some really important criticisms
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:31,328	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	If we went to a system where we really just sent
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,096	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Tiny pictures
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:34,912	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Then the things that I really love about emojis
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,936	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	What kind of bee loss
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:38,752	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Which is that they turned into this store
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:41,312	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Universal standardized language of pictures
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:47,968	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Like the idea that some stranger in Argentina and I are both sending a 😍 to express love
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:50,784	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Think there's something really cool about that
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:54,112	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	That is a nice quality to another Universal
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:57,696	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So so what happened with your meditating person you must know by now
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,000	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	So for a few days after my presentation
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,792	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I still haven't heard anything
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:05,120	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	No email thanking me for my proposal 1
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:07,168	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Letting me know when I hear back or
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:07,680	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	Anything you like
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:09,728	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	It was just total radios
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:13,568	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	And then I was just scrolling on Twitter
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:15,872	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	I'm so I just saw
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:18,688	| 99pi-0272-personinlotusposition-1 |	That emojipedia has a
