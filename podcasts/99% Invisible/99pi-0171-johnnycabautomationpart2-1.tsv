EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:09,663	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Automation has been appearing in cars almost since they hit the market anti-lock brakes automatic transmission powers

EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:17,855	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	It's been a long time coming
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:21,439	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	There's been a few players developing self-driving car technology
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,487	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	The most visible among them
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:23,999	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Being Google
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,791	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	In 2009
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:29,887	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Google began retrofitting Toyota and Lexus cars with new technologies
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,935	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Allowing the car to drive on its own
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:39,359	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	The cars can accelerate stop at traffic signals make turns merge onto freeways and avoid pedestrians cyclists another
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:43,711	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	All with little or no intervention from anyone inside the car
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:45,247	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	And then in 2014
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,527	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Google started Manufacturing
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:47,551	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Their own
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,599	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Cute little two-seaters

EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:04,959	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Google has videos that show blind people and children sitting in what we normally think of as the driver seat
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:06,239	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	As the car scoots
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,519	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Around a test track
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:09,055	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Pulling Santa's sleigh
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,591	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	You shouldn't have to have any training
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:13,663	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	You should be able to get in them tell them where you want to go
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,991	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Tell them you changed your mind do you want to go somewhere else and then get out
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:18,015	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Google wouldn't show me the
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:19,807	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	But Chris
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:21,599	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Did show them to Planet money's
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,367	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Steve head
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:24,927	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	So I you want to open it up and show me the inside
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:30,303	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	So this is one of our early prototypes will actually start our 5th generation prototype
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:36,447	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	This vehicle is one of the ones that will start to be testing on the roads in Mountain View in the next over the summer
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:38,495	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	We talked to Steve about what it was like after
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,031	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	When you get inside
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,823	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	There's no dashboard there's no
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,359	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Steering column so I'm about to
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,151	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Tall and
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:46,687	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	The seat is all the way again
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,455	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	What's the back window
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:47,967	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Of the car and I can
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:48,991	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Take my legs
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:50,527	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Straight out in front of me
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,063	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Because there's nothing there
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:56,159	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Well almost nothing what you can see in the center here so this is
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:58,975	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	The steering wheel brake and gas pedals and lessor for our test drivers
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:04,095	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	But their removable California law allows autonomous cars on the roadways but
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,119	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Only if they
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:06,911	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Can be driven by a human
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:09,215	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	But the design of this car is to have none of them
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:11,775	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Right into their very very few
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,567	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	User controls in
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,079	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Inside
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:17,151	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	There are buttons to lower the windows
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,687	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	There's a button
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:21,759	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	To pull over to the side of the road and stop
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:26,623	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	You know if you suddenly see a yard sale if you want to check out our friend do you want to pull over and talk to
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:31,743	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	But is also an emergency stop button a button that halts the car and its track
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:38,143	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Skellige on an elevator you know how they say it the big red button while they're still you know I really need to get out now there's some
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:38,911	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Something very wrong here
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:43,007	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	I've never press the red button elevator but it's kind of comforting notes there
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,543	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	The cars look kind of endearing
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:48,383	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Goofy the small and round Steve versus them as bubble cars
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:50,687	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Not that they would let him ride in one
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,967	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Yeah so they didn't
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:55,551	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Let me ride around in the bubble car and in fact the bubble car hadn't hit
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,063	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	The streets of man
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:58,623	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	But he was able to get inside one of their older mod
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:00,159	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	With a retrofitted

EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:01,951	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	TV okay
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:03,487	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Should I jump in the front or the back
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:07,071	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	You should yeah probably this back
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:09,119	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Corner right here
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:12,191	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	I think the most remarkable thing for me
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,495	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Was how quickly the
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,263	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Experience
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:15,775	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Became
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:21,919	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Just kind of boring it came to a full and complete stop at the
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:28,319	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Stop sign definitely soda car follows the law very closely
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:31,903	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Passenger the car is driving with more or less indistinguishable from a human driver
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:37,279	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Well a human driver that always follows the rules of the road we were driving
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,047	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	True residential
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:39,327	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	In Mountain View
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,911	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Including through streets that were under
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:45,983	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Construction so it was navigating
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:48,799	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Streetscapes that were changing
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:51,615	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	You know lanes were blocked off Lanes
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,383	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Foreclosed
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:56,479	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	And at one point on their drive a construction worker was directing traffic
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:59,551	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	And Steve was chatting with the other person in the car
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,575	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	We were both sort of
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,343	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Distracted
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:07,743	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	And suddenly all on its own wow
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:13,375	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Car slammed on the brakes it was startling
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,679	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Steven the Google employees hadn't seen it
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:20,543	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	But the construction worker had flipped his handheld sign from slow to stop
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,847	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	The machine had noticed that handheld stops
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:23,871	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	When all of a sudden
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,663	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	That actually kind of
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,175	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Scared
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,967	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Because we didn't see it
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:30,783	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Even the Google employees hadn't seen that before
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:34,367	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	The autonomous car was working better than they had expected
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:36,927	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Maybe these things can react faster than
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:42,303	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	But sensors will fail navigation will get screwy onboard computers
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,071	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Will break
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:47,167	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Car owners barely know how to fix their own Vehicles as it is now so
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:52,287	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Will people be able to fix the kinds of complicated problems that come with a self-driving car
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:54,079	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Payday really depends on
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:56,639	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	How they end up being using a mark
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,407	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Right
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Chris imagines that if a self-driving car breaks while it's on the road
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:02,015	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	It'll pull over
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:04,063	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Another car will come fetch the passengers
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:05,855	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Leaving the broken one for technicians.
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,135	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Which means
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:10,719	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Google doesn't want to just change how we relate to our cars
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,535	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Google wants to change how cars
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:15,071	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Relate to society
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,375	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	If you look at the car that you own today
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,399	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	You know it's

EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:25,567	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Now both your kind of financial resources that went into it
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:31,967	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	But also the environmental resources that the material and energy we put into making that vehicle so we can use that more efficiently by sharing at that sounds

EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:48,607	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	In other words it's possible that these cars could enable a world in which no one owns a car and all of us just

EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,167	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Well
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,959	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	What's the great thing about predict

EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:07,039	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Kostas Samaras has thought a lot about how self-driving cars will change society
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:12,415	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	He is the co-author of a report called autonomous vehicle technology a guide for policy
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:18,047	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Jocasta like Chris urmson and pretty much everyone else I meant working on autonomous vehicles
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:22,399	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	He thinks that these things hold a lot of Promise so reducing crashes
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:23,935	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	The first wave that automation
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,471	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Help Society
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:27,007	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	But that's really only the starting point
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:31,871	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	After all the vast majority of American cities are built around cars
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:35,967	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	And so transforming the car means transforming the city
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,503	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Starting with parking lot
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,039	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	We can
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:45,439	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Get rid of a lot of the parking garage space and put in housing or commercial development because if all or most cars are
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,207	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Taxis
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:51,071	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	We don't need to clear out spaces and congested downtown's just so cars can have a place to sit idle
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:54,911	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Get out of the robot taxi and it's off to give a ride to someone else
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:13:01,055	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Urban core downtown
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:05,663	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	All the things we learned in driver's ed staying a certain amount of seconds behind a speeding car
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:08,223	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Those things will now be taking over
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:09,759	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	I'm by self-driving vehicle
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:12,063	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	They will make the

EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:17,183	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	And 10 order for everybody to be safe
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,743	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	This would allow cars to get closer together
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:22,047	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	And not just bumper to bumper
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,327	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Side to side
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:26,911	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	The Department of Transportation requires that Highway Lanes be at least
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,935	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	12 feet wide
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,983	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	That's about twice as wide as the average
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:33,567	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Car so suddenly a 3-lane highway can accommodate 6 Lanes
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:34,591	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Without any new
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:39,199	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Less space between cars means more cars can get where they're going faster
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:43,551	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	But these cars could also we organize cities for the worse
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,831	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Right now I have a cost
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:46,623	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	I'm driving and that cost is
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,903	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Running my vehicle
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:49,695	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	And also the time that I'm in it
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:56,095	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Anyone could read or sleep or write emails in a robot car people might feel just fine about living far
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:59,423	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Or outside the city and commuting a long way in
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:04,031	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	And that type of scenario we would see lots more vehicle-miles-traveled lots more
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,823	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Sprawl into the deep excerpts and into
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:10,943	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	And of course the inside of the car could become another place for advertising
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:13,503	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Your route data could be for sale
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:15,295	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Maybe it knows I hadn't had coffee
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:18,367	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Because it's connected to my refrigerator and my coffee maker at home in
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:22,463	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	He hasn't had coffee yet let's make the slow route next to the coffee place
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:27,583	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Or the route data could even become a matter of National Security
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:30,143	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Take control of your car or

EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:40,383	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Clearly there are still a lot of details to work out
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:44,991	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	But I wonder once the science is done and the policy is carefully considered
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:47,807	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Will people even want these things
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:50,111	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Is America ready to give up the steering wheel
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:54,463	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	I mean will people still go on road trips and tailgate in the stadium parking lot
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:59,327	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Will you still be able to get in your car and go on a nameless contemplative Drive
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:03,167	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	I guess we hadn't really thought about that that's Chris urmson from Google
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:08,031	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Assumption is he would give it a destination and say where you want to go but you'll always be able to change it
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:08,799	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Right so
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,335	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	I don't do a whole lot of
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:14,943	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Contemplative driving but when I do you know you start heading somewhere and then you like out maybe I'll go
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,711	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Afterwards
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,735	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	But you know
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:19,807	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Sometimes you're really just need to get in your car and go
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:26,207	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	Like say if you're getting chased by gun-toting corporate goons trying to stop you from eating Martian colonists Rebel

EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:57,183	| 99pi-0171-johnnycabautomationpart2-1 |	We can recognize the same kind of user annoyances
