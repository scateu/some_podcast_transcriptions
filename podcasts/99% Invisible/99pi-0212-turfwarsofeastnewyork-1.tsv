EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:42,847	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	The city had been run by Democratic Mayors using the Democratic machine
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:46,431	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	So the city wanted to know what was going on in East New York

EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:03,839	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	But they were voluntary and they were pretty
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:04,351	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	Sleepy
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:07,423	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	Lindsay beef up their powers and gave them money
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:12,031	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	So he'd have locals on the ground to talk to when stuff hit the fan
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:15,615	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	Lindsey also oversaw a change in police tactics

EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:56,831	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	A local black teenager was later charged with the dean shooting
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:58,367	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	And put on trial
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,647	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	But a jury acquitted him
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,183	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	In the end
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:03,743	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	Lindsey managed to keep New York relatively
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:07,071	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	Free from the major fires in fatal racial violence
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,607	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	That ignited around the country
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:11,167	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	In places like Newark and Detroit
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:11,935	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	And other cities
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:16,287	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	But within a year almost every single white family moves away
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,055	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	From East New York
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,847	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	White flight then

EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:23,455	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	Especially the outer boroughs
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:29,855	| 99pi-0212-turfwarsofeastnewyork-1 |	But the turf wars between teenagers were just one symptom of Allah
