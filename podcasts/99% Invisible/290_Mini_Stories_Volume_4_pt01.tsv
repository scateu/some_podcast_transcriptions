EDL	00:01:58,528	00:01:59,040	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	2 Peter suckers

EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,928	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And I try to not pop my peas
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:08,768	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I get excited I'll try not to talk too fast
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:17,216	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And the stuff that Peter gets really excited about the stuff that makes and Papa's Pizza and Subs
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:23,616	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Is language because he's the editor-at-large at Merriam-Webster and he's a leg
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:24,384	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Photographer
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:30,784	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Lexicographer is a person who compiles and edits dictionaries that's the old definition
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,808	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The Great
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:34,112	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Samuel Johnson lexicographer in London
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,648	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Mid 18th century
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,928	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Darius Amos Lee
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:39,488	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Define lexicographer as a harmless
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,256	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Drudge
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:44,608	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And Peter actually said that they use that term affectionately now as like
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:45,376	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I kind of
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:49,216	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Badge of honor they like to be called harmless drudges
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:55,616	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So don't worry about insulting them if if you want to use that term
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:03:02,016	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Merriam-Webster well from his description it sounds like they work in an office that is very very
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:04,064	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Be quiet silent basically
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:09,184	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And it's filled with these massive steel filing cabinet
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:15,584	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And I've kind of been imagining it like that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark at the end where the man
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:19,424	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And it's pushing that create through a huge Warehouse
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:24,032	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Instead of stacks of enormous crates is filled with metal filing cabinets
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:27,872	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And those metal filing cabinets are filled with index
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:33,760	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	As far as I know it's the largest body of collected evidence of any language in the world it's
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:35,296	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	15 or 16 million
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:36,832	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Index cards
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:40,160	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	With a word in context
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:42,208	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Wicked full bibliography so we know
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:44,512	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Who wrote it and where was published and when
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:50,144	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And so that is the work of lexicographers are the keepers of that word history
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:56,288	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And for a long time before computers came along this is how they did it with
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:58,848	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	These massive systems of filing cabinet
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,128	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Is the
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:03,456	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	File for the fin for the foundation for the pronunciation editor
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:09,600	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Is the file for our dating editors who who do the etymological dating a Place full of file cabinet
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:14,720	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But this isn't actually a story about how the Merriam-Webster offices are filled
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:19,071	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Was filing cabinets no it's not it's a story about 1
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:25,471	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Special filing cabinet Ventura office okay so here's where it gets really interesting
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:31,103	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The 1-day Peter was wandering through these endless rows of filing cabinets and he came across
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:34,431	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Is one and one of them simply said
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,199	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Backward index
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:37,759	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And so he opens up
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:40,063	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The cabinet that says backward index
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,879	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I realize what it what it was which was
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:47,999	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Are all of the head words of the unabridged dictionary some 315,000
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:49,279	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Separate index cards
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,303	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	With only
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:52,351	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	One word on them and it was
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,631	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Edward
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,655	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Typed backwards
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:59,007	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Is a bad word that use the entry in the dictionary that's the first
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:02,847	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Word with the word in question
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:06,687	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	This index is like imagine all the words in the dictionary
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:07,967	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:10,271	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Typed backwards and then organized
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:10,783	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Alphabetically
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:11,807	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Okay
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:16,415	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Why would you do that that is the question because
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:22,815	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Utility of it is not immediately obvious at least not to non lexicographers like you and me
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,351	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Repeater
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:26,143	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The harmless Drudge
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,679	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	He kind of got it
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,983	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Lexicography is an extreme sport
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:32,031	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	This is kind of a radical
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:34,847	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The practice of collection and of archiving
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:38,431	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And so to a certain degree this is
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:39,711	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Maybe the the
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,783	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The weirdest example of that kind of archiving
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:45,087	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Abbott made a kind of sense to me
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:51,487	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	To really understand why it makes any kind of sense you have to think back to when lexicographers
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:53,023	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	First started compiling
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:53,535	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The backwards
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:57,119	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Which was in the 1930s it turns out
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:00,703	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Which was a time before computers and
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:03,007	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	All of the search possibilities that they allow
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:05,055	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	In the pre-digital era
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:11,455	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	How else could we have known that there are four examples 500 words in the dictionary that end in ology
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:18,367	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Yeah yeah you're getting it that's because with a regular dictionary just
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:21,439	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Organized in a regular alphabetical way
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:24,767	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	A word like ecology would not appear next
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:28,863	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	To a word like technology because one starts with
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:29,375	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Lydian once
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:36,799	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I got it okay so with a backward index all the words that end in ology for example be grouped together
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:41,407	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So you couldn't actually look up ology words you would look up
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:45,247	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Y g o l o r word
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,551	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Can yuan
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,831	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Exactly yeah yeah
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:50,879	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Kind of kind of ingenious
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:54,975	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And there are actually a lot of other examples of of why this is useful
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,791	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	There was no way that they could know
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:00,351	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	For example how many words in English
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:03,935	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Made with a compound like
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:07,263	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Like you know block like clock like rock like sock like chocolate

EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,959	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So I want to start with

EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:40,319	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Activate is likely to be intensified
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:44,415	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Because of what happened early this morning at a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:48,255	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So you probably heard about this before because
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,023	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	This is big news
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:54,911	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But back in 1979 there was a partial core meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant near Harrisburg

EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:59,775	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And the plant did just what am I supposed to do
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:00,543	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Shut itself off

EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:08,735	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	A bunch of communities around the reactor ended up having to evacuate
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,807	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	A lot of people out they should have been freaked out there
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:15,391	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Freaking scary
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:17,183	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	In the aftermath of what happened
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:20,767	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The president ordered a commission to investigate what happened and there's a
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:23,327	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	This big post-mortem report to try to understand what
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,631	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And what
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:29,983	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It's kind of complicated because a lot of things went wrong
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:33,311	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But Three Mile Island was
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:35,615	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	A classic cascading failure type accident
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,151	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So essentially
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:41,759	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	A relief valve in one of the reactor units got stuck in the open position which caused all the

EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:45,599	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So the coolant run out of the core and it started to overheat
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:50,719	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And in the end it ended up being a pretty minor mechanical breakdown
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:55,071	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But what they found out was that it was actually human error that made the whole situation worse
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:14:01,727	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Humans make everything worse really do they really do
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:04,287	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,591	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The plant operators
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:11,711	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	See and they can hear that something was wrong because all these lights are flashing and alarms are sounding
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:14,015	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But it wasn't clear exactly what was wrong
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,551	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Because all the alarms are really
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,831	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Fusing and just made this
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,599	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Situation worse
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:18,879	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Because I went to
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:20,671	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Same time
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,719	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	That would have hindered
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,487	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Communication
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,255	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	At the very time
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,535	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	When they need you
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,047	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Communicate
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,327	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And who is that
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:32,959	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So that's Judy edworthy she said he's psychoacoustics and alarm design at the University of Plymouth
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:38,847	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And she told me that Three Mile Island is actually a really common case study when it comes to bad and ineffective alarm design
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,919	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Is very well-known
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,455	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Having hundreds of alarms going off
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,991	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	A short period of time
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:49,855	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Until happens
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:52,159	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Alarm design really matters
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:54,719	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Yes it definitely matters to
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:15:01,375	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And there have actually been other major accidents were alarms that were supposed to help people respond to emergency
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:03,935	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But instead they made the situation worse
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:09,823	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Like the Deepwater Horizon accident in 2010 would cause a ton of oil to fill into the Gulf of Mexico
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,359	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I didn't know that had anything to do with me
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:12,895	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Oh yeah yeah
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:19,295	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It turned out that a bunch of the alarm systems on the Deepwater rig and actually been inhibited for at least a year before the
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:21,343	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Because Transocean
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:25,439	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	What is the company that ran the rig didn't want false alarms to wake up the crew while they're sleeping
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:26,719	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Three alarms
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:27,999	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Too easily triggered
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,791	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And so they just turn them off
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:30,815	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	They didn't upset
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:34,911	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The operation of the ranch
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:35,935	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	To visit going to stop
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,983	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Professor Edward a think about a lot
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:40,543	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Yes yeah she thinks about the best ways
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:43,103	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It has an alarm so that they can accomplish what they need to do
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:50,015	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And whenever big concerns is that humans are just bombarded by so many alarms in our everyday life that we just
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,039	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Start tuning them out
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:52,831	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Or treating them off
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:55,903	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Cuz I think the whole world's have to serve along today
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:59,743	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Just so used to alarm just going a whole lot of time
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,791	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Under almost
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:03,583	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Digital backdrop to allies
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:08,447	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	She says that the average person probably hears about a hundred different types of alarms a day
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:11,519	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The distal the time you send it to cash register
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,287	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Speak to me away
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,567	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Shunyi
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,079	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	You had called
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:17,151	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Turn ons going off
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:19,199	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Everything
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:21,247	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	FANUC
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:27,903	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And so people just start tune them out and they lose track of which alarms are important and which
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:33,791	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	If everything in the world is beeping we kind of forget that those beats are trying to point out actual problems
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:36,351	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But another consideration is
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:39,679	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Set alarm tones Ben cell should communicate something about what the problem is
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:41,215	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	How does that
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:42,751	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:45,055	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	When you think of an alarm sound
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:45,823	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	What do you think of
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:46,591	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Well I think of
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:49,663	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Bracing klaxon
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:51,711	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Beeping siren high pitched
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:58,111	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Alarm alarm in upsetting all have like one culture
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:00,415	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Reference point for what an alarm should sound like
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:04,767	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Because like in the olden days we didn't really have much range in terms of
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,279	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Alarm
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:07,071	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	In the past
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,351	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Alarms
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,655	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Metra Lombard
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:14,239	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Pushing son pushing a through an object like a
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,263	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The klaxon
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:17,567	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Pitching
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,079	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Taco Bell
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,895	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Wesoo cities arcade noises
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:23,711	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Like bells and whistles and sirens and klaxons with
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:24,735	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Auditory alarms
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:28,575	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Because that's just what the technology of the time allowed for and we got used to it
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:29,855	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:36,255	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Judy made actually was kind of funny point which is that we have such a narrow idea of what an alarm should sound like
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:38,815	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	That it even shows up in futuristic Sci-Fi movies
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,351	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Sci-fi film
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:43,167	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Oh so wonderful things happen in the film
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:47,007	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But when you put alarms both and I just the same alarms that work
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,287	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	We just used to
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:51,871	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So I come in the film
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:53,151	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The Martian
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:57,247	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	They can do it just want to listen good malls
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:59,551	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But the counts on veteran loans
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:31,039	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Digital sound
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,831	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Esl which was possible you can make
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:34,367	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	An alarm sound like basically anything
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,671	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	You can use music
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:37,183	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Some people use
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:39,487	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Tunsel sequences of melodies
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,023	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	You can use
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:45,631	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Sounds of the sounds of real object to real things that we tend to
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:47,167	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Research thesis
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:49,471	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But really love just metaphors
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:53,823	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And I love this I love the idea of auditory icons and
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:56,127	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Metaphorical sound is just really interesting
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:58,687	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So what's a good example of an auditorium
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:00,991	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:04,063	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Hospitals are notorious for having these terrible sounds
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:06,879	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Because the sheer amount of alarms that are
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,903	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Ashley going off in
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,951	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	All hours of the night
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:13,791	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And I'll just eat some towns that are kind of variations of each other
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:15,839	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Soju Design This NuTone
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:19,935	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It's meant to be used when there's a problem related to a patient's medication and
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:20,447	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	This is how it works
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:24,031	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	What you might do is dance
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:25,567	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	An alarm by using
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:26,079	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Coming out this
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:29,919	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Attention
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,111	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	There's a little bit
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:39,647	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Attention grabber
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:41,951	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And then something metaphorical
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:42,975	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Oh so you can really tell
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:45,279	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	What it is kind of
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:48,095	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Choose medication in your head so you kind of already
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,399	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Know what the problem is before you even address
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:52,959	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	What we what we find is over to icons
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:53,983	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The very very easy
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,263	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Can you just tell people once
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:56,543	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	What they mean
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:59,359	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And then there was ever understood it
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:03,455	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So instead of some generic an alarming alarm sound
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:05,503	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I could literally mean anything
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:08,319	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Which is what happened at Three Mile Island you can imagine these
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:15,231	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Auditory icons that kind of communicate exactly what the problem is so you work there wouldn't be this confusion about trying to decipher
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,511	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	What is One Tone means
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:19,839	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Except for a 3-mile and when there's a hundred things going wrong
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:20,607	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It would sound like
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:26,239	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Preschool classroom and rattles
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:29,055	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But that becomes the sound design challenge of like
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:29,823	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	How do you
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:32,127	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Prince which one you hear the loudest in
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:33,151	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	In what order do you hear
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:34,175	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	That's worth it
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:35,711	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Which you know is really
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:37,759	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Cool concept to be into
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:41,343	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Yeah yeah yeah you basically have to rethink
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:43,135	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And environment from the top down
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,415	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	In terms of what it sounds like
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:46,207	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:46,975	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Thank you
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:06,175	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Since your voice isn't heard as much on the air want you say Who You Are
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:08,223	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I'm sure Jusuf
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:14,623	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I am what did you settle on technical producer
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:15,647	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Make things sound good
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:16,416	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	That's awesome
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,440	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I need to make things sound good
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:19,232	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	What kind of story do you have
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:25,376	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Yesterday I have I believe it's called a mini story and it is about alchemy
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:31,520	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It is a the idea of
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:34,592	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Turn it using chemistry to turn lead into gold
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,128	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Yeah basically or any other base
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:40,224	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It was this loony idea that folks in the Medieval ages were obsessed
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:41,504	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Sweat turning base metals
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:43,296	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Lead and mercury into gold
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:45,344	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Which of course is preposterous nowadays
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:51,488	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But there's this time when Alchemists were these like really dope people back by Rich folks and Powerful folks
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:53,792	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Including King Henry the 4th of France
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:56,608	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	A lot of Catholic monks practice Alchemy
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:22:01,472	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Even Sir Isaac Newton was super into Alchemy he apparently wrote about it more than physics
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:01,984	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Optics
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:05,056	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So for a long time hundreds and hundreds of years
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:05,824	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Lacrosse team
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,592	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Tire world
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:08,128	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	In the Middle East in Europe
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:11,712	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	There are these blurred lines between science and Alchemy
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:13,760	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I'm back to Alchemy can actually be
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:14,528	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Be traced back to
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:16,576	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The Arabic alkemia which means
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:17,088	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Chemistry
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:18,624	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Because apparently Egyptians
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:21,440	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Since we're pretty big into Alchemy back in the day especially
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:21,952	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Italy during the holidays
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:25,536	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	X in Alexandria which is where I used to live
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:27,840	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So shout out to Alexandria
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:32,448	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And so Alchemy was really big thing and it is still
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:35,264	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Really prevalent in pop culture today like I don't know if
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:37,312	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Minecraft
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:41,152	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Based on a cursory Google search
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:44,224	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I think there are some Alchemist characters involved in the oast
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:48,320	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Examples for my child who doesn't Harry Potter
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:50,368	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The whole first book is about the
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,136	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The Sorcerer's Stone
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:52,928	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The British version
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,208	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The Philosopher's Stone
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:57,536	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Which is this thing that turns Metals into gold and also
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,048	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Apparently
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:22:59,584	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Makes people immortal
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:01,632	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Which is like Voldemort was all about it
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:08,288	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Anyway that's all to say that this idea that you could design
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:11,104	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Kind of design gold from other metals
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:13,152	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It was a really big pseudo-scientific West
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:14,688	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	For a really long time
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:19,552	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But that'll sort of went by the wayside when Modern Chemistry started to become
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,064	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Its own disk
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:25,184	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Atoms neutrons and electrons and all that stuff sort of started
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:26,208	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Taking cold
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:28,256	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Well the ironic thing is is that
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:33,888	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	With modern chemistry it is actually possible to create gold from other elements
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:38,240	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It actually happens in nature like when a neutron stars collide
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:43,104	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And it can happen in Labs if you have nuclear capabilities or like a particle accelerator
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:45,408	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Which brings us to Maryland
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,432	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	In the 1960
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:50,016	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	There was a physicist there named Judith temperley
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:53,344	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And there with a nuclear reactor she managed to turn
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,112	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Mercury
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:54,880	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Into gold
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:58,208	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Well she actually transmuted it which
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:01,792	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Is the technical term end as I understand it means she modified the nucleus of
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,328	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	1 elements
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,608	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Until it had
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,376	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The same amount of protein
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:07,680	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Gold
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:11,776	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Should I do a quick chemistry lesson I mean
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:13,312	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Chocolate chemistry
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:16,640	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Elements are defined by the number of protons in the nucleus
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:19,200	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It's like hydrogen is number one in the periodic table
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:21,504	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Which means it has one proton in its nucleus
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:24,576	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Sodium is number 11 has 11 protons Meadow on
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:28,160	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I'm so the idea was that
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:29,440	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	If you got an element
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:29,952	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	That
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:31,488	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Had you know
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:34,048	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Close to the number of protons is gold
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:37,120	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Yeah I'm then maybe like with particle accelerator youku
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:40,192	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Add protons to weatherstrip protons away but to do that you need
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,984	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	A huge amount of energy
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:42,752	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Because if you
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:43,520	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Collide
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:44,800	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	2 positive things the witch
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,336	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Are than they were
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,104	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Bounce off
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:48,128	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Ready to party
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:48,640	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Accelerated
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:51,200	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And Mercury is number 80
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:51,712	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	On the period
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:54,528	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Gold is number 79
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:55,552	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So they're very close
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:25:00,160	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Right so she was like okay cool I'll put mercury in there which has 80 protons
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:05,280	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I'll try to smack one of those off and maybe one of the protons will fall off and I'll be left with gold
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:07,072	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And she did that
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:08,608	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I think successfully converted
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:15,008	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	One atom into gold which you know great that was really great job and she proved that this ID
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:17,312	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Do you have that was really crazy but was
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:19,616	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So obsessed over for so many hundreds of years
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:20,896	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Actually sign
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:21,920	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Play possible
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:24,224	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I'm a man in the 1980s
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:29,088	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	This professor named Glenn T seaborg who was a nobel-winning chemist at Berkeley
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:30,624	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Made even more gold
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:31,904	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Transmitted the same way
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:36,512	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Except this time he was bismuth which you know unlike Mercury isn't poisonous
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:38,816	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And it was also pretty close to gold on them
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:40,864	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I think it was
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,144	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	3
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:43,680	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Kirkland's number 83
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,704	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Compared to a gold set
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:47,776	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Find some smack some carbon into it using up
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,312	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Particle accelerator
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:51,104	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And he managed to create several
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:51,616	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Thousand
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:53,920	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	You know when both
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:54,432	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Cases
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:57,504	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Love and results we're sort of invisible
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:58,272	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Like to the naked eye
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:00,320	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So it doesn't seem like a
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,600	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The best option
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,368	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Referred
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,392	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Creating wealth
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,928	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Xiamen
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:06,720	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Especially considering that you need
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,024	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Particle accelerator do if a child care
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:10,816	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Pretty expense

EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:12,864	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Solace
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:15,168	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	CenturyLink West becomes possible
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:18,496	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But in the end it's pretty impractical because
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:21,312	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	You really have to spend way more gold than could ever be made
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:23,360	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Creating a
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,896	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Gold atom out of business
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:27,456	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Yeah I think
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:30,272	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Seeburg Economist told the Associated Press at the time
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:35,648	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	That in order to create an ounce of gold using his process that he did in Berkeley
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:36,160	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It was he
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:42,048	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	One quadrillion dollars to create an ounce of gold and I had to look up quadrillion
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:47,424	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It's a one with 15 zeros after it and at the same time the going rate for gold was about
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:48,448	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	$560
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:51,776	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Not the most cost-effective but
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:53,568	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Pretty cool that we did it
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,592	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Thanks so much
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:05,344	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Last but certainly not least is the longest serving soldier in the 99 PIR me

EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:09,952	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So how long have you lived in the Bay Area
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,744	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I moved here in
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,280	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	1990
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:15,584	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So are there any
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:16,608	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Tourist
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:18,144	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	You still haven't been
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:20,192	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Oh
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,216	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Yeah

EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:29,152	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Oh yeah I've never driven down on bars really
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:35,040	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	That's so funny that you would love them
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:37,600	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Live there for my childhood and adulthood
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:38,880	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Are you tired
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:41,184	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And I never ever went to the crown of the Statue of
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:44,512	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Now it's too late and it's the kind of thing that I've always told me to do
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:45,792	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And it's
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:48,608	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	You know just kind of a typical thing that locals have a very
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:51,936	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Different experience of their town and their city and visitors
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:54,240	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Does by and large they don't see the attraction
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:57,312	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The vast majority of our visitors
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:57,824	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Are from out of town
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,872	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Overwhelming majority
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:02,432	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Play about locals doing tourist activities in any town around United
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:04,480	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Many people do not go to The Tourist
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:09,088	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	In their town this is Dina jerrion he is a tour guide in an area of downtown Seattle called
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:10,368	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Pioneer Square
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,648	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Very touristy
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:13,440	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And he works for a company
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:15,744	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Bill Speidel Underground Tour
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:17,280	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	As the name suggests
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,304	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The Torah allows you to
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:19,328	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	You descend some steps
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,608	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And find yourself below street level
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:23,168	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Like literally underground under the ground
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:24,704	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I lived here
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:25,472	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Ford
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:26,496	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	12 years before I knew
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:28,032	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Safe to say
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:33,408	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Easley the majority of people live in works at in Seattle do not know
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:34,432	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	They don't know
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:36,224	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	As we look around up above there
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:40,832	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	All of the sidewalks you see up there all of those sidewalks are Halo
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:43,392	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	What does it mean that the sidewalks are Hollow
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,952	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Explain that we have to go back to 1851
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:50,048	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	To the founding of Seattle when the first White settlers
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:52,352	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Arrived back then the land look
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:53,120	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Completely different
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:54,400	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Topographic
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:55,424	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It was
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:57,984	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I mean shockingly differin if you look at a map
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:29:02,848	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Seattle is this tiny little Peninsula that used to sometimes flood into an island.
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:04,384	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It was
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:06,688	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Not the best place to establish a city
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:07,456	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:10,016	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Some young white guys went ahead and established it
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:12,832	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Pioneer Square quickly became this little logging town
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:13,856	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Tiny wooden houses
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:14,880	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And the logging Mill
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:18,208	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	That was the original Pioneer Square area and that's
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:19,744	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The dock was
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:20,256	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	That's where the song
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:21,536	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	What business is work
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:23,328	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	This is history and allenstein
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:27,424	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And he says even after the settlement the town would still flood sometimes
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:29,728	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And this man plumbing was impossible
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:31,008	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Toilets were at
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:35,104	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Sea level so the problem is every time the tide came and it would blast water through
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:39,712	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And so these toilets erupting with water
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:44,320	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Sound off.
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:47,136	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Stupid places establishing Town it was a bad idea
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:49,952	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But the settlers decided to grin and bear it
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:53,024	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And they put up with the many faults of their little city
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:54,304	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	As long as they could
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:55,840	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Could continue to sell its Lumber
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:58,400	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Until they accidentally burned the entire Earth
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:01,984	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Even when the great fire hidden 89th at
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:06,080	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	That burned down that started in Pioneer Square that burned down was that area Because by the
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:06,592	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	This time
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:09,152	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Wooden buildings have been built up
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:10,432	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	In 1889
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:13,248	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The great fire had Seattle and it is pretty much
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,272	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Levels downtown
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:15,040	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Town it's just a
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:15,808	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Asteroid
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:16,832	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But miraculously
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:18,624	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	No one died in the Grapevine
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:21,696	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So the city actually sees this as an opportunity
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:25,024	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Saddles like okay this is our big chance to get the town above sea level and we
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:26,304	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Start again
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:27,840	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	They thought well let's live
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:29,120	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Grated over let's
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,912	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Pack up the streets so that there
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:32,704	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	11 feet higher in the air
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:34,496	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Yeah and
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,520	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	That way it is
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,544	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It's a little more stable
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:42,176	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But the business owner has already started building the city didn't want to tell the businesses in Pioneer Square
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:44,480	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	To wait until the project was done to rebuild
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:47,040	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Because raising up the streets with this really ambitious project
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:52,160	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I was going to take like 10 years to do so you can tell all the businesses in your town to take a 10-year hiatus
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:54,720	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The Pioneer Square businesses
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:56,512	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Where is that when they rebuild
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:31:00,864	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	First I should do it in Brick and Stone not would my no lesson and then secondly
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:02,656	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	They should add another entrance
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,680	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	On their second floor
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:05,984	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And slowly in increments
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:08,032	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The city raise up the street
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:09,824	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	5 to 11 feet up
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:10,848	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Around business
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:12,896	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So they built their businesses
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:14,176	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	With an entrance
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:15,200	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	On the first floor
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:17,248	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And an entrance
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:18,784	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	On base with a second-story
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:25,440	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	For the eventuality that the street would raise to meet at
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:31,584	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	We're raised up and then the sidewalk and the building were lower than the street
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:35,936	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So for example if you wanted to park your carriage
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:36,960	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	In the street
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:37,728	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And then
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:40,544	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Leave your carriage and go into a store
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:42,336	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	You got to actually go down steps
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,616	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Stairs reedem ladders
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:45,664	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Storefronts
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:50,016	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Basically the sidewalk at this point wasn't really joined that Second Story
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,552	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But the street was there but the sidewalk
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:54,880	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Yeah the sidewalk was still down at the old
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:55,648	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Athletic
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:57,184	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Yeah first level
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:58,464	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It did not happen
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:31:59,488	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Once it happened in increments
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:01,280	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But yeah and then the street was above it
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:02,816	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:05,376	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Eventually the city connected the raised
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,936	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It's to the new 2nd Story entrances
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:09,984	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	With a new sidewalk
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:12,288	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I just covered up the old sidewalk
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:13,312	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Incredibles hollow space
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:15,360	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Between the old sidewalk
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:15,872	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Anakaren
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:17,664	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Once
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:19,456	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The streets were graded level
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:19,968	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Then
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:23,296	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Businesses move to the Opera that the Second Story
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:25,344	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And that's where their storefront
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:26,880	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Later became
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:27,648	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So all these
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:28,672	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Original storefront
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:30,208	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Worthen
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:31,232	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Covered over Underground
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:33,536	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And that's what
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,816	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Became Underground
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:35,584	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Seattle
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:37,376	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So the underground was rumored to have a lot of
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:40,192	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	People speculate
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:46,080	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	About its life is speakeasies and gay clubs and Pat's for Espionage or smuggling
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:48,384	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But honestly for most of its existence it was
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:49,408	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Abandoned
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:52,224	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Forgotten are used as storage space by the shops

EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:55,552	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But then in the
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:59,136	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Most of the businesses started to leave Pioneer Square
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:00,928	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And the area became kind of down and out
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:08,096	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And said this was the sixties everyone is like great let's just turn down all the old buildings in Pioneer Square so we can build more space AG stuff
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:09,632	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Lego Space Needle
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:12,192	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The space-age the future
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:13,728	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	People are looking
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:15,008	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Forward than they were.
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:15,776	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The past
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:17,824	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Except for a man named Bill Speidel
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:20,384	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So build it was a

EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:21,920	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	For the Seattle Times
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:24,480	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And he had an interested
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:25,248	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	In history
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:28,064	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	A lot of it was because he had a lot of contacts
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:31,904	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Like contacts with direct descendants of the founders of the city
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:36,768	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Bill Speidel new people who were the sons or grandsons of the founding Pioneer families
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:38,560	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Galilee young history
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:40,608	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	As far as White Settlement goes
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:42,400	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Here in Seattle really it's
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:43,936	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Three generations
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:44,448	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It's away if you
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:48,800	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And through these Old-Timers their stories the rumors
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:52,128	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Speidel hears about these underground kind of tunnels in downtown Seattle
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:54,944	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And he eventually learned about the raising of the streets in this house
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:55,968	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Spaces between the car
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,504	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Current sidewalk and gold sidewalk

EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:06,208	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And he use the tour as an opportunity to show seattleites that they had history
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:08,512	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And I had a historic district but they were ignoring
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:11,072	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And they thought they didn't they thought they were this young City
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:15,936	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	This got the ball rolling on preserving Pioneer Square and by 19
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:16,448	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	69
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:20,032	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It worked because it became a a National Historic District
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:22,848	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Nancy is still listed as day
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:25,408	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Bill Speidel passed away in 1988
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:27,200	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But today if you go to Pioneer Square you will see
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:30,784	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Hordes of tourists roving around in groups of 47

EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:37,184	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	They trying out these massive Torres everyday a hundred eighty eight people come through every hour and
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:38,464	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	One time I went
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:39,744	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	There is never this woman

EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:48,960	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I'm at or very much continues and Bill speidel's original style it's a lot more dedicated to
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:50,240	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The fun Ben facts
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:56,640	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Lightest eye exam dad jokes
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,944	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Drunken debauchery on the Rays Street
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:03,808	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	In the first year of construction Alone 17 men
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:06,624	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Walked out of bars tried to cross the street
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:09,696	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Fell to their death stepping from the street to the sidewalk below
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:14,816	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Bill Speidel said that was it working away because that was early Seattle's original one step program
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:16,608	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I love that joke
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:19,168	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So it's a lot of
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:23,008	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Unverified stuff and a few exaggerations but honestly
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:27,360	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It's true with a lot of tourists detours they kind of turn into this giant game of telephone
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:31,968	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But in this case without Speidel Legends and dad jokes we might not have

EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:15,296	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And I care about them deeply
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:17,344	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Inside if you didn't serve in the military

EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:25,792	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	This show is don't challenge coins radiotopia so my association with John Lithgow
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:27,072	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Is strong
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:27,840	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And because of that
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,376	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I was forwarded
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:35,520	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The December 22nd Washington Post article about Trump's garishly over-the-top challenge coin

EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:42,944	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	What Trump can teach us about con law
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:45,504	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	We take the tweets of Donald Trump and we use them
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:49,088	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	As a jumping-off point to learn about the US Constitution
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:50,112	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	If you haven't heard it
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:54,208	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It's a really fun show and it's not nearly as snarky and angry as you might think
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:56,768	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Plus my co-host on that show is
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:59,584	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Hello professor and a friend of mine her name is Elizabeth Joe
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:01,120	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And she's super smart and
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:02,912	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Delightful to listen to so check it out
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:06,496	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	When things we discuss a lot on the show is that Donald Trump
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:08,032	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Has a tendency to subvert
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:09,568	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Constitutional norms
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:12,384	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And if you're into Trump you can actually
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:15,456	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Appreciate that Tennessee I know I totally dig people
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:17,504	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Pushon rules to achieve the things
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:18,272	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I want
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:19,040	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	To achieve
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:24,672	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Anyway with the redesign of the presidential challenge coin it's clear that Trump also likes to break the norms
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:25,952	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Taste
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:28,256	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Good design and tradition
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:32,096	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The new Trump challenge coin dispensers with the presidential seal
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:35,168	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And replaces it with a similar-looking eagle image
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:36,960	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But the head of the Eagle at 23
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:38,240	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The directions for some reason
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:40,288	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And it has Donald Trump signature
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:41,056	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Across the bottom
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:43,360	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Instead of e pluribus unum
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:44,128	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It says
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:45,664	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Make America great again
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:51,296	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And it says Donald Trump again on a ribbon that extends below the traditional circle of the coin
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:53,088	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It is twice as thick
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:58,976	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Is the most recent presidential challenge coins and instead of the muted colors befitting a dignified office
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:00,768	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	This coin is gold
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:02,304	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Burberry
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:02,816	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Very
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:04,096	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Cheap-looking
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:04,608	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Goal
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:08,448	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	In terms of taste I consider this new coin and imp
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:09,472	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Events
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:12,800	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I will personally draw up the articles of impeachment myself just give me a call
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:13,824	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	However
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:16,896	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I also must consider this from a design perspective
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:19,200	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The key question in design is
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:21,248	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	The Thing You Do
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:22,272	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	What it was designed to do
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:23,808	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	In that sense
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:25,088	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	One could argue
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:26,880	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But the Donald Trump challenge
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:28,672	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Is perfectly
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:29,184	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Design
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:34,304	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	It completely reflects the taste and style of trump and his presidency
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:35,328	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	In every way
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,352	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Is in your face
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:37,120	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Non-traditional
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:42,240	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	I fundit unbelievably ugly and tacky and I don't like the ribbon protruding from the bottom of the circle
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:43,520	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	But it's
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:45,824	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Much like the man himself where is his
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:48,640	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Wide shiny ties that come down
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:49,664	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Way too low
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:54,528	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	So just like I didn't really get the red Maga hats I can't argue that they weren't
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:57,088	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Effective icon for did the job they were designed to do
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:58,624	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Turn away
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:01,184	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	You kind of have to admire the new coin
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:02,208	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	And judge it
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:03,488	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	What it is
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,536	| 290_Mini_Stories_Volume_4_pt01 |	Sinbad
