EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:39,136	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	The neighborhoods are lined with fragrant eucalyptus
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:45,536	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Montecito's beautiful landscape is also what makes the community especially vulnerable
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,048	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	To Wildfire

EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,223	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	It look like it was gone
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:14,783	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:17,855	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	I never seen all of the mountains behind
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,927	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Burn like that if they weren't they were
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,231	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Completely denuded
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:25,023	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	They look like
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:27,327	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Desert mountains that
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,119	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Don't have anything growing on them
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:32,447	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	A shocking thing to see
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:34,239	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Persol
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:37,055	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Large an area hole mountain range

EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,783	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Eventually burned into these still fresh
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:51,391	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Scars from other recent fires and without Chaparral another fuel to keep it going
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,927	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	It simply put itself out
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,743	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Only three houses were destroyed in Montecito
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:58,559	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	People in the town thought they'd been spared
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:00,095	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	But then the rain came
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:03,679	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	In the early morning of January 9th 2018
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:05,727	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	A storm pummeled Santa Barbara
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:09,311	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Half an inch of rain fell on the mountains above Montecito
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,591	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	In just 5 minutes
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:13,919	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	ER doctor Steve Mills was up listening to the storm
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:17,247	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	He and his family had moved to Montecito just a few years
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,783	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Before that night
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:20,063	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Everyone went to sleep
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,855	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	And I couldn't
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:25,951	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	It was one of these things where you're in that throw half awake half asleep state
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,231	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,023	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	I heard thunder
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,047	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	What I thought was
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:31,583	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	NFL
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:34,143	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Weird Thunder last for 30 seconds
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:36,703	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	I mean what Thunder rumbles that long
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:41,055	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	And then my brain finally turned on enough that I
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,591	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Left out of bed
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,359	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,127	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:50,527	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	I was going to make sure he's okay and then as I walked by I look outside and there's mud at the door
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:56,671	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	House of been enveloped in a river of mud rocks and trees there was a dead body right in front of our house there was
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:16:00,255	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	A lot of number of them washed down
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:02,303	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Extreme indoor area and it was
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:02,815	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Frightening
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,863	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	This debris flow
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:07,423	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Or what some people mistakenly call a Mudslide
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:12,799	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Was the direct result of the Thomas fire that had burned the mountains Bear Just week before
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,847	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	It all goes back
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:15,615	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	The Chaparral
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:22,271	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	After the fire the waxy substance that coats the Chaparral leaves was left as a film across the score
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:22,783	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Soil
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:26,367	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	That oily coating made the ground impervious to water
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:29,183	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Serene slipped across it instead of soaking in
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:31,999	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Is the rain skimmed across the soil
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,791	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	There was no Chaparral to restrain it
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:36,863	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Thomas fire had devoured all the plants
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:37,887	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Years Rob hazardous
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,679	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	And what that does
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:41,727	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Completely strips the
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:44,287	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	The hillside of anything that can hold back
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:46,335	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Soil Rock debris
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:49,919	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	To such an extent that you know
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,967	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Any amount of rainfall
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:53,247	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	It's going to result in some kind of
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:58,111	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	And then unfortunately of course we know what happened we had
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:00,415	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Rainfall intensities that were 10 been seen in hundreds
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:06,303	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	In this landscape flood is essentially the second stage of Fire
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:08,863	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Rain came rushing down the hills into the town
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:09,887	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	As it flowed
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,423	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	The water carry mud
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:13,727	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Trees and rocks off the steep hills
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:20,127	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Even season rescue teams are shocked by the magnitude of the destruction we don't say this I mean it is complete

EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:30,623	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Voted down several dense rivers of mud
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:32,159	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	More than 15 ft deep
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:35,999	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Some of the debris flows reach speeds of close to 30 miles per hour
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:40,607	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Boulder smashed into one house so violently that the gas man exploded
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:43,167	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Unwhole residential blocks
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:45,215	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	They weren't houses to dig out under the mud
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:47,519	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	The houses were simply gone
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:50,847	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Some homes were wiped off their foundations and vanished
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:53,151	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Others turn into piles of wood in
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:53,663	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	And steel
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:57,247	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	My dad was fine but many of his neighbors were not
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:00,831	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	More than 400 homes were damaged or destroyed
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:02,367	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	About a tenth of the whole town
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:05,695	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Hundreds of people had to be rescued by helicopter
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:07,487	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	23 were killed
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,023	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	2 or never found
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:15,423	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Steve Mills and his family were lucky
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:16,191	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	By some measures
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:22,591	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	A few of their neighbors in their low-lying part of montecito's Flatlands ended up with Boulders in their bedroom
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:26,943	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	The Mills house is currently uninhabitable
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:29,759	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	And they're living in a rental while they make repairs to the property
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:34,111	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	They had 65 truckloads of mud and debris removed from their yard
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:38,207	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Before they could even begin removing the mud and debris from under their home
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:43,071	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Some of the people whose homes were destroyed have moved away and Steve's wife
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,607	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Would like to do that too
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:45,631	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	She saw this
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,655	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	20
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,167	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Mud
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:50,495	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Damn and it was frightening and I
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:55,615	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	That sort of that leaves you marked your mind just learned a great sushi
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:58,175	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Really doesn't want to live here
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:05,599	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	But for now they're in a protracted battle with their insurance company and they can't fix their house until that's resolved
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,135	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	So they have to say
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:14,047	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Debris flows are technically floods but since they're caused by fire
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:17,631	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	California law mandates that they're covered by fire insurance
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:19,679	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Which everyone in Montecito has
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:24,287	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	The financial infrastructure that takes over when physical infrastructure fail
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:25,823	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	More than government
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:30,175	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	It's insurance companies that seem to make the decisions about where and how
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:31,711	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	People can live in California
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:36,319	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Insurance companies complain that their subsidizing for risky decisions
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,599	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	But for the most part
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,903	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	They don't stop and train people
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,439	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	They just increase prices
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:43,487	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	In California and even more
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,255	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Exclusive
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,791	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	The place to live for everyone
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,839	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	The housing market is cold
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,607	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Somewhat
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:51,167	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Montecito is a whole remains desirable
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:57,311	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	If anything the value of every property that wasn't destroyed by fire or flood in the last year
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,079	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	I've only gone up
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:02,175	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	With the Chaparral bird out of the hills the whole wrist
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,967	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Paradigm in Montecito has changed
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:06,015	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	As have the engineering challenges
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:09,343	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Threat of fire is another 20 years off
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:14,463	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	The immediate concern now is when the next rain might come and bury the town in mud again
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:19,839	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	I mean to have that amount of intensity that follows up a fire that have
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:25,983	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Select off the hillside you know that that's not going to happen very often does it doesn't mean it's not going to happen again
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:26,495	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	Of course not
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:29,823	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	More debris flows are inevitable in Montecito
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:34,687	| 318_Fire_and_Rain_pt_01 |	They're how the whole area was formed hundreds of thousands of years ago
