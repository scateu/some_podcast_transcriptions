EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:19,807	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	So he set a limit on how tall the church would ever get

EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:33,375	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	La Sagrada Familia would be one or about three feet shorter than Mount montjuic in Barcelona
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,167	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Just to keep it humble
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:41,567	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	In 1883 when Gaudi started work on La Sagrada Familia is first matter of business was

EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:49,247	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The Crypt is essentially a small church under the bigger chart
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:51,295	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And a place where important people are buried
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:56,159	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	In fact I was buried there when he died in 1892

EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:06,655	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Sagrada Familia Crypt was big enough to hold services in Endless kept everyone happy while Gowdy took his time designing the rest
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,423	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The building
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:11,263	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The book of Isaiah died management of the construction passed through various hands

EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:17,663	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	God is the client and God is never in a hurry
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:23,551	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	After the Crypt was finished Gowdy begin to build the first big wall of the building

EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:30,463	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But it was important to him that this facade get done first
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:31,743	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:34,303	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	It would be the Bible written in stone
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,071	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Which
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:39,167	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	People if they couldn't even read or write they could look at the building and btools about
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:41,471	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The values of the Catholic faith
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:44,031	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	LD was a sculptor as much as an architect
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:47,871	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The wall would be full of stone sculptures depicting biblical scenes
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:53,247	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The baptism of Christ Christ in the workshop with his father flight to Egypt

EDL	00:08:56,063	00:09:01,183	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The stone sculpture of a donkey in that c was actually cast in plaster
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,975	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Become a real life donkey
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,279	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	It had to be particular to the Donkey
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:08,351	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	It looked as if it had been through the desert for 40 days
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:13,471	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	One of these workers actually wandered the streets until he found the perfect

EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:21,151	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Each of the donkey and the Donkey
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:25,503	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And he Costco
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:30,879	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Antoni Gaudi also tried making plaster molds from live human beings
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:34,975	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Yeah she tried to do with one of his workers but we almost killed him and
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:37,279	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	I decided that maybe that wasn't the best
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:41,887	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The way forward
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,959	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	This all took an incredibly long time
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:46,751	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But eventually the wall started
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,799	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Telestory in stone
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:52,895	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And it featured hundreds of celestial and Earthly creatures

EDL	00:09:56,991	00:10:00,831	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The song became crowded and cluttered and teeming with life

EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:17,727	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Antoni Gaudi was slowly building a Catholic Church
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,519	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But not everyone was convinced that

EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:21,183	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Miraculously they failed to do
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:25,279	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Catholicism was under attack during the war and by the end of it

EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:57,279	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Few workers return to gaudi's Studio to salvage what they could
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:59,071	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	They very carefully
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:00,607	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Picked up in boxes
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:03,935	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Little sections and fragments of of the multiples
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:07,263	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Unlike archaeologists do today they started piecing them together
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:11,359	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	For the next couple of decades the remaining Architects and other workers
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:15,711	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Try to figure out how to move forward on the construction without Gowdy's plans
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:20,063	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But outside the church there was opposition to moving forward at all
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:26,975	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	In the 1960s an impressive group of intellectuals and Architects including Le corbusier and Alvaro Alto Road
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,559	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Golden open letter opposing the continuation of La Sagrada Familia
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:34,143	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	LD wasn't only an architect they argued
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:34,911	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	He was an artist
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:37,727	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And you shouldn't attempt to finish a work of art
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,495	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Without the artist
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,031	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	They felt that
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,567	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	This was a total waste of
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,591	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The time they should have left
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:45,407	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Just the original Nativity facade
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:47,455	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Almost like a Gothic ruin
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:49,247	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	That as a homage to Gaudi
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,807	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And the Gaudi wasn't being well so
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:54,879	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But the patrons of the project would have none of it
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:59,231	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The building was never supposed to be an homage to Gaudi they argued
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:02,047	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	It was always about something bigger
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:07,935	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	That said they would try to honor Gowdy's original Vision as Faithfully as possible
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:08,959	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But it would be easy
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:15,615	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The models and drawings had been the roadmap for how to move forward on the construction and they were burned and smashed to pieces
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:19,199	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And this wasn't just any Cathedral
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:22,783	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	All these years have been designing something
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:23,807	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	So unique
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:26,879	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	So complex and so completely new
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:29,439	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But it would take his successors
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:30,207	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Years
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,487	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Definitely get a handle on it
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:38,655	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The church still had no interior and no roof
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,703	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	It was just walls and Towers
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:42,495	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	A construction site
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,519	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Open to the Rain
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:47,615	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	I first went to Barcelona in 1977
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:49,407	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But I was 20
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:51,455	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	That's architect Mark burry
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:57,855	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Mark actually been told an architecture school that Gowdy was not worth studying because his approach was to
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,135	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Esoteric
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,159	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	That he was sad
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:03,487	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Two extraordinary and that there was no school
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,511	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Meaning that there was
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:10,911	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Nothing to say you move alone this just got blurry more curious
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:17,311	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	So he went to have a look at the Sagrada Familia himself accident
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:19,871	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Meeting the 290 rolled architects
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:22,175	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Directions to project
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,223	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And had died
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:27,551	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	They have been young Architects listing to Goudy expanding his latest
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:28,319	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Discoveries
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,343	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	When they were students
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:34,207	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The old Architects were ready to move on to the interior of the building
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:37,791	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But they didn't exactly know how to do it
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,327	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	They knew that he had a system
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:41,375	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Facebook geometry
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:45,727	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Then use a system which translates into
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,031	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	I got a building methodology
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:51,103	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	In other words The Architects knew it was
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:52,127	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Theoretically
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:54,943	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Possible to figure out how to create the rest of the church
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:57,247	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But it was a Monumental task
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:00,063	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	They pointed burrito couple of boxes
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:03,391	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Monster Paris models
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:06,207	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Invitation to come and join the demon
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,023	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Have a mistress
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:13,887	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Puryear burry work with the models
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:16,703	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Trying to extrapolate the geometry of the rest of the church
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:18,239	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Based on the pieces he has
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:19,775	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	After a year
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:22,335	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	He managed to draw out architectural blueprints
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,359	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	For one window
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,639	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	It was a start
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:29,503	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Mercury didn't stay long at the Sagrada Familia
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:33,087	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	He was only 20 and he had to go back to New Zealand finish school
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:35,135	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	He returned to work on the church
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:37,951	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	10 years later and found that when he was gone
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:39,487	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Anew thingamabob
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:40,767	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	I've been moved into the office
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,303	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Computer
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:46,911	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Thought these computers must have something to offer cuz I've never actually personally tax form
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:51,775	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Winberry finally touch the computer he figured out that it had architectural software on it
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:57,663	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But the software wasn't capable of dealing with Gowdy
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,687	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Trying to do
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:00,991	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The complexity of gaudi's designs with
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:04,063	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Too much for architectural software of the early 90s
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:09,439	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Marie wondered if there was anyone else who designed with similar geometric complexity
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:11,231	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And finally you landed on it
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:13,535	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	People who design airplanes
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:20,447	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	He started using aeronautical software to figure out an architectural strategy for the interior of the church
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:25,055	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And because I had to spray sophisticated software by accident undiscovered parametric design
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:29,151	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	So we were working parametrically from 1991
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:34,015	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Parametric design uses computer algorithms to allow you to plug in different variables
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:37,087	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And see what the end result is each time you change something
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:42,207	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Mark Berry was one of the first Architects to use computers to design this way
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:47,327	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Eventually figured out that Frankie Ruiz team had also started using aeronautical software
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:54,239	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	To bring Gary strangely shaped curvaceous buildings into being
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:57,055	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Is it Frank's office and talk to their technical team and compare notes
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:20:00,639	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Eventually Gary Technologies with help from work break
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:04,479	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Went on to create their own parametric design software specifically for Arkansas
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,527	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	By the early 2000s
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:09,343	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Many of the most exciting new projects in architecture
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,111	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	We're being done this
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:15,231	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	At the Forefront of this was a church design over a century ago by Antoni Gaudi
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:17,023	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	La Sagrada Familia
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:20,351	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	So from being the selection is a man interesting
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:22,143	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Irrelevant it became actually the
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:25,983	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Delete projects in the Hall of the digital Revolution affect
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:32,895	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Parametric design allowed Mark Berry in the other Architects to move a lot faster on the interior of the church
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:34,687	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Without this technology
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:36,735	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	It's possible they would still be no
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:37,759	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Inside the sea
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:40,063	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	It was only a few years ago in 2010
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:43,903	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The Architects were able to put the finishing touches on the interior
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:47,487	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Now people line up around the block to get a glimpse inside
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:52,095	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And it really is breathtaking
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:58,495	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Partly because of these incredibly tall columns that Gaudi designed the branch out like trees at the top
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:00,287	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Stop and are capable of carrying
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,823	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	A tremendous amount of weight
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:06,175	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	When people go into that building I'm not suggesting
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:08,735	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	It is necessarily always a religious experience
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:11,295	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The shock
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:13,087	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And surprise
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:15,391	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Of walking in trailers doors
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:18,208	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Into this explosion of light
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:18,976	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The light
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:21,792	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Coursing through giant stained glass windows
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:25,120	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	In the afternoon it's a red orange light
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:27,168	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And in the morning it's a bluish-green light
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:31,008	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And it filters through the huge tree like columns
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,544	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	You feel like you're in a forest
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,336	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And you feel very tiny
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,360	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	If you're very small
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:38,176	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	You feel as if there's a hold of universe above you
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:42,272	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But the building is still not finished
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:55,072	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	I'm in An Extremely Loud metal cage elevator that runs on the outside of the church with head on emo

EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:59,424	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The architect volume at the very beginning of the story
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:04,800	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And Anna Barbie who handles press for La Sagrada Familia
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:10,176	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	It's very safe Anna says but it doesn't feel that safe
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:16,832	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The elevator is shaking and we can see Barcelona getting smaller below us as we rattle up alongside the tower
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:17,856	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Church

EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:33,216	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	We are standing on the top

EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:24,160	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But there is still a lot to be done
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:30,816	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Meanwhile some of the neighbors seem set up with La Sagrada Familia and all of the congestion and Taurus

EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:36,960	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Like this one in 2011

EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:12,512	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	What are things you mentioned that piece are these models
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,792	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	That were destroyed and
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:18,656	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	How important they were in realizing gaudi's vision for La Sagrada Familia
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:21,472	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Little too technical to get into in the piece
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:22,496	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Costa
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,008	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Noses
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:25,824	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And I asked him to come to the studio and explain
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:27,360	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Gowdy's modeling technique
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:29,920	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And why it is so important to the creation
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:31,200	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	La Sagrada Familia
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:31,968	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Like a lot of artists
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:33,760	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Especially once you'd like to use
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,832	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Preferred to work in models rather than
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:40,160	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Models help them experiment with really complex
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:41,184	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Control structures
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,976	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And Albany
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:45,536	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Model out structural Arrangements test things out
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:48,096	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Photograph as models in
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:48,864	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Over the photo
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:51,424	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But the bottles were behind all of the
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,448	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	If they were driving the design
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:56,800	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And one of the things that you tried with a lot and bottles were variations on what's called a
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,360	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Okay so what is a
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:27:59,872	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Catenary
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:02,176	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Catenary is
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:04,736	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Curved shape that a hanging chain
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:05,504	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Assume
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:06,528	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Under its own weight
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:08,320	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Basically picture
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,856	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Electric lines
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:10,624	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Suspended between you
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:13,184	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Okay so you're driving on the highway
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:14,976	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	C2 utility poles
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:18,304	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Electric line goes across time and there's that natural Boeing
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:20,352	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Of the electrical wire
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:21,632	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And that is
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:22,656	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The catenary arch
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:23,936	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Exactly
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:24,960	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And that term is actually
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:26,752	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Drive from the Latin word for chain
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:32,640	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And it was already well-known by gaudi's time that an optimal Arch shape could be made
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:33,664	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	By mirroring
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:35,200	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	A catenary curve vertically
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:37,504	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Basically you take that hanging curve
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:39,296	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And you just flip it up
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:41,344	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And that becomes the model of your
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,136	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And that Arch
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:45,440	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Distributes building loads efficiently
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,208	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And a lot of Gothic
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:50,304	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Okay that makes sense you take this boat to chain
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:51,072	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	It crepes
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:53,120	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The optimal Arch when you flip it over
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:55,936	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And when Ukrainian churches in the gothic style this is a
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:57,472	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Good way to create a good
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:58,496	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Model
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:00,800	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But I already took the idea further
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:04,384	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	He hung strings other strings from other strings
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:06,432	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	They added birdshot
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:08,736	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	To weight them down at structural intersections
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:10,272	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Need treated these
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:12,320	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Huge intricate wire frame models that
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:13,856	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	End up looking a bit like
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:14,368	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Like chandeliers
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:17,440	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And then God would use mirrors to flip
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:18,464	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	These vertically
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:21,024	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And study the shapes they created
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:23,584	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	In order to shape his own elaborate building skeleton
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,632	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And it sounds a lot like what
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:28,192	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Leader Architects to use soft
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:29,728	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	When they
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:30,240	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Did 3D mod
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,544	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Yeah there are a lot of parallel
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:33,824	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	In essence
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:37,152	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Long before parametric design was a computer software
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:39,200	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Gowdy change
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:43,040	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Parameters in his models by moving strings and weights around to see how
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:44,832	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Who's individual modifications
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:46,112	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Could reshape an entire
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:46,624	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Structure
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:50,464	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And then a century later people came along and finally made these digital
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:52,256	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	I could be anybody
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:53,536	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	These handmade models have been doing
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:56,864	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Allowing Architects to see how small changes with ripple out
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:57,632	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	To their entire design
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:59,936	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	So you know what you can imagine
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:00,704	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	It would take like
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:01,472	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Call Amanda
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:03,776	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Moving around a little bit
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:05,824	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And that deforms like all the other shapes
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:06,336	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Self-destruction rap
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:08,384	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Right and then
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:10,176	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Software you do this and
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:12,992	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Nail dust off our cranks long and does its thing
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:14,784	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	But in gaudi's time
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:16,832	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	You would move a weight around
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:17,856	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And you'd see how the
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:22,464	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Connected set of chains with all kind of deform by adding
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:23,744	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	A little bit of birdshot
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:24,512	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	21 Little
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:26,560	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	That's amazing
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:28,352	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	And it looks stunning
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:30,912	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Yeah the results are amazing
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:33,472	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	A lot of people you know they think Audi and they think of you
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:35,776	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	He's beautiful sculptural scenes in these details
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:36,544	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	He created
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:37,312	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Underneath
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:38,080	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	All of that
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:40,128	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Is this really lovely structural logic
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:42,176	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Instagram Familia
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:42,944	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	The Tostitos are
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:44,992	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Beautiful but so is this internal framework
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:47,040	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Columns and arches
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:47,808	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Vault
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:49,088	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Branches up and out
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:49,600	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Creed II
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:50,880	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Fractal Forest
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:52,672	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Spell because
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:54,976	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Dowdy didn't spend a lot of time teaching or
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:57,536	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Explaining his methods are really writing about his
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:58,048	| 01_281_La_Sagrada_Familia_pt_01 |	Designs
