EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:14,496	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	By the late 1980s
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:17,056	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	AIDS have been in the US for almost a decade
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:19,872	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	We look through timeline from this.
EDL	00:01:19,872	00:01:23,456	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	You see the records of 100 people that a thousand
EDL	00:01:23,456	00:01:25,760	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	People that a million people that

EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:34,976	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Then of young men and women in the country
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:39,584	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	So what you don't see much of in the late 80s is public acknowledgement of AIDS

EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:45,728	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Millions of people were dying of this mysterious new disease
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:48,032	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	But there was so much stigma against talking about
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:51,872	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	You kind of felt like you were living in a war zone and there was no reported
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:55,456	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	It was a Bizarro world

EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,424	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	It just been told
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:21,056	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	To Patrick and a group of other artists
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,592	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Turn their focus to AIDS
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:25,920	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Yeah why why were you making art and response
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:37,184	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	In 1988 O'Connell and his collaborators begin calling their Collective
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:38,464	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Visual aids
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:40,512	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	They held public events to raise awareness
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,048	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	There was slideshows
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:42,816	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Gallery shows
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:46,144	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	But of all the work they did the thing that had the biggest effect
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:47,424	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	With a simple little symbol
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:50,240	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	That at the time was a novel concept
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:52,288	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	The AIDS awareness ribbon
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:56,640	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	It all started one night in the spring of 1991
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:58,432	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	The visual aids artist caucus
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:00,224	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Hilton meeting in search of a symbol
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:03,808	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	They wanted something that could be created that
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:04,576	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Could
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:06,880	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Be put out there for people to wear
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:10,208	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	That's a couple he's a costume designer and was at that meeting
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:13,024	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	He's now director of costumes for the New York City Ballet
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:17,120	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	That's a lot of driving around upstate New York
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:24,032	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	This was at the time of the Persian Gulf War we started to see a course at the time yellow ribbons or
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:25,568	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Tied around trees which is
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:29,408	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	You know in reference to that song for servicemen
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:40,160	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	It's been so long
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:43,744	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	You know we just were like
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:45,536	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	You know
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:48,096	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Why can't we do something like that
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,632	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	4
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:50,144	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	8
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:55,264	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	And we talked about it you know what it really be around a tree and that just seemed a little like
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,312	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	I don't know not right
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,848	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Then it became like
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,360	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Oh
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:04,224	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Maybe not around the tree but maybe folded
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:05,760	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	With a pin on your lapel
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,296	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Then it was time to pick a color
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:13,440	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	In the meaning it also came about that it was like yes it should be red because it represents blood
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:15,232	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	It was just so obviously right
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:21,375	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	The local ribbon supplier donated spools of half inch wide red grosgrain ribbon
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:25,471	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Greens that ribs ribbon you might have worn around your ponytail growing up
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:32,383	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	And we started just in these meetings like folding them and doing different things with them and force it just
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:34,175	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Started out just like folding it in half
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,711	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	But then it came
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:38,527	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	To actually folding it in that
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:40,319	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Way we now know it so well
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:41,343	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	With a safety pin
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,623	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	The loop
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,647	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Inverted V shape
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,439	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	They're on the streets of the
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,207	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	City

EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:48,767	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Search something with them
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,303	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Patrick O'Connell again
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:52,607	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	By this time he was director of visual aid
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:55,679	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	And at this point the red ribbons were essentially in art
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:00,031	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	The visual aids artist caucus members help but they called ribbon.
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:02,079	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Think like a quilting bee
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:03,359	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Bunch of people gather to work

EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:45,823	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	And

EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:06,815	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	I filled up a hundred-dollar bill and gave it to us

EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,943	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Somebody could wear
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:06,015	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	And somebody might go up to them and say
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:06,783	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	What is that
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:10,367	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Why are you wearing that red ribbon and hopefully that person would say
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:10,879	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	Here's why
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,695	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	The ribbon was doing its job
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:15,487	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	People were talking about AIDS
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:19,327	| 99pi-0173-awareness-1 |	The New York Times declared 1992 the year of the ribbon
