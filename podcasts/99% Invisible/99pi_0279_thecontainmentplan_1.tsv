EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:24,255	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Developers
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:26,559	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Didn't like what was happening in Skid Row
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,607	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Stop for example the Union Rescue Mission
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,399	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	I was on Main Street
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:37,055	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And there were lots of people there and it was full all the time there were people lined up outside a lot of activity there
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:42,431	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	There was simply an open-air drug Market
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:44,479	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Around the corner of 5th and Main Street
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:48,063	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And so a plan emerged in 1972
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:52,159	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	A plan drafted by group of businesspeople and endorsed by many City officials
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,975	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Remove Skid Row population out
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:57,279	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Enveloped the area for new more money resume
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,583	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	It was known as the Silver Bullet
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,631	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	That was essentially
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:02,655	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	To raise Skid Row
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,191	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Take everyone out
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,471	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Bulldoze buildings
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:06,751	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Start fresh
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:10,591	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Of course residents of skid row and their Advocates didn't like this new plan
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:13,151	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And they began thinking about how to fight it
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:15,967	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	One of those people was Charles elsasser
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:16,735	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	A young lawyer at the
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,295	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Who remembers coming across some research
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:22,111	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	It showed that when you bulldoze a neighborhood like Skid Row
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:24,927	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	It just means more Skid Row like neighborhood pop-up Elsa
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:28,255	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	What I did when we weren't quite sure whether it was true and such
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,071	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	True or not
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:31,839	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The theory
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,607	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Was useful
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:34,655	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	But it was it was it was a very can
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,191	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Useful
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:37,471	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Theory
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:41,311	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	For purposes of saying this is a mistake
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,103	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Did that whole idea was a mistake
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:47,711	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The theory that Skid Row will just pop up somewhere else in Fresno
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,479	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Smoove
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:52,319	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Scared people who didn't want skedros residents to end up in their neighborhood
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:56,159	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Some of these scared people join the skid row activist cause
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:57,183	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And the activist
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,207	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	We're happy to have them
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,231	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	It really did
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:01,023	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	You know come up with this
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:02,303	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Idea that
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:04,863	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	IDE samskara Lee
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:05,375	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Support
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:08,191	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	But also really really help
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,471	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The Advocate
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,263	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And so
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:13,055	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Armed with their one study
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:17,407	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Elsasser and other activists came up with an idea to replace the silver book plan
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:19,711	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Which would bulldoze Skid Row
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:20,223	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	With another one
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,783	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Here's Jeff Dietrich who helped write the new plan
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:25,087	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	We develop was called the Blue Book
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,391	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Jeff Dietrich and his wife
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,159	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Kathryn Morris
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,695	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	I've been longtime advocates for
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,463	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The homeless
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:33,279	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	They run a well-known Soup Kitchen in Skid Row called the hippie
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:35,839	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The Bluebook plan was this
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,887	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	To contain the spread
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,911	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Skid Row
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:41,983	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	It's basically what's it called the containment plan
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:46,591	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	This new plan will call it the containment plan from here on out
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:48,639	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Propose some pretty radical ideas
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:51,199	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Including getting all the missions
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:53,503	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Going to Charities and other homeless services
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,295	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	To physically move their offices
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,855	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	So they be within the newly drawn borders of
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:58,367	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Skid Row
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,647	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Again
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,415	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Gary blasi
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,439	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The deal was
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:04,767	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	All the services that tend to attract
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,815	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Homeless people will be concentrated
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,375	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	To the east of Spring Street
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,911	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,447	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Here in exchange for that
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:19,359	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The Redevelopment agency will not only not bulldoze all of the sros but it will
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:23,455	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Also find a separate nonprofit called the SRO housing
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:30,367	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The SRO Housing Trust would be charged with protecting and maintaining a whole slew of low income housing in Skid Row
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,927	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The actor who spent several months
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:34,719	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Writing and developing the containment plan
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:38,559	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Any work every angle trying to get the city to take it serious
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,095	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	So
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,631	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Someone knew someone
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,167	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	In the city council
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,447	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	That's Kathryn Morris
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:48,543	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Explaining that they got someone to distribute a draft of the plan to everyone on City Council
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:50,079	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And so
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,103	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	They agreed
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,919	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	That while there was a lunch break
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:56,991	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	That they would bring these and put them at every
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,807	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	So the people came back in the council
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,087	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Came back in
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,879	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Shut down
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,903	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Picked up first thing on there
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:07,999	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Paging through this where this come from I don't know where it came from
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:12,095	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The containment plan was enough of a compromise that somehow
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:13,119	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Amazingly
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:13,631	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	It went out
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:16,447	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	It wasn't a legally binding agreement but
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:18,239	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	I want you to find the city's approach to
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,007	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Skid Row
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:19,519	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	For decades
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,823	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And it was a totally unique approach
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:25,407	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Who said no one else was doing what they were doing
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:27,455	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Nobody really seems to have done it sent
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:31,807	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Elsasser says he's worked on lots of campaign
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,855	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	To save skid-row like neighborhoods
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,391	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Housing projects in the 70s
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:38,719	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	But Skid Row was the only time he's used containment
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,231	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Ed Estrada
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:43,583	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The containment plan Mayberry suggestions on how to keep
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:46,655	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Skid Row types within the new borders of the neighborhood
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:49,471	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	There's a section of the plan called inducements
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:49,983	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	That reads
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,287	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Toilet public restrooms benches
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:55,359	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Pleasant Open Spaces within the contained area of Skid Row
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:58,687	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The residents might be inclined to confine their activities to
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,455	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The immediate area
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:01,759	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	That section would serve as a magnet
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:03,807	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Ahold undesirable population Alamo
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:04,575	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	In Skid Row
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,111	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Not against their will
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:07,391	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	But of their own accord
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,719	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And the plant talks about a buffer zone
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:14,303	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Which would create a border between skid row and the rest of downtown
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,583	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Strong Edge
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,607	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Will act as buffers
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,399	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Skid row and the rest
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:18,911	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Central City
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,727	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	When the skid row resident enters the buffer
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,751	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The psychological comfort
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,799	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Familiar skid-row environment
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:25,311	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Will be lost
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,103	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	You will feel for it
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:33,503	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And will not be inclined to travel far from the area of containment
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:36,831	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Payment policy was officially adopted in 1976
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,367	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	City started to implement it

EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:57,727	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And then there was a more aggressive measures

EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:42,271	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Elsasser the lawyer who helped write the plan says
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:45,087	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	If the way it's written sound unempathetic or even
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:45,599	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Defensive
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:46,879	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	That's because
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,671	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	They weren't trying to run a PR campaign
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:52,255	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	They weren't trying to change politicians Minds about Skid Row's residence

EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:59,679	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And containment was better than doing nothing

EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:24,255	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	For better or worse over the course of just a few years La Skid Row became the place to go
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:26,303	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	So if you are homeless in Los Angeles
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:30,655	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Some hospitals would even discharge patients there if they didn't have a fixed address

EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:18,239	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Or residential
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:19,775	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Again city planner Brian
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:23,871	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	In the eastern half of skid row where it is zoned Industrial
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,639	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	That has
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:27,967	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Precluded the expansion or the ability to create a new housing
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,039	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	But all of that could soon change
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:35,135	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Los Angeles is currently undertaking a Total Recall of its zoning code
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,415	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Starting with downtown
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:39,487	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And a lot of skid row that was formerly zoned Industrial
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:42,303	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Will probably be rezoned as mixed use
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:45,375	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	There are a lot of vacant buildings in Skid Row
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:48,959	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And the city would like to make some of that real estate available for housing
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:52,287	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Many residents of skid row would love to have new housing
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:54,079	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	They've been asking for it for years
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:57,919	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Having more housing has been been something that they have
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:59,455	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Expresses is something that
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:00,735	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Critical for the neighborhood
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:05,343	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Having grocery stores with Vino healthy and accessible and cheap food
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:08,159	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The city is basically saying in order to give you housing
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:08,927	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	We have to rezone
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:12,767	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Let's get real residents want new housing in the neighborhood to be affordable
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:15,327	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And that isn't something that can be dealt with through zoning
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:19,167	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Zoning can say whether an area is industrial or residential or mix
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:21,983	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	I can't say if housing will be affordable
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:24,543	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	That would have to be done legislatively
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,871	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Some residents believe
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:31,455	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Political leaders could find a way to build affordable housing in the neighborhood
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,479	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	But instead
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:35,039	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	No use the rezoning process as an excuse
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:37,343	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Open up the real estate market and get them out
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:39,391	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Like Craig r

EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,655	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And create this new

EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,744	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Where
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:33,536	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	You ended up on another Skid Row
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,072	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And not just
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:39,424	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Any skid row it was maybe where the name Skid Row comes from
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:41,728	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And if you go to Seattle
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:43,008	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And you go downtown
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:45,568	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Yuan counter place called Pioneer Square
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:50,432	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Should actually a triangle and it is the tourist area and
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,456	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Seattle
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:52,736	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Used to be a really big logging town
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:56,576	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And the mill used to be right downtown so
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:25:00,928	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Loggers will go up into the hills and chop down these massive huge
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:03,488	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Trees and they lubricate them with fish oil
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:05,024	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And hook the logs up to
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,560	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The teams of oxen and mules
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:13,216	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And then would run the logs down this road over the mountain that would be called dragon or skidding
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:13,984	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	The Lox
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:14,752	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Skating the logs
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,544	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Makes this road the skid
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:19,616	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Wrote it was called skid Road
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:20,640	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	With a D
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:22,432	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	According to my guide Dina Jerian
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:29,344	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And that street is now called yesler way because Henry yesler was the owner of the mill at the end of the street where the logs are being
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:30,112	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Get it down to
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:31,904	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And the smell
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:33,440	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Is also very close to the seaport
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:35,744	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And so here in this part of town

EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,912	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	A lot of guys around
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:45,216	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	And they got these hard jobs
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:47,264	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	With long periods of downtime
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:49,824	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	They are looking for action and fun luckily
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:53,152	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Seattle in this area in the skid row was here provide
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:54,944	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Before there was Vegas
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:56,992	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Sin City was right here
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:58,528	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	M bars lot of brothels
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:00,832	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	So this is the original Skid Row
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:07,232	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Maybe maybe
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:09,792	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Term of the logging industry in other parts of the world
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:15,936	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	I don't know if those other skid roads also developed like bars and red light districts in Reno
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:17,472	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	Rough attitudes but
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:18,752	| 99pi_0279_thecontainmentplan_1 |	That's definitely what happened in Seattle
