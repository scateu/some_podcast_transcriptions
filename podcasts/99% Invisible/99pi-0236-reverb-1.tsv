EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:13,472	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And I'm sitting in that tiny little room this microphone right up to my mouth
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:16,288	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	So the sound of my voice is transmitted directly
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:17,312	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	From me to you
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:19,360	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	There's no sense of the room that I'm in
EDL	00:01:19,872	00:01:21,152	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	When I stop speaking
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:22,432	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	The sound stop
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:24,480	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	There is no reverberation

EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:32,928	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Rooms that sound
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:33,696	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Good
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:35,232	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Mass producer Avery trufelman
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:38,304	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Because if I step outside this tiny
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:40,096	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Completely padded Studio
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:43,680	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Okay it's so quiet
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:44,704	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Because I'm inside
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:48,544	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	But I'm going to walk around a little bit so you can secure the architecture around me
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:51,360	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	You can tell now that I'm in a bathroom
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:54,688	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Or you can tell if I enter the stairwell at better office
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:59,808	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	If you're not listening in headphones my voice is bouncing around your car
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:00,832	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Or whatever room you're in
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,368	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Whatever you're hearing
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:04,416	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Sound is affected
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:04,928	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	By The Arc
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:10,048	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	There are two main ways to control the sound in a building
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,328	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Active acoustics
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,096	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Impassive
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:14,144	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Passive acoustics
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,424	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Are the materials in a space
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:17,728	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Like a padding in the studio room
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:20,800	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Carpeting and drapes are also absorptive material
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,336	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Soak up sound
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:24,640	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Glass and Porcelain on the other hand
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,664	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Create more Reverb
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:32,064	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Essentially if it's shiny it's going to be reflective isn't easy way to interpret that
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,856	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	This is Ashley Hansen
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:37,696	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	My name is Ashley Jansen I'm the design services manager at Myerstown
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:40,512	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Meyer sound is a company that mostly makes
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,536	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Active acoustic
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:43,072	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Which is this a speakers
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:45,376	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Amplifiers and other electric sound equipment
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:48,704	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	People probably have run into our products
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:50,240	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	They just don't know that it's
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:51,776	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Meyer sound
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:54,080	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Meyer sound makes a lot of the Big Show
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:57,152	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Speakers hanging off of the ceilings at concerts and Broadway shows
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:00,736	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	But their products are also in a lot of unexpected places
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,016	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Cruise ships
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:03,808	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Restaurants
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:07,648	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	We are in some corporate headquarters at
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:09,184	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Educational facilities
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,464	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Airport
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:14,560	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Over 600 Meyer sound speakers were used when the Pope
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,328	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Spoke in Mexico
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:18,656	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	One of the things I tell people in general is
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:20,704	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	If we're doing our job right
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:23,776	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	You might never notice that were even there
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,104	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And that's part of Ashley's job at Myerstown
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:31,968	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	To make sure the sound equipment is effortlessly integrated into a building
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:34,784	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Using both passive and active
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,600	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Materials and electronics
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:43,232	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	But often in architecture what looks the best is at odds with what sounds the best
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:49,888	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Of course you don't necessarily want to always see the big black speaker somewhere and so we have to get creative
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:52,192	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	We like our speakers out of sight
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:56,288	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And we also like high ceilings and long glass windows which makes
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,312	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Spaces sound
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,080	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Wheatley
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:58,592	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	River
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:03,200	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	So architecture is a puzzle for Ashley and her team to solve
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:07,808	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Whenever we see rooms that have curveballs we kind of cringe
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,088	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Especially if they're out of glass
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,624	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Oh that's pretty
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:14,720	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	When we approach spaces there are things that although they're beautiful
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:17,536	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	We know are going to definitely
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,327	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Put pressure on us
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:21,631	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	To come up with creative and unique ways
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,399	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	2
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:23,423	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	A Pista
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,191	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Visual
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,727	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And Sonic needs a
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:26,495	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Set the room
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:28,543	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	So it depends on what you're trying to do and that's
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,311	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Space
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:33,407	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	If it's a venue for the symphony or the Opera you want the sound to be big
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:33,919	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And resonance
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,479	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	An echoing
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:39,039	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Or cafe or place with
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,575	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Acoustic performances
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:42,111	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	A little Reverb is nice
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:45,439	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	But you're trying to hear a lecture or reading
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,207	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Per se
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:46,719	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Have a meeting
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:49,279	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	You probably don't want much Reverb at all
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:53,887	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	But we haven't always been able to precisely control the acoustics
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,655	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Sever building
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:56,447	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Sound until fairly recently
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:00,287	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Was a somewhat mysterious element in architecture
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:06,687	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	In the late 18th century there are all sorts of different theories about how to get good sound but
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,735	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Half of them contradict the other half
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:10,271	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And no one really knew what
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:12,319	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	To do this is Emily Thompson
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:15,647	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	She's a history professor at Princeton and a scholar of sound technology
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:18,719	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	She says at the turn of the 20th century
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:22,047	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Architectural Acoustics are pretty much a roll of the dice
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,071	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Architects
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,095	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Begin to fret
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:27,167	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	But they don't really know what they're doing with this aspect
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:31,519	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Of their designs and it was all kind of left to chance and if you were lucky
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:33,311	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Aurora Theater would sound good
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,359	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And if you were unlucky
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,127	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	It wouldn't
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:38,687	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And in 1895
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,711	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Harvard University
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,759	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Was very unlucky
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:44,063	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	The university had just completed building
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:46,879	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Fogg Art Museum and it had a lecture hall
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:49,951	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Where there was so much reverberation that they simply
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,999	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Could not hold classes in that room
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:58,143	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	You couldn't understand the speaker
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:06,847	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Harvard had just wasted a lot of money on a completely useless room
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,615	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Sound

EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:11,199	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And in an attempt to save the space
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:15,039	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	They listed the help of a rookie physics Professor who had some time on his hands
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:17,343	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	So the president of Harvard
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:19,391	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Ask this young physics professor
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:23,231	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	To figure out how to fix that Auditorium and make it use
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:23,999	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Visible teaching
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:24,767	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Hbase
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:26,303	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	This professor's name
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,583	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Was Wallace Sabine
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,119	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And through this task
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,935	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Sabein would eventually
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:34,495	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Become the father of architectural acoustics
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:40,895	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Lissette Wallace sabein onto an investigative path that actually took several years
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:45,759	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Collecting data basically making sounds in rooms and timing the Reverb
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,831	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	He would take
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:54,207	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Measurements of the different reverberation times in different rooms all over campus
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:56,255	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And in order to do this under the quietus
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:07:00,351	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Possible circumstances he tended to run his experiments in the middle of the night
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:04,703	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And he would change the reverberation
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:08,031	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	In time within a given room by bringing into it.
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,311	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Sound absorbing material
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,615	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Sabein was a perfection
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:14,943	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Keep throughout over 3000 measurement
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:17,503	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	After determining that his own clothes
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:19,295	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Had a small effect
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,319	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Upon the sound of the room
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:22,623	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	He started all over again
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,927	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Taking measurements in the dead of night
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,439	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	But now
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,231	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Wearing the exact
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,743	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Same outfit
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:28,767	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Every time
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:35,935	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Meanwhile the president of Harvard is is waiting and waiting for this lecture hall to be made useful again
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:37,215	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	One point you finally
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:39,519	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Does to the young Professor it's
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:41,567	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	It's time for you to tell us what to do here
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,591	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Enough is enough
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:43,615	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Night night
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:45,407	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Feeling nervous under pressure
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:47,455	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Saybein pours over his notebook
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:48,991	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	I had a breakthrough
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:55,135	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Looking at all his measurements he starts to notice a trend a mathematical relationship
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:58,719	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Between the size and materials of a room and it's reverberation time
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:01,023	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Relationship so steady
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:02,303	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	That you can make a formula out of it
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:05,119	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	He discovers a mathematical formula
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:05,887	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Bitconnect
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:12,543	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	The architectural materials of the room and the behavior of sound within it and this is a formula
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:16,383	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Sa Vines formula now that really
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,175	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	A enables
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	People to be able to predict
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:22,527	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	The reverberation time of a room
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:23,551	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Based on its design
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,855	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Design savings equation allowed for
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,623	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Planning
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,671	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Something you can manipulate the Reverb of a
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:31,487	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Space by changing the materials the room was made of
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:34,303	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	So that then you can take any sort of Arkansas
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,327	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Textural plan
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:37,887	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	You know the dimensions you know
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,423	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	How many square feet of
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:41,471	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Plaster or wood or glass
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,751	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Soar upholstered seats
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:44,543	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Fill this room
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:50,431	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And you can just kind of plug and chug and if the formula will turn out a predicted number for the reverberation
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,711	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	The room
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Stabilized formula helped Architects design for as little or as much Reverb as they want
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,111	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Architect
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:59,647	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Could now control
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,415	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Sound of a
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,207	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	They could make
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,231	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Big rooms
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,255	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	With very little Reverb
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,559	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Until they begin to do Jess
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,071	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Stat
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,631	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And the most remarkable early example of this
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,167	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Was Saint Thomas
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,471	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	St. Thomas Church
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,495	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Which is
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:18,079	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	In New York City not far from the Museum of Modern Art
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:22,175	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	The architect of this church wanted to build it in a neo-gothic style
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:26,015	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Basically to make it look like a European cathedral made of stone with
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:28,319	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	High ceilings and stained glass windows
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,599	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	But while they wanted
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,647	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	This building to look Gothic
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:34,207	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	They realized that a Gothic
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:36,255	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Sound would not work for modern
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,535	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Temp service
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:41,119	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	They wanted to hold a much more sermon Focus
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:41,887	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Service
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,911	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Not Justa medieval math
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:46,239	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	I needed less Reverb
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:48,031	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	I'm so prisoners could understand the words
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:51,359	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	So the Architects turn to Wallace Avon
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,663	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	How to make a Sacred Space that would be
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,431	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Clear
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,455	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Calming
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,479	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Reverb
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:56,991	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Free
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:01,087	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Shure wireless Avon could add felt and padding to the building
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:03,647	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	But he thought that didn't fit the feeling of a church
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,695	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	He work with a tile maker
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:09,023	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	To come up with special sound absorptive ceramic tile
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,047	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Dogs with porous surfaces
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,351	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	He called them run for tile
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,167	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Rumford tile
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,959	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Named it after
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,727	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Physicist
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:20,799	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	2hat kind of been interested in solving practical problems
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,567	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:26,175	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Play the substantial architectural material it's not a matter of just hanging drapes or tack
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:28,223	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Felt onto a surface it's a
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,759	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	It's much more integral
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,295	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	So with St Thomas Church
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:36,159	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	By using the sound absorbing tiles way up and all the ceiling vault
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:38,463	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	They have the gothic look
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,999	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	But without the gothic sound
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:43,071	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	St. Thomas Church was completed in 1930
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:45,887	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	It's definitely not modern look
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:48,959	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	But it was a landmark modern
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:49,727	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Sounding building
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:54,335	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Completely engineered of formulated for environmental control
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,127	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Thanks to the Rumford tile
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Say mine works in public and private spaces all along the east coast
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:02,271	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And came out with more Broad
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,319	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	To accompany the Rumford tile
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:07,647	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And he passed away in 1919
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:10,975	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Rate really at a moment when a much
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:13,023	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	More pervasive interest in
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,303	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Controlling environmental song
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,375	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	The Roaring Twenties
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:22,239	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	It got that name for a reason
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:26,847	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	It may very well be the case that it was louder in the twenties then now
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:33,247	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	This was an ERA when cars and trucks did not uniformly come with Mufflers there were
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:37,343	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	For these new unfamiliar unprecedentedly loud sound

EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,535	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	In the crowded City
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,559	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	An escape
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,583	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Was hard to find
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:55,263	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Sound Christmas and Clarity could provide calm and control
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:57,823	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	It meant a complete Mastery of the
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:01,151	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And so the desire
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:06,015	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	To control sound within interior spaces isn't parked
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:08,575	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	A kind of a drive to create Refuge
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:12,159	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	From the noisy tumult of the world outside

EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,463	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Finally
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:18,975	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	It was quiet
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,279	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Too quiet
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:26,143	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	What is the 20th century went on
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:31,519	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Who became disenchanted with the idea of completely closed off spaces with dampened acoustics
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:34,335	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	They wanted to let in air or light
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:34,847	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And sound

EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,951	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Since the early 20th

EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:56,351	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	They actually decided they wanted
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,631	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	More reverberation
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,911	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And this material
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:13:59,935	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Engendered
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,215	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	So
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:02,239	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	In some cases
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:03,775	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Porous surface
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:04,543	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Of the rump

EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,847	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Has been painted over
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,383	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Peel off those
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:11,199	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Pores and then to make it more reflective
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:11,711	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Of sound
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:15,551	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And these days we want our architecture to have a range of
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:20,159	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	No one single room or venue can accommodate a lot of
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,439	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Kind of sounds
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:24,511	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And that's possible using not just passive
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:27,071	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Acoustic materials like the ones they bind pioneered
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:27,839	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	But also
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:28,863	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Active
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:33,215	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Using microphones and loudspeakers
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:34,495	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And digital signal processor
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:38,335	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	That's Melody Parker and acoustic engineer at Meyer sound
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:39,871	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Cannabis product
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:41,407	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Called constellation
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:44,223	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And so what constellation allows
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:45,247	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	You to do
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:48,319	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Is to create multiple environments in one space
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:52,671	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	It basically allows you to manipulate the sound of the room completely digital
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:56,511	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Do a system of many Chinese speakers and microphone
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,791	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Where the microphone
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:58,559	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Throughout the ceiling
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:14:59,839	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	They're really smart
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:03,423	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Melody showed Avery the test room for consolation
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:05,471	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Inside Meyer sound headquarters in Berkeley
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,775	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	It looks like a very small theater
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,567	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	It's a room with a low Reaver
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,871	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Time thanks too much acoustic padding
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:14,431	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	But it's outfitted with a variable active acoustics
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:17,503	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	We're tiny microphones capture the sound
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:19,551	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And the speakers playback no sound
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:22,367	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Monster mimic the reverberation in different size rooms
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:28,255	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Okay so I'll grab Melody took out an iPad and activate a different settings
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:30,559	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Which completely changed
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:32,095	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	The Sonic shape of the room
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,375	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Midol do
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,143	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	I'm dramatic
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,191	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Demonstration
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:38,495	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	This is what
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,007	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	It sounds like
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,543	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	With a very long
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:45,663	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Melody play the clave to demonstrate the Reverb time
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:52,063	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	This setting was called Sacred Space I gave this tiny room the sound of a cathedral
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:55,903	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And it's one thing to hear a Reverb effect
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:57,183	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	In a song or podcast
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,743	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	It's another thing entirely
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:01,535	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	To experience a Reverb effect
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:02,815	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	In a room
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,351	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	In real life
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,119	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	In real time
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:08,191	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	The echo completely changed my perception of the
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:12,031	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Then Melody took the Reverb completely out of the room
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,055	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Entirely
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,591	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And suddenly it felt
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,359	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Stifling
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,895	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Like I'd been muzzled or something
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:18,431	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	It's hard to breathe
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:20,735	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And those are some of the most dramatic setting
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,551	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	There are lots of subtle change
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,087	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Is that a client can make to a room
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:29,695	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	They have the ability to change the length of the reverberation change the strength
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,463	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	The loudness
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,231	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Set the reverberation
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:32,767	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And 2 even
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:34,815	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Change the perceived height
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:37,119	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Of the room in the perceived width
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,631	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	The room
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:44,287	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Constellation and its competitor sound systems are expensive so they're not
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:45,311	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	, exactly
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:52,223	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	But they're in a lot more places than you'd think like a number of big venues all over the world and classrooms and offices
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:55,807	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Restaurants use so-called variable active acoustics
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:57,599	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	So they can adjust the noise level
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:59,391	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	How to keep it a pleasant home
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:02,207	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Regardless of how many people are in the space
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:06,047	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	An architectural implications of this
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:06,815	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Are fascinating
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:11,679	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Of course Architects and acoustician still have to pay attention to the path of acoustics
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,447	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Building materials
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:15,775	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	But there's a lot more design flexibility now
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:19,359	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Yeah we actually have an interesting one that we're working on
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,127	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	4
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:22,687	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Attack business where they took over an old

EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:28,575	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And so the challenges in that space
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:31,903	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	It's the factories all brick and exposed and beautiful
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,415	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	And
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:35,487	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Have these high ceilings and she says
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:38,815	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Combination of active and passive acoustic systems
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,351	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Help architects
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,631	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Repurpose old buildings
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,423	| 99pi-0236-reverb-1 |	Were able to
