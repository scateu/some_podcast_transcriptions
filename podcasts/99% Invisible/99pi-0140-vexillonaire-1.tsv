EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,280	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	There are rules and principles being
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,072	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Keep it simple
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:48,864	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Use meaningful symbolism
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,400	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Use two to three basic colors
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,448	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	No lettering or seals
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:53,472	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	And be distinctive

EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,568	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	But one rule the fourth one
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:03:59,872	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	No lettering or seals
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:03,456	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	That rule for some reason Americans just can't grasp
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:07,040	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	We have tons of flags
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:10,368	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	And that's bad that's why you shouldn't have a seal on it
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,928	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	A seal is designed
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:15,232	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	To be on a piece of paper

EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:24,191	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	And only one side of the paper
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,751	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	A flag
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,031	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Is meant to be seen
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,567	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	From a distance
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:31,871	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	On a piece of fabric

EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,735	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	And might be seen on the front or the back
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:41,343	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Seals don't belong on flags seals belong on pieces of paper
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,623	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Damn right
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:46,207	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	What are the Intriguing things about the fact that Ted gay

EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:09,759	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	A group proposed a flag to the

EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:13,343	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	The group was the commercial Club of Portland
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:16,415	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	The proposed design consisted of a Whitefield

EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,775	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	And then the words

EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,151	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	And then the words

EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:04,799	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	But this decision set into motion one of the greatest tragedies and Redemption

EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:26,303	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Asking about the city council and the Arts commission which attributes should be on the flag as you might expect

EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:34,495	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	What a flag should look like
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:37,311	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	From what the Arts commission members look like
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:39,871	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	You don't say the City commissioners were
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:43,967	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	They wanted realism they wanted the name of the city on the flag

EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:50,623	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Lots of stuff on the flag of the
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:55,487	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Parks commissioner said it should be abstract it shouldn't have words on it
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:07:01,375	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Much more consistent with our modern perception of what good flag design is so Doug
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:04,447	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Went into The Fray and designed flag
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:07,519	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	That did not have a rose on it
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:13,663	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Did not have the name of the city on it it was an abstract design Doug's design was a
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:20,831	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	I will call it an offset cross if you go to our website or pull out your phone you'll see a variation of this flag that
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:21,855	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Doug Lynch proposed
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:24,671	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	It's incorporated into the Comfort I love this episode
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:26,975	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Two lines crossing from
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,791	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Top to bottom and left to right in the center
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:31,839	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Creating a
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:33,375	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Void in a center that
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:36,959	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Is called a hypocycloid a 4 pointed star
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:42,079	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	The blue lines that cross represented the Confluence of the Columbia and Willamette rivers
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:46,687	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	The flight hypocycloid represented the city of Portland at their confluence
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,223	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	And then
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:54,111	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Those stripes were bordered by yellow stripes gold Stripes which represented either Commerce or
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:59,999	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Grain flowing along the rivers and everything was on a background of green representing
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:00,767	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	The forest
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:02,303	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	It's really lovely
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:06,655	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	City council said Thank You for Your Design and change the upper left-hand

EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,983	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	From green to blue and put the city Ceylon
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:12,031	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	And adopted that flag
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:27,391	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	I know all the graphic designers in the audience were digging half-moon-shaped scars in the meat of their palms upon here
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:33,791	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Violation thumb was more painful that this Abomination was so close to being a really good flag
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:36,095	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	The one that Doug Lynch had originally submitted
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:45,823	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	A few years to the city council version of the flag made it out into circulation in 1973
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,847	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	But being a
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:53,247	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Relatively poor design with that City seal on it most people can't tell it's the city seal even

EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,623	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	The flag was never
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,903	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Widely Sloan
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:06,047	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	So nearly 30 years later Doug Lynch join the Portland flag Association
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,583	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	He was in his late eighties
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:11,423	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	And I invited him to come to one of our meetings
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:14,495	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	And explain this whole story of how he had
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,287	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Designed the flag
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:20,383	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	How it was adopted and how was changed at the last minute
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,943	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	At the end of the presentation
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,223	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Said
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:25,247	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	If I had to do it
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:32,159	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Over again I would widen the blue stripes the center of the flag over a little
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:38,559	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Take that upper left-hand Corner which is blue and change it back to green and he would take that City seal
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,583	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Off the flag
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:43,167	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	How to make all those that's how I would do the flag but it's been 30 years
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,703	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	Too late now
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:47,007	| 99pi-0140-vexillonaire-1 |	And they're like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait a minute
