EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:26,047	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	We're just the beginning because the earthquake shattered the cities gas means
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:31,423	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	And the gas that we doubt somewhere it connected with a spark
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:37,055	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	The massive fires that resulted lasted for three days and destroyed about 500 city blocks
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:43,455	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	Chinatown was one of the first neighborhoods to go up in smoke

EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,719	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	But before her career in Academia
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:56,767	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	She was in a slightly different line of work
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:07:01,119	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	I was a San Francisco firefighter for about 5 years
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,399	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	And so my first

EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:19,295	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	Earthquake and fire were social equalizers
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:24,927	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	That the shared experience of suffering United San franciscans of all colors and creeds

EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,863	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	On the Chinese
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:36,191	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	The racism against them only intensified
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:37,983	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	I call it hiding post-disaster
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:41,567	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	You could see this height and racism happening on at least
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,335	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	Two levels
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,615	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	First
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:45,407	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	With individual white Saint Francis

EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,527	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	And that's what gets erased
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:51,295	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	On April 18th
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:53,599	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:55,647	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	If you're an elite white Saint Francis
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,159	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	You don't have

EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:00,255	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	As
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:03,327	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	The Chinese are leaving their homes in desperation
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:05,119	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	They're being yelled at to get

EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,983	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	And according to Davies it wasn't just
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:13,055	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	Private citizens who are guilty of that heightened racism
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:17,663	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	Because the second place that the fire spur to flare up and racism

EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:04,735	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	Who did the Chinese all the way to Hunters Point
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,783	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	A region on the edge of town
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:09,087	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	It's where the city slaughterhouses were
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:13,183	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	But it wasn't long before the Chinese residents found out about the
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:17,279	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	And I think they fought back very
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:18,047	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	Intelligently
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:21,887	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	They got china's Empress Dowager so she involve

EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,287	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	But the coup de gras
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:29,311	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	Was Financial
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:30,847	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	Four-decade
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:34,431	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	San Francisco had been a key hub for trade with China
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:41,343	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	So a group of the city's top Chinese business owners wrote to the current mayor in a line
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:44,159	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	Which San Francisco officials could easily understand
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:47,231	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	And so the on the business level of the negotiation was

EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:59,007	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	And that was a loss that city leaders couldn't take
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,311	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	Less than a month after the quake
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,103	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	The mayor dissolved

EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,551	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	But they didn't stop there
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:14,623	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	The fire had left Chinatown a blank
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:17,183	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	And for the first time

EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:02,239	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	To create a Chinatown that looked the way

EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:06,591	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	Even though he knew
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:08,383	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	In his own mind that
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:10,687	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	The buildings in China didn't all look like this
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:14,783	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	Now looks plan might seem a bit counterintuitive

EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,879	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	The Chinese of San Francisco had been harassed
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,391	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	That's precisely
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:23,231	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	Cuz they look and dress differently from mainstream White America
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:24,767	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	And he was the guy saying

EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:50,367	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	And they also were pretty Savvy with the fact that people were interested
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,927	| 319_It_s_Chinatown_pt01 |	And they were interested in this exotic
