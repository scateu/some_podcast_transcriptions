EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:21,759	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	No it didn't
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,783	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Credibly
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,063	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Finally staged
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:24,831	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Theater
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:27,647	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Every little detail about that stage how they're standing
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:28,927	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Is it
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,743	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Litigated really
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,791	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	And if you watch carefully Sisseton

EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:41,983	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Each other what they're doing when the other person's talking
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,847	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Then there are the convention
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:49,663	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Also incredible dramaturgical feet
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:52,223	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	From the message of the speeches
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:54,527	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	The timing of the balloon drop
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:56,319	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Even the chance of the crowd
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,879	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	The teams so spontaneous
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,671	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Completely pre-planned
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:01,695	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	The campaign staff
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:12,959	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Seton says each section of the convention floor have a campaign
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,263	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Who receives instructions
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:18,079	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Passed down from a central planner
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:21,919	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	And the website make sure that their sections are her chanting appropriately
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:25,247	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Because left to their own devices a big group can become a big
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:30,879	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Stupid mop like at the Republican convention this year when a bunch of people started chanting the USA
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:34,207	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Preventing the committeewoman from Puerto Rico from taking money
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:42,911	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Which actually brings us to secret number 6
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:46,495	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	No matter how carefully the Advance Team plan
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:49,823	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Campaign events can and do go wrong
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,103	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	The biggest
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:51,871	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Screw-ups

EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,423	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	But it had been
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,191	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Kenny G's
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:56,031	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	And that brings us to secret number 7
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:12:02,431	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Everyone traveling with a campaign the advanced team that handlers probably even the candidate ends up loading

EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:27,007	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Sometimes it's rock and roll sometimes it's country but it's inevitably
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,287	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	Fun upbeat pop songs
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:31,871	| 99pi-0063-thepoliticalstage-1 |	But you come to the stage and you leave the stage and workable plan with two
