EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:30,143	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	There were no segregated schools in LA

EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:36,031	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	But the ones I go get it this would be instrumental later in life
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:38,591	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	When his High School connections would prove
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:40,127	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Very valuable
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,407	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And Paul Williams is career
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:44,735	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	It's hard to say exactly where Williams desire to be an architect
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,015	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Came from
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,063	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	He did have a natural talent for drawing
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,087	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And then
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Somehow he learns that architecture was a profession
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,975	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And then resolutely decided it was for him
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,279	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	What is kind of incredible when you think about it
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:00,607	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	He never knew another architect never relieved
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,375	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Heart of another rock
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:06,495	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	When Williams told his high school guidance counselor that he wanted to practice architecture
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:08,287	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	He was told to give it up
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:14,687	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	He should not try to be an architect he should be a doctor or a lawyer because black people always need doctors and lawyer
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:21,087	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And why people would not hire him as an architect in black people can afford them so
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:22,879	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	So he should just give up
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:25,695	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Didn't happen
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:27,999	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Williams didn't go to architecture school
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:34,399	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Instead he attended different art schools and engineering school just cobbling together the skills he needed in draft
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:36,703	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Landscaping materials
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:40,287	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Before he was certified as a contractor in 1915
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:43,615	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And then came the challenge of actually getting hired
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:45,919	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	His own notes he said he got
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:47,711	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Dressed in his best suit and
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:52,063	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	I wish you're probably only had one for church but
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:54,111	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Best suit Hazel briefcase
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,415	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Wood knocking on doors
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:59,487	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	He approached all the architects in the area that he admired
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:01,023	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And show them his portfolio
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,559	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	They all
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:05,375	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Said no but they smile when they said no
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,655	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Then he went back the next day
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,447	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And kept knocking
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:14,847	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	I finally got two offers one for $3 a week maybe five and one for nothing
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:21,503	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	But he took the job that was for nothing because he thought you would learn more and being a better person

EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:57,599	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Williams had an impeccable sense of scale
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:09:01,695	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And he knew just how to situate a structure on a property to make best use

EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,399	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And often they were

EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,727	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	The hire somebody it's one thing
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:50,335	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	To think that he's the best around you want the best around it's another thing.
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:55,199	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Many of his white client had never interacted with a black professional Buffet
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:59,807	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Williams had to find ways to work around white people discomfort with
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:03,135	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	He would not put people in a position where they felt like they had to shake his head
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:07,487	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	So you would put his hands in his pockets or behind his back
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:12,095	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And Williams also recognized that many clients wouldn't want to take a seat next
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:13,887	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:16,447	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	So to make them feel comfortable and to
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:20,031	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Possibly persuade people who aren't sure
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,311	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	About having this black man
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,359	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	He gets in a one-sided sqb on the other side
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,663	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And he would ask you
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,455	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Yo
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:30,783	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Do you want a formal living room do you want a formal dining room do you want to

EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,135	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And then
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,927	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Facing the client opposite the table
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:39,999	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Paul Williams with sketch out of vision of the house

EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,327	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	So that it faced the client
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:45,887	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And he was sketching upside down and come alive
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:46,655	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Before your eyes
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:49,215	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	I said I never interviewed anyone who saw him do it
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,263	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Who did not just light up
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,103	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	You should have stayed a
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:11:00,479	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	You've heard the expression Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did except backwards and in high heels

EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:05,343	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Except upside down
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:06,623	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And better
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:10,975	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Williams was not the first architect
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,999	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Draw upside down
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:16,095	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	But it's indicative of the lengths he went to accommodate his white client
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,655	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	He always dressed impeccably
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And worked
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,191	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Tirelessly
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:26,847	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	He wants word about a meeting with a potential client who warned Williams that he was also speaking with a number of Other Ark
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:31,455	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	The potential client as how soon Williams could submit preliminary drawings

EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:34,271	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Set volume
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:39,391	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	The client thought it was impossible because all the other Architects had asked for two or three weeks
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:44,511	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And you can bet that yes Paul Williams delivered that planet for the next day as promised
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:46,815	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	They didn't tell the client that a work
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:49,887	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	22 hours straight without eating or sleeping
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:51,679	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	He felt like he had to be light years
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,727	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Better just to be accepted
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,543	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And you know if he wasn't accepted
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:01,151	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Sometimes Williams was unwelcome in the very places
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:04,735	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	He was designing and even after he earned the respect of his client

EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:54,719	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	This is where the Paul Williams project comes in

EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:56,767	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Project is
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:59,839	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Primarily a research project that seeks
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:02,399	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Text to accumulate information photograph
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:04,191	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Etc about

EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:10,079	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And a big part of this project was actually collecting information
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:13,151	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And hunting down which buildings were designed by Williams
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:16,223	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	The project which is based at the University of Memphis
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,783	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Send a photographic team to Los Angeles

EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,063	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	In Las Vegas
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,855	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	To start a catalog
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:22,623	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Paul Williams building
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,439	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	But they were not always easy to find
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:30,303	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Because he was a master at. Style
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,071	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	So
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,095	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	He would have
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,375	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	A
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:35,167	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Spanish style house next door
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:37,727	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Volume style house next to a

EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:42,591	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Provincial style house or gothic style
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,615	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:46,943	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	The project has found less than half of Williams were
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:53,599	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Who knows how many of his buildings have been unknowingly torn down or renovated beyond recognition
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:59,487	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And the poems project is always hearing about more buildings to add to the catalog
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:01,535	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Mostly in Los Angeles but not exclusively
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:04,607	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Williams buildings are all over the country
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:07,679	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And there are few were brought we discovered them all the time
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:11,263	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And then we verify we verify every house
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,799	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	So we go to the
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,591	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	City documents
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,615	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	When pulling permits
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,151	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	All of that
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:19,967	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	They are constantly checking and correcting themselves
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:25,855	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	But it's really tough word because they have to go buy accounts and Records which were mostly burned and then
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:29,183	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	You know Williams of style is just all over the place
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:32,511	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	He just didn't stick the one thing he was always learning and developing
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,047	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:36,095	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Of course you would listen to his clients
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:37,375	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Trying to respond to
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:38,911	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	What they needed
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:40,447	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And what their desires were
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:42,239	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	That's architect Phil freelon again
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:43,775	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And I asked him
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:46,591	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	If Williams had to be responsive to his clients
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:48,127	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Flexible in his style
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:49,663	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	In order to survive the black market
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:57,343	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	I think that Paul Williams desire to satisfy his clients is something that many Architects chair
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,135	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	It's not necessarily
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,159	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Tied to race
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,951	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Although I will point out that
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:02,975	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	He had
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:03,999	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	To make
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:06,559	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Certain adjustments in his
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,095	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Approach to clients
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:10,655	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Because of who he was and
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,679	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	The time. In which
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,191	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	She practice
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:15,263	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	By the way I feel free line is also a big deal
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:22,175	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	You worked on the Museum of African diaspora in San Francisco the center for civil and human rights in Atlanta and moose

EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,551	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	On the mall in Washington

EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:33,951	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	To Fremont had already gotten into an architecture program
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:35,487	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And before he had even heard
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,511	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Paul Williams
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:40,351	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	How's baby into my third and fourth year of school before I learned about

EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,935	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	And that was really on my own
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:44,703	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	It wasn't anything
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:48,799	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	In the curriculum are in architectural history that mention him
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,335	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	Let's make this clear
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:54,431	| 99pi-0255-thearchitectofhollywood-1 |	There are a lot of black architects who get left out of the textbook
