EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:50,815	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	As in it's the bottom of the ninth and there's one out left
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:58,239	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Breaking bad news is as delicate a procedure as a knee surgery and there can be serious consequences if they
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:58,751	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Things go wrong
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:02,079	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	If the patient doesn't understand their diagnosis or
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:03,359	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	What the next steps are
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:06,687	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	They could end up making an informed decisions about their treatment
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:09,759	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Which is why many medical schools now offer training

EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:26,143	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	But that's not the only connection between acting and this particular facet of Medicine

EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,431	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He wasn't just a physician
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:40,223	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	There's also a comedian
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:42,527	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And he actually Drew an attic
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:45,855	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Experience to transform the way that doctors break bad news

EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:52,255	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	His name was Rob Buckman
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:59,423	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And his very unusual life prepared him perfectly to tackle what might be the hardest part
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,703	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Of a very hard job
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:08,127	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	In 1968 Rob Buckman was on stage in London's West End

EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:13,503	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I think the essence of it is that it was a
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:18,111	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The strip routine that you might have expected a female burlesque.
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:22,719	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	To come out and do with rub it in this extraordinarily physically unlikely

EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,919	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And they were all members of the footlight
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,199	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	A theatrical Club
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:47,295	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It was a big deal to be in the Footlights then and it still is today
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:53,695	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The group has turned out tons of famous comedians like half the comedy troupe Monty Python and more recently peep

EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:12,383	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Aroused by this routine

EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,951	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	There was no real punchline to it was there except
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:28,767	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Except that he had a flower painted on his stomach
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,303	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And that was robbed that.
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:37,471	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Robert going to Cambridge with the intention of becoming a doctor
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:40,799	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	My day he said he medicine and two classes in Biochemistry
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:44,383	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	By night he wrote and performed sketches in the Footlights Club room
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:47,199	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	House in the second story of a local fish shop
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:49,759	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He slept only three or four hours a night
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:52,831	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	After Cambridge Rob went to a teaching Hospital
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:58,207	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And it turns out that he answered medicine just as a big shift in medical culture was happen
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:01,791	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	One that changed the way doctors thought about their patient
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:09,471	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Around the same time Rob was on stage in London West End doing a strip routine
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:13,823	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	His name dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross was working on a pretty radical project
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:18,431	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	She was spending time with dying patients at a hospital in Chicago
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,735	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Listening to their stories
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:23,295	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I just sent them listen to dying patients
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:26,111	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I'm try to be their spokesman
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:28,927	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	You can only sit and listen and hear
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,207	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	What they say
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:33,535	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	They teach you nothing about dying but about living
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:39,935	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	In 1969 Kubler-Ross published a book based on her research called on death and dying
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,983	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	You know the five stages of grief
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,007	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	That's where that come
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:48,895	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The book became an international bestseller and brought conversations about dying into the home

EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,031	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And it was in this context
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:25,823	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	That Rob Buckman became a doctor
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:29,919	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	A Doctor Who's totally irreverent take on medicine
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:32,479	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Would ultimately help him transform the field
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:42,463	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Rob's work in the Cambridge Footlights got him noticed by the BBC
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:47,071	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Was still training at the doctor he wrote and performed on radio and TV

EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:04,223	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I think medicine show was like SNL or Mad TV but all medical
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:08,063	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It was actually a lot of comedy about medicine at this time
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,087	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Especially in Britain
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:15,487	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Doctors were seen as the stodgy and distant authority figures so they made a good Target for satire
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:19,071	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	One of Rob's recurring characters on the show was a malingerer

EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:51,999	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	To buy some cheese and it slowly becomes obvious
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:53,791	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	That they don't actually have any
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,839	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Any cheese in the shop
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,143	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Parmesan

EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,967	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Then stopped in slang.
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:50,111	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Rob's appearance with Monty Python mark one of the high points of his comedy career
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:54,207	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	If you look close that you might notice his face looks pale

EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:23,135	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I contracted a very interesting and very rare disease
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,439	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Interesting not just
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:27,743	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Because he defected me and turned me from

EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:32,351	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	But also because it's one of a group of disease

EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:51,807	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It began
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:53,855	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Very simply and very mildly
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,391	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	With pain
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,415	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	In my right wrist
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:58,207	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And when I move my wrist
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,231	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It Creek
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:02,559	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Rob had dermatomyositis
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:04,351	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Very rare autoimmune disease
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:08,447	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The disease causes your body to malfunction and attack its own muscle
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:10,495	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The Robb wasted away
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:13,055	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He developed these rashes all over
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:13,823	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	His body
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:16,639	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	At one point I couldn't actually put my hands behind my head
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:19,967	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Because so much of the skin was inflamed it was like wearing

EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:23,295	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Encased in
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:26,367	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Rob was married at this point and had two daughters
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:31,231	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	One of the more poignant moments of the film captures Rob trying and failing
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:32,255	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	To pick up one of his girls
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:35,071	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He talks about how weak and vulnerable
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,351	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Bully fails what happens
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,887	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Is very very simply
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:38,911	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The color
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,935	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Trains out of everything
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,471	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It's the same scene
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:44,287	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It's the same family as the same house
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:45,311	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	But
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,895	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The color the things you enjoy
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,431	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Have simply
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,199	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Play the tone
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:53,247	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	All film is about the
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:58,623	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	While Rob condition was so bad that his doctors thought he might not make it
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:01,951	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And the experience of being that close to death was profound
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:07,327	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Years later he broke all and especially important encounter with one of his Physicians
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:09,119	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And I was sitting on my way
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:13,471	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Very altruistic and I had all kinds of problems with the skin and bowel trouble
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,263	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And I was feeling lousy
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:19,103	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He said you got miss you girl. You go the other you look skinny but the muscles
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:21,407	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It must be awful for you
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,431	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I am sorry
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,479	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It must be awful
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:24,991	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Fall for you
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,271	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:29,087	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I very nearly burst into tears and hugged it
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:31,135	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Because he gave me
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,671	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Permission to feel
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:37,535	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The doctor was telling Rob that it was okay to have feelings about being sick
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:41,119	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	But the negative emotions were a valid part of the experience
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:44,703	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The doctor was paying attention not just to Robbins physical state
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:46,751	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	But also his emotional state
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:49,567	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And while this might seem obvious
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:52,127	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It wasn't especially common for doctors to
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:52,895	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	To do this back then
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:55,967	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	This moment was simple but important
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:59,551	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It would go on to become the Cornerstone of Rob's approach
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:00,831	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The doctor-patient communication
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:08,767	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And then little by little
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,047	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Rob started getting better
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:13,375	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He was having blood plasma replacement therapy
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:15,679	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And a new drug he was taking started to work
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:17,471	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The last 4 weeks
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:17,983	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Something like
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:20,543	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I can drive my car
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,567	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I can
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:23,103	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Straighten my elbows
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:29,503	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I can dress myself I can put any kind of sucks on even really sucks by May of 1980 Rob's condition had
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,015	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I turned around
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:35,647	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I can go for walks in the park with the kids and don't feel too bad about it and I can stay awake all day
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:40,767	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I watch television in the evening or whatever like go to bed at midnight and then live
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:49,727	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Normal life Med going back is incredibly intense work schedule
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:55,871	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He was more successful than ever training as a specialist in oncology which is the branch of medicine that deals with cancer
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:19:00,223	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	While simultaneously co-hosting a popular TV science show called
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:01,247	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Where there's life
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:07,647	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Where there's life returns as doctors Miriam stoppard and Rob Buckman explore such topics as cosmetic surgery
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,439	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Unwed mothers and the nursing
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:12,255	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	But that intensity wasn't good for his marriage
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:16,607	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He and his wife ended up getting a divorce and in 1985
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,887	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Rob move to Toronto
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:19,679	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	To take a job at a hospital
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:23,007	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	In Canada ROM had to restart his life completely
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:28,127	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It was there he would end up making his most lasting contributions to the field of Medicine
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:32,735	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He started studying the way that doctors communicated with people they were treating
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,271	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Specifically
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,575	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He was interested in how doctors interact
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:37,343	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Dying patient
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:41,183	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Because he himself had recently been a dying patient
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:44,255	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	This is from an interview he gave in 1999
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:46,815	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The great thing about
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:49,119	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Being able from my point of view
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:53,727	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Was that I found out that I could tolerate mean I did
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,775	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	But I didn't come
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:59,103	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I didn't have my hero by any means but I wasn't a different person
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:07,039	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	His big realization was that doctors didn't need to hide information from their patients and tiptoe through tough subject
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:09,599	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Sick people could withstand a lot
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,391	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	So when I recovered
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:14,463	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I was thin able to say okay I've been on the phone
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:15,999	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And I stayed the same
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:18,815	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	No I can be brave when talking to the patient
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:21,375	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He walked in my room like
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,167	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	A breath of
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:26,495	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Not fresh air I was sort of like a
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:28,031	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Wind
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,311	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Is huge energy
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:32,639	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Exploding into the room and I've never actually
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:34,687	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Met anybody quite like him before
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,991	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I think most people haven't
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:43,647	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Dr. Patricia Shaw was a cancer researcher at the same hospital where Rob worked in Toronto
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,183	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	She goes by Pat
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:51,583	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Patton Robinette in the most dr.lee meet-cute scenario imaginable
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:53,119	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Why didn't you ask me
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,887	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Crisco
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:55,167	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And so we came into
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:55,679	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Kisimi
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:57,727	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And that's how we really
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,263	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	That's our first conversation
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:03,103	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	One thing led to another and they got married in 1988
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,663	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It was around this time that Rob started writing more
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:07,967	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He had a large piece of
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:09,759	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Solid mahogany
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:12,319	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	They brought with them from England
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:13,087	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:15,903	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	His favorite spot was just sit at this desk
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:16,672	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Cache of computer
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:20,000	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	So even though he's really busy
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,024	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	At the hospital
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:23,584	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He's been a huge amount of time
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:25,120	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	After those hours
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:25,888	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Working in a study
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:27,680	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Rob wrote a book
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:29,216	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Called I don't know what to say
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:32,288	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	How to help and support someone who is dying
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:35,104	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It's kind of like What to Expect When You're Expecting
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:39,200	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	If what you're expecting is that somebody close to you is going to die
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:44,320	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It's a very Frank but easy to read book that covers everything from
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:48,160	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Basic listening skills to the sexual needs of the dying to survivor's guilt
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:50,720	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And then in 1992
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:53,536	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Rob published the most important book of his career
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:54,816	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It was titled
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:56,352	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	How to break bad news
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:58,656	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The first medical textbook
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,424	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	On the subject
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,960	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	When Rob Buckman
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:04,288	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Wrote the book on how to get bad news it was from his
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:08,128	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Experience as an oncologist having to give it
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:09,920	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Several times a week
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:12,736	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	That's dr. Walter Bale again
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:16,576	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He was also studying doctor-patient communication when Rob's book came out
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:17,856	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He understood that
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:21,952	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Bad news was a series of steps that could be broken down into series of steps
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:27,328	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Walter and Rob would eventually write a set of guidelines based on route
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,096	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Book
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,632	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	They called their strategy
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:30,912	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The spikes protocol
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:32,960	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Spike's was an acronym
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,240	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	That's good for setting
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:36,032	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Reception invitation
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:36,800	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Knowledge
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:37,824	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Emotions
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:39,104	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Stratagene summary
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:43,712	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It's a mnemonic device that doctors can use as they prepare to give bad news
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:46,784	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And then during the actual conversation with the patient

EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:04,448	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Soon Walter and Rob were giving presentations on spikes at hospitals all over the world

EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,064	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Make It Clap
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:33,952	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	As you can hear from those scenes Rob with master
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:35,488	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Breaking Bad News
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,280	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He was calm
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,584	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Present compassionate and clear
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:43,168	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And not just because he been a patient
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:44,960	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	But because he been a comedian
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:48,544	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It's the ability to put yourself in your audience's shoes
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:51,104	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And understand
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:52,384	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	What makes them
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:54,944	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Check right so if you're comedian
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,224	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	You want to know
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:57,504	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	What you can do
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:59,040	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	To make people laugh right
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:00,320	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	If you're a doctor
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,880	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	You need to put yourself
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:04,160	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	In people shoes
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:06,976	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And imagine what they need
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:10,048	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	In order to make sense out of
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:11,584	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The process of giving bad news
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:15,424	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Even though Rob had recovered from his illness
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:19,520	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It has taken a toll on his body and he had health problems for the rest of his life
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:23,360	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	A case of shingles left him paralyzed on one side
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:25,920	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Your difficulty dressing himself in Wok
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,712	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He couldn't drive a car
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:28,992	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And that was
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,040	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Pretty devastating
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:32,320	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Again Rob's wife
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:37,952	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	This insult leaving him with his permanent episode I think was
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:41,792	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Really really damaging any other hard time coping with that
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:46,912	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	But in his typical robway he kept working on his many projects
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:51,776	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	In 2011 he flew to London to film a series of health videos with Terry Jones
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:53,824	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Another member of Monty Python
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:56,896	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Then he got back on the plane to Toronto
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:58,944	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Afters light Garden
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:27:00,736	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	You didn't arrive any wasn't answering his
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:02,016	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Text messages
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:05,600	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Wasn't too unusual he's travel so much flights
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:06,368	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	. delayed
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,904	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I went to bed
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:10,464	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Panda boat midnight
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:14,304	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	There is a knock on the door and there was a policeman at the
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:15,328	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	At the door
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:18,400	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Doctors aren't the only ones who have to break bad news
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:22,240	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Talk to bit of nonsense and then asked if I was
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:24,288	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Mrs. Pacman
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:28,640	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And then eventually got caught around saying that the prophet passed away
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:34,016	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Robert died in his sleep on the plane from an undiagnosed heart condition
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,296	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He was only 63
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:38,368	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It took Pat a long time to get over the shock
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:39,392	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	There was
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:41,440	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	So much boo
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:47,584	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Missing Rob there is so much about having to deal with the realities of what happens when somebody dies
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:51,936	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And even though Raab himself had talked openly about death and dying
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:56,544	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Even though he'd spent years writing books that encourage people to be frank about the
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,056	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	These subjects
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,872	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He wasn't actually ready for his own death
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:04,992	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	In real terms you know like finance and insurance and all that kind of stuff
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:06,784	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	What was there was hard
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:10,368	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Even though it's 6 years later and it still makes me
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:14,976	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Bacteria thinking about it
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:19,328	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Beyond Rob's death
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:21,376	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Spike's has endured
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:24,192	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	It's been absorbed into the mainstream of American Medicine
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:31,104	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Just recently the American Society of clinical oncology started recommending that doctors use a protocol
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:32,128	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Call when giving bad news
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:34,432	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Therefore spikes is a good example
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:38,272	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And spikes is taught in many medical schools in the US and Canada
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:40,320	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	As well as schools in Europe
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:41,600	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Asia and South America
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:45,184	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	You remember Artie the medical scene from top of the show
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:48,512	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	He has spikes navigate his encounter with Mark the actor
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:55,424	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Yeah I think if I hadn't had this beforehand I would have been
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:57,472	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Completely lost I would not have known
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:58,752	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Can I where to go next
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:06,176	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Spike's isn't the only set of guidelines for Breaking Bad news and it may not apply to every bad news situation
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:09,248	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	In some scenarios like an emergency room
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:12,576	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Doctors might not have the time to be that delicate
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:18,464	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And time is one of the main things working against doctor's as they try to do their jobs
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:19,488	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Thoroughly and compassion
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:23,584	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	These days the average physician visit last
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,608	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	About 21 minutes
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:26,912	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	More than half of visits last
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:27,680	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	15 minutes
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,448	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Charles S

EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:13,728	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Flat pocket
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:19,360	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	So I'm back to the reporter John Basile to talk about some of the remarkable
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:24,224	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Beautiful pretty much unseen comedy that he found while he was reporting on Rob Buckman
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:27,552	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	But we can fit into the new story itself so
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:29,856	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Is a little extra bit for you Monty Python fans
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:34,208	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	So are you a Monty Python fan
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:37,024	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I would say it went to a Monty Python face
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:40,608	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Efface in junior high
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:42,912	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	You find them and you think
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:47,776	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I'm really special for liking this when no one else liked it cuz it was just on PBS
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:51,104	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Add that was my face why I watched all of them and
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:54,688	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I love them but I haven't kept my Phantom alive
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:34:01,088	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I'm a huge Monty Python fan and when I started reporting the story had no idea there was any connection between Robin
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:02,112	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Monty Python so
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:04,672	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Finding that out was like a big deal
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,792	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Found all this rare stuff
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:15,936	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	That hardly anybody has seen like stuff I got from tapes that Rob's Widow pulled out of storage
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:22,848	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Like Mike what would give me example so right around the time Rob was writing how to break bad news in the early night
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:23,616	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	90s
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:27,968	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	John Cleese got in touch with him and he had this idea for a series called videos for page
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:32,320	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I said it always seemed to me that it would be a very good idea to make
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:38,208	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Videos for people who had just being told by the GP
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:45,120	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	That they had some sort of medical problem because when you told that you always get anxious and then
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:46,656	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Absolutely the worst time
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:48,960	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	To take in information
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:55,360	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The idea was to make a bunch of videos describing various medical conditions in detail so that patients with
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:58,944	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Weather conditions could replay them whenever they needed a refresher
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:02,016	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And almost all of them start with this little sketch that kind of
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:03,808	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Deuce Breaking Bad News
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:06,112	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And some very beautiful music
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:13,792	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	90s CD-ROM music
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:21,984	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Or I don't owe

EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:34,272	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Chris plays a patient inquiring about his condition and Rob the doctor precedes to lay some head
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:35,552	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Heavy medical jargon on him
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:39,648	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	What exactly are leg

EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:43,648	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	The time I get home
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:46,464	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I always realize that I haven't

EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:50,560	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Always something
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:51,584	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	I should have asked
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,376	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	For some reason didn't
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:54,656	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And that's
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:55,168	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Exactly
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,704	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Why we've made this
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:37:03,360	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	So then the rest of the video is just Rob going over the conditions slowly and in painstaking.
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:03,872	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Detail

EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:19,232	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	Glue ear which I've never heard of
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:21,024	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	But they ran into a problem
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:29,472	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	A major problem which none of us had anticipated and I'm not entirely sure no one could have anticipated
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:33,824	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	And what was the problem
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:35,872	| 306_Breaking_Bad_News_pt1 |	We set up all sorts of schemes
