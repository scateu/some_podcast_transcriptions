EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:48,864	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	But as it got bigger
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:51,936	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	She had to move the ball outside or it gets stuck down there for good

EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,344	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	They rolled it for 4 hours a day
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,880	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Every single day
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:14,976	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	It became an addiction in on possession and it was something that he wanted
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,768	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	To do because it
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,815	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Spark something inside of him
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:20,607	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Princess Johnson was a perfect

EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:28,031	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Has it got bigger he rolled it around the yard
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,823	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	To make sure he added 20 evenly
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,127	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	So it remained beautifully
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:32,639	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Symmetry
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:34,943	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Especially
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:39,039	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The ball got so big that he couldn't roll it around his yard anymore with just his body weight
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:44,159	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Johnson invented an ingenious method to rotate the volume using railroad Jack
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:48,767	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	A jack under the ball and use it to nudge the ball forward
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:50,815	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And then the ball would roll
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:55,167	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Intercourse on the other side of it he would have something to stop the ball from Rolling completely
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:58,239	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	He repeated this process over and over
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:01,311	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Rolling a ball of twine rolling the ball

EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:17,439	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The ball attracted a lot of attention both in and out of Darwin it appeared on television that written about

EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:25,375	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The ball had made Johnson's famous even if he wasn't willing to admit it

EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:36,607	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	You quickly realize there's something about them that you know it's somebody who took

EDL	00:10:54,079	00:11:00,223	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Yeah but I don't think you change anything if someone were to tell him you know you're going to die from SUV looks old and you keep doing it
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,343	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	In the story could have ended there
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:07,135	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	With two dead twin men

EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,023	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	But
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,815	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Cawker City wasn't finished yet
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,887	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Stupid left the twine ball to the city after
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,655	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	He died
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:21,983	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Infer few years it just sat there in the downtown gazebo
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,007	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	A tribute to the
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:25,055	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The second greatest twine ball roller in history
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,359	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	But then the town decided
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,407	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	They didn't want to settle for second-best
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:31,199	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	We decided let's have some

EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:34,015	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And we started having
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,039	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	What we call our annual
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:42,975	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Resident of cawker City decided to jump in and start adding more twine to the Stover ball to see if they could beat the
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,999	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The record again
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:46,303	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	But this time it wouldn't be the product of one man
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:48,095	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	But an entire community
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:52,703	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The town had what was a brilliant idea which was let's let the community keep rolling it
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:55,519	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Here's Doug Kirby from Roadside America again
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:12:02,175	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	He says that cawker City started holding twine Athens once a year where everyone in town would gather to help grow the twine ball
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:03,967	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And eventually
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:05,759	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	They started allowing visitors to wrap
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,039	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The twine ball on a daily basis
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,599	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Give me the ball

EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:16,255	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	More visitors and let's just have it
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,791	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The ball set up so that

EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:23,423	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The ball you'll see immediately that you're
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:25,215	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Adding to this world records
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:26,495	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	So it's a
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:27,775	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	It's a different
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,311	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	If it's a different approach
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:33,919	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	When did Clover literally keep spools of twine on her at all times
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:36,223	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	On the off chance that she runs into someone
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,759	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	She wants to add to the ball
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:40,063	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	If you go to my car or my pickup
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:43,647	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Either one has twine that I have ready to let
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,695	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	People add twine on to the ball
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,975	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Anyone else in town
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:48,767	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Carrie's twine with them
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:52,863	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	But Linda Clover does
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:58,239	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	So many people participating the cawker city ball continues to grow bigger and bigger
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:12:59,775	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The latest estimate
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,311	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	How to get 20000
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,079	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	500 lb
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:05,407	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Over 2500 lbs heavier than Johnson
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:08,479	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And when you see it in person
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:11,039	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	It's unquestionably larger in circumference
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:16,415	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	But not everyone agrees that rolling 20 balls
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,439	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Should be a group project
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:19,743	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Especially in Darwin
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:24,607	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Courtney says that Johnson's ball is particularly impressive not just because of its
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:25,887	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Perfectly round shape
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:28,959	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	But because it was the soul accomplished
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,239	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The one man
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:34,335	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	It needed to be done by him cuz it needed to be perfect and need to be solid
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:36,895	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Needs to be done with only a certain type of twine
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:39,711	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	You know he was just so particular needed things done
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,247	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	By himself
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:42,783	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And remember
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:46,879	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Johnson had his own special technique for rolling a perfectly symmetrical sphere
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,927	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	People of cawker City
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,439	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Don't have that
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,999	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	They have no way to wrap the top
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:55,071	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	In the bottom of the ball so it just keeps getting wider and wider
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:56,351	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	In fact
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,655	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	It's not really a ball anymore
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,703	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Moreauville with a flat bottom
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:01,983	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	So
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:03,519	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Cawker City Spa
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:04,287	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Bigger
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:06,847	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	But the Darwin ball is definitely nicer to look at
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:08,127	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Darwin
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:11,711	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Is by far my favorite ball
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,271	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	This is Edward Meyer
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,807	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And he's currently retired
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,855	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	But up until a year ago
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:19,135	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	He had probably
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:21,183	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The coolest job I've ever heard of
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,231	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	My primary focus
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:25,279	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	What's the by Xzibit
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:27,071	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Put in the museum

EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,935	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Around the world
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:36,543	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Where was vice president of exhibits in archives with Ripley's Believe It or Not
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:41,407	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Wing it was literally his job to find the weirdest things in the world and put them on display
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,711	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And back in the early 90s
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:46,015	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Zion Darwin's giant twine ball
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,063	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The Darwin ball
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:54,975	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	It's almost romantic as it's one man's dream and it takes him a long time
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:59,583	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And he has certain Rules by and doesn't break
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:07,519	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Getting silly I guess but now it's it's an accomplishment like climbing Everest
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:11,871	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Meyer had been interested in the Darwin twine ball for years
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,639	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And as luck would have it
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,175	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Johnson's nephew
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,199	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	If you had inherited
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,223	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	His entire estate
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:17,247	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Including

EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:29,279	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	He invited me and I said sure I'd love to come
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:34,399	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Meyer was asked to pitch the town on the idea of putting Johnson's twine ball in a Ripley's Museum
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:36,191	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Personally
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:36,959	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	He thought
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:39,263	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	What better way to honor Johnson's accomplishments
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:41,823	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Going to put it on display or possibly thousands of
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,103	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	People of week would see it
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:45,663	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	I gave a presentation
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:48,479	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	But I wanted to buy
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:52,319	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The reaction was all over our dead body
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:53,855	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	I was
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,903	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Probably one of the most
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:58,463	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Uncomfortable evenings in my entire life
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:03,071	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	I was literally in fear of my life
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,887	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Not sure how this was going to end

EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:11,519	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	But they were pretty upset
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,543	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	For 1
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:14,079	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The people of Darwin thought the

EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:17,407	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The more important
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,455	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The ball had become
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:21,247	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Part of Darwin's identity
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:23,807	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Slimeball is a good analogy with say it
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:25,855	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The twine that binds represents
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:28,927	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Do you know not only are we support that but

EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,655	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	But they even started an annual tradition
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:40,447	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Call Darwin twine ball day
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:45,055	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Which includes a number of twine ball related activities like at Wind Cave which is
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,591	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Kind of like a 5K
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:47,615	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	It starts out with
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:55,295	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	A 17400 400-foot run that's 70400 foot run to celebrate us
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:57,343	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	17400 pound twine ball
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:59,135	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	They pass out candy to kids
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:02,719	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Roll miniature versions of the twine ball down the street and have a parade
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:07,583	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	He probably last round 35 minutes which is the right length for a parade these days in my opinion
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:11,167	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Francis Johnson ball had become Central to life in Darwin
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:16,031	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And that we made it clear that if Meijer wanted a giant twine ball for Ripley's
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,567	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	He would have to get it from some other town
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,359	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And that's exactly
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,895	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	What Edward Meyer dad
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:23,711	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Well I literally read it in an airplane magazine
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:25,503	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	At this guy in Texas
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,783	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Had been inspired
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:30,623	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	As much by cawker city as he had been by a Darwin
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:36,767	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	As it turned out while Darwin and cawker city were battling it out in their public twine ball arms race
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:39,327	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	A third ball was rapidly growing in

EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:42,655	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The hands of a man named JC Payne

EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:49,055	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Who was always in search of a new project
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,847	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And in the late 1980s
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:51,359	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Hefei
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:56,223	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Pain had read about the Battle of the balls in Darwin and cawker City
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:58,271	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And have a clear favorite in the rain
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:03,903	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	From the beginning JCPenney did not want cawker City to beat Francis Johnson
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:10,559	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Apparently pain was not a fan of the fact that the cawker City Community effort was about to beat Johnson solo Pro
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:13,887	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Paine believed in the great man Theory

EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:22,847	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	You know that it was a shame the cawker city was going to be bigger than Darwin's cuz the whole town was involved in it
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:29,759	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	He thought that this was no I use the word cheating but that's my interpretation
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:34,623	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And said y'all if Francis isn't going to be the world's biggest then I'm going to be
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:39,487	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Can you start rolling his ball until 1987
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,791	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Apple 37 years after
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:47,935	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The by 1992 the Guinness Book of World Records declared it the largest ball in the world
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,983	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	In a few short years
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:53,311	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	He managed to create a ball that was 42 ft in circumference
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:55,615	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	13 ft tall and weighed six
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,383	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Tons
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:59,711	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Part of it is that he had a tool used
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:05,343	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Technology to add the string to it he had a tractor he had a hook type
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:06,623	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Implemented
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:14,047	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Prevented him from getting his hands wrecked that he wasn't literally even touching it at some point
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:19,935	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Part of it was the euro used whatever he could get in terms of string nylon specifically
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:23,263	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Which bothered a lot of twine ball Pier is to like to think of
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,799	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Twine anymore traditional
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:26,079	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	More natural scent
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,871	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	I seen the pile of

EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:31,455	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	You're Linda Clover from cawker City again
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,503	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	They're complaining were talking apples and oranges
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,295	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	You know complete
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,319	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Something completely different
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:39,391	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The main gripe about JC paintball
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:41,951	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Was that he used artificial colored nylon twine
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,999	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Well Johnson and Stover
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,279	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Both used sisal twine
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,839	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Sisal is an earthy color
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:49,119	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Plant-based material
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:49,887	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	It has that classic
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:53,727	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Whereas nylon just looks like City Slicker twice
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:58,847	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Nylon also weighs less making paintball much lighter than both cawker City and Darwin
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:02,687	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The end result was a multi colored artificial
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,455	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Lighter weight
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:03,967	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Monstrosity
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,527	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And Edward Meyer from Ripley
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:07,807	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Had to have a

EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:14,207	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	No I'll buy this because
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:17,023	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	You know I've missed out the one I really wanted but
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:18,303	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	I can still get one
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:22,911	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	So he flew to Valley View Texas to meet pain in person and see the ball for himself
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:25,215	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Nice band salt of the earth
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:28,031	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	A little bit on the competitive side
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:30,591	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	But
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:32,383	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Basic
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:36,991	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Football when I first saw
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,807	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Pretty darn good
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:41,855	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	But it didn't look good for long
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:45,183	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Pretty soon they realize that they have to move this 6
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:48,511	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Tongue ball Ripley's Museum being built
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:49,535	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	In Branson Missouri
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:56,191	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Well we dragged it out of the barn and that messed it up a little bit and then we had to
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:58,239	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Rain
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:21:01,567	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Which messed it up more and then it was
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:04,639	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Drop onto a flatbed tractor
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:07,455	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Flattens
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:13,343	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And then it was driven 3000 miles to Branson Missouri from Denton Texas
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:19,488	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Build this misshapen monster of a ball was going to be the PS2 resistance
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:21,024	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Of the new Ripley's Museum
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:25,632	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And the ball was so huge that the building had to be constructed around it
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:27,424	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	If for any reason

EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:31,488	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Specifically like an American thing but it's kind of like a new world
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:32,512	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Country swing
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:38,912	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	I think part of that is that love of superlatives does seem not just an American
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:41,216	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Something that is very young country kind of see
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:46,080	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Because Australia and Canada also have that sort of need
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:47,872	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	To make a mark
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:54,016	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Because we're kind of lacking in that old old old history of our built environment because everybody who
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:58,624	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Here was much more in tune with nature and didn't make giant monuments
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:33:00,416	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	To themselves so once we
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:04,000	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Started making our own history we realize we don't have much
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:05,792	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	So we started doing these
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:07,328	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Superlative things
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:09,632	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The kind of loudmouth show offi
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:11,424	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Say hey we're here
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:12,192	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	This is
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:13,216	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Look at our chicken
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:19,872	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Look at it
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:23,200	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Who is because we don't have something like that
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:23,968	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The pantheon
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:24,736	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	We have
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:30,880	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The world's largest frying pans or something like that
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:34,976	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	What I think I like most about
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:36,000	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The world's largest
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:36,768	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Question
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:38,048	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Of the smallest versions
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:42,912	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Of the world's largest things project isn't isn't just that it's
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:45,216	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	You know a catalog of the biggest things
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:45,984	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	It's
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:48,032	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Also wait for Nelson to really explore the
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:49,056	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Stories behind
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:52,640	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	You know The small-town Monuments that aren't traditionally valued from an
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:53,152	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Academic standing
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:55,456	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Right I mean I guess
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,248	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	There isn't the same sort of
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:59,552	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Academic rigor applied to
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:04,928	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Roadside attractions as there is other forms of vernacular architecture but there's no reason why
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:06,208	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Yeah exactly
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:07,744	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Nelson actually says that this
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:09,280	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Attitude
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:10,048	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Kind of ship
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:10,560	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Lately
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:13,376	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	I think there's a growing number of people who are
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:16,704	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Who are taking them seriously and I've had those
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:19,264	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Debate since learning from Las Las Vegas
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:22,336	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Just came out and ended up being such a tone for architects
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:25,152	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	They address that very thing is
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:27,200	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	When is when is Kitchen Bouquet
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:30,016	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	When is populous architecture okay
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:34,368	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And so with that introduction into scholarly debate
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:35,904	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	People started
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:39,232	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Looking at then again all of these things that they grown up around
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:43,328	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The built environment and re-evaluating them in
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:45,120	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	The lenses that they were taught
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:46,656	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	To look at more serious
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:49,472	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And we covered a lot of this stuff in it
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:53,056	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Story Avery dad about Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi about
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:54,336	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Gallery from Las Vegas
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:55,104	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	I mean this
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:55,872	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Idea that
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:59,200	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Yeah they became really advocates for the architecture of Las Vegas
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:05,344	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	That most people and even people like I performed in Las Vegas for the a conference and somebody wrote me
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:08,160	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	To say I can't believe we're doing it in Lost
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:09,696	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Guess there is nothing of value
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:10,976	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And I was like
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:18,144	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	It was a whole book about it
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:18,912	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Around the stinking
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:20,448	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	You know in
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:21,216	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	In general
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:22,496	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	We should
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:23,264	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Think about
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:24,032	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	What people go to
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,568	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	You know because
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:29,152	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	You know that's worth evaluating why they want to be in place
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:31,200	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Lake Las Vegas I mean really does Tita
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:33,760	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Yes exactly like that that demand is
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:34,272	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	There for a reason
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:37,856	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Giant fiberglass pheasant
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:42,208	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Or a twine ball might I mean yes it's silly and it comes off
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:44,256	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	It's too late but people are drawn to these stories
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:45,792	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Stories behind them in the
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:47,072	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	People who made these objects
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:49,888	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Because it tells you a lot about you know the region
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:50,912	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And people live there
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:53,728	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	I mean since
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:55,008	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	They were a reaction
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:57,824	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	To the way that we travel
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:36:00,384	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Embed we will be getting to bypass a lot of these towns
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:03,456	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Kinecta came attractions for this reason
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:06,016	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	A Roadside Attraction continuing to evolve
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:07,552	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	As travel of all
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:10,624	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	It now and I I asked
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:16,000	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	I asked Nelson this question because you know we're not in like the rapid expansion
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:16,512	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Face
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:19,328	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Petoskey decades
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:23,936	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	We've been doing air travel and with climate change what kind of more aware of
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:25,216	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Carbon footprints
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:30,080	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	And also this Wednesday
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:32,896	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Okay
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:35,968	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	World
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:36,736	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Largest
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:37,760	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Ball of carbon
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,368	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	I asked her about this
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:44,672	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Cuz I was kind of curious and
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:46,464	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Still it's still a little bit of a question
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:53,120	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	I'm not sure yet I mean will there be a whole new set that surrounds Mass rail or
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:37:00,544	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Artwork in airports has really exploded to artwork is happens in that controlled environment
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:03,360	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Attractions don't really have an inlet there yet
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:04,128	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Because they're
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:05,664	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	You're so control
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:07,200	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Will there be a
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:09,504	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	A slow version in cities that
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:13,344	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	It's just Alleyway embellishments at the new roadside is the sidewalk
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:14,880	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	A little tiny thing
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:17,952	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	To the next Starbucks
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:19,488	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	I think that that's
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:21,536	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Right on the money
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:25,888	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	I mean it just because like there's all these types of little artistic
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:27,424	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Interventions in Urban Land
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:30,496	| 362_Goodness_Gracious_Great_Balls_of_Twine_pt_01_correct |	Landscapes and maybe they've always been there I don't know if 8
