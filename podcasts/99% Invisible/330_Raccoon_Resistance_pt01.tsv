EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:33,696	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The city of Toronto has a special relationship
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:34,976	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	With raccoons
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:35,744	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Or at least
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:36,768	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	They think they
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:41,632	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	You're not the only city with raccoons but we often act like we are
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:44,704	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	We like to think Toronto is the raccoon capital of the world
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:47,776	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And were strangely proud of that distinction
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:50,848	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But we really have no data to back it up
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:52,128	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	This is Amy Dempsey
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:53,920	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The reporter for the Toronto Star
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:58,016	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Do we have more raccoons and say Chicago or Vancouver
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:02,624	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Well we don't actually know you can't count Urban raccoons they're all over the place
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:04,928	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But who needs data when you can
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:05,952	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Feel it in your heart
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:09,536	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	A few years ago when a raccoon died on Young Street
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:13,632	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Torontonians named in Conrad and built a vigil around his body with

EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,448	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	In a framed photo
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,216	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Cards
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:20,032	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	So if science ever disproved this idea
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:25,152	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Of Toronto is raccoon Nation I really fear for Toronto I think we're going to have an identity crisis
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:29,504	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Toronto's feelings about raccoons are not uncomplicated
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:33,088	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Our relationship with raccoons is kind of a love-hate relationship
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:36,672	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	We hate when they destroy our grass and break into our houses
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:38,976	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And yes they do break into our houses
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:42,304	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Maybe worse than all this though
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:45,120	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Was the raccoons proclivity for getting into the compost
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,936	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	What's the city started collecting for the residents
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:50,240	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	In green bins several years ago
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:52,288	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	From the perspective of the raccoon
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:55,104	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	These Campos bands were an incredible development
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:59,200	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	An all-you-can-eat buffet with the plastic and other garbage RT
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:00,736	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Thoughtfully removed
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:03,808	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And the raccoons will go to town on our stuff and just spread it everywhere
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,600	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And you wake up
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,904	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Look out your window and go s***
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:11,744	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And then maybe you'd argue with your spouse or roommates about who'd have to clean it up
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:18,144	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The green bins become a feast a veritable Feast For the raccoons this is Toronto mayor John Tory a few years ago
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:23,008	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Go dressed in a blue suit in front of a row of Canadian flags if he's announcing a plan to
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:25,056	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Step up the war on crime
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,336	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	In a way
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:29,920	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	He was probably nothing that represents more of a nuisance
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:32,224	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	In a big city like this
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:35,296	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Dan of the feasting of the raccoons on the contents of
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:35,808	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Set the green bins
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,856	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	End the war on raccoons
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:43,232	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Started started with Mayor John Tory
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,024	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	They're hungry
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,048	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And they're determined
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,584	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But our job
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:49,632	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Together with our private sector reinforced
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,680	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	I is to show them
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,728	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	That we are smarter
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,776	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	He said things like
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,568	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	We are armed we are motivated
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,592	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	We have left a nose
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:01,408	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Stone unturned in our fight against raccoon Nation
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:09,600	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The reason muir-torre felt so prepared that day was that the city was unveiling a new raccoon resistant green bin
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,368	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Organic waste
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:16,000	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	During the same press conference the mirror held up new been victoriously
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:20,863	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Ended up with reporters as cameras Flash
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:25,471	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	I would say it was 75% tongue and cheek
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:29,567	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But there was also a hint of seriousness to it it was pretty clear
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:33,663	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But he was confident the new green bins would solve our raccoon problems
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:37,503	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Confident enough to stand in front of news cameras and say
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,575	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Is not an option
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:44,415	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But Amy was about to find out for herself
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,439	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Weather defeat
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,207	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Was an option
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:47,999	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And spoiler alert
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,303	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	It was an option
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:00,287	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Let's back up just a bit
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:03,103	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	This all started the way most things starting cities
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,663	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	With an RFP. PDF
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,967	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Yeah they put out a request for proposals

EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:35,359	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	If the city of Toronto was in a war with raccoons this ladies and gentlemen
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,383	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Was the General

EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,199	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And he took his role
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:40,735	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Very seriously
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:43,039	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	I mean rehrig Pacific takes
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:47,903	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	New product development very very seriously and and there's a five pronged approach
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:49,951	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Which we initiate
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,743	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Dennis is in many ways
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:53,535	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	A classic sales guy
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:57,119	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	He wears shirts with his company logo he has a firm handshake
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,423	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	I found him to be
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,727	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Extremely helpful and genuine
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:05,823	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	When he speaks about the green bin you can tell
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:12,735	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	He's really proud of it it's something that I'm very very passionate about not only being part of the design
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,759	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Team
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:17,087	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But I'm also Raisin in the city of Toronto so I know
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:19,647	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	What it means to me as a resident
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:26,303	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Rehrig Pacific had a number of design criteria they were trying to meet with their green bin program
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:27,583	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	For example
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:32,703	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Ben's would need to be picked up and dumped by an automatic on that reached out from the truck
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:37,567	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The bandwidth need a lid that closed and locked to protect against raccoons
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:43,967	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But the lid would also have to open up automatically when the bed was turned upside down and dumped into the truck by the owner
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:50,367	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	So we have to ensure that the lock itself disengages 100% of the time the container must
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:52,415	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Function in extreme weather conditions

EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:59,839	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	You don't safety kids end up in the darndest places
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:06,239	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Definitely don't want them in organic container but more importantly we don't want them locked inside the container Wheels limit
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:12,127	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Nation of internal CashPoints any material that becomes trapped inside the container could pose significant risk
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:15,455	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	With respect to the X Factor for the residence
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:19,039	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	On top of the X Factor in the meddling kids
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:22,111	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Rehrig Pacific had to think about Enemy Number One
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:23,903	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The raccoons
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:28,767	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Yes so we worked with an urban raccoon specialist to basic
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,047	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Sickly understand
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:32,607	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Raccoons likes
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,375	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Dislike
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:39,263	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Stair dexterity what they can and cannot do it was a local raccoon specialist by the name of
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:43,871	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Suzanne McDonald's Dr Suzanne McDonald professor at York University
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:49,247	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Study animal behavior calling her a raccoon specialist really downplays her accomplishments she is
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:52,063	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	A professor of biology and psychology
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,343	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	You have studied
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:55,647	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Just about every animal you can think of
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:08:00,767	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	She may have studied every animal you can think of but in Toronto there's only one animal that matters
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,303	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	In Toronto everybody tour
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:07,935	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	I work in Vancouver lot and nobody talks about raccoons are there raccoons all the time
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:12,287	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	So she wasn't that surprised when we are Pacific got in touch as they were designing there been
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:12,799	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,615	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Asked me to talk to them about
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:17,151	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Are raccoons work and I did
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,991	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Will raccoons are omnivores
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,015	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	So that means I can eat
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:23,551	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Everything
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,855	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Really good teeth theyll use them
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,647	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	They don't want to use them
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:29,951	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	They want you to go away
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:32,255	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	You go away girl my yard
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:34,047	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	They also get a taste for human food
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:39,935	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	So once they get a taste for that Indian take out that we've thrown out that they've enjoyed our men on
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:43,519	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Like berries I'm not eating berries we look at them they look at us
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:46,079	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	If you would look at a monkey in the face that look away
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,615	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But reckons don't they look right out of
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:49,407	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	They look right through
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:53,247	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	You know they have pretty good senses of smell they have pretty good vision
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,039	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But touches their superpower
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,319	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	I'm very persistent
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:59,903	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	It will work in a problem for hours and hours and hours and they're pretty strong
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:04,255	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Rehrig Pacific took all of this information and applied it
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,023	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Is there been design
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:09,119	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	There was multiple generations of the design
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:12,191	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	If multiple photorealistic rendering
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:15,007	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	In the end they came out with a Ben they believed in
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:18,079	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	It's an olive green 26 gallon container
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,383	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	That closes and locks
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:21,919	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	We felt
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:25,503	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Very very confident with the success of that locking
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:28,063	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Mechanism and the container itself
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,111	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:32,415	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The new green bin rollout
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:35,487	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Took about 18 months from start to finish
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:38,303	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	People are waiting for their new green bins and people are getting
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:42,911	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Really excited about these things before they were rolled out on my street
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:46,239	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	They were rolled out on some of the streets nearby so
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:49,567	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	People on my street would have to walk by and see
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:52,127	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	At homes near us
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,919	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Had the new green bin and we didn't
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,199	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And you
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:58,527	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	It's sort of be thinking on your walk to the subway to go to work like
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,063	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The hell where
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,855	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Where's my Ben
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:05,695	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But eventually Amy did get a bin of her own
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:06,719	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	So on the list
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:08,255	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	There is
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,023	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	A dial
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,327	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Like a handle
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,607	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	That you turn
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,631	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:15,167	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	When it's in the
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:17,727	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Horizontal position is open
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,263	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	When it's in the vertical position
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,055	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	It's secure
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,567	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	It's locked
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:24,639	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	You actually have to turn it in a way
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,175	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	That really would make it
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:30,783	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Difficult if not impossible to turn if you don't have opposable thumbs
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:33,087	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And contrary to popular belief
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:35,391	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Raccoons don't have opposable thumbs
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:39,231	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Even though they can move the thumb like did it on there creepy little hands
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:39,743	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Little bit
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:44,351	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	For a while everything seems to be going according to plan
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,143	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	It's like some people worried
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:48,703	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The new bands with working too well
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:52,287	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	In other words people were afraid that without the green bins as a food source
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:54,847	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Maybe the raccoons were starving
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:58,431	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	So the way I became involved in all of this was
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:00,479	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	That in January of 2018
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:04,575	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	A friend sent me a note saying that he believed the new green bins
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:08,159	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Had eliminated the raccoon population in Toronto
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:10,719	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	He actually use the word eliminated
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,279	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Is any Intrepid reporter would do
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,327	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Amy decided to look into it
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,375	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	I wrote a quick email to
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:20,191	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Suzanne McDonald our local raccoon expert
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:21,983	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And I said
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,519	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Hey
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:25,567	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Could racoons be dying
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,847	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	She decides
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,407	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	They're probably hiding from the cold
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,199	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But she says
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:36,063	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	She would have more information a few months she said after I measure more dead raccoons
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:39,135	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	So a five-course wrote back immediately and said
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:39,903	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Can I come
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:46,815	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Animal Control was collecting raccoons killed by cars and storing them in freezers for Suzanne then come
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:50,143	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Man and measure them in order to track the health of the population
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:52,191	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	From year to year and I do this
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,215	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	4 times a year
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:59,615	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	When you go in July it turns out and you bring up Frozen raccoon carcasses and it takes a while to measure them
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,407	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	They start to melt
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,991	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Oh dear God you can imagine the maggots and the
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:07,807	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	All the things
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,855	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	That's fine I mean Society
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:10,879	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Sweet Polly push through
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:14,207	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Suzanne wouldn't have results of her data for a while
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:17,279	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But while Amy was there watching her measured dead raccoons
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:18,303	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Chester
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:21,887	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Do you think it's possible they could learn how to get into the new green bin
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:23,935	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:26,239	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	She shook her head no she said
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:32,383	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	You know she'd filmed them trying and not one of them could do it she just said they won't they won't
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:35,455	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Directions won't break into the
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,735	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Into these green Vans
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:42,367	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	On the Raccoon proof
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:44,159	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Green vandalism video
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,183	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	That was
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:47,231	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Then about a week later
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:50,303	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	This story comes out
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,071	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The look see your laughs
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:53,631	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	So watch a zoom into it here
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,679	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Basically
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:57,727	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Local Toronto resident who
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:13:00,799	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Has film the video of a raccoon
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:01,567	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Opening
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:03,359	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	His grain bin
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:06,431	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Ask if that little tuck are we going
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:09,247	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And just like kind of winking at the camera almost
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,527	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Really
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:14,623	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	This was not the only report of a band being broken into
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:17,695	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Although it was the first to include video which quickly went viral
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:19,487	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Much to the dismay
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:20,255	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Dennis monast
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,791	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	From rehrig Pacific
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:25,887	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	For somebody just to come out and say all the container doesn't work
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,191	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	You know it's frustrating
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:31,519	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The videos going to says don't tell the whole story
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,543	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	A couple of break-ins
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:34,591	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Doesn't mean the design is flawed
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:36,383	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The screw might be loosened too much
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:39,199	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And if you just simply tighten it
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:39,967	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	A little bit
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:40,735	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	It might
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,527	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Prevent the issue
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:45,343	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Dennis is frustrated by the fact that
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:48,415	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Sometimes when people have issues with their green beans
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:53,023	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	They don't call the city they don't report their issues to 311
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,303	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Instead they sometimes
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:55,583	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Call
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,863	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Local newspaper
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,911	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And then it becomes a story
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,959	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	I think you said something to me like
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:04,543	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	You know when your car breaks down you don't call the Toronto Star
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,079	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	You call the mechanic
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:11,199	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	I don't know if for some reason you know Toronto specifically that they loved it glamorize raccoon
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:15,807	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The city for its part playing the handful of break-ins on user error
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:19,391	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And the city's response was to suggest that these homeowners
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:26,303	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Locking their bins properly and to emphasize they had only had a handful of complaints at a 400
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,327	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	50000
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:27,839	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Green Vans
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:32,447	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The suggestion being that if Joe in Yorkville had a problem with his Ben
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:35,007	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And maybe the problem was Joe
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,031	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And not the Ben
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,871	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:46,015	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Soon after I woke up one morning and walked outside
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,063	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And saw that
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:52,927	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	My neighbor's green bin was on the ground and Arlene way
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,975	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And there was
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:55,743	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Food
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:56,767	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Everywhere
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,815	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	So I texted my neighbor and said
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:01,375	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Directions of garden into your green bin
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:05,215	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	She said you know what the hell kind of raccoons
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:05,983	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Get into the
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:08,287	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The green Vans now
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:11,871	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	This point Amy had been convinced by the city's argument
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:18,015	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	There was no problem with the Benz the problem was the users
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:20,063	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But you didn't lock it properly
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:24,415	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	I still have the text message and when I read it I cringe a little bit
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,743	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Thank you locked it properly
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:28,255	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Caroline
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:32,351	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But Amy didn't get to space mode for long
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,887	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Two nights later
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:35,935	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Her own been with Wonder
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,727	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	My
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:39,007	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Husband and I get it
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:41,055	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Group text message from Caroline
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:45,151	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Directions of gotten into your green bin
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:48,735	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	At this point on Floors because
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:52,319	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	My husband is a person who locks
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,855	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Thanks and checks locks
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:54,623	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	67 *
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,415	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	It seemed the reporter
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,951	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	I just become a character
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:58,719	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Your Own Story
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:00,767	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	I'm thinking like first of all
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:06,143	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Do they like this is so weird that they know that I was looking into the stuff
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,191	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Am I being targeted
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:13,055	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Amy Cole the city who said ma'am please you probably just have a broken handle
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:14,591	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And they said some workers out to fix
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:17,663	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And they replace the lid on my band as if
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:18,175	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Caution
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:19,967	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Even though they
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:21,247	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Couldn't find anything
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:21,759	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Wrong with it
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:23,807	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	She also wrote to the raccoon
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:25,599	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Expert Suzanne McDonald who was
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:26,879	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Because
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:29,439	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	She's always secretly been on Team raccoon
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:32,255	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	She wrote back almost immediately and said that
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:32,767	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Is
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,303	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Awesome
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,327	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And she said
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:37,375	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	I'm going to I'm going to loan you a trail camera
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,167	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And you have to see how they're doing it
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:43,263	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	So I get the I get the camera from Suzanne
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:44,799	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	We meet up at the zoo one day
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:50,175	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	I go to our local grocery store and I got a couple of chickens
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:52,223	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Put the chicken in the green bin
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:55,295	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Some of the chicken grease all over the grain bin
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:57,855	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The first night raccoons did not come
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,647	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The second night I went out
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:02,207	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	To the front porch actually with my toddler
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:03,999	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	We peeked around the corner
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:05,791	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And my my daughter said
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,631	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Then was down
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,655	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Is a mess
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,703	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	I took the camera upstairs
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:13,983	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And press play
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,519	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	On the video that I captured
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:22,175	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	It's almost as though the raccoons knew what I was doing and they were like let's give her a really good
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:23,711	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Shah here
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:25,759	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	This one is going to go viral
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,295	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Cameras pointing at
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,319	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The bends
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,599	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And then all of a sudden this
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,647	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	This mama raccoon
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,183	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Come skulking out
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,463	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:37,023	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	She just pulled the bend down like
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:43,679	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	She gets out of the way like at this point you can tell she knows what she's doing when she's not going to stand in the way and get crushed by the Ben
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:49,311	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	No she's going to pull it at the exact right angle and it just falls down with like
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:53,663	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And turns around and looks at the camera
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:55,455	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	As if to say
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:56,991	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Watch this
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:03,903	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And then she turns the handle into soap it likes it turns it opens it just like I would
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,439	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And then they go
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:09,023	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The key seem to be knocking down the bin
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:11,327	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Which made the handle much easier to turn
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:14,399	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	When it's on the ground you can just kind of
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:15,423	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Holonis
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:17,727	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Like as if you're pulling a lever
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:22,079	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	You know you can almost bet your paws added or like pull it to the side
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:23,871	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	On August 30th
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:27,967	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	2018 Amy published an article in the Toronto Star with her video
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:30,271	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And as these things tend to do in Toronto
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,551	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	It went viral
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:34,111	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Thousands of torontonians watched
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:36,927	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	As the protagonist handily pulled down the Ben
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:39,999	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Flashing her glowing eyes at the camera
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:42,303	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Showed off how easily
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:43,071	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	She could open it
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:46,399	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Amy got a bunch of emails and comments on the article
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:48,447	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	People saying that this was happening to them too
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:50,239	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The city maintained
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,543	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	They were getting relatively few complaints overall
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:56,639	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	What Amy told them as monitor
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:57,919	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Cathay pacific
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:00,991	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But the raccoons were getting into the bin that his company designed
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:03,551	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	He decided to pay her house call
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:07,135	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	You know I personally wanted to go out there myself to
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:11,743	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Inspect the container and to do some pork for testing on the handle itself
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:13,791	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Some Heroes don't wear capes
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,583	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Paper polo shirts
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:17,631	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Company logo on the breast pocket
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:20,191	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The date Dennis came over
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,727	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	My neighbor Mike came over
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:25,311	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	As soon as he saw this guy in my driveway working on the green bin
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:28,127	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But Mike had no idea that
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,151	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	This is
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:30,687	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The green van guy
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:36,831	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	It seemed like there was a gang of neighbors that came up all of a sudden out of nowhere and it was just like
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:43,231	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	All we have in a week we had we have some some problems with with the raccoons getting into our bins
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:45,535	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Getting in everybody's been and he's just
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:47,071	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Ripping on

EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,375	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And the waste of money
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:51,167	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Dennis took it all like a champ
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:57,055	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	He tightened up everyone's handles so they be particularly hard for little raccoon Paws to turn
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,359	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But it hasn't solved the problem
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:01,663	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Having accepted defeat
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:06,015	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Amy nail keeps her bins tied to a wall so raccoons can't knock them over
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,575	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And she can't help but Wonder
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,599	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	How soon
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:12,927	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	What this knowledge about how to open the Benz spreads

EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:18,559	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Teach each other these things but
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:22,655	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	It's called social learning and even most monkeys don't do that
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:24,191	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And so it's not like this
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:26,751	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Innovation is going to spread across the city
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:32,383	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Suzanne McDonald doesn't think most raccoons in Toronto currently have what it takes to get into the new green compost bins

EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:52,607	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Toronto's favorite front of me is as bad as ever
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:56,703	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	She thinks that's because even though most of them can't get into the compost
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:58,751	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	They moved on to a different solution

EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:31,520	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And Suzanne and Dennis both tell people that the green beans were never advertised as raccoon proof

EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:53,504	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	That eventually
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:56,320	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Resided in a particularly famous work of American architect
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:57,344	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The White House
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,368	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Oh yes
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:24:59,904	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	History's not exactly
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:03,744	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	There's this one in particular that really saying that
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,536	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Especially around Thanksgiving
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,072	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Her name is Rebecca
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,608	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	In the 1920s
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,400	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	She was sent to president count
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,424	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Coolidge
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:13,216	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	In Mississippi
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,776	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But this raccoon wasn't meant to be a pet
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:19,104	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	The idea was actually that should be served up as part of the holiday
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:22,688	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Which is not the most traditional Thanksgiving meal
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,736	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	You know I mean not
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,784	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Today at least but a century ago
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:27,808	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Wild animals
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:29,856	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Much more common to see
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:30,880	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Dinner plates
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:33,440	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Meals with Docker turtle or opossum work
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:36,000	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Typical minute some cases that were even Regional delicacy
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:40,352	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And then also you know sending animals as food to the White House for the holidays was a
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:40,864	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Pretty popular
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:43,168	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	To the president getting center right
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:44,448	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Wasn't Maybe...
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,216	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:46,240	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Him keeping him as a pet
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:47,776	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Was out of the garden
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:51,872	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Right I mean that's a little bit more unusual when we think about president
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:52,640	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And that
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:54,688	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Thanksgiving we usually think of that turkey
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:57,248	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	Keyparts lady would walk her around on a leash during the day
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:58,528	| 330_Raccoon_Resistance_pt01 |	And then at night
