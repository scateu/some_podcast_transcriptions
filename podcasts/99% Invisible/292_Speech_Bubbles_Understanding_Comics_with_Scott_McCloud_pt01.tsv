EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:26,559	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Obligatory
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:29,631	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Decisions that they all make
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:31,167	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And where the first decisions they make
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:32,959	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Is choosing their moment
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:34,751	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	No matter what

EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:40,639	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And it's a non-trivial problem as an engineer with

EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:47,807	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	If you think about it any kind of narrative that you want to tell
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:49,087	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Can be broken down
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,367	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	In an infinite number of ways
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:53,695	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	You know I could do a 10000 panel graph

EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:03,679	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	If you want I could just break it down by microseconds by nanosec
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:06,751	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Or I could do you a 2 panel sequence
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:08,543	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Of the entire history of the universe

EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,359	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	You're done
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:16,735	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	So that means that you you can slice up anyway you like and yet if I asked you
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,527	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Hey what did you do yesterday
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,599	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	There's a part of your mind that immediately
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,135	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Leverages this tremendous
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,159	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Neural horsepower
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:26,719	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	2 deciding what matters
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:31,583	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	You know we have these wonderful saliency filters that choose the moments quite natural
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,375	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And Mouse cartoons choose them
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:36,959	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Pretty naturally they know once I have a story to tell they know what moments matter
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:39,775	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	But they have to make that decision even if they're not making it
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:40,287	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Consciously
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,591	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And then from that point
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,615	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	You have to choose the
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,383	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	The angles
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:44,895	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	What's the framing
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:48,991	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	How close are you going to get to that thing you want to show how far away are you going to
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:49,759	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	What angular
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,807	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Is it going to be warm side view Eagles View
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:55,391	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Are you going to have to establish the Same by plant way back
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:57,439	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And then all those decisions about
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,207	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	How you draw the
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:02,047	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	How do you draw so it's recognizable how do you draw so it's a
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:04,351	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Expressive how do you draw it so that
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,631	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It's visually interest
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:08,703	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	How do you balance out Dynamics versus
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,471	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It's Clarity Olive
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:14,847	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And then of course the mixture of words and pictures and the way it flows and it's just
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,919	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It's an endless series of decisions but these are decisions
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,431	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	We all
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,223	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Make whether we do them cons
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:23,807	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Through every medium has its strengths and weaknesses
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:26,623	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And your mind we're the best kind of ideas that
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:29,951	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Comics are best at conveying and it may be what are some ideas for
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,487	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Hardest to convey in,
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:36,607	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	When it comes to visual explanations I found it, it's a really good at
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,119	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	The intro
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:42,751	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	When you getting time to a really granular level like for instance if you want to choose Comics to it
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,775	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Explain the latest
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:44,543	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Congressional
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,847	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Budget bill or something like that
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:49,407	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	That can be a problem because they're time-intensive
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:50,943	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	So long time to
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:53,247	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Put them together and something like that is better intact
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,295	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	But if you wanted to explain
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,087	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	In a particle physics
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,367	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Swore
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,159	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Some you know engineering
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:02,975	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Principal or something like that something that's going to stick around
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,023	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It's a Wonderful entry
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:06,303	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Almost any subject
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,839	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And I've done a bunch of things like that
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,863	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	That I recently did a
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,399	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	A comic explaining
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,935	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Kubernetes which is
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:14,751	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	This was for Google it's it's a way of
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:18,591	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Orchestrating containerized applications if that's something you're
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,615	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Planning to do tomorrow
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:22,687	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	There's a comic going to explain how to do that
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:26,271	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	So what I'm able to do is I'm able to lay out the map
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:28,063	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	I'm able to give you a sense that
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:31,135	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Yeah this is what the neighborhood looks like this is how everything is interrelated
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,927	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	This is the shape
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,207	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Of the subject
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:36,255	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Comics really good at that
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:40,095	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	But the flip side of what Comics are good at
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,631	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It's tricky because
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,935	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	I'm always reluctant
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,447	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	2
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:49,567	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	To say that the medium is inherently good at something because that immediately Beggars the
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:52,895	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Question as you've already asking what what's it maybe not so
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:57,247	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And the thing is whenever I think Comics are not capable of something
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:59,039	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Somebody always proves me
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,831	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Wrong listen example of that
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:06,463	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Would like hard math you know but some people have actually given it a running like where they use in comics to it
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,231	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Explain
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:10,047	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Mathematical Concepts something that I thought would probably
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,095	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Dino Dan on starter
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:13,887	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And it turns out.
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,703	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	You can give that a try
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:17,983	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,543	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And of course when I began
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,847	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It was all superheroes it was all suspect
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,151	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Sensationalism
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:28,991	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And there were many people who felt the comics were inherently good at that
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,807	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	But pretty soon into my
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,343	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Career even before I became a
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,367	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	MyCareer formerly
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,903	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	I discovered Japanese comics
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:38,207	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	They were doing comics about everything they were fishing,
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,743	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Thermage on comics
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:41,023	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	There were comics about Romance
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:42,303	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Answer comics about ninjas
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:44,095	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It didn't matter they could be about any
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:48,447	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	But if you grew up in America you might mistakenly think
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:51,007	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	The medium was somehow built somehow
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,823	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Inherently constructed in such a way

EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:02,015	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Somehow inevitable just like in in 1962 somebody could think that

EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:04,831	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Movies and

EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:14,303	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	There's nothing that said that movies had to go in that direction it's just that
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,583	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Just the cul-de-sac
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:16,863	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	The bay window
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:21,983	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	But I love to look at when it comes to this roof everyday objects at people very familiar with
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,775	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Is I like to look at that man and
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:28,895	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	To recognize that they represent choices and maybe their choices so long ago
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:30,175	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	That we
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,967	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Forget that they're even choices so
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:34,015	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	For example I was
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,039	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,063	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	The speech bubble
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:37,087	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	In the comic books
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:38,367	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And realizing
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:41,695	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	That is if you really think about it
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,463	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:45,791	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Other things like that that aren't these little revolutionary
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,839	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Visual representations of things
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:51,679	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	That you could ever walk us through maybe who did them
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:53,727	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	When did this change
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:57,311	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	When did it go from being in the Box to being in the bubble Lena lick words
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,335	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Anything about
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:11:59,871	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	The evolution of
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:00,895	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Comics that
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:03,199	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Represent these revolutionary little punctuated
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:08,831	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Equilibriums but are so built into the way we perceive the world that we don't even recognize him as choices
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:10,879	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	I'm going to pull up 180 here and say that
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,415	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Actually this is a good example
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,439	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	What's something that maybe isn't
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:15,231	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	To the medium is kind of an epic
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:20,607	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	When when you do something I'm one of those usually the first evidence is that it happened early
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:24,959	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And speech bubbles happen as early as certain European broadsheets
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,543	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And they are speech bubbles
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,591	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	There's no question about it
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:33,919	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	You know I could show you something from 1600 1500
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:38,271	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Where are there in the shape of Scrolls but they are dialogue coming out of people's mouth
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:43,391	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	So as soon as you start squaring off things into panelboards which they were also doing in those days
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:44,927	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Rectangular paddle board
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,975	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Yeah you start to have that
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,487	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Restart an speech
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:50,815	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	You can even save sort of equivalent things in things like
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,583	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Pre-columbian
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:52,095	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Germanic script
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:55,167	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Some of the stuff I think there's some dialogue in the bayou
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,447	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Tapestries
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:59,519	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	So yeah this was going to happen no matter what
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:00,031	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Because
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:02,591	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Dialog speech it's part of life
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,127	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And anything that
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:06,687	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Purports to represent life in any kind of art
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,455	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Citic narrative medium
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:11,039	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It's going to have to account for that and in some way shape or
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:11,551	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Perform
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:13,599	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	That's it I think it's it's what
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:16,927	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It is kind of what will eyes are called a desperation device
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,951	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Bison in a sentence
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,487	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Because we have a soundless medium
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,023	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	For most of our history
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,559	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	We were kind of stuck
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:25,119	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And it does feel a little bit like a hack
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,655	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	I think there's a little part of
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:29,471	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Every cartoon has heart sinks a little that
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:30,751	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	That we have to use the
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:35,103	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Shape with voiceover in in movies
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,127	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,151	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Yeah it feels
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:39,711	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Feel like a cheat like you should go to show it and not tell her
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:42,527	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It does it feels like a cheat and I think that's that's why
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,063	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	I think what Comics are
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:46,879	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Silent when you have the silent
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,183	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Sequence of some cartoons do nothing but I like
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,463	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Most of us will do them
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:53,279	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Occasionally it feels more like pure
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:55,327	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Comics you know there's that little purest
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,631	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Gene in each of us.
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:03,263	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Rebels a little when we can dispense with not good news for writers
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:06,591	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	I love this term silent comics
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:12,991	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It's so strange the Absurd it but I totally totally makes sense that it's
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,783	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It's strange that you have this
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,831	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Unitymedia
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:18,111	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Presentation
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:22,975	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	That still feel so multimedia that we think of it as having sound and time and
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:23,999	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Adept
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:27,327	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Exactly we it's very easy to forget the
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:28,095	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	The comics is
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:28,863	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	This is relegated
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:30,143	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It's just one of the five
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:32,959	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Traditionally Porsche that's beginning to change a little
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:36,543	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	With various mutations online and one
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,311	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Not that
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:42,943	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Yeah it's it's strange because it didn't really doesn't feel that way it does feel multimedia and that's of course that's partially because
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,223	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Many feel that it's this
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:45,759	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Agglomeration of
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:50,367	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Abortion pictures even though that tends to be true I don't think that is the essential
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,135	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Show character comic
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:53,439	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	I just think of that out that is one of
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,207	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Comics auction
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:56,255	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	But you can if you get some other comics
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:57,791	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Scholar in here
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:58,303	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	To argue with me
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:03,679	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Wetlands are certainly the most visible but
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:05,215	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	The other ones
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:08,799	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	I do find very interesting I talk in understanding comics about
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:11,615	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Things like Sweat Beads and how you can
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:14,687	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	See the evolution of written language even in the
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,711	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Pictorial symbols
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:17,503	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And the fact that a sweat bee
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,039	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Toriel symbol
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:23,647	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	They gradually drifted so that rather than a little sweat beat on cheek
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,951	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	You would see a sweat bee drawing beside a face
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:28,511	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	So that it began to emanate
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,023	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	From the face
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,839	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	To the extent that it became a symbol that simply
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:34,655	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Indicated the interstate and now you can find manga
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:37,215	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Where robots will have sweat bees
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:40,031	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	On the mend it's simply a signifier

EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:36,640	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	All around the

EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:40,992	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Which is
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:43,040	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It's got two different little flames
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:44,320	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It's got this
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:47,136	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Little tiny elevator and then it's got this very big
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:48,416	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Guy who's
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:49,696	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Going
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:51,744	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Right-to-left down the stairs towards
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:53,792	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Flame in about to trip over the elevator
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:59,680	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	All they did was they found the symbols and they filled the available space
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,960	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Buddha symbols
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:04,032	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It didn't even occur to them that the way the guy was facing
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:08,640	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Or the relative size of the guy in the Flames the guys much bigger than the Flames to Flame someone
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,200	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And why are there two of them
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,992	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	You don't like all of these things
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:14,784	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	They didn't consider it at all
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:18,112	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Because they weren't thinking that maybe
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,672	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Every visual decision has
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:21,952	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Every visual
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:24,000	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Collateral meaning
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:27,840	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Until I started remix in these things and turning the guy around and changing the size relay
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:29,120	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Changing
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:32,448	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	The proximity and making sure that
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:35,520	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Each individual element had its own space to breathe
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:40,128	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And I was able to come up with like three different alternatives
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:41,152	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	I think
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:41,664	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Work better
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:47,808	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	I'll probably go on a crusade to fire departments around the country
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:51,392	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	But now I see I see these things everywhere I mean like
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:52,672	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Maps for example
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,184	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	You know
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:55,488	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	90 degree rotation is hard
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,768	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Mental knife
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:57,536	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	2 degree rotation
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,048	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	It's very hard
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:00,096	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Actually upsets me when I see
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:02,400	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Before plants telling you how to get out of your burning building
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:07,008	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And they're rotated they're not in the same orientation is the way that you're standing
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:07,776	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Because they have one
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:11,616	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Map orientation for the whole building right on the map they print right
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:14,688	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	But you know you are building is on fire
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:17,248	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	You're going to die any minute now
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:21,088	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And you've got to stand there and kind of just sort of Imagine
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:26,464	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	If you were facing the other way any return this way and way which hallway is that in there this
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,280	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	I should be clear as day
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:30,560	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Here's the thing
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:31,584	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	I think that
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:35,168	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Good visual communication should speak
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:35,936	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Imbecile
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:38,496	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	What I mean by that is that
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,288	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	There are many
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:42,080	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Kinds of
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:43,360	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Visual communication
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,128	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	That
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,408	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	They're clear enough
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:47,200	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	You can figure it out
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:49,760	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	You can piece it together
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:53,600	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	But they still kind of Mumble as they walk away
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:57,184	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Like the bike path sign you know it's
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:24:00,512	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	All it is the bike path signs are everywhere right it's just a
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,536	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Picture of a bicycle
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:03,328	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And then the word bike
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,864	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Empath underneath
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:05,376	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	The bicycle
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:06,400	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,192	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Oftentimes
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:10,496	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Biking path are separated
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:12,288	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And there's more space
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:13,056	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Between bike
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:14,336	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And pass
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:18,432	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Then there is between the words biking path and the wheels of the Bison
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:22,016	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Nobody will be confused by this
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,552	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Everyone on Earth
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,600	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Knows that if they can read English
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:27,904	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Dino that says bike path they know what it means
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:30,464	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	But I say it's still up
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:32,000	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Socks on every
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:33,280	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Damn one of them
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:34,048	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Because
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:36,352	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Because what it does
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:38,912	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Is it violates the rules of proximity
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,936	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	So that it's like
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:43,264	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	The word spike in path are married there are a couple
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,056	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	And that there is
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:48,640	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	There is infidelity going on there because they're flirting with the wheels
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:53,248	| 292_Speech_Bubbles_Understanding_Comics_with_Scott_McCloud_pt01 |	Right and they're creating this visual grouping of wheel and
