EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:07,744	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	I'm going to tell a few stories
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:10,816	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	About the physical border on the southern edge of the United States
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:13,888	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And what happens when instead of people crossing the border
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,168	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The border crossing
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,216	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Go Richmond
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:18,240	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	We'll take it from here
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:24,640	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	In 2006 President Bush
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:30,016	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Signed a law to begin building in 18 ft high fence along a few key parts of the US Mexico border
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,832	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The project went by different names
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:35,136	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Operation gatekeeper in California
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:37,184	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Operation Safeguard in Arizona
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:40,000	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Play Texas they called it operation Hold the Line
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:44,352	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Today that fence looks like a somewhat random dotted line
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:46,144	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The entire border
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:52,032	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And the Border fence is always been controversial but it's based on a very human impulse
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:56,128	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	To have an actual physical barrier that marks the imaginary one on the map
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,176	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	It's a simple idea
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:01,248	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And like most things that turned out to not be so simple
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,296	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Hello
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:05,344	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Hello this is Pamela Taylor
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:07,904	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	So can you tell me where you are right now
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,696	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	I'm in my living room
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:11,232	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	I'm looking out the window
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:14,304	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	I shaved my front yard
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,328	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And Beyond.
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:16,608	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Is the fence
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:19,680	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	It is huge iron
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:22,240	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	About 20 feet tall
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:25,056	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The paint was put in there by Homeland Security
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:27,872	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Pamela Taylor is 86 years old
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:30,432	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	You may have noticed she has a slight British accent
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,456	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	But she's an American citizen
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:37,600	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	After World War II she marries an American they moved to a small Brick House outside of Brownsville Texas
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:39,904	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	That's the house she's in right now
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:41,696	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Which has been there for more than sixty years
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,768	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	At that house is technically in the US
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:46,304	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	But for the past 6 years
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,584	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	It's been on the wrong side
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:48,864	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Defense
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,400	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	We are on the Mexican side
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,704	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The fences in front of my home
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,520	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	So let me just go over this
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:04:00,128	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Many people think about the Border fence they just assume it's on the border
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:03,968	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The Rio Grande river is illegal border
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:05,248	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Between the US and Mexico
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:09,600	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	But the Border fence doesn't follow all the natural Contours about River
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:13,696	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	If they follow the river it would be a winding fence
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:17,024	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Whereas now because a straight fence
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:22,143	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And therefore they did not need to install that much fence
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:24,959	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And in the beginning
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:30,079	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	We were told this fence was going to go right through my living room
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,895	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Luckily the ended up building it
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,663	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	About a mile North
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:38,527	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Today Taylor has about a half-dozen neighbors need exact same situation as her
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,831	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Down the road there's also a farm
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,111	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Ana Golf Course
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:44,415	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	All on the Mexican side of the fence
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,463	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	We've gotten used to it now
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,999	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	We just can't go on and
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,791	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	A measurable about it
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,351	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	So how would you describe
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,119	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Where you are living
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,447	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Well actually it's a no man's land
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:02,847	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And I firmly believe that I shouldn't be paying taxes
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:09,759	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	A no-man's-land between two countries that's what our next story is about
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:19,231	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The United States is not as big today as it was at this time yesterday
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:24,095	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	President Johnson and president Diaz ordaz of Mexico mad at the border today
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,631	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Ended an old dispute
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:30,239	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The Rio Grande River has been the border between the US and Mexico ever since text
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:30,751	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Is became a state
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:33,055	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The problem is Rivers can move
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,615	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	That's exactly what happened in 18th
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:36,127	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	64
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:39,967	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Torrential rains caused the river to jump its banks and go south
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:43,295	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	All of a sudden the Border was in a different place
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:46,879	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	What that meant is the Texas have gained a square mile of land
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,927	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Was called the Chinese all
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:50,463	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Names of the scrubby desert plant
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:50,975	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The crew there
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:55,327	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The Chinese I was a thorn in the side of us Mexico relations for a century
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:57,631	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And then finally 50 years ago
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,679	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The US gave the land back to Mexico
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:03,519	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	About that time thousands of people and moved to the Chinese at all
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,287	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	I made it their home
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,591	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And that is where the story
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,103	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Begins
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:10,175	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	My name is smiley okay me at 3
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:15,039	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	I grew up in the chimney selleria during the 50s and 60s
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:17,343	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	I live one street away
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:18,879	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	From the river
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,951	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Which was the division between the two countries
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,999	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The river was just
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:27,327	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	More like a highway that you have to cross to get to where you needed to be
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:33,983	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	There was a baseball team on the Mexican side and then it was a team on the El Paso side and they were just
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:36,799	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Signal each other through crystals on and they would cross
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,615	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	That was just
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:42,943	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Life with the river between us
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,015	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	This is an interview
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,575	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Is part of the Chinese style oral history project

EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:21,087	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	In this area
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:25,951	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	A lot of Mexican interior thought that the Chinese are switch
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,999	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Basically just a square mile of land
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:30,559	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	They thought it was us largest California

EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:37,215	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Every time there was an issue between two countries
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:39,775	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	A Mexican would have course bring up these Chinese on

EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:54,111	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	But in the United States every two Americans had even heard of it
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,695	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And then the 1960's that'll change
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,487	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	No really unexpected way

EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,791	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The Chinese all dispute
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,327	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	To use it as a kind of bargaining

EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:07,487	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Enough to get by
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:12,607	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And she told me that she was not going to give her house to those goddamn next

EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,039	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And put her furniture in storage
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:34,111	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	My name is Angie Nunez
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:36,927	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	It was a very big disappointment
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:39,231	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Because they did not pay for the house
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:40,511	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	They paid us for the land
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:43,071	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	My father had just built

EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:56,383	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Because the house was going to be that much thicker that
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,407	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Warmer that
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,175	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Nice whatever
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,967	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And we had to leave all that
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:03,295	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	One by one the family started moving out

EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:14,303	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Windows are all boarded up and then yellow ribbon was placed on them so that we couldn't even go into the bank
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:18,143	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	So it look like a crime scene that is yellow
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:18,911	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Tape all over
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,983	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Until the only family left was hours
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,263	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Hours

EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:51,263	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	1rp was a wall design made of concrete
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:54,335	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The other was for a design made of quote on quote
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,359	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Other materials
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:58,431	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	They were to be between 18 and 30 ft tall
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:02,783	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	From the submissions they received Customs and Border Protection selected 8
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:04,063	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And turn them into prototypes
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:08,159	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	That's October our own Avery Chapman went down to see what they look like
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:10,975	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Well I'm glad you're okay
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,863	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	I found myself in a crowd of reporters
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:19,423	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	From writers in the guardian and Univision and fox
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:21,983	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	We'd all been given hard hats
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,007	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	A neon yellow vest
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:26,079	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	We all piled into an air-conditioned van
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,615	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	But we were brought out to a construction site
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:32,991	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Cameramen unpacked and hoisted their video cameras like great mechanical carcasses
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:35,295	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Anchors applied fresh makeup and did warm ups
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:38,879	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And then we swarmed around Roy Via Real
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:41,695	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	All of us jostling to get our microphones in his face
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:43,999	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	First name is Roy Roy last name vital

EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:51,679	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	A real acting Chief Patrol agent for the u.s. border patrol in the San Diego sector
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,983	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	He was showing us these eight prototypes
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:54,751	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	New border wall
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,287	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Between the United States
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:20:02,175	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And Mexico seven of the eight have been completed and the 8th when should be completed by the end of the
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:05,247	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	These 8 Simple rectangles
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:07,039	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Border wall are massive
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:08,831	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Each is 30 ft tall
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:11,135	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	It's striking in person
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:14,207	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	If they were actually formed into one continuous wall
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:16,511	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	They block off the mountains in the distance
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:19,583	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	By now you've probably seen pictures of these prototype
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:21,631	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Bar made of concrete
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:23,423	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Four are made of other materials
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:24,703	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	What is bright blue
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:26,751	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	One has molding on the side to make the
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:28,287	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Concrete look like cobblestone
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:31,615	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Half of them around and tops to make it harder to grip
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:35,455	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	MMD determination of of the ultimate design is based on
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:36,991	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Testing evaluation
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,015	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	We have three specific
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:39,295	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Requirements
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:42,623	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Which are looking at the Subterranean ability to dig underneath it prototypes
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:43,903	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Penetrability
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,439	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The aspect
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,207	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Being able to breach
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:48,767	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Some way to grade the Prototype
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:49,791	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And scalability
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:54,143	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The setup of the eight different prototypes only look like a design competition
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,679	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	So I asked Via Real
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:57,983	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Will there be a winner here
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:58,495	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Olympia winner
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:05,407	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Ultimate the winner is the US government is going to be us in that this is going to enhance our portion
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,687	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Nicely played
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:10,015	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Conceptually what we may have is we could have a singer design that is going to be
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:14,111	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Utilize it then some signal on the border or we have a combination of the designs
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:16,159	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Pair together and then applied
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:17,184	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Different areas along the border
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:20,768	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	It's not exactly clear what will happen with the Prototype
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:24,608	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Customs and Border Protection never specified if they were intended
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:27,680	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	For the entire border or parts of the Border
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:29,472	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Or to fortify existing walls
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:36,384	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Because of course the part that Trump didn't mention in his campaign is that over one-third of the u.s. Mexico border
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:39,456	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Is already covered by a wall for a barrier from time
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:46,624	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	So now we are here in this Administration which ran on the platform to said I'm going to build a wall and everybody clapped
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:51,744	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	There's already 650 my wall in place
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:57,888	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	This is Ronald real professor of architecture at UC Berkeley and author of the book border wall as architecture
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:01,728	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	In his book he writes about the long history of the border wall
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:02,752	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	It has a long life
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,568	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	It's been around for some time
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:06,848	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	It's evolved from
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:11,712	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Stone Cairns these are Stones placed along the border to save where the Border was
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:17,088	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Because it's just a frontier originally real says no one knew where that borderline
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:18,112	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Actually was
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:19,392	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	An engineer's from
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,672	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Mexico and the United States
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:24,512	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Went to this kind of no-man's-land Frontier Zone
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,792	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	After 1848
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:27,840	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Just figure out where to place
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:31,936	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Is demarcation Stones piles of stones were put up in Lego monuments
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:35,776	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Fences were constructed mostly the fences work truck to keep cattle out
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:36,800	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Is there ranches on both sides
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,336	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Eventually
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:40,128	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Some of those fences
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:42,432	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Became more aggressive especially between the cities
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:43,456	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Particularly
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:44,736	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Between San Ysidro
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:46,272	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Tijuana
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:50,368	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	In 1990 the Army Corps of engineer came to that Tijuana border
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:53,952	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	They brought over 40000 carbon steel corrugated
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:57,280	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Each plank 12 ft long and 1/4 inch thick
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:23:00,352	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	These have been made for the Vietnam War
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:02,144	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Portable Landing mats for helicopters
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:05,728	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Annies helicopter landing mats were turned up on their sides
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:07,776	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Into the first official border wall
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:13,664	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	More and more Landing mats were added and today they're over 60 miles of this Landing mat wall
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:18,016	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And then in other parts of the Border other kinds of walls and fences work
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:19,040	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	I'm different
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:21,600	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	All varying based on the topography
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:27,744	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Pedestrian fences that allow for visibility on both sides vehicular fences that are meant for cars not the
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:33,376	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Cross in his book railless over a dozen types of border wall
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:36,704	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And this is here in the Algodones Dunes
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:39,008	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	California floating fence
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,288	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Snakes over
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,824	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Huge mountainous Dunes
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:44,128	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And has these mechanical buttress
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,920	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	But keep it from sinking into the sand
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:47,968	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Dutch designed to be lifted
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:48,992	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Placed back on the dunes
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:50,272	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Otherwise
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,552	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Just let it go it just sinks
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,576	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Amazing
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:57,184	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The border wall is already a building project with significant weight behind it
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:24:00,768	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Is unfettered bylaws that regular building projects
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:01,792	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Have to abide by
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:03,328	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And that's particularly because of Easter
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,352	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Secure fence Act
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:07,680	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Passing 2006 back when George W Bush was president
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,984	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The secure fence Act of 2006
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:10,752	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Was created
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,288	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	So that it could
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:13,824	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Usurp
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:16,384	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Any other law that existed
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:17,664	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	In the United States
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:19,712	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	So any environmental
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,480	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Protection laws
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:21,760	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	This is more important
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:24,064	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Any Native American heritage
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:26,880	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	This is more important any Wildlife Act
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:28,416	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Secure fence Act
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:30,208	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Is more important than any of them
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:31,488	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And so
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:33,536	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The wall can be constructed
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:34,304	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Inhibit
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:38,144	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Which brings us back to those new prototypes that are being considered
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:40,192	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And the Press junket I went to back in October
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:41,984	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The border is very dynamic
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,800	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Fluid Dynamic there is
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:45,568	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Climate
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,592	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Some form happening everyday
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:49,408	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The prototypes will help influence

EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,200	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The future.
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:53,504	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Future development of our border infrastructure system
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:56,064	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	When they request for proposals went out
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:57,344	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Architects for like
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,368	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	What do we do
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:01,696	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Number of architecture firms submitted some designs for border wall
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:05,792	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And other Architects admitted blank sheets of paper to waste his time
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,584	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Ultimately
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,888	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Customs and Border Protection didn't choose
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:10,656	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Any architects
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,960	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	At all these prototypes
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:15,264	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Like the vast vast majority of

EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,432	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Or mostly made
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,456	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Buy General country
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:26,272	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	These giant construction firms
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,040	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Are very practical
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:28,832	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	They safely arrived
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:30,880	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Huge structures on time
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,392	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And on budget
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:33,440	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Their goal is to
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:33,952	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Jacquee's the club
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:35,744	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Which in this case
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:36,768	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Is the US government
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:38,560	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	They prototypes were manufactured
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:39,072	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Her by 6
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,096	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Companies
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:42,656	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Do you mind walking us through these companies are
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:46,496	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	I'm going to defer that to mr. to sell cuz I don't know them
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:48,800	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Route to say I was the spokesperson for border
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:52,128	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And he wasn't quite familiar with the construction companies either
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:54,432	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The best he could do was read them off a list
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:57,248	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Glpa North Augusta
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,296	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Cadel

EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:07,744	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	To be fair at the time I didn't know these companies either
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:10,048	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	I had never heard of them before
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:12,864	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	But I've lately been in one of their structures somewhere
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:16,192	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	In one of their tunnels or airports are office building
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:19,776	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The companies that made these walls are

EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:35,392	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Now
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:36,672	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Because of the wall prototype
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,720	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	People know these companies
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:41,280	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And they're talking about their relationships today
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:49,984	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	We separate return from the border I went to an Oakland city council meeting where they were considering passing an ordinance to forbid

EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:58,944	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	How to take my colleagues and fans for supporting our resolution on the border wall to make sure that
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:27:01,248	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	None of our tax dollars are spent

EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:15,488	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And this goes beyond those companies already involved in the Prototype
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:18,816	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Because new Border Construction is happening
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:19,584	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Separately
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:20,864	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	8 prototypes
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:22,656	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	On the San diego-tijuana border
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:25,728	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	When I talk to Customs and Border Protection people
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:28,288	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	They're thinking is that you know
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:30,592	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	He's the president this is what he wants
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:31,360	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	So we're going to
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,640	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	We're going to follow his
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:33,152	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Orders
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:35,712	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	So they're going through the motions
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:37,248	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Buildings prototype
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:40,064	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	But when it comes down to it that's not going to work
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:41,344	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	That's Melissa Del Bosque
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:43,392	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	A reporter from the Texas Observer
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:49,536	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And according to an article she published last year there already plans in motion for the First new section of the border wall
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:52,352	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Which will run through a wildlife refuge in South Texas
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:55,424	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	It will be built by Michael Baker International
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:59,008	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Construction firm who was not involved in the prototypes at all
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:01,568	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	The proposed design will be a levee wall
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:04,128	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Which is not among the designs in the prototypes
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:06,688	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Pictures of the prototypes what should we make of that
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:09,504	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	I don't know I think they're going to
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:11,552	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Sit there like Stonehenge probably
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:13,088	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	You just view them as a symbol
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:13,600	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Yeah
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,136	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Yeah totally
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:17,952	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	I don't think they mean much other than
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:19,744	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Filling his campaign promise
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:25,888	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	So whether or not these particular prototypes on display will ever actually be built
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,936	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	There will be more walls
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:32,032	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	What will happen is what has been happening for decades
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,056	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And it's not
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:36,640	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Special to the Trump administration at all which is that
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:38,944	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Some walls are going to be constructed
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:42,016	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Because this has been happening to many presidencies
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:43,808	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Republican and Democrat
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:46,112	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Professor Ronald Rael again
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:47,904	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And so I imagine that's what's going to happen
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:49,184	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	There's going to be some walls built
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:53,536	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Rail has been studying the various border walls for years
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:56,096	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	He's come to believe they're ineffective and inhumane
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:59,936	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	So we first saw the pictures of Trump's prototypes
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:05,312	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	He thought of the famous saying show me the 20-foot wall in 21 foot ladder
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:09,920	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	And so real got to work on a simple Act of protest using his skills of an architect
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:12,736	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	Based on the images of the wall prototypes
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:15,040	| 294_Border_Wall_pt01_final |	He drew up some designs for ladders
