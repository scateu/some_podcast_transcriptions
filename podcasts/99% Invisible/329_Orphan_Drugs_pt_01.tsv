EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:08,608	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I'm Roman Mars
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:16,800	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Ivy Myers grew up in Brooklyn and married a guy she'd known since they were kids
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:19,872	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Their first son David was born in 1968
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:21,920	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	By the time David was to
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:24,480	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I be noticed something was different about him
EDL	00:01:24,992	00:01:26,784	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	David's face with twitch
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:29,088	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	He sometimes made involuntary noises
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:32,160	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	His arms flailed around out of control
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:33,696	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	So he can barely feed himself
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:36,768	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	He was very disturbed
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:41,120	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	By the other kids would make fun of him
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:44,960	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	David's teachers often got upset with him in class
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:47,008	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	So you can imagine the
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:49,824	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Torture that he went through
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:52,384	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	One Sunday morning David with eight
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:54,944	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Abby Watkin try to read the funnies
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:56,736	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	But he couldn't keep his head steady enough
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:00,064	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	That's producer Dan Weisman
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:02,880	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Host of a new podcast about the cost of healthcare
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:04,160	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Called an arm and a leg
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:08,000	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Watching David struggle with the comics Abby was ready to cry
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:10,048	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	She put off doing the dishes
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:13,120	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Sat down and picked up another section of the paper
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:13,632	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	End
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,168	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	2 total coincidence
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:18,496	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It was an article about a teenager who had symptoms
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:19,264	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Just like David's
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:21,056	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Facial tics
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:21,824	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Weird noises
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:23,104	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Flaming Lips
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:27,712	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I stood up and I yelled for my husband and I said you have to read this
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:29,248	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	This is what David has
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:32,832	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Abby and her husband brought the article to David's pediatrician
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:35,136	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And the doctor agreed
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:37,952	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	This story described exactly what David had
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,768	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	This condition will sound familiar to you but
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:42,816	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Time most people even doctors
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:43,584	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I've never heard of it
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:44,864	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It was called
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,144	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Tourette syndrome
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:49,216	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Speaking to doctors many doctors after that
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:53,056	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	They said they never heard of it because they simply
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,872	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	We're not talk very much about Reggie season
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:56,896	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The medical school
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,176	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Back then
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,456	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	When so few people heard of
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:02,016	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Direct was considered a super rare
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:08,416	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It just seemed bizarre to me that I got a diagnosis out of a Sunday newspaper
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,952	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	From there a b sound a special
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:14,048	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Eventually turned her on to a potential treatment for Tourette syndrome
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:15,328	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It was being tested out
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,096	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Clinical trials
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,120	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Well
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:19,424	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It wasn't being tested for Tourette's
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:22,496	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The drug company was mainly hoping to Market this drug
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,520	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Schizophrenia
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:27,104	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The particular drug had been made available in Europe
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:29,152	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	For a while and taxes
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:31,200	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	New it worked on Tourette's
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:35,552	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	So David got in on a trial for this drug with the hopes that it could be approved in the US
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,344	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It turned out
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,136	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It works really well for him
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,160	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:41,440	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The drug trial
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:43,744	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Didn't go as well for schizophrenia
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:49,376	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Which was supposed to be its more common use so the drug company decided the market wasn't big
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:52,192	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	They just drop the drug entirely
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:54,752	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It's so good company she'll suck no
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,032	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	They wouldn't do it
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,080	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	They wouldn't make the truck they wouldn't sell it
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:02,432	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And this is how Abby learn to term that would define the next few Decades of her life
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:03,968	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Orphan drugs
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,016	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Orphan
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:06,528	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Drugs
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,832	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	As Abby learned
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:12,928	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Drug companies weren't interested in developing treatments for rare conditions
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:15,744	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Because the big money was in drugs with tons of customers
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,280	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Antibiotics
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:19,583	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Drugs for stuff like diabetes high cholesterol
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:23,423	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	They just didn't think selling a drug for Tourette's would be a big moneymaker
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:27,519	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	So promising treatments like the one that have been working for David
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:29,055	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Became orphan drugs
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:32,127	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	With no Pharma company to raise them
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:35,711	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	To keep yourself from going nuts with frustration
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:38,271	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Abby Meyers joined at the Tourette Syndrome Association
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,063	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It's pretty small
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,623	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Immediately invited her to join the board
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,391	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:44,927	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Ask her what you wanted to be in charge of
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:51,839	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I sure did that want to become the fundraiser or the arranger of special dinners or anything
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,351	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Do you like that
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:56,703	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And I wasn't the doctor so I didn't want to do the research end of it
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,983	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	That left Lobby
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:58,751	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And advocacy
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,543	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Spreading awareness
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:02,847	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Abby started figuring out how to do that
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:04,383	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	She found a mentor
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,687	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Her name with Margery got
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:09,759	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Marjorie was the Widow of Woody Guthrie
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:13,855	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The iconic American folk singer who wrote the song This Land Is Your Land
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:16,159	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Woody had died in the 1960s
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:16,927	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Huntington
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:18,207	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Another rare disease
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,511	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	She was on a mission
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,791	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Pharrell life
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,327	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Which was
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,095	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	True
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:26,911	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Find the answers for Huntington's disease
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,935	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Marjorie was
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:28,447	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	React
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:31,263	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	By the time a d Myers started lobbying
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:34,079	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Everybody connected with rare diseases new Margery got
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,383	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Marjorie
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,967	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Marjorie would be talking with Scientists or Pharma exec
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:42,015	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And they be using technical jargon
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:45,343	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	She say please talk to me in plain English
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,111	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I'm just a house
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,159	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And they would
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:54,559	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And when experts couldn't hide behind technical jargon Marjorie Guthrie would pin them down put them on the record
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:56,095	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And use their words as ammunition
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,375	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Branson
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:01,215	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Experts to explain exactly how promising a proposed drug might be
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,263	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Why they would sell it
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:04,799	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And all of that
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:07,359	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Would be in there and you're in plain English
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:10,687	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	So when Abby started meeting with government officials
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:12,479	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	She introduced herself the same way
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,015	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Just a housewife
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:17,343	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	She figured it wouldn't be a bad thing to let them
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,623	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Underestimate her a little
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:20,159	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I found the people
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,463	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Boys22
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:26,815	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Think about a woman as somebody's just trying to raise her kids
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,351	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	She's just a housewife
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,423	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	By June 1980
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:33,727	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Abby and Marjorie and their allies
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:38,079	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Got a California Congressman to hold a hearing to call attention to the problem
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,103	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Orphan drugs
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:42,943	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	This was their big chance to finally have a national audience
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:45,503	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Different Pharma companies on the spot
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:48,319	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	To make them face the patients who were waiting for
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:51,135	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Maybe this hearing could really changed
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:52,927	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Well
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:55,743	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Nobody from the pharmaceutical industry showed up
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,023	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Also
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:59,071	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Hardly any elected representatives showed up
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:01,887	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Well no Republicans at all showed up
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:08,287	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Maybe one or two congressmen stuck their head in and sat down for 5 minutes and then left
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,335	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The gallery was pretty empty to
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:13,151	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It was like nobody was there except
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:16,479	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The very very last row in the room
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:18,783	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	A young man was sitting there
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:20,831	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And I had no idea who he was
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,367	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And the
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,927	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Turned out that he was a reporter
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:29,279	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	For the Los Angeles Times
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,047	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It was a local store
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:31,839	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	One of the people testify
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,631	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	A teenage boy with Tourette's
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:34,911	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Was from Los Angeles
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:37,471	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It resulted in a very short
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:40,031	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Buried in the middle of the paper
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,311	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Nobody was likely to see it
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,359	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Except somebody did
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:48,991	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	If you're old enough to have watched
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,527	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	TV in the 1970s
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:51,295	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The name
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:53,343	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Jack Klugman instantly
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,879	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Conjure a raspy voice
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,415	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Baijiu New Yorker
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:59,487	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The sitcom The Odd Couple it was huge
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:03,071	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Jack Klugman played a middle-aged slob whose roommates
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:03,583	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Houdini

EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,031	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Assorted cheeses
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:18,431	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	When that show ended Jack Klugman got his own brand new TV show
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,991	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Kind of detective series
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,039	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	He played a medical examiner
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,063	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Call Quincy
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:30,463	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The Quincy show which was nice entertainment about a doctor who looks at dead bodies
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,231	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Decided
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,767	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Who the murderer was
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:36,863	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It was like a precursor to CSI and it was kind of a big deal.
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:48,639	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	World of forensic medicine and after that little story the Los Angeles Times came out
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:51,455	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Abby got a call from some but you said
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:54,015	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	He was a producer on the Quincy show
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,831	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	She was skeptical
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:09:00,671	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Thought you said yes and I mrs. Santa Claus
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:03,487	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	But after a few minutes on the phone
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,511	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	She realize
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,535	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The guy was telling the truth
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,839	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	He was a producer for Quincy
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:09,887	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Any happen to have
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:11,167	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Fairly rare disease himself
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:12,447	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	In fact
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:13,983	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Who is dying
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:14,495	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Optum cancer
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,031	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And so he
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,847	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	So this whole say with orphan drugs
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:20,127	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Is
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:24,735	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Beautiful story and I'd really like to do an episode
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:28,575	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Of Quincy about it
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,623	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	His name was Maurice
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:31,647	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Klugman
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,695	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	He was Jack Klugman
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:38,303	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Brother I mean these things happened in the movies that what happens with real people
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,863	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And that's what happened
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:43,167	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The episode actually got made
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:48,799	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It happened and in the episode a teenager with Tourette's dies under suspicious circumstances
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:49,567	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Turns out
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,359	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It's not exactly a murder
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,663	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	But by the time Quincy figures that out
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:55,711	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	He meets another young man with Tourette's
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,479	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And get
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:56,991	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Obsessed
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:58,271	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Problem
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,295	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Orphan drug
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:00,319	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Is Quincy

EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:05,183	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	If you got a disease that happen to have a low incidence
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:07,487	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Don't count on the pharmaceutical companies
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:10,559	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	That's why they call them orphan drugs
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,327	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Merrick
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:14,399	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Chores for rare diseases that no one wants to adopt
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:19,007	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Listen to go before Congress that supposed to deal with all this drug bill it still being considered
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:21,311	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	They should have suddenly goes from a mystery
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,847	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	To a policy drop
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,919	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Quincy it goes all-in on the orphan drugs
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,223	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	He lobbied Pharma companies
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:32,319	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The FDA Congressman becomes a total policy nerd
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:35,647	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	At the big finish the kid with Tourette's after a
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,927	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Pep talk by Quincy
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:39,999	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Gives a blockbuster speech at a congressional hearing
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,279	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I'm thinking about
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,303	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The other victims
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,119	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I might just have tourettes
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,679	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	But anyone who is unlucky enough
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,983	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	To have a disease that never made it to the top 40
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:54,079	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	This Congressional hearing was obviously fiction
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:56,895	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	But it got a real-world response
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:00,735	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	When that show was broadcast
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,783	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Jack Klugman receive
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:05,343	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Thousands and thousands of letters
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,415	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And they didn't even open up they just
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:10,975	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	How do you spell exactly will like
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:12,511	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Santa Claus facts
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:15,583	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And they stuffed animal into them
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,887	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And they sent all of those
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,655	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Sex
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:19,935	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Tumi
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:26,335	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The letters were from people with rare diseases and people who just wanted to do something to help solve the orphan drug problem
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:29,407	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	This kind of publicity and support
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:31,967	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Abby and her friend got another Congressional hearing
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,759	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	On March 10th
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:34,527	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	1981
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:39,391	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Real-life elected officials heard testimony about a real-life proposal
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:43,999	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	To create Financial incentives for Pharma companies to take on Orphan drugs
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:49,375	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	On hand to give that proposal a boost of star power was Jack Klugman himself
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:55,519	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The actor food Washington and testified in this new Hearing in Congress this time it was packed
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:12:01,663	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	People just sat down on the floor in the aisles
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:05,759	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Because Jack Klugman was in the room
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:09,087	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I'm telling you Jack Klugman was a big deal in those days
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:12,415	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	An orphan drug bill passed the house but
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:14,207	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It got stalled in the Senate
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:17,791	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Where Abby heard a single Senator was secretly blocking a
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:20,351	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It was rumored to be Orrin Hatch
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:24,447	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	So Jack Klugman and his crew swing into action
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:27,007	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	They do another episode of Quincy
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:30,335	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	One single Senator is holding up an orphan drug bill
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:34,687	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	In the climactic scene Quincy confronts that senator in his DC office
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:39,551	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I choose to keep going against this
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,831	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And you should be ready for the reaction
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:42,623	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I won't be in a reaction
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:44,671	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I play this course too many times
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,719	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Or maybe the rules have been changed
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,535	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I'm just take a look out there
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,047	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Window shutters

EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:12,319	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Big demonstration heading straight toward the Senator's office
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:17,695	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Camera zooms past the two men that focuses on the action outside
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,231	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	There are
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:22,047	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Hundreds of people lock them in wheelchairs
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:24,351	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Colorful signs with slogans like
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,887	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Now is the time
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:27,679	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Vote for the orphan drug deal
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,191	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Can
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:32,287	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	In a direct pitch to be fictional Senator watching through the window
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,847	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	We need you Senator Reeves
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,919	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The sequence Wingers
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:44,831	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And lingers and lingers these extras
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:49,439	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Are all actual people with rare diseases that Abby Meyers and her colleagues recruited
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:49,951	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Except
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:54,047	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Not actually in Washington they shot it in Pasadena or the weather was better
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:56,351	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The fake March on Washington
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,119	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Totally work
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:59,167	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The fake Senator on the show
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:05,055	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I cannot support this bill but I won't stand on its way
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:08,895	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And so did the real life senator
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:13,247	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Orrin Hatch
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:18,367	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	There would not be an orphan Drug Act if it was not for that episode of Quincy
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,159	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The orphan Drug Act
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,183	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Pass the Senate
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:23,487	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	President Ronald Reagan signed into law
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:26,047	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The fake March on Washington
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:28,607	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Became in some people's minds
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,631	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	A real life event
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:35,007	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	People will say to me that March on Washington was wonderful
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:37,567	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	There wasn't the March on Washington
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:39,359	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	But you know it was on TV
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,943	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Abby Meyers went on to help start a new advocacy
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:46,015	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The National Organization for rare disorders
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:47,807	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	She ran it for more than 20 years
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:49,343	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	These days
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:51,391	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	When people ask her about her Legacy
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:52,671	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	This is what she tells
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,487	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Be careful what you
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:57,023	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Wish for
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,559	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It might come true
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:03,679	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The orphan Drug Act of 1983
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:05,727	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Created Financial incentives
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:08,031	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Pharma companies to develop drugs to treat
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,055	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Orphan conditions
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:11,359	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Urine Drug Act basically says
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:13,919	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Once the FDA agrees proposed treatment
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:17,503	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	A rare condition undercurrent definition that means that affect
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:19,807	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Fewer than 200 thousand people in the US
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,575	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Ben
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:22,623	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Developer qualifies for special goodies
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,671	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	That includes subsidy
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,463	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Actual taxpayer cash
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,487	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Clinical trials
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:28,255	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:29,791	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	A big prize at the end
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:32,607	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	First drug company to get FDA approval
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,887	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	For certain kind of treatment
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:34,911	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Market
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:35,679	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Exclusivity
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,215	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Basically
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:41,823	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	No one else can Market an equivalent drug in the US for 7 years
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:48,735	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Which means that during that seven-year period the company gets a chance to make money off this drug even if relatively few people
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:51,039	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Music by setting a higher than usual price
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:53,599	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	You know if you have a drug for
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,879	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	High blood pressure
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:59,999	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It's probably half of the United States needs blood pressure medicine
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:06,143	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	But with a rare disease you're not going to make money if you charge your normal price for those
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:09,471	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Amendra companies realize that if they had a monopoly
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:13,823	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It didn't have to charge anything that would be remotely considered a normal price
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:16,127	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	They can charge pretty much whatever they want it
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:19,199	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Especially if the insurance companies were paying for it
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:24,831	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It took Pharma companies a few years to catch on to how good a deal the orphan Drug Act be
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:27,135	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	But by the 1990s
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:29,439	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Things were definitely rolling
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:34,559	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	One rare disease drug came out in 1991 with a price tag of 150
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:35,583	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	$1,000 a year
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:36,863	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It was
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:37,375	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Huge money
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:44,287	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Biotechnology and Healthcare companies
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:46,335	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	This is Joshua Sean
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:48,383	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And he's one of the many entrepreneurs
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:50,431	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Who took advantage of the orphan drug policy
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:54,015	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	His path to the big Pharma money let through
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:54,527	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Las Vegas
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,063	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It was great
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:57,343	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Just how Wild West
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,111	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	This new world
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:02,719	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Could be in 2003 Joshua shine started a company called Lev Pharmaceuticals
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:05,023	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And this company had just one mission
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:06,815	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	A single thing it was going to do
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:08,607	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Lev Pharmaceuticals
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:13,215	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Was going to Market a drug for a rare disorder called hereditary angioedema
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:14,495	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Actually
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:15,775	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The drug already existed
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:18,079	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It has been used successfully in Europe for 30 years
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:21,407	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	But nobody had taken it through clinical trials in the US
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,991	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	I look like a good setup
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:28,319	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It seems like a very good opportunity from its Inception
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:32,159	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	We saw a serious unmet clinical need in the US
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:35,487	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	To bring this treatment from Europe to the point where it could be sold in the US
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:38,815	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Message Josh wish I would have to raise enough money for live Pharmaceutical
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,143	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Which
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:44,191	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Would be a lot easier to do
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:46,239	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	As a publicly traded company
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,031	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And that's how they found
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:49,823	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Fun City popcorn
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:55,967	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Brightest on a typical path
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:57,247	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Biotech companies
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:01,087	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Fun City popcorn sold popcorn and nacho cheese sauce
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:02,623	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	The concessionaires all around Las Vegas
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:04,159	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	100
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:05,439	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Malls

EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:12,095	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Of course lived in Pursuit FunCity for their nacho cheese sauce recipe
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:16,959	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It turned out fun cities owners were getting out of the popcorn & concession business
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:19,263	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And they were game to try something new
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:22,591	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	FunCity agreed to actually merge with metformin
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,895	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Bestowing on love
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:27,711	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Their status as a publicly traded company
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:28,991	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Which
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:31,551	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Made it easier for love to attract even more in bed
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:35,903	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	But for a few months until they can get the paperwork sorted out
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:37,183	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	They had to go by the name
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,975	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Funfetti popcorn
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:40,767	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	We felt we could
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,791	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Overcome
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:47,423	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Fun City popcorn than any other jokes that might bring up did people catch you about it
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,311	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	All the way to bank
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:55,359	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Over the next few years
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:58,687	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Lev Pharmaceuticals raise about 75 million dollars
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:00,991	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	To pay for the clinical trial that would win FDA approve
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:05,343	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Of course Joshua shine still had to get the trials done and do it
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:06,367	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Before anyone else
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,671	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	After all the orphan Drug Act
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:11,743	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Is set up to give a monopoly to whoever gets to the treatment
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:12,255	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	First
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:13,535	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Finishing second
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:15,327	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Commune losing whole investment
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:16,863	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	It was a real horse race
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:19,167	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	So you could finish the trials

EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:54,143	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Prices on number that is makes the drugs absolutely unaffordable
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:57,215	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	In other words it's like a ransom note

EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:22,048	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Far far outnumber the successes and without a system in place like you're the Drug Act
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:27,168	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Of course it doesn't have to be this way

EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:45,856	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	And

EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:32,416	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Yeah the cost of healthcare and the need for
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,440	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Health insurance
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:34,976	| 329_Orphan_Drugs_pt_01 |	Expensive that
