EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:12,192	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Summer time in New York
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:13,984	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Year is 1902
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:18,336	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And II and wilhelm's printing company in Brooklyn has a
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:20,384	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The problem that's producer Emmett Fitzgerald
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:25,248	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	They're trying to print the popular Humor Magazine judge
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:29,344	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And it's really hot and there's a lot of humidity and they're having trouble
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:30,880	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Getting the
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:35,488	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Thanks to set properly on the page this is writer Stephen Johnson
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:40,352	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Author of the book how we got to now he says the problem isn't so much the Heat
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:46,752	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	But the moisture in the air with warping the paper throwing the print out of alignment and so they hire a
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:49,056	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Young enterprising engineer
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:55,456	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	By the name of Willis carrier to solve this problem and basically pull the moisture out of the air
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:02:01,856	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Inside the printing plant and carrier developed the system that pumps air over cold metal
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,624	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Coil
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:09,024	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And it works it pulls moisture out of the air and the magazines are printed more efficiently and and that Banks
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:09,792	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Don't run
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,072	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:15,168	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It has a side effect of as it's pulling moisture out of the air and also makes the air
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:15,936	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	A cooler
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:16,960	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And so of course
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:21,056	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Everybody wants to have lunch in the room with his new machine
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:27,456	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It's like wow this is so nice
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:29,760	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Because it's so much more pleasant
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:31,808	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Carrier had invented air conditioner
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:37,440	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And began to think that maybe his new technology could do more than just keep paper dry
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:38,208	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Maybe it's
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:41,280	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Something could actually be harnessed in the service or just human comfort
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:45,120	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The first install system in textile Factory
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:46,400	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Tobacco plant
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:49,472	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Other industrial workplaces that require low humidity
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:53,824	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Is it really catches on in a very different
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:58,432	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	So before air conditioning the last place you would want to go
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:06,624	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	What's the crowd into a movie theater with a thousand other human beings on a day when I was 95
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,904	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Degrees out right that would just be
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,672	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Completely intolerable
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:11,744	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The movie theaters really struggle to sell tickets
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,024	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It's during the summer months
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:16,096	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	So carrier approaches a bunch of theater owners all around the
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,120	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Country with an idea
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:18,656	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	I'll install a new machine
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:20,704	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	That turns your place of business
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,728	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Into a crisp
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:22,496	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Cool Oasis
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:26,592	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It won't be cheap but you'll make up for the cost in summer tickets
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,640	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And that's exactly what happened
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:35,296	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Peter owners advertise their chilled air and people came out to air condition theaters in droves
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:38,880	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Yes you lucky people just sit back for a moment
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:39,392	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Relax
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:42,208	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	I noticed the delightfully clean
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,744	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Cool and refreshing
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:47,072	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Atmosphere is scientifically air-conditioned theater
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,632	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	This advertisement
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,936	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	From the 1940s shows a bunch of
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,728	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Theatregoers wearing fur parkas
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:54,752	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Isis
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:55,776	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Ripping
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:59,616	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Spinner
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:04,992	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Suddenly movies went from being the last place you'd want to be on a summer day to being actually one of the nicer
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:09,856	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And this whole tradition of having these big movies to come out in the summer
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,368	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Became pause
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,904	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Summer blockbuster
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:15,744	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	But air conditioning would do a lot more than just
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:16,512	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Create the summer
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:17,024	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Blockbuster
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,583	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It would dramatically change what people in the United
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:22,143	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It slipped in the design of our building
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,679	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And homes
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:30,079	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	But the air-conditioning Revolution didn't happen all I want before World War II
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:36,479	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Wealthy Elites had air conditioning systems installed in their Mansions but mechanically chill there was still seen as a
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:40,575	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Luxury something to be enjoyed at the theater in your own home
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:42,623	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Willis carrier wanted to change that
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,927	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	In a 1929 speech he said
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:50,047	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Air conditioning and cooling for summer may become a necessity rather than a luxury
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:56,959	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And we will look upon present times as marking the end of that dark age in which there was but relatively
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:58,751	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Little cooling for human comfort
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:02,079	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The big transformation for air conditioning
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:04,127	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	They really arrives after World War II
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:07,967	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Is like so many stories of Technology really a story about
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,015	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Miniaturization of
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:12,319	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Something was really big and shrinking it down
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:14,623	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Early AC systems were massive
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:18,207	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Way too big for an individual home but by the late 1940s
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:23,071	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Carrier and other companies were selling air conditioners that can fit in your window
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,607	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	But they were expensive
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,399	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And it wasn't clear at first
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,935	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	That people would buy them
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:29,471	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	I think advertising
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:30,751	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Play a huge role
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:33,055	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	In the increased use of
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,847	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Air conditioning in the residential sector
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:40,991	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And what's really interesting is that the advertising really played on the role of women
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,527	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And their social status
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,575	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	This is Gail brager
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:50,719	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	She is an architecture professor at the UC Berkeley College of environmental design and an expert on thermal cup
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:55,327	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	If you look at the advertising in the 1950s a lot of them showed
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:57,375	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Women dressed like
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,167	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Beaver Cleaver's mom
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,447	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	With the pearls
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:02,751	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And the gloved hands and
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,031	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Dressed well
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:07,615	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And it was really trying to associate on social status
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,407	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	With air conditioning
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:10,687	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	If you have air condition
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,479	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	You can live this life of leisure
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:16,831	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And you wouldn't have to sweat with the toil of housework
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:19,135	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Is that also played on the idea that
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,159	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	With air conditioning
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:21,439	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Homeowners could take him
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,463	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Control over nature

EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:27,327	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Cool enough to need heat the same night
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:30,911	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Here's an air conditioning commercial from the early 1960s that takes
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:34,751	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Place in Palm Springs the maximum test for air conditioning
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,799	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	What system works best
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:39,359	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Let's ask the owner of this desert show place

EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,263	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Went from 45 to

EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:13,567	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The 210,000 people

EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,663	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Houston almost doubled
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:24,063	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And Florida during the 1920s had only a million people living there
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:27,647	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	But fifty years later there were nearly 7 million people in Florida

EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:54,015	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And that Coalition is really crucial to Reagan's

EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:59,903	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	They were obviously a lot of different factors that led to Reagan

EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:01,951	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	I think that

EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:20,127	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Knows who did that developed lots of strategies
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:20,639	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	To beat the Heat
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:24,991	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Including forms of vernacular architecture that were carefully attuned to the climate

EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:33,183	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And it's often driven by local environmental conditions
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:36,255	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	If you look at traditional buildings in hot climate

EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:41,887	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	If you're in a hot dryer hot humid climate
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,167	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	In the desert Southwest
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:46,495	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Houses were traditionally built with Hefty material
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:49,567	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Like Adobe and stone that can absorb heat
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,871	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Is soaking up the heat during the day
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,663	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Keeping it from getting inside
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:56,479	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And then releasing it to the colder air
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,247	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	At night
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:00,319	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Homes in the southwest also tended to have flat roofs
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:05,439	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And small windows that can be closed up during the day and opened at night to let the cool area
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:10,815	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	However in the humid Southeast the vernacular architecture try to maximize shade
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,887	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It was screened in sleeping porches

EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,191	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It's between rooms
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:20,031	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And cupolas in the roof to draw cool air up through the house
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:25,151	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	You tend to have much larger Windows much larger operable windows to the

EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:27,199	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Passage to be opened up
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:30,527	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	You might have much larger shaded
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:33,599	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Porches and balconies so there's a lot of outdoor living
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:37,695	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And so you can you can look at the architecture and
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:39,231	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It says something
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:40,255	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	About the place
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,839	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	On demand cold-air freed architects

EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:50,239	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And as we got
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:53,567	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	More of a chemical systems and the power to

EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,199	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Architect started relinquishing

EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:02,271	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Conditioning to the engineer's
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,831	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Air conditioning systems were expensive
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:08,415	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Home builders made up for the costs by cutting down on
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,439	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Passive cooling features
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:14,559	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And little by little the local Architectural Traditions rooted in the climate
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:17,375	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Gave way too tightly sealed mass-produced

EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,935	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	So a house in
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,959	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The Southwest
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,727	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Might look
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:26,847	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The same as a house in New Orleans which might look the same as a house in Minnesota
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:32,479	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And whether you were in a hot humid hot dry or cold climate I think architecture
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:34,527	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Really lost a sense of place
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:38,623	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The rise of tract housing had to do with more than just Erica
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:42,975	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It was influenced by the development of the highway system in the suburbanization

EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:50,655	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	But AC enable the mass production of affordable homes that could exist in many different climate zones
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,703	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Air conditioning didn't just
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:57,055	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Change residential architecture it revolutionized the design of skyscrapers
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,591	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Schools in office building
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:02,687	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	For air conditioning the only source of cool air with the outdoors
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:04,735	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	So offices usually have high ceiling
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,527	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Lots of windows
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,295	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	People could open
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:10,367	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And so all offices had at least one
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:12,159	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Wall that was exposed to the
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:15,999	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	You might have Courtyards in the center of building
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,815	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	So that even the built those spaces that
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,607	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Weren't on the street
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:23,167	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Would have access to the air and light on
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:23,935	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Inside
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:30,335	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	If you look at the floor plans of many mid-rise buildings from the early 20th century they often have these
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,103	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Irregular shapes
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:33,663	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It look like letters when viewed from above
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:35,199	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	So we sometimes
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:36,735	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Just called them alphabet building
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:38,271	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Thanks cuz they be in the shape of
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:40,319	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	E&H and I and O
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:45,439	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	But with air conditioning buildings could fill up the entire lot with offices.
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:48,511	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Inside the core of the building nowhere near a window
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:51,583	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Air conditioning also changed facade design
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:54,911	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	4AC address the issue of

EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:59,775	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	By providing appropriate shadings or on a
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:03,871	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Facades were carefully designed to avoid too much sun coming into a space
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:10,271	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	This is Lisa Hashem an architect who spent her career studying light in architecture
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:14,879	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Discovered air conditioning all of a sudden we could have these continuous glass facades
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,159	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Because we would solve the problem
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,463	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	With power conditioning instead of
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:24,095	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Facade design or building design it was just Brute Force Power
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:27,423	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Will air conditioner weigh out of all of these
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:28,703	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Design it
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:35,615	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Now this wasn't all a Bad Thing many modern Architects were happy to see the problem of thermal Comfort to the edge
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:38,175	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It meant they could focus
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:39,199	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Aesthetics
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:41,503	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And so it was incredibly empowering
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:44,319	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Architects to be able to relinquish that
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:51,487	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	With a c they were free to design the Sleek hermetically-sealed last hours that became Hallmarks of modern
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:57,631	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It's safe to say that without air conditioning we would not have many of the Great modernist buildings of the 20th century
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,911	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Oh absolutely not
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:05,055	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	But as a consequence the modern built environment in the United States is now totally dependent on air conditioner
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:09,151	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	A lot of our buildings would be uninhabitable in the summer without AC
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:13,503	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And all that cool air requires a lot of power
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,807	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	We now use as much
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:18,367	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Electricity for air conditioning as
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,135	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	We used
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:21,951	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	For all purposes in 1955
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,487	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	This is Stan Cox
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:25,535	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Author of the book losing our cool
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:28,607	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	He says AC consumption has continued to rise
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,655	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Vim 1993
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,935	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The 2005
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:36,287	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The amount of electricity used for air conditioning doubled Nationwide
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:39,103	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	One of the big reasons was that houses
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,383	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	We're getting larger
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:43,711	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And virtually all of those newly constructed ones
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:47,295	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Were getting central air installed in them
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:51,647	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The larger the home the more space needs to be filled with cool air
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:55,487	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It's crazy to think about it to me that
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:56,767	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Hohhot
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:59,327	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Day here in Kansas
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,095	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	There are
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:02,911	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	3000 square foot houses
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:04,447	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Being kept at
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:06,239	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	70 degrees
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:10,847	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	All day long and all the occupants are off it at work and school and so it
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:13,663	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Not cooling a human being at all
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:17,503	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	In all that air conditioning might be keeping our buildings cool
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,551	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Let's make in the outside world
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:20,831	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Hotter
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,367	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The additional
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:25,695	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Greenhouse emissions from Air Conditioning in the United States
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,743	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Add up to about
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:32,095	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	500 million tons of CO2 equivalent
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,631	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Per year
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:36,447	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	He says that's more than the entire construction into
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:39,775	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Including the production of materials like concrete
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:40,799	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	So what's up
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:42,335	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Very
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,615	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Significant amount
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:46,431	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	In fact in 2010 when Stan cockroaches book
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:50,271	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	He says the US was using as much energy for air conditioning
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:53,599	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Has the entire continent of Africa was using
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,623	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	For all purposes
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:59,231	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And all of these structures that require massive amounts of energy to key
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:15:59,999	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Keep cool
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,023	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	We've been
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,303	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Boarding them to the rest
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:02,815	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The world

EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,143	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It's like Dubai
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:08,191	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	What American has been fantastic
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,983	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Cost of boarding Dental design in art
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,031	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Is making a brine Annex
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:12,799	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Sporting Good
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:15,615	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	However a lot of it architecture is non-responsive

EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:19,711	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	This is manit rastogi

EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:28,159	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	He says that a lot of the buildings in Indian cities
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:28,927	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Is today
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:32,511	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Look like they could be buildings in other City around the world
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:35,583	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Sealed up glass towers that require a lot of air can
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:41,727	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	But India also have a long history of vernacular architecture design.
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,239	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	People cool
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:45,311	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	M Rastogi started looking back at some of the
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:46,079	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	These old buildings
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:47,359	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And thought
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:49,407	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	We used to do this really well
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,455	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Not so long back
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:54,015	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Why are we building differently today
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:59,391	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Rastogi has devoted his career to designing functional modern building
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:01,439	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Borrow passive cooling techniques
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,975	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Traditional Indian architecture
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:05,279	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And require very little
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,047	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Play Fanny air conditioner
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:08,095	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Like it design
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,887	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The Pearl Academy of fashion
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,447	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	So the Pearl Academy of fashion
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:15,775	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Is on the outskirts of Jaipur which is essentially a desert climate
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:18,335	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Went rastogi started working on the Pearl Academy
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:20,127	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	He looked at Old Indian buildings
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,151	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	In hot dry climates
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,431	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Inspiration
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,455	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	He studied Old Fort
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:23,967	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Sun Palace
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:25,759	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The see how they stayed cool
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:28,831	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And he was particularly impressed by a feature called the battle
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:31,135	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Stepwell
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,951	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Bellies are traditional Indian stopwatch
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:35,487	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	What's found in many old Palace
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:42,143	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	They're basically pools of water dug deep into the ground beneath the building and surrounded on all sides by descendants
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:44,191	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Intricately carved
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,215	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	From Stone
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:50,847	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The cool temperatures from underground combined with the evaporative cooling of the water to lower the temperature
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:51,615	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Picture in the palace
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:56,991	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Rastogi decided to put a modern take on this ancient architectural feature in his building
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:59,039	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	So we created about your step brother
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:01,343	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Across the entire site
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,879	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	3 meters down into the ground
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:05,695	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And we recycle all the water
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:08,511	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Into that stepper condition allowed for
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:11,071	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Evaporative cooling to come up and cool the side down
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:14,911	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The top of the building is insulated using earthenware pot
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:17,471	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And the sides of the building reboot
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:20,799	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Locally manufactured jollies that keep the Sun out but let the light in
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:27,199	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The Jolly is a traditional Indian architectural feature it's basically a lot of screen filled with all these
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:28,223	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Any holes
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:31,039	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	What's that letting diffused sunlight without too much heat
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,063	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Let me put a whole life together
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:34,111	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And when the project finished
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:36,671	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	We were getting temperature to 29 degrees
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:40,255	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	When the outside temperature was 46 degrees without air conditioning
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:43,071	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	In Fahrenheit that's 84 degrees inside the build
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:46,399	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	When it was 115 degrees outside
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:47,935	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It's still hot
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:49,215	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	But doable
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:54,591	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Turn office building that doesn't actually sound all that doable to me that sounds way too hot
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:59,967	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Yeah I think so too but rastogi says that for someone used to living in Jaipur India
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,991	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Pretty Pleasant temperature
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:03,807	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	He says thermal Comfort is relative
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:07,135	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Standards for what constitutes thermal comfort
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:09,951	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Is where I think the whole problem
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,719	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Sort of sick
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:15,071	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Architects and Engineers around the world use thermal comfort
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:19,679	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Set by the American Society of heating refrigerating and air conditioning engineers
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,727	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Historically the standard
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:25,567	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Dictated a relatively narrow temperature window that all building should be kept
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:31,711	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The only way to be certain that a building can meet that standard all year long is with lots of air conditioning and heating
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:35,039	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	But if you've ever worked in an office you know that some people are always hot
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,599	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Well others
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,367	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Katie
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,391	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Are always cold
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:40,671	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	You will never
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:43,487	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Achieve a static environment
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:44,767	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Where hundred percent of
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,839	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	This is architect Lisa hatchimal

EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:10,208	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	More than half an hour after it all
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,768	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Okay so some officials in news outlets
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,304	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Are calling to the prison

EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:43,744	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The focus is too much
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:47,328	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	The person whose basic argument is that if it's that easy to screw up
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:48,096	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	There's a design problem
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,632	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Fax and I think it's safe to say that we

EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:01,408	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It was really easy to make this mistake and send out the alert
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:03,712	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	It's also too hard to retract it or issue

EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:07,040	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	And then there's this lack of detail on the method
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:09,600	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Like where to find shelter
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:12,416	| 291_Thermal_Delight_pt_01 |	Oregon telephone numbers or links to websites that might
