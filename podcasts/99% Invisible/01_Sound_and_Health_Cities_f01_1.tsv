EDL	00:00:22,784	00:00:23,552	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	I'm Roman Mars
EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:30,208	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Nearly everywhere we go
EDL	00:00:30,208	00:00:31,488	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	We're bombarded with
EDL	00:00:31,488	00:00:32,512	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Human-made sound
EDL	00:00:33,024	00:00:34,560	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	It's especially bad Insidious
EDL	00:00:35,328	00:00:36,864	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Cities in the past
EDL	00:00:36,864	00:00:38,656	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Think about where you have
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:39,168	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Horses
EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:43,008	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	And Buggies clapping you here
EDL	00:00:43,008	00:00:44,544	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Banging of wood against
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:45,568	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Stone
EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:47,616	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Very noisy experiences
EDL	00:00:48,128	00:00:49,408	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Best Joel Beckerman
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:52,992	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	He's a composer and founder of a Sonic branding and design company
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:54,016	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Called man-made music
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:57,344	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Then cars came along and we're sharing the road
EDL	00:00:57,856	00:00:58,880	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	With these horses
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:00,928	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	And so not only did you have
EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:06,560	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Horses at 1 rate of speed the cars at a different rate of speed so lots of honking
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:07,840	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Of the horns
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,632	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	It must have been
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:11,168	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Cacophonous mess
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:18,080	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	But things got even worse when cars came to dominate the road
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:20,640	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	You fast-forward to
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:21,920	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Really
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:24,480	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	What the soundscapes were let's say in the 50
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:28,064	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	So in the fifties it was all about muscle cars
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:33,184	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	It was all about the loudest car you could have the Mustangs
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:38,304	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Corvettes that were really really loud
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:44,448	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	We might not have muscle cars anymore but our cities are still noisy places
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:47,008	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	We're pretty good at tuning it out
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:49,824	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	But our Sonic environments have serious impacts
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:51,360	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Are mental and physical health
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:54,432	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	So is the blurring modern soundscape
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:55,456	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Movie killing us
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:58,784	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	This is part one of a two-part series
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:02,112	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	All about how sound can be designed create more well-being
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:03,136	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	And reduce harm
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:05,184	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	We really respond
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:09,280	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	To sound quicker than the other since it really becomes the Arbiter of all our sense
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:15,680	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	But many of the sounds we hear are created with very little thought for how they interact with each other
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:17,728	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	They could be a byproduct
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:20,032	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Like engine sounds of a computer
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:24,384	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Or they could be made intentionally like alarms or cell phone pings
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,920	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	At the doctor
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,688	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Sound
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:27,456	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Overhead planes
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:28,736	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Air conditioning unit
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:30,784	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Patios in stores
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,064	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Pumping up music
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:35,904	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Sirens and people talking loudly to be heard over the rest of the noise
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,184	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	You have truck
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:42,048	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Buses other kinds of Transit and then unit mechanical things like Construction
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:44,608	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Of course
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:45,632	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Americar
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:47,680	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The sound of cars
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:50,496	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Is kind of inescapable which is
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,032	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Depressing if you think about it
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:56,640	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Has Kate Wagner you might know her from her fantastic blog mcmansion hell
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:59,968	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Xi'an architecture and design critic and she cares a lot
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,736	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	About sound
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,016	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Cars
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,040	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Tend to drown out
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:06,368	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Other things like Birdsong human speech
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,648	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The rustling of leaves
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:10,464	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Conversation things that maybe
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:14,048	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Armored personnel are like Kelly Hold and it higher like aesthetic value
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:19,168	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Joel Beckerman says we need a new approach to sound
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:22,240	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	One where we decide what we hear in our everyday environment
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,288	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Really about
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,824	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	How do we
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:27,104	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Use Music and Sound
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:30,176	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	To make people's lives richer and simpler
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:34,016	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Joel wants sound to be something we're thinking about all the time
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:37,088	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	What cities have more noise laws than ever
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:41,696	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Over half of the world's population live in urban areas experiencing
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,976	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Way too much noise
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:46,816	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Sound is measured in decibels
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:49,120	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The louder the sound the higher the number
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,680	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Quiet library is around 40.
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:59,104	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	B-52 8790. Supposed to be really close to the highway
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:03,456	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The decibel scale isn't linear that means 80 decibels
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:05,760	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Isn't twice as loud as 40 it's actually
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,296	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	10000 times louder
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:10,880	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	If you have to pull over on the side of the highway
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:13,696	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	This may be a flat tire or something
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:15,488	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The sheer noise that
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,512	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	You hears
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:19,071	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Play starlink
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:21,631	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Of sound that is an 8 Lane Highway
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:27,263	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The average level of car noise in a busy City
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:31,103	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	It's about the same as having your TV on at top volume
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:31,871	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	All the time
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:35,199	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Some silly noises are designed to be loud
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:38,015	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Police sirens and ambulance sirens
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:39,295	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	120 decibels
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:45,439	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	We might try to escape all this by sticking in a pair of headphones and cranking up the volume
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:47,487	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	But depending on what you're listening to
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:50,047	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Headphones can be over 90s
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:53,887	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Prolonged exposure to anything over 80 decibels
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,911	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Will lead to hearing
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,215	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	So before we go any further
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:58,751	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	What we're talking about the idea of
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:04:59,519	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Sound and health
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:00,799	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Do yourself a favor
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:03,615	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Get into a little bit quieter area
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,919	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	And turn this episode down a couple of notches
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,711	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Your ears will thank you
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:14,623	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	When it comes to City sound volume is not the only thing
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:18,463	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Not just how loud the sound is its
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:20,255	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The character of the sound
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:23,583	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	It's whether or not you have control over the situation
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,863	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	That's Erica Walker
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:30,239	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	She's a researcher at the Boston University School of Public Health in a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grantee
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,775	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	For Erica
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:33,311	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Impact of sound
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,335	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Is all about contacts
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:39,711	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	I live in an apartment building and above me where these neighbors and they had two small kids
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:45,087	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	And the kids used to run across the floor 24 hours a day
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:49,951	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The sound wasn't more than 50 or 60 decibels that's the same volume as
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,487	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The background music in a coffee shop
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:54,559	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	But Erica could feel that sound
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:55,583	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Every moment
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,607	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Of every day
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:03,519	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	I think for different people as different things but for me it was the rumbling it's that low frequency sound
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:05,567	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	You can't hear it but you know it's there
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:09,151	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	And you don't know where it's coming from but you can feel it
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:15,039	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Living so close together we're going to make sounds that will cross over into other

EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,447	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	But when we don't have control
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:34,239	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	That's what health problems start

EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:33,119	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	This still constitutes a major public health problem because so many people are exposed

EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,463	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	So the way we currently

EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:47,839	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Measure sound

EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,631	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	We can get a better grasp

EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,263	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	In the meantime

EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:13,599	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	There are certain architectural and design choices that we can make to make our spaces a little bit quieter

EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:29,983	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Velvet curtains might be a solution to noise problems in her home
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:35,359	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	But addressing the noise from cars and Industry requires a fundamental change to the way we live

EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:42,015	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The things that are making the most noise especially sort of industrial noise
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,551	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Are the things that are
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,855	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Perhaps not exactly the healthiest
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:47,647	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	For the environment for example
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:53,791	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Takes a lot more noise to have a natural gas plant or drill or do what have you for any kind of
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:58,399	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Extractive purposes and it does to have a solar farm which is almost entirely silent
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:05,055	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The quietest City I've ever been in that was a major city was Helsinki in Finland
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:07,103	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	I was astonished because
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:11,711	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The Metro are the subway trains and the buses and what not their silence
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,991	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,271	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Train station
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,295	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Are very quiet
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:18,879	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	That's partly because the majority of their trains are electric
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:21,695	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	But it's also down to the design of their station
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:28,607	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	From a mixture of materials sound absorbing materials and also psychoacoustic tricks like pumping in noise
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:30,143	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	That has this weird reverse
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:35,007	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Effect of making things seem quieter which is a technique used in offices as well
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,543	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The fins are able to make
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:38,079	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Spaces quieter in
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:40,127	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	That idea that they should be quieter
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:43,199	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Seems to be more popular there
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:48,831	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Prepster quieter public spaces play a small part in making Finland reportedly
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:50,367	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The happiest country in the world
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:51,903	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	It's a country that is
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:55,231	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	So taken into account
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:56,511	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	The public good
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:58,047	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	From all aspects
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:01,375	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Things like Health Care Child Care Social Services
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:02,911	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Robust
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:08,031	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Welfare state and things like their outlook on sustainability
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:11,359	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	So cleaner quieter Vehicles make you happier
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:13,407	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	And when things are less noisy
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,943	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Is a great opportunity
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:17,247	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Please create a richer and more useful

EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:20,831	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Electric cars don't naturally make a sound
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:23,391	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	So if you've ever had one creep up on you
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,695	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	It's a really really scary experience
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,743	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Joel Beckerman says
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,791	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	This Silence of electric cars
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:31,071	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Can actually be a drawback
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:33,631	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Total silence is not a good thing
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:36,703	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Joel says that electric cars need to make noise
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:38,495	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Or else they won't be safe
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:43,103	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	It's not the people in the car it's for the pedestrians to know that the car is coming
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,151	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	But the opportunity
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:47,711	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Also to create a personality
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:50,271	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	For the vehicle for the electric vehicles
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,575	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	He actually worked with Nissan

EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,879	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	For their new electric car
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,671	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Here it is coming right at you
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:04,351	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	In this case what we were looking to do was
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,631	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Create
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:09,215	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	A car that had a personality which is really in association with clean energy
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:11,775	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	One of the things we know is it's going to be frictionless
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:14,591	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	When you hear a car
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,103	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Accelerate
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,639	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	If it accelerates
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,431	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	It's very quickly let's say
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:20,735	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	And there is a sense of
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,015	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Really smoothness
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:23,807	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Lack of friction
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:25,087	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	There is a
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:27,391	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Almost in natural ambience
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:28,159	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	To it
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:29,951	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	We actually used
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:34,559	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Natural sounds
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:40,959	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	It still sounds like a car and it absolutely had to because we don't have to destrian to hear it and say oh what's that
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:41,727	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Get hit by the car
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:45,567	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Joe wants a future city dominated by natural sound
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:48,639	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	It also sounds that we consciously chosen
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:51,967	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Some cities are already taking a more thoughtful approach
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,271	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	In the Tokyo subway station
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,063	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Each station
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:57,855	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	Has a little tune associated with it
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:01,951	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	And if you know anything about the Japanese subway system it is packed
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:04,255	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	So if you're in the middle of a car
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:07,327	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	And you miss an announcement because it's noisy

EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,143	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Cities_f01_1 |	You're going to miss your stop
