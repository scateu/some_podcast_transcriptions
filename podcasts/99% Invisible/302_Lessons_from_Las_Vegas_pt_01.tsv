EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:39,648	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And she won them over the whole
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:42,720	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Psycho she finally agreed with me but not
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:44,256	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Before a lot of arguments
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,536	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And

EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:22,399	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	But you wasn't from a fancy family
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:26,239	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And yes he was really into historical architecture

EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,847	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	That would spur a new chapter
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:07,871	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	In architecture
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,735	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	To this day architects
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:15,039	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And turn their nose up at Las Vegas
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:17,087	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Las Vegas is still a very
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:19,391	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Controversial topic among architects
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:21,695	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Typically dismiss the city
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:22,719	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	This is Stefan Al

EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:33,471	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Everytime I tell my colleagues I study Las Vegas and I get a few frowns
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:35,007	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	From architecture perspective
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:37,823	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It's a city that's known for neon
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:40,127	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	City known for candle decoration

EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,295	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Conventionally trained architects
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:48,063	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I would like
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,855	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	But people love Vegas
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:52,159	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Last year there was about
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:54,719	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	45 million people that visited Las Vegas
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:57,535	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And that was 10 million more than the City of Paris
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:07:00,863	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	To be clear here we're not talking about downtown Las Vegas
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,911	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	We're talking about the Las Vegas Strip
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,959	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	A long stretch of road flank
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:05,727	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Bike Casino
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:12,127	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Yeah so a lot of people don't know that this trip is actually not built in the city of Las Vegas is actually just outside
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,919	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Site outside of city limits
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:17,759	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And as a result developers are not as much restricted by
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:19,551	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	City zoning laws work
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,575	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	City Council
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,367	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And they have more
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:25,951	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Leeway so to say which is why the Vegas
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:28,511	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Strip is never one static thing
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:30,815	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It goes through radical changes
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:32,095	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Almost every decade
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:36,703	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Since the whole stretch of the strip is geared entirely to what will bring in the most Taurus
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:42,079	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Is design for what's popular at a given time so I'll make as much money as possible
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:43,103	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	As soon as
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:47,711	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	One of the buildings is no longer profitable or as soon as they realize they can
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:53,855	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Actually build a more profitable building that is worth for them to implode the previous building and build something new
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,903	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And this is how biggest is always be
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:08:00,255	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Constantly remaking itself depending on what tourist want
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:03,071	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It's designed and redesigned over and over again
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:04,607	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	For its visitors
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:10,751	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	The very first Casino Hotel complex on the Strip was called El Rancho Vegas
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,543	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I had a western theme
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:15,103	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Literally part of the advertising was
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:15,871	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Bring your wine
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,919	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Western boots in your usn outfit
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,223	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	How you can wear your hat
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:21,503	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	In the 1940s
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:23,295	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Western movies were popular
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:26,623	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And the western themed made gambling seem a little more
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,647	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Patriotic
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,671	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Rugged
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:30,975	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	What cowboys did
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:33,535	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Do you got to have gambling in a wild West Town
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:35,583	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	A real authentic
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:41,983	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Wild West Town forever any Cowboys in Las Vegas and so it was from the very
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:44,031	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Beginning Las Vegas architecture was
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,567	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Where you could call
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:48,127	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Fake and then in the 1950s as the
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:50,431	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Fake Western fat got tired out
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:54,015	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	They traded it in for fake mid-century Suburban glamour
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:57,343	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It really turn gambling into a Suburban vacation
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:59,903	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	There were all these glamorous bungalows
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:01,183	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Kidney-shaped pools
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:03,999	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	But they all look more or less the same
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:05,791	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	So then came the sign
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:10,911	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Starting with the Stardust Hotel and Casino
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:13,471	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Big horizontal sign really big
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:15,263	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Over 200 feet long
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:21,407	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It looks like a giant explosion and their mind this was also. In which we see the space race
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:28,319	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Start to begin up the ante on the competition between the hotels on the strip
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:34,719	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And more massive hotels popped up with bigger and bigger sign
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:40,095	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And it was a really kind of sophisticated technology that went into these structures
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,375	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It was only because
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:44,703	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	The competition was was so intense and it was so much at stake
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:48,799	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	By the 1960s the Las Vegas Strip with a cacophony
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:50,591	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I think eating Neon
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:54,431	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	All these huge jarring sign was calling out over each other
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,991	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	That's what the strip look like
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:59,295	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	When Denise Scott Brown first encounter.
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:02,111	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I've had a cold shiver up my spine
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:05,951	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And I said Is This Love or is this hate
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,743	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I said I don't know
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,815	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I said foot rabbit anyway before it goes
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:13,887	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	She first visited Vegas in 1980
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,655	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	C5
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:16,959	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	After she had left pain to take a job at Berkeley
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,263	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Unlike the modernist
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,567	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	To it ignore a messy place like Las Vegas
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,615	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Denise found herself
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,383	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Curious about it
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,455	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Given her background and urbanism in planning
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:29,503	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	She was interested in observing the
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:30,015	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Habits
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,831	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Las Vegas was
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:35,391	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	A place people voted for with their feet
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:37,439	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	They went there in droves
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:39,487	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	They really showed they liked
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,791	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	They even spent money to be in it
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:46,143	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	The 1960s trip was the exact opposite of what modern architects
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,679	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	The world should look like
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,215	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It was loud
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:50,495	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Garish and dazzling
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,543	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It was full-blown populism
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:55,359	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And this is what Denise loved about the strap
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:58,175	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	She knew she had to show Robert Ventura
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:02,015	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Bob was the only person I invited to Las Vegas cuz
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,295	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It was the only one interested
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,879	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And then he just adored it
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,183	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	In 1966
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:13,023	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi spent 4 days in Las Vegas
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,327	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Marveling at it
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,863	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	When Bob and I

EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:29,151	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	We took photographs we drove the strip we had music on Wii
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:32,479	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Jobs in the desert and we took pictures of each other

EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:39,775	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It functioned in the midst of its apparent chaos
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:44,639	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Like there would be an Arabian themed design for an Arabian themed Casino

EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:16,895	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	What happens next everyone reads that book
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:19,711	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	This is architecture and design critic Alexandra Lange
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:23,039	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And she says learning from Las Vegas challenged architects
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,855	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	To take the architecture of Vegas
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:28,671	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	What they called the architecture of the American Highway
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,183	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Serious
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:31,743	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And that it too has a structure
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:34,559	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And it too has lessons that we can learn from
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:37,375	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And so let's stop being snobby and only
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:43,519	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Kind of talking about architecture within architecture and look at what's actually out there in the world and what we can learn
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:48,639	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It's not just saying hey Vegas is cool it's saying here's a whole approach
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,431	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	To the world that we actually live in
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:54,527	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And truly everyone studying architecture read this book
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:17:00,415	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Why do they catch on because people were searching for a way out of the dead end
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,695	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	The dead end of modernism
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:06,303	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And this book written by kind of the coolest kids in architecture
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:08,863	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Seems like it might be that way out
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,655	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	By 1980
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:15,007	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Learning from Las Vegas becomes a text assigned in every architect
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,799	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Is that
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:20,895	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Is a huge deal because it means American architects

EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:24,991	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	That's all around
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,551	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Although Venturi got most of the
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:33,439	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	The credit I never get the famous all it's Robert Venturi and what's that wife doing hanging in there

EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:40,863	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Which she then invited Venturi along for
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:43,935	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Not to mention Denise's background in observation

EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:54,175	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Digital architecture needed to say something to the maximum number of people not just two people
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:55,967	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Who were educated
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:56,991	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	In the themes

EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:04,415	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Venturian Scott Brown loved the historical elements of architecture that anyone could recognize
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:06,975	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And so they say you know what
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:11,839	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	People love houses with Gables people like their Banks to have columns out front
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:12,607	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	So let
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,375	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Do that
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:16,191	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Columns can signify that a building is important
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:18,239	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Since they're associated with banks and government
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:21,823	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Wrangler roof means that the building is a house

EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,943	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Architects should just go ahead and add them

EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:35,135	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	One of the more extreme examples is their design for the Children's Museum of Houston
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:37,695	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	They put these oversized Greek

EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:42,559	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Because it's a children's museum
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,607	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	The Columns are Brite canary yellow
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:49,215	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	The Columns hold up on massive sign that says Museum in Big Red Letters

EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,055	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It's pretty clear
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:58,431	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And they did this for adult museums to freeze off of in Seattle Art Museum
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:02,015	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	A sign on the top of the building just says s a.m.
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,807	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Seattle Art Museum
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,599	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It is very big
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:09,183	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I mean not all their buildings a giant overt signs on them
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:12,767	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	But the point is Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown we're not

EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:30,943	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And this morphed into one of the most controversial movements in architect
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:32,479	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Postmodern

EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:41,183	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Although the problem is a lot of designers
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,719	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Focus on the Fun Park
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:46,047	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	So some postmodern architecture
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:46,815	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Takes
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:48,351	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Kind of the Jazz Inus
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,143	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Vegas
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:52,191	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Takes the colors take the Neon
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:54,751	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	That becomes one form of
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:55,519	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Post-modernism
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:58,335	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	A lot of Architects and designers were just like
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:01,919	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Oh cool now we can use neon and bright colors and big science
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:05,503	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Xiamen historical Styles and details
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:07,295	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Just for the fun of it
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:09,343	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	In other words it became part of the ascetic
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,367	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	The 80s
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:11,647	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Bright colors

EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:16,255	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	This is what a lot of people mean by NF

EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,839	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Just kind of goofy without substance
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:23,679	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It goes in all of these different directions and I think
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:25,727	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Denise Scott Brown really hate
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:29,311	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Some of those directions because they don't have their interpretive
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,591	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Quality.
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:32,383	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	They brought to their version of
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,151	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Modernism
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:35,711	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Andaz postmodernism became sillier and
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,223	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Sillier
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:43,135	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It strayed further and further away from what Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi were originally trying
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:43,903	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Need to do
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:48,511	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It became hard for clients to see how deeply intentional and thoughtful their work was
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:53,375	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It wasn't like one Triumph to another after they wrote that book by any means
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,655	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	We probably
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:56,959	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Had more work if we hadn't done all this
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:21:00,543	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Their books they're building Champion places like the Las Vegas Strip
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:04,895	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	They're definitely times when they didn't have that many clients it was very difficult for them
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:06,431	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	To get work
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:10,527	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Ultimately postmodernism's popularity was short-lived
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:16,928	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	What happened with post-modernism is it really did not last very long as an architectural movie
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,208	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It has basically it

EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:29,216	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Sort of revert back

EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:40,480	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Is a box
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:43,040	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	That could contain anything
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:45,088	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And it has a sign out front
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,624	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	That indicates what happens
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:52,256	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Inside so yeah pretty much a decoration that is pretty much what it sounds like
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:53,024	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It's a simple
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:56,096	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It's not a cereal box but it is a simple and generic building
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:57,888	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	With a sign or decoration on it
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:59,936	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Like the Stardust Hotel
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:01,216	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Which cities are staying at
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:04,032	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	That was a facade a mile long just
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:05,056	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Blazing
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:05,824	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Neon
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:08,128	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And we woke drawn the back
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:10,176	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I'm box at the back of this building is
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,968	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Flawless decoration
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:14,784	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Then Walter gropius ever dream job
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:16,320	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And we call that the shed
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:20,416	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	So decorated sheds are actually quite common if you think of like a big box store
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:22,720	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	If it goes out of business in another business
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:23,744	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	They just changed
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:25,280	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	The sign and it
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:26,304	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Completely functions
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:29,376	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I think that the interesting thing
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,144	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	About
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:32,960	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Learning from Las Vegas and Scott Brown inventories work
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:36,544	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Is that what they're basically saying is like decorative Shades or not
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:37,056	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	A bad thing
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:41,920	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	That is one of the main points learning from Las Vegas is trying to prove that signs are really efficient
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:47,552	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Way for building to communicate so we will getting this model of the shed for the place
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:48,576	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	But I was
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:49,856	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Walking down
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:52,416	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Architecture building
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:56,000	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	In New Haven and I looked up and I said you know
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:59,072	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It's called No decoration but the whole thing is a piece of
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:30:59,584	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Decoration
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,376	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Which brings us to
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:04,448	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	The duck duck
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:07,264	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	So that's the idea of the whole building being a decoration
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,032	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	You know what
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:09,312	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Call Duck I don't
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:13,920	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Does actually there's a famous building on the side of the road in Long Island
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:14,944	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Literally shaped
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:16,736	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Like a duck and it's old duck
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:18,016	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And it's sold duck eggs
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:22,880	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Of course it sounds awesome.
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,928	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And it doesn't really matter what
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:27,744	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	The shape is inside this route for old activity
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:32,096	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I guess I'll know that even if it's shaped like a duck a lot of buildings
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:34,656	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Shaped like the very thing they're selling that's
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,168	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Pretty rare
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,472	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	There's one outside of where I grew up
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:38,496	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Which is one of the reasons why I know
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:39,776	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It resonated with
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:40,544	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	What is it
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:41,568	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	In
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:45,920	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I lived for a stretch of my childhood in Newark Ohio
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:47,200	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And outside Newark Ohio
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:48,224	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Is the
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:51,040	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Starts with an L basket company
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:54,368	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I don't know what it's called
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,136	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	They sold
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:56,160	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Baskets and they had a building
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:57,696	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	A big picture
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:31:59,488	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I'd like one of those
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:00,512	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Rare like
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:02,048	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Pure forms of duck
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:04,608	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	That's so cool but that's the interesting thing is like
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:07,424	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Frank gehry building
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:08,960	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Things can technically be.
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:11,520	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Frank areas like mr.
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:13,824	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Because those are
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:15,616	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Statement buildings that are not
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:19,200	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Decorated for sale if I don't have ornaments on them
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:23,552	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	But they are built out as an entire piece of decoration in and of themselves
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:24,832	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Looks like with Gary has he
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:25,600	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Crazy
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:27,648	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Curved metal Exteriors
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:30,464	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	That forced the interior is to accommodate it
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:33,024	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	So it's it's kind of counterintuitive cuz you
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:35,840	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Would be inclined to think while modern buildings are sheds
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:37,120	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Because they're very minimalist
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:44,032	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	But yeah there's an argument to be made that a lot of modernist architecture was very preoccupied with making
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:47,616	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	What they called the heroic and original architects
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:49,152	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	People like Paul Rudolph
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,176	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And the brutalist
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:51,456	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Made a building
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:51,968	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It looks like
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:56,320	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Did all kinds of crazy things to try to express what it did
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:57,088	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Inside
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:33:00,672	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	But actually often made in a room that were unusable
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:02,976	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Balconies and nobody would ever hang out on
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:05,280	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	But that's not to say
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:06,816	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	That ducks are bad
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,608	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Sunbathing should be.
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:10,144	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	You know
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:15,520	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I was sunbathing should have ducked like parts of them but was inside is less important than the outside
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:19,872	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Airport buildings that need something on them to make them
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:21,152	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Show from the air
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:22,944	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Edward helps out
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:27,040	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Do that job special but they better have a big red checkerboard pattern feather
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:28,320	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	No plane will fly into
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:34,208	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It's for a while when we went to give a lecture and you should be someone dressed like a duck on the stage with
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:37,792	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Text pictures of nice sign of kind of something
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:40,352	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:42,144	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I guess you're pretty much right
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:44,960	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	What do you think anything
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:46,752	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	It widened my scope of what a duck
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:49,056	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I can see why
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:50,080	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Even if your
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:52,640	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Really smart like I was your delaying
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:54,944	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Is way smarter about architecture then than me or
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:56,736	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Anyone in the building
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:59,808	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	You would kind of have to look it up
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,088	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Like his Maybe
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:02,624	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	The Apple
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:03,648	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Campus
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:04,672	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	IDOC
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:06,720	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I mean I think there's a case to be made that
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,280	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Are there any others
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:11,328	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Edge cases that we could talk about
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:14,912	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I kind of think like other hotels on the Las Vegas Strip you know
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:15,680	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Like
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:17,728	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Some of them really walk that line I'm picking for
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:19,520	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Particularly of like New York New York
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:20,288	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Hotel which has this
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:22,080	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Play Books
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:23,872	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Like the skyline of Manhattan
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:26,944	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And I can't tell
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:28,992	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	If that is like
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:32,320	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	A front on a bunch of buildings you know it's hard to tell
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:37,440	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	What is the sign and what is the shape of the building when you get to the Vegas
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:41,536	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And that mean the best form of nipples of both
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:54,336	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	I looked it up afterwards and it is the Longaberger Basket building that's in Newark Ohio
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:55,872	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	And it doesn't even look
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:56,896	| 302_Lessons_from_Las_Vegas_pt_01 |	Look like a giant picnic basket
