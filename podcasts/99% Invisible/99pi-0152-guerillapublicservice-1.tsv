EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:23,712	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Maybe a door that open the wrong way or a poorly painted marker on the road

EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:58,272	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	NOK we're doing it
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:01,600	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	It was early Sunday morning
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,624	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	August 5th
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:04,672	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	2001 Los Angeles Califor
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:09,280	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Richard ankrom and a group of friends were on the 4th Street Bridge
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,048	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Over the 110
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:10,560	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Freeway
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:12,352	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	They were about to commit
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:15,936	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Give me a high-profile dangerous situation
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:20,288	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Natalie can I get arrested I could kill somebody really I was terrified of that
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,056	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	But let's back up
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,616	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	About 20 years prior
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:28,736	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Richard ankrom an artist living in Orange County was driving north on the 110 freeway
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,528	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Is he passed through downtown Los Angeles
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:34,112	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	He was going to merge onto another freeway to I-5 North
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:36,416	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	But he missed the exit got lost
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:38,208	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	And for some reason
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:39,232	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	It just stuck
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:46,656	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Years later when Richard move to downtown Los Angeles he was driving on the same stretch of freeway where he got lost today
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,680	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Decade before
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:53,568	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	We looked up at the Big Green rectangular sign suspended above I realize why I missed the exit
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,104	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	It's because it wasn't
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,640	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Adequately signed
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,920	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Bad wayfinding
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:02,272	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The exit for the I-5 wasn't indicated on the green overhead sign
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:04,064	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	There was even a big open
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:07,392	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Space weather should have been a blue and red Interstate Shield
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,672	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	And above that
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,208	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	It should have said north
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:12,256	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	It was clear to Richard
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:12,768	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Caltrain
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,328	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The California Department of Transportation
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:16,352	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	I made a mistake
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:23,776	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Sir Richard and artist and sign painter decided to make the Interstate 5 North Shield himself and install it in the
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,592	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The place he thought it should have been all along
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:28,896	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	High above the 110 freeway
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:31,456	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	He would call it an act of Guerrilla public service
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,248	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	All I do is to be
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,552	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Certified public servant
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,320	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Bored
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,344	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Roxy to show
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,392	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	What you can do with artwork
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:43,488	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	You can put in plain sight have a functioning working thing for everyone to use
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:47,840	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Richard started by studying LA freeway sign
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:50,144	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Holding up Pantone swatches
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,680	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Perfectly match the paint color
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:55,776	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	He dangled over Bridges to measure the exact dimensions of other sign
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,824	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	And most importantly
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:00,640	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	He downloaded the Necronomicon of
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:02,432	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	California road signage
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:03,968	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The Mad kid

EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:16,512	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	To provide for uniform standards and specifications for all official traffic-control devices in California
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:18,559	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	It's not a beach read
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:22,143	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	I have a horrible Lazy Sunday Afternoon read
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,471	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	All the specs are online so
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:25,983	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	People can

EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,031	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Projects
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,823	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Richard wanted his sign
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:32,383	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	To be built to the exact specifications
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:32,895	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Caltrans
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:35,455	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Which were designed to be read by motorists

EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,015	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The

EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,111	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Roughly High
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,135	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	WYD
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:46,463	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	It's less than 1/8 of an inch barely needs
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:47,487	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Stick woman
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:49,279	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	It's still pretty strong
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,583	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	And above that I put the word North
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:55,167	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	And that was all about 14 in by 5
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:59,775	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	And again I use the same typeface that was there in the same signs
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:00,799	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The tried to match everything
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:03,359	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Close as I could so it wouldn't be obvious
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:04,639	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Caltrans didn't do it
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:06,687	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Richard's brand new edition
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,711	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Had to blend in
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:08,479	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Perfectly with
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,247	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The existing signage
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:11,551	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Which have been collecting dirt and smog
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:12,319	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	For decades
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:15,903	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	I sprayed the whole thing with a really thin glaze
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,183	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Gray
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:17,695	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The knockdown
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:21,791	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	After he finished it Richard sign his name on the back of it
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:22,815	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The black marker
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,351	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Painter signing a
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:24,863	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Canvas
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:27,423	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Then came the next phase of the project
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:28,703	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The installation
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:30,239	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Cheap land
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,775	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Decision of a bank
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,847	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	He bought a disguise
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,895	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	A white hard hat and an orange vest
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:41,247	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	So he'd look like a Caltrans worker basically looked at partes as best I could
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:45,599	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Animal decal for a pickup truck meant to look vaguely official that said
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,903	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Aesthetic deconstruction
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,463	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The night before the installation
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,999	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Richard drove out to the site
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,023	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Hit some of his
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:55,071	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Supplies to the BET to get to the next morning
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:56,863	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	My interview.
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:58,143	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	He took me to the spot
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:58,655	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Show me
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:02,751	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Stashed his stuff okay we're basically here
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:07,103	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Right now the ivy isn't that fit but it was a lot thicker and I had
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:11,455	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Basically behind that trade stashed the ladder and the signs and stuff
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,759	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	After he hit his things
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:14,783	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Climbed a tree
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,855	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Going through everything
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:22,975	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	I just heard a call myself down by being there and hanging around with it tonight
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,487	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	4
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:26,047	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Richard was worried that he might drop
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:26,815	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The sign
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:27,583	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Or one of his
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:29,119	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Tools part of the road below
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:31,167	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Drivers going 60
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:33,983	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Plus miles an hour would have no time to react
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:36,031	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	If something landed on the road in front of them
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,799	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Or worse
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:37,823	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Onto their car
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,359	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	That was a scary
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:40,895	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Thing about hope
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:42,431	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	If somebody got hurt
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:44,991	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Apple ID with that
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:47,295	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	And then the project that after scan it cuz
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:49,343	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	It would have defeated the whole
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:49,855	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Idea
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:52,159	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	But despite some reservations
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,439	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Richard was pretty confident
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,719	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Call the Whole Thing Off
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:57,023	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	And he gone too far to turn back
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:02,399	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	And that brings us back to the morning of August 5th 2001
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:09,567	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Richard did not act alone he asked several friends to film the insulation from different Vantage points
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:13,151	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Amy inoue was one of the friends he Enlisted the film
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:15,967	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	6 a.m. or 7 a.m. on Sunday morning
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,503	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	It was 10
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,295	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Because we all thought we were going
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:27,743	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Richard had chosen the Sunday morning to put up the sign knowing that there would be little traffic and The Morning Light Rising
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:30,815	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	In about the skyscrapers would be just right for filming
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:37,727	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	What he hadn't anticipated was that couch ranted also picked that morning to do work on the same stretch
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:40,543	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Yes they happen to be doing some other work
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,335	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	On the freeway
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:42,847	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Just salad
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:44,127	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	That's fine
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:46,175	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	When they saw the Caltrans workers
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,711	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	They thought about turning back
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:50,015	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	But I had surmised after all this is
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:52,063	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	It's pretty large city there be more than one sign
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,879	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	My assumption was that think the other guy was
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,927	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Richard Park his truck
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:59,487	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	When everyone was in position with their cameras
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:00,255	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	He went to work
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:02,815	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The hardest part was getting over the razor wire
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,839	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	With the ladder
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,375	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Once he was up on the catwalk
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:07,167	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Delete 30 ft above the highway
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,471	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	You started screwing in the new sign
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:11,519	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Careful not to drop any screws
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,543	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	On the cars below
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,359	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Halfway into it
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,639	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	We just
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,431	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Don't like okay he's going to get away with
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:24,831	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Amazing or what
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:27,391	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The whole thing took less than
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:27,903	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	30 minute
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,439	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	As soon as it was up
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:31,999	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Richard pack up his letter rushed back to his truck
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:37,887	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Blended back into the city
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,423	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	I think we all went out to
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,751	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Super relieved
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:51,199	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Only a small group of people knew that the Interstate 5 shield with the word North hanging above the 110 freeway
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:52,223	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Was it forgery
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,271	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	He didn't say to us.
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,039	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Don't tell anyone
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:55,807	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	So are
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:56,575	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Friends on new whip
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:01,695	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Happy
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:03,743	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	But it never
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,303	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Tweaked-out
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:09,375	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	For a while
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:09,887	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	For a while
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:13,983	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	For nine months the secret stayed within a small community
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:16,031	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	And then Richard sprengeri
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,823	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Repeat the story
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:22,943	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	What the hell Gary why can't you be cool just be cool Gary Richard Secret
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,991	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Without the Caltrans
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:31,391	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	And the Press from the fake magnetic sign on his beat up blue truck to a work order proclaiming rush
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:37,791	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	But he did is against the law to capture and says it has no plans at all to file charges against him actually found out what
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:40,351	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	What happened apparently they send a crew out there to inspect
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:44,191	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Richard was hoping to get it signed back from Caltrans after they took it down
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:50,335	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	He was thinking he would hang it in an art gallery but Caltrans didn't take the sign down at past
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:54,431	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The Caltrans inspection cuz that's really that the final
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:57,247	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Cast of how am I how good the artwork is
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:59,039	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	It stayed up for 8 years
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,855	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	9 months and
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,391	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	14 days I believe
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,415	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	It's not exactly a coup
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:05,695	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Pretty close to that
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:09,535	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	An interviews about the incident with other news organizations
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,583	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Caltrans didn't exactly
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Condone rich
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,119	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Handiwork
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,911	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	They're pretty kind about it
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:19,519	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Here's the Caltrans spokesperson at a time
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:23,615	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	And in fact you did such a good job that I'd like to offer him a job application
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:30,015	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	More than eight years after Richard son when he got a call from a friend who noticed some workers taking it down
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:34,879	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Richard contacted Caltrans to ask if he can have his signed back by time I tracked him down
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:37,439	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	It already been crushed into a bale
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,463	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Going for China
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:41,023	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Who knows what it turned into could be a waffle iron by now
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:44,351	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	After Caltrans took down Richard
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,399	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Consign they replaced it with a brand new one
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:47,935	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	But this time
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:51,263	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	They Incorporated his ideas into the new design
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:54,847	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	They out of the 5 north and the shield not only
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:55,871	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	That's fine
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:57,919	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	But the two additional one up the road
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:04,319	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	A little epilogue
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:09,439	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Richard's highway sign is a happily Ever After Story the sign worked
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:12,511	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	People appreciated it no one got hurt thankfully
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,791	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Even Caltrans was
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,327	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Really pretty nice about the whole thing
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:19,935	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	There's another gorilla sign story out of New York City a group that calls itself
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:24,287	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The efficient passenger project has been hanging signs in New York subway station
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,567	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	To tell people
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:29,151	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Where they can board the train to make the most efficient transfers
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:33,503	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	The project is not at all affiliated with the Metropolitan Transit Authority
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:36,319	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	But the signs look just like MTA signs
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:38,367	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Black with white helvetica lettering
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,391	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	They say things like
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:42,975	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Bored here for best transfer to the 4 5 and 6 trains
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:45,279	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Or board here for best transfer
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,559	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	F&M train
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:52,959	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	It's the kind of knowledge that you build up over time as a regular Subway Rider and this gorilla sign maker is offering
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:53,983	| 99pi-0152-guerillapublicservice-1 |	Bring it to everyone
