EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:18,592	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Have a burning question for you
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:22,432	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Why do us flags on military vehicles and uniform
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:23,712	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Always appear.
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:25,760	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	That's from Michael McAuliffe
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:32,416	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Well first of all their only backwards part of the time military regulations state that when a flag is displayed it must give the effect
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:37,280	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	That flag flying in the breeze is it the person wearing it is moving forward
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:39,328	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Till the patches on the left arm
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:41,632	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The flag is displayed as you normally
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:44,704	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Take a bath with that blue star field in the upper left-hand corner
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:46,496	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	But if the flag patches on the right
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:49,568	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It's the reverse side flag that's display
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:52,128	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	With the blue star field in the upper right-hand corner
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:59,296	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Singles for vehicles the blue star field always points towards the front of a vehicle as if it's flying North charging

EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:28,287	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You're that out so the structure or the sort of estate that she's talking about
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,823	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It actually replace
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:31,615	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	An entire neighborhood
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:33,407	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So let me just give you a little background
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:36,479	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	In 1963 in New Castle England
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:41,343	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	A 17000 resident working-class neighborhood called biker
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:43,391	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Sault Sainte the same name as
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:44,159	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	This new place
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:50,559	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Was demolished because it was considered a slum and I think there are a lot of vacancies
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:56,959	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And the neighborhood was made up of sort of Victorian Row Housing and like if you've ever seen the movie Billy Elliot
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:02,335	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And you can like picture hands are dancing through these like
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:04,383	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Brick houses and
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:07,967	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Really really close together narrow streets and that's
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:10,271	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	That's the old biker
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:14,879	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	At the old biker and I think that movie was actually filmed a really close to
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:17,951	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The old biker neighborhood
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:24,351	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Street-by-street the old songs with cleared one straight line straight the new bike it was built
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:28,191	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Neighborhood of brick row houses this architect named Ralph
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,215	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Skin
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:30,495	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Built
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,519	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The new place
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:33,823	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Which is called biker wall or or sometime
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,591	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Biker estate
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:37,663	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And it's a community of public housing that
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,479	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Is enclosed by this
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:42,271	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Great big wall of
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:49,439	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The wall is a mile and a half long and it provides a barrier to winds coming
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:52,511	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Kind of off the North Sea and also
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:54,815	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Highway noise there's like a big
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,095	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Freeway
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,375	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Bestway nearby
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,143	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And it kind of
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:00,447	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Creates this sort of microclimate within the
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:00,959	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Community
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:06,335	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So it's basically this big wall that should have wraps around these other buildings and closing them
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:10,687	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Campbell at she has some very
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,199	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Vivid
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:15,039	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Descriptions on but she says the way it's constructed

EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:37,055	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Like that was a little sexual it gets like there's more
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:39,615	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	What does all this mean for architecture

EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,999	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It goes with the Contours of the landscape
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,815	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It's an enclosure rather than a disclosure
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,863	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	What does nooks and crannies
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,655	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Layers and levels and surprises
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,287	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Annies
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:17,503	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Yeah if you didn't hear that is aggressive phallic architecture
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,295	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And it was great erections
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:21,599	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Skyline Boulevard
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:25,183	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Does gray directions
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:28,255	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So great
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,559	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So I found this
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,863	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Please send I was sort of like
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:38,239	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I want to put this on me are basically just to get
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,799	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	This lady and her
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,871	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Volvo architecture theories
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:50,783	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	On our podcast like I don't know if there's a story here but I want there to be
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:55,135	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	A little cool things about by Corso
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:59,231	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It's kind of neat about it Ralph Erskine the architect
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:04,095	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	He was a socialist and a Quaker and he really wanted to build a place that fostered
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:04,607	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Community
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:11,775	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And he'd also studied buildings in the Arctic and how they were constructed to sort of Shield the inner Courtyard
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:16,895	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Words from from winds coming in from the outside and she wanted to do something similar but
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:21,503	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Not Justa Shield it from winds but also just to enclose the residence in this
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:27,391	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Fulvic Unearthed contrived
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Really really hard to involve a bunch of the residents from the old biker
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,559	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	In the redesign of the new one
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,095	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	But
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:37,119	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Despite his
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:41,727	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	3 best efforts not that many of the original residents ended up living there
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:49,151	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Eventually in the 80s the place kind of turns a little bit back into a slum there's a lot of
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:53,759	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Was crying and in vacancies and a lot of the places sort of fall into disrepair
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,551	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The guardian
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:59,135	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Said this about the biker the New Biker estate
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:01,183	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	For all its faults
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:07,327	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Biker wall was an Exemplar of both design and an attempt to involve the community in the changes
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:09,375	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Plan for them by those in power
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:16,287	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	That it failed in so many ways reveals that it's rarely in the interests of communities to demolish the home
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,055	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	They live in
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,639	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Yeah so that's to me that's just sort of like
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,967	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You can try really hard to do it right
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,247	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And it
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,015	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Still
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,783	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Mike
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,575	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Come out wrong
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:35,999	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So in Beatrice Campbell the the YouTube lady she she admits that the place is flawed but she still
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:41,375	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Explode a car but at least unlike most of its contemporaries
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,727	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Both monumental
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:48,799	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It's a social space
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:49,567	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Undomestic
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,663	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	There's something about this place
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:10:02,111	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Okay so I don't know if you can understand her last line there but she says there's something lighthearted about this place something love
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:02,623	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Audible
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:09,279	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Eminem if I love that if you scroll down just a little ways that the comment on the video says
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:15,423	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	They didn't tell them it was Carl orff 24/7 in this place
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:21,567	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Carl orff I think with that comment is getting at is that it was real
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,871	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The kind of dark
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:26,687	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	A place to live because Carl orff wrote this
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,199	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	10
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,335	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	That's pretty dark
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,359	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Liquor well
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,151	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Thank you Katie
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,175	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:03,807	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	In 2014 the biker Community Trust are they multimillion-dollar revamp up
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:07,903	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	With lots of improvements including Broadband in every property
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,719	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It's not all Carl orff
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,023	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	If indeed it ever was
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:16,863	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Tell me who you are
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:20,191	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I am sure effusive assistant producer
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,215	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	99 pi
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:22,239	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	What does that mean what are you
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:28,383	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I've sort of do a lot of the pro tool stuff so I'm working with the actual tape for a lot of The Producers stories
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:34,271	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Scoring sound design a lot of the pieces I do research in fact-checking so I basically do
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:36,831	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Whatever needs to be done it's a what is you were
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,623	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So things that are
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:41,183	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Creative are relatively simple to copyright
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,207	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Erratic song
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:42,975	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Copyright
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,255	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You write a book
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:47,839	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Did you get copyrighted it's easy to prove that you've done this thing
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,887	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	But a question arises
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:50,655	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	When
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,447	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You tried to copyright something that is
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:53,983	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Based in fact
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:57,311	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Some sort of objective reality like the definition of a word in dictionary
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:00,127	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Entry for a person and inside
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:01,919	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Or
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:03,711	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	In this case
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:07,807	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Maps when I know you like a good math story. I love a good night story yasso
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:10,367	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	This story is about a town called
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:11,391	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Agloe New York
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:14,207	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And it was in the 1930s
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,743	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The general drafting company
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:18,047	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	What's creating a map of New York State
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:24,959	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So they put in a lot of hours and lot of Manpower detailing all the rivers and gorges and Finger Lakes and
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:29,055	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Pounds and he said we put in so much work you know we have to protect our investment
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:31,871	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So they set a copyright trap
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:35,455	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Near the northwest corner of Pennsylvania
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,991	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Just a couple miles into New York
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,551	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I've a put a little town
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:41,087	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Next to Roscoe New York
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:41,855	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Call
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:42,367	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Idaho
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,671	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	An aglow I believe is actually
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:48,767	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	A jumble of the initials of the founders names agloe
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,815	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And so they put this on the map
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,095	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,375	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	They know that if
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,143	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Another map
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,191	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Shows iglow New York
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,983	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	That person was copying there
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,263	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Yeah exactly
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,567	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So they create this fictitious town
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:02,591	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It's on the map
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:05,407	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And it's like soldan Esso stations around movie
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:06,687	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The state
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:08,479	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And for a while everything is all honky
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:08,991	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Chidori
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,551	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	But then several years later
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,087	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Another map comes out
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:14,879	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And they open the map
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:15,647	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,415	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Lo and behold
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:20,255	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I got it was on it this company is called Rand McNally drafting
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:22,303	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Busted busted
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:28,703	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Yeah that's what they thought so the general drafting company goes yo Rand McNally you stole our map and where
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:33,311	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Going to sue you and Rand McNally is like no no wait this is an actual place
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,591	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Let's go and take a look
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:35,615	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Intelligent
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,407	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And Company people are like
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:39,455	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Okay sure take us to a glow
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:41,759	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So that goes place where I glow
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:42,271	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Should be
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:47,135	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And lo and behold there is actually a big General Store there
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:49,183	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Small General Store actually
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:51,743	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And it's called The agloe General Store
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:54,559	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And there a couple houses maybe 2 at its peak
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,863	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So The Story Goes
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:14:01,983	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Some people maybe from the neighboring towns wanted to this place wanted to build a general store
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:06,079	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Saw that the map said I glow is here but nothing was there
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,359	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:09,407	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	When they wanted to build the story they just
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:13,503	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Slapped on me I glow name so this place that was created as a
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,783	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Fictitious copyright trap
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:17,087	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Start of spring up into reality
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,623	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So this sort of
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:21,695	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Became famous because author John Green
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,719	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I wrote a book
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:27,583	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Call Paper Towns. Miss settin agloe New York and he gave a tedx talk
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,631	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	About I go New York and about
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,399	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The concept of paper
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:33,727	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Paper Towns as well since turned into a movie
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:35,775	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So we thought the story might not be a great
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:38,335	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Fit for us because people in our audience minority
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:42,687	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Be really familiar with him yeah but we can talk about it a little bit and if you want to learn more
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:46,015	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You should look up John Green because he and his brother Hank
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:47,551	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	If these great videos
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:49,343	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	But you are all kinds of things I know people
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:49,855	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You like the show
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,135	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Totally love

EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,519	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And you are
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:12,383	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I'm Turk Cole said that I'm the digital director at 99% invisible and describe what that means
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,687	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Sure I produce a web stories for the show
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:17,247	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And I take care of all of our digital
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:18,527	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,063	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Several
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:20,831	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Years ago
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,855	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	But I remember being
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,391	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	In the waiting room waiting
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,415	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Maslow's
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:25,439	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	In surgery
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:28,255	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I got an email
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:30,047	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	From a firefight
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:31,839	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And she said
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,631	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Do you know anything
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:35,167	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	About Knox
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:42,335	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Which of these little invisible elements you see everywhere in urban environment you probably never noticed
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,359	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So please tell us
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,383	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	What is
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:44,895	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Enochs
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:48,223	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Yeah Knox Box in simple terms is a rapid entry system
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:50,527	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It allows emergency personnel
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:53,087	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	To get into buildings quickly when there's a disaster
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,391	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So for example
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,927	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	When there's a fire in your apartment building
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:59,743	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And the fire department is trying to get in quickly
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:02,815	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	They show up they open an Xbox get out of key
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,583	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And into the building
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:07,167	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So the Scarlet like physically so it's like a little box that sort of
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:09,471	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Up against the wall
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:15,871	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Typically be found within a few feet of an entryway to ilvl the black box
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:16,895	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Usually
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:19,455	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	With a little red on it so it's easy to spot
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:21,759	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	To the fire department shows up
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:23,295	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	They grabbed hold this little box
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:26,623	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And the user master key to open it and it should be
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:28,159	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And there's a fire inside
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:29,695	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Didn't want to break in in
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:33,279	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	All the doors and windows they just if there's a key available they can use it
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:37,887	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Write an emergency they're not worried about you know the property damage of course
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:38,399	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	That's a vibe
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:44,799	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	They're worried about injuring themselves right so they have to break glass door and jump through through that glass door
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:46,591	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	That puts them at greater risk
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:50,175	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The building this season time
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:53,503	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Reduces injury injury risk and Chestnut
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:59,391	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Is why does the whole system work so they they have a master key that opens up all the knocks boxes
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,927	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Right so their master key
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:03,743	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Out of all the black boxes
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:10,143	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	For all the different buildings and that means when they arrive at a building they don't have to sort through bunch of keys figure out how they're going to get into a particular building
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:11,679	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I just whip out their one key
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:14,751	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Stick it in the lock box open it up and inside of that
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:17,311	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	They will find whatever key they need to access that particular bill
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,359	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	What is the name Knox
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:22,431	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Knox is a company that produces a lot of these box
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:26,783	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And technically generically you might call the rapid entry system
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:29,087	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Knock make so many of them that
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:31,647	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	If he has become an everyday sort of household name for these
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,159	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Knock knock
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:38,303	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Cool so like if you were in any populated area
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,327	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:41,119	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Will see a ton of these right
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:44,191	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	There everywhere you are surrounded by Knox boxes
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,727	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Basically anywhere you go
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,519	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You probably pass
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:50,079	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	A dozen or so of these just walking down the street everyday
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:54,943	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So on every block very city you'll find some equivalent of a Knox Box
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:57,759	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Ashley outside the building and once you start seeing these
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,527	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You will see them
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:05,439	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	At a high level they're made to be seen and yet they're somehow strangely invisible until you start notice
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:10,303	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	This is one of those great examples of a short story that was just
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:14,911	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It's an anecdote multi-story so it made sense just put it up on the web
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:15,935	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,447	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	In Call of Duty
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:20,799	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Rick Astley have a whole website tomorrow at 9 p.m.

EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:34,111	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Suggestion all those years ago
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:38,719	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Last week I got this mini storage suggestion from Tucson Arizona resident Megan Phillips
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:40,255	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	In Tucson
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:42,815	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Roads running East-West or called Street

EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:47,935	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Makes sense but what is unique to Tucson
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:49,215	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Is that any Diagonal row
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:49,983	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Roads are called

EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,919	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Letting that's pretty cool
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:03,551	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	When I got me cuz. I was sitting next to famous portmanteau skeptic Helen zaltzman of The Illusionist
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:06,879	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It's where you took his acclaimed Word podcast and I asked her what she thought

EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:52,863	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Maybe maybe I'm just worried that people hear it and be like oh yeah I know it
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,911	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	That doesn't work which would mean

EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:03,871	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I'm a producer at 99percentinvisible
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:07,199	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So we're telling all the type of stories that we
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:10,271	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Can't tell on the radio for various reasons maybe they were
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:14,623	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Little parts of stories that got cut out because they're too confusing maybe they were
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:18,464	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You're like a little too small to constitute like putting the whole episode about
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:20,000	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	But this one
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:22,560	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	This one this one is different
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:24,608	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Why the difference
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:29,216	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	This was supposed to be my magnum opus
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:32,032	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The One That Got Away I mean I mean it like
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:33,312	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	2 years ago
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:35,872	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And so at the time it was
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:41,248	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	This is it I was already planning out like the t-shirts we would sell about this episode
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:41,760	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,808	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It just it didn't happen
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:45,344	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Okay so what is this doing
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:46,880	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	This is about the most
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,648	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Iconic

EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:50,976	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Is a poster we've all seen
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:53,280	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Is it supposed to say we have all been forced
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,304	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	See
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:22:01,472	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It is this
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:03,008	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Can you read that line there
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,312	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	D a o

EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:09,664	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It is that pyramid arrangement of black letters on a white background
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:12,224	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Is usually got a biggie at the top
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:14,784	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Nice line of letters get progressively smaller
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,808	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Is a vision chart
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,344	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And it has
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:18,368	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Official name
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,392	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	What's the name
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:20,672	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Is called
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,440	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The Snellen chart
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:24,000	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	After the Dutch ophthalmologist
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,536	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Herman Snellen who invented it
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:26,560	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	1860

EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:32,704	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	2
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:33,216	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Perfectly
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:35,520	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The way it works
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:38,336	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Is that you read off the series of letters
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,104	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Annie's line
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:41,408	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And he get the majority right
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,176	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You get to move to the neck
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:47,808	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Went to a bunch of ophthalmologist
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,600	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	A bunch of times
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:51,392	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And according to
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:52,160	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Mira Lim
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,440	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	This
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,720	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	They kind of pomologist
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:56,000	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	To work at the street from us
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:58,560	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	By convention you always use the Snellen chart
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:00,608	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	This just works well it's what everybody has
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:05,728	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And a big part of why the Snellen chart works really well
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:07,008	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Is because
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,032	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Easy
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:08,544	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Memorize
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:10,336	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And a lot of

EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:12,640	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Eye doctor
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:14,432	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Have memorized their chart

EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,000	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	There you go
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,816	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Wow so that's just her
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:34,656	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	She just read a little about it then
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:36,960	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	They don't have to like
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:43,104	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Squint with you to like make sure you got each one right or they don't even have to follow along in a paper like if they have it memorized
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:50,528	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I ended up wrong and they can assess you really quickly which if you're not a doctor you're doing this
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:53,088	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Every single patient and then this makes
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:55,648	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Add minutes to your day
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,184	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You have it memorized
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:58,976	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So the Snellen chart
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,536	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Is Iconic you can see it online
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:05,376	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Mugs and tie them whatever is everywhere just that layout is classic
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:13,824	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	An obvious problem
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,616	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The way the test works
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:18,176	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You read the line you get the majority right
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:20,480	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And then you get to go to the next line
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:23,040	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	But if every line has a different
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:26,368	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Amount of letters on it it's basically a different test every time
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,648	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You can get
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:29,184	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	One line is okay to get
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:32,256	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Arirang the next line it's okay to get whatever
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,280	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Foreign
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:36,096	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Is a different test every time you have different odds
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:37,376	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	If you got
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:39,936	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Three out of five right in the 2020 Rio you will be
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:40,704	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Peking 2020
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:42,240	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	If I Stay
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:43,520	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Let me repeat that
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:44,800	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And you only got two days
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,592	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	In that same row
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:47,104	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Now you would have
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:51,200	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The shockingly imprecise it's unbelievable
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:53,504	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	That is Doctor Ian Bailey
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:57,856	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And in the 70s he helped design a more precise vision chart
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,624	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	That has
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:00,416	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Five letters on every
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,440	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Single line
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:04,000	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I think at chat design could be
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,536	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Compared with
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,816	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Designing a ruler
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:10,656	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Where you say why don't we make the markings on the ruler
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,448	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Of the same size
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,776	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It seems obvious
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:17,312	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And so he has
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,848	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	5 big letters at the top
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:19,872	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	5 letters
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,152	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Find five letters in the next line
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:21,920	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	All space
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,200	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Equally apart
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,480	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Very precise
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:26,784	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	But if you visualize it for a second
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,832	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Instead of one
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:30,368	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Giant letter at the top
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,904	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	There are five
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:33,184	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Giant letters
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:33,696	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	At the top
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,280	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Which means that it is a physically bigger
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:42,912	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Chart it's just wider and also that means it looks more like an upside-down pyramid
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,680	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	T25
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:45,728	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Really big letters with.
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:48,032	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And then five smaller letters in it
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:49,312	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Smaller letters
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:55,456	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	How to get tiny tiny tiny but it's still always fine exactly and then he also had to pick which letters
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:56,992	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	To use
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:59,296	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And so some letters are more confusable like
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:01,088	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	CNG
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:03,392	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	What is a very distinct like Z
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,160	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	A
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:10,560	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And so he also had this like design challenge of making sure that you wouldn't have one line of lifo either letters and one line of difficult letter
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:11,840	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	To make sure they distribute
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:13,888	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And you also to make sure
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,168	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	But there wasn't like
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:21,312	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Cuz he designed it in Australia and you want to make sure nnz were next to each other people be like oh New Zealand and like
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:25,152	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Create associations with with shapes
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:27,456	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So yeah it was like it was a really tough
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:28,480	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Start to design
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:34,880	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Battlelog bar chart chart it is one of many improved charts but the
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:40,000	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Problem is so yeah the chart is a lot bigger and wider physically it takes up more wall space
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:41,280	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It's a lot of offices
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:43,584	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Can't actually accommodate
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:46,912	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And since there are five letters on every row it means
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:48,448	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	There more letters for doctors
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:49,728	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Memorize
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:51,264	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And actually
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,032	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Dr. Bailey
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,360	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Exactly
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:59,712	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I can still remember the Snellen chart that I used to have when I was in
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:00,224	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Private
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,808	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	DCB
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:04,576	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Dln
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,648	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Long story short like
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:12,256	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The memorization is really cute to why the Snellen chart works
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:16,352	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It's like what everyone is used to the old pyramid shape is like easier to memorize
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:21,984	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The division chart presents was really interesting question about what really makes a design good cuz on the one hand
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:22,496	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You have
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:27,104	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Charts like the logmar chart like Doctor Bailey start which are standardized and precise
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,128	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And it's a better
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:32,480	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	But a little harder to accommodate in a little harder to use
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:33,248	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And then
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,272	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	On the other hand
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,552	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You have the classic
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:36,064	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Melon chart
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,112	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	What is less precise
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:39,904	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Way easier to memorize
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:41,952	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Which means that the more efficient test for doctors
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:44,000	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Plus if it's conveniently on a wall
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,560	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It is memorable quick easy
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:47,072	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Imprecise
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:53,472	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	There's probably more scientific ways of measuring Vision but it's a pretty good
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:56,032	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It's a pretty good way of assessing how well you can
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:59,872	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Function so it's good it does work and it's a lot easier than
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:02,176	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The other wizard
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:08,320	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So you see both versions of the chart around and just next time you get your eyes checked
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,344	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	You can see which
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:11,392	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Design your doctor has opted for
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:16,768	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	If you see of the traditional pyramid Snellen chart shape that means it's more efficient for the doctor to use
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:19,840	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And if you see the upside down log Mar
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:20,352	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Shape
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:24,192	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	That means it's just a more precise tool for measuring vision
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,216	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	But like
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:27,008	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Both are good designs
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:27,520	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Justin really gif
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,544	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Waze
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:34,944	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	So we just gave the most cursory explanation of vision charts and the design implications of each of them but
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:37,504	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	When the whole story was with being scripted
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:42,368	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	It had lots of different details and it ended up getting more and more confusion about what 20/20 vision
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,392	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Actually wasn't
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,184	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	All this weird stuff in the eventually
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:45,952	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	We just decided
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:47,488	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	The Killer story
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:49,024	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	And not I could produce a full version of it
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:52,352	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Which is ongoing tragedy we are reminded of all the time
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,144	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I thought that this would never really be
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:29:00,032	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I researched the hell out of this I'm fertile subscribe to the Ophthalmology
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:04,128	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	National newsletter and I see this chart everywhere and it and it
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:05,152	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Really
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:09,248	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Baby pisses me off
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:12,320	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I've had this day flying around forever I even made
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:15,136	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	I even made this really fun medley of songs
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,416	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	Check it out
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:21,280	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	20/20 vision

EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:49,696	| 99pi-0242-ministoriesvolume-2-1 |	We had a huge response the last episode soap if you have a mini story suggestion
