EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:54,592	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	But I do think they're a lot of good things about the cassette

EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:07,392	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	You can have a tape floating around on the floor of your car per year
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:08,928	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	And then throw it in your tape deck

EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:52,159	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	If you purchase a cassette recently from anywhere

EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:19,295	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	As for why cassettes have stuck around in prisons all these years
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:21,855	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	It's hard to get a definitive answer
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:23,647	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Because every prison is different
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:26,207	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	But there's one Theory we heard from a few different people
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:29,279	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Tapes are allowed because CDs are easier to weaponize
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:30,815	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	They say that
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:32,607	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	It's the most safest way
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:36,703	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	For them to listen to music through the CD you can break and maybe cut somebody with
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:41,311	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	That's Chris Barrett this Abraham was recorded a couple years ago for a short film
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:46,943	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Chris used to run a service that help families send packages to people in prison in New York state
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:51,039	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Get a warehouse full of items that had already been approved by the prison authorities

EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,927	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Instead of CDs
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:59,999	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Three never really understood the logic behind it
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,791	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	They let me sell
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,071	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Tuna fish cans
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,351	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	That
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,887	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	You know you pull off the top
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:07,167	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	And that thing is metal like
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:10,495	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Much more dangerous and a CD is my point
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,775	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Tuna fish canned india
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,567	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	I don't know why bae
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:18,943	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Come up with some of the rules and they come up with we just try to stay
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Within those guidelines
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:25,599	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Chris whose package sending service recently went out of business
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:27,903	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Also sold a lot of cassette Walkman
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:31,999	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Walkmans used to be available for purchase in prison commissaries
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,535	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	They generally heart anymore
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:35,583	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Which makes them extremely coveted items
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:40,703	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Max my Walkman break I'm out of there so I'll take good care of it
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,239	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Blinky lights
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:48,639	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	And wear-and-tear is not the only threat to the life of a Walkman
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:54,783	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	But when it's like amazing shake down and they bring other officers from other institutions
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:58,879	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	They will just break your TV break your radio
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:01,951	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Take those cheesy take your radio take your cassette tapes
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:03,231	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Washington
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Destroy my Walkman
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:06,815	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	I cannot get another Walkman
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:11,167	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	This is probably one of the most prized
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:11,935	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Items
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:16,799	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	It'll try to hold out as much as they can
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,335	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Singapore checked in as much as possible
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,895	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	That's efren paredes Jr
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:25,759	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	He was a fifteen-year-old honor student when he was tried as an adult on a murder charge
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:29,599	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	And sentenced to life without parole he's always maintained his innocence
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:35,743	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Efren is 43 now and during his 28 years in prison he amassed a pretty big collection of music
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:39,583	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Call my favorite Kendrick Lamar
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:41,631	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	I like Young Jeezy Rick Ross
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:42,911	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Meek Mills
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,703	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	I like Lil Wayne
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:51,615	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	At Muskegon Correctional Facility in Michigan where Ethan is serving his sentence
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:54,431	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Prisoners can actually have MP3 players
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:10:00,831	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Inmates can purchase an MP3 player through the prison commissary and then download music to it through a kiosk provided by
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:02,623	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Company called access entertainment
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:07,999	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Before downloading the app to transfer money to the company and receive a credit for a certain amount of songs
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,791	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	But there's a catch
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Michigan there's a policy that
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,655	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	They try to restrict as much
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,703	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	As much music
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:19,007	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	What do
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:21,311	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Labels at parental advisory
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:26,431	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	In other words the state of Michigan will try and sentence a 15 year old as an adult
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,479	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	The winning becomes an actual adult
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:31,807	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	State won't let him purchase music deemed inappropriate for a teenager
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:35,135	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	It's interesting that you know that the Department Corrections has never
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:38,975	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Taking any steps to restricting
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:40,767	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Cassette tape purchases
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:45,631	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	We couldn't confirm that there were no restrictions on cassette music but efront hasn't encountered them
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:48,959	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	And that's why he says a lot of inmates still prefer cassettes
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:53,567	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	They listen to them all the time on their personal walkmans and sometimes out loud
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:57,151	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Actually as long as we're talking right now
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:59,967	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	A gentleman in the bathroom
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Washing clothes
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:03,039	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	What is radio on
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:04,831	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Playing
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,623	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	The song play at your own risk
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:14,303	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Writer needs a part of the prison or Ephraim is locked up is the one that houses the prisoners in solitary confinement
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:20,447	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Who is here guys all the time yelling up to music
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,727	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Rick Ross
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,519	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Turn on Meek Mills
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,055	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	This what they been waiting for
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:27,871	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	You know something so they can hear down there
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:29,919	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Something
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:32,223	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Music from upstairs
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:34,783	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	I used to pray
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,551	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Times like this
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,343	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	So I had to
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,927	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	I like this in a matter of
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:41,695	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Time I spent
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:44,511	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Patty wagon
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:56,287	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Prisons tend to be late adopters of technology so maybe one day all prisons in the US will just make the switch from cassette
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,055	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	To digital
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:59,359	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Or maybe they'll go to CDs first at the beach
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:01,151	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	The logically chronological
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:06,271	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Whatever the format the most important thing about music to Efren and Adolfo
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,551	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Is escape and connection
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:13,439	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Here's Adolfo again
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,463	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Music

EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:40,063	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	He rests his Walkman
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:40,831	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	That is love

EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:22,559	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Benjamin is one of my oldest friends and radio and you should definitely be friends with him too

EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:50,975	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	It's one of those little postcard reproduction
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:54,303	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	I've even made a gold frame for it out of balsa wood
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,863	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	The painting is called
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:57,887	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	The artist
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,911	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	In his Studio
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,471	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	It's by John Singer Sargent
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:04,031	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	I brought it with me here to the studio
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:06,847	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	I have it right here in front of me
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,895	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Propped up next to the microphone
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,711	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	The painting
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:14,783	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	It takes a Man painting a picture in his Studio
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,599	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	But this artist studio
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:19,135	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	Is not an ordinary Studio
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,439	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	It is the artist home
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:24,767	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	The man has his painting propped up
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,303	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	On the bed and the bureau
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,095	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	There is no easel
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,655	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	You get the idea that
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:33,983	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	The only things in the room are the bed the bureau
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:35,519	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	And the chair upon which the name Sid
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:41,151	| 99pi-0214-loudandclear-1 |	The man is confined to extremely small quarters
