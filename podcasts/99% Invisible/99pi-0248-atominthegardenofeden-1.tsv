EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:15,232	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	It was widely talked about in speeches
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:17,024	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	It was written about in popular mag

EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:57,215	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	But you understand the history of using radiation to mutate

EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:18,975	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	So basically ionizing radiation is just a nice form of electromagnetic radiation that has the power to

EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:31,423	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Of the nuclear radiation in Fallout would be on plants and animals
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:35,775	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Well that research continued after the war in a project called operation cross
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:40,895	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	What are US tested nuclear bombs around a small cluster of islands in the Pacific
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:43,199	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	The Bikini Atoll is where the US
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,479	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Testing the atomic bomb
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:49,855	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	And that's the first place where they really start intentionally
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:50,367	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Planting play
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,671	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	And seeing how their effect
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:56,767	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Researchers wanted to find out how plants would respond to the Heat
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,815	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	And the cameras but the bombs came off

EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,983	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	See the effects of bombs on living animals
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,519	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	A lot of them.
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:10,079	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	On the blast as well as the radiation
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:13,919	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	But there were other strains of nuclear research going on much
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:15,199	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Closer to home
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:17,503	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Particularly in National Lab
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:21,855	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	For the government was willing to throw funding at the new Hot Topic of nuclear science
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:25,183	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Even if those projects were directly related to weapons
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:27,743	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Enter the Atomic Garden
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:31,583	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Add a new quest to alter genetic material in plants
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:33,887	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Something we're still doing today
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,935	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Modern genetic

EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:40,799	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	We have the ability to go in and very carefully slice the genome with the scalp
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:44,639	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	The radiation experiments B Tomic Gardens were essentially just
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:46,687	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Getting the genome with a hammer and see what would happen
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:50,527	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	What are the most fascinating examples of us
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:52,831	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Research was happening at Brookhaven National Lab
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:58,719	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	So the gamma Gardens of Brookhaven in New York for probably the largest Gardens in the US governmental ever
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:00,511	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Devoted to Atomic radiation
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,023	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Plants
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:05,375	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	The Brookhaven gamma Garden was created in 1949
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:08,447	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	And its original goal was to study the effects of
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:10,751	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Prolonged exposure to gamma rays on plant
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:17,407	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	But eventually they begin to research whether they can use gamma Gardens to induce beneficial mutation
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:21,503	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	The essence of gammagard is it looks like a big circle
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:27,391	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	I'm with pie-shaped wedges and at the very center of the pie is a radioactive

EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:33,535	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	It was usually contained in a pole and would be raised above the level of the ground
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:38,143	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	The column Gardens actually makes them sound smaller than they were
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:43,775	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Many of these gamma Gardens were five acres in size so they were really massive installations
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,055	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Because of the wedges
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:49,151	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	When viewed from above almost looks like a symbol for radiation Danger
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:52,991	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	The center pole contain the radioactive isotope
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:53,759	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Usually

EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:58,879	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	That would shower the field with gamma radiation for about 20 hours a day
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:01,951	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	When it was time for researchers to go in and see the results
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:06,303	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	They would lower the source into an underground bunker made of concrete or lead
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:08,351	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Step inside the Fieldhouse

EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:11,935	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	And inspect the plants arrayed around the center
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:15,519	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Generally the at the very front of the source almost all those plants
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:16,287	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Die
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,335	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Pretty much where they be shrunken and shriveled
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,895	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	As you got back towards the back of the
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,943	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Glad you see plants
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:27,039	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Sober living that might look normal but which were going to be evaluated
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:28,831	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	To see if they had any abnormal growth

EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:34,975	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Adhere the researches
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:37,535	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	For Henry the place with radiation in an attempt to
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:40,095	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Increase that rate of mutation in the plant's DNA
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:43,679	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	So in a sense the scientist hope to speed up evolution
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:48,287	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	They were hoping to create crops that could withstand harsh growing condition

EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:42,975	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	So she wanted to provide them with irradiated seeds
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:47,071	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	And they would hopefully discover useful mutations in people's
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:54,239	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	People could become members of her Atomic gardening society and Merle would ship out the irradiated seeds and ask them to see
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:56,543	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Send back any data they could about the plants
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:58,591	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	This is really an early example of crowdsourcing
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,127	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	That's what she was doing
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,943	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	And her Atomic gardening Society was just
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:08,063	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	One of Howard's efforts to get people involved and interested in nuclear science
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:10,111	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Previous to the forming Atomic Garden
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:12,927	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Society she had published something called the atomic Digest

EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:19,839	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	That digest was part of another Society
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:25,983	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	She started called the atomic Society for the Layman Albert Einstein to be the first patron of her Society
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:30,847	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	She was invited to Gatherings of the Nobel Laureate
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:34,175	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Who acknowledged her to say our goals are much like yours
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:38,783	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	A lot of atomic scientists like the idea that their work was being used for something

EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:42,879	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	So the atomic scientists were very concerned
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:47,231	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Did the power of the atom would be kept kind of only for evil and only for weaponry
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:51,327	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	And felt like the safest route for it was for it to be brought out into the open
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,863	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	An into the realm of the laborers
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:54,399	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Person in into these more peaceful
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,167	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	What causes
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:58,495	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	Imperial certainly made great efforts to help his cause
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:01,567	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	She had a lot of atomic Gatherings an event
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:07,455	| 99pi-0248-atominthegardenofeden-1 |	So there were film screenings I'm about an ectopic Sarah lectures
