EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:25,664	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And had been since shortly after reconstruction

EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:51,776	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Hey my name is Curtis Graves and I'll go in 1938 so I'm a little older than most of the people who are listening to this
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:57,152	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Curtis would eventually become a Texas State representative
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:59,456	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And then he'd go on to work at NASA

EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:09,952	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	His parents tried to Shield him from that reality
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:14,560	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	I've often said that both my mother and father were the best lies that I knew
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:17,888	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	For instance we sat in the back of the bus
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,424	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Because it was cooler there
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:22,496	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	We rode in the front of the train because
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,776	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Are you could get off quicker
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:27,104	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Wish that upstairs in the movie because
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:29,152	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	You had better seats in the upstairs
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:32,224	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Of course that ruse can last
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:37,600	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And by the time Curtis with a college senior in Houston Texas in the mid-1950s
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:42,208	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	He was fully aware of what it meant to be a black person living under Jim Crow
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:45,280	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	There's one experience in particular
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,560	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	That stands out in his mind
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:53,472	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	He was just 21 years old and getting ready to drive to a college meeting in Waco about 3 hours Northwest of Hughes
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,800	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Degree to take a couple of acquaintances
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:04:01,664	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	They happened to be white women but I said to myself I might be in for some
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:03,456	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Difficult times here
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:06,784	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	But you know I had to sold you on
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:13,952	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	To get to Waco Curtis had to drive to a stretch of East Texas that was Notorious in those decades for racial
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:18,559	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Violence oh yeah those communities pretty bad
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:23,423	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Around dusk The Travelers got hungry so they pulled over at a Roadside Diner
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:25,727	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	As soon as we got in the front door
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:29,823	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	The guy said I'm sorry but you can't come in here
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:32,383	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	We don't serve black people at all
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:36,735	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	So the three of them went back outside and Curtis devised the plan
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,783	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	They try another restaurant
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,319	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Right across the street
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:44,415	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	I said to them the two of you go in get a table
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:49,279	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And after you seated and the waiter or waitress comes up to you
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:51,327	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Tell them that you have a boy
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,351	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	That's driving you
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:56,447	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And that you want to know whether he can you can bring him in to eat
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:02,335	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	So the women walked inside and they asked the waitress of Curtis could come inside to join them
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,871	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And ladies hit of course
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:04,895	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	No problem at all
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:08,223	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	So as long as I was that boy
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:10,783	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And their driver I could eat
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,831	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	With them at a table
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,111	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Vienna Restaurant
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:17,183	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	But if I were equal to them I could not
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:25,119	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	This kind of humiliation on the road was routine and had been going on for decades
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:28,703	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Many people wrote Into the NAACP around this time

EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:23,647	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	But he kept hearing stories about discrimination on the road
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:24,927	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	So he would
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:29,279	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Go do his route in Hackensack New Jersey come back home and work on the green book at night
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:33,375	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Compiling these addresses typing them up and put them in a book for
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:36,447	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	This is Calvin Alexander Ramsey
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,983	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Playwright author and filmmaker
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,519	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And years ago
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:42,079	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Calvin started researching the history of the green book
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:46,175	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	He learned that the green book wasn't really the first guide of the
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:46,687	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Science
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:47,967	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	In fact
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:50,527	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Victor may have gotten the idea from Jewish travel
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:53,855	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Because the Jewish Community was also having
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,903	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Issues on the open road
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:58,463	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	It's a lot of places saying restricted
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:00,255	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And it was a cold war
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,535	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	For Gentiles only
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:05,631	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	When Victor published his first green book it just covered New York
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:10,751	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And he heard from around the country from other carriers and other people saying we really need this Nationwide
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:14,847	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	But it wasn't that easy to gather information from across the country back then
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:17,407	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Long distance phone calls were expensive
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:19,199	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And that Calvin says
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:21,247	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Is when Victor green realized
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,783	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	That being a mailman
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:25,343	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Was his secret superpower
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:28,415	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	There were African-American let it carries all of United States at the
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:30,207	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	This time we talked about 1936
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:33,279	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And so he knew about you know
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:36,607	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	The relationships that the mailman have with their
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:43,007	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Homeowners or apartment dwellers Delivery Man mail so just like today the mailman is part of the
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:43,775	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	The community
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,823	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	So Calvin says Victor tapped into the snap
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:49,919	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Spreading the word about his guide through the National Alliance
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,711	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	The postal and federal employees
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:53,503	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	A letter carrier Union
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:56,575	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Calvin says postal workers across the
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:09:00,671	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	The country scouted potential Green Book locations and their cities and towns
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:03,999	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	He says it's some even asked families they delivered to
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:07,071	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	If they'd be open to hosting Travelers in their home
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:09,631	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And if they agreed then
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:12,447	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	They will send the information to Victor Green in Harlem
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:17,055	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Victor was able to get a feel for us
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:19,103	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Of letter carriers
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,383	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Who are all over the country
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:24,991	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Acquire material and names and addresses and businesses for him
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,783	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Where were there was a black mailman
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,063	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	You got a green book salesman
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,343	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Call recruiter
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,927	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Pretty quickly the green book caught on
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:36,511	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Businesses many black-owned began getting in touch with Victor
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:39,327	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Hoping to advertise and hoping to be listed
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:41,887	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Black newspapers signed on as sponsors
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:44,959	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Victor eventually retired from his job as a letter carrier
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:47,007	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And started working on the guy full-time
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:50,079	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Even opened an Affiliated travel agency
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,871	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Github Torres deranged traps
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,943	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	But still there was the challenge of distribution
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:58,527	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	How to get the Guide into the hands of Travelers who needed it
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,575	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	That happened in a few ways
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:03,647	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	United States travel Bureau signed on to help out
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:06,207	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And then there would be more informal Networks
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:06,975	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Spell churches
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:10,815	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Pullman porters the Urban League NAACP
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	The Masonic lodges
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:16,959	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	There was a very wide very distribution
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:19,263	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Process in place for these green book
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:22,079	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And there was an important corporate sponsor to
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:22,847	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	A big one
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:30,783	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Gas-X extra fine

EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:48,959	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Was one of the fuel oil companies back then then actively pursued Black customers they franchise their stations to

EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:53,055	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And he had a black representative on staff

EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:58,175	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Who helped plays Green books in many of those stations
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,711	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	As well as the white on one
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:02,783	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Also may have done this out of a sense
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,807	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	The fairness and equality
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,343	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Johnny Rockets
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,159	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Who founded Standard Oil in 1870
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,463	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	I married into a family of abolition
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:12,511	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Who were part of the Underground Railroad
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:15,583	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And he voted for Abraham Lincoln.
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,095	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And the day
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:19,167	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	But I probably did it for another reason
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,703	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Until money honey
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:22,751	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	It has to do with money
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:26,847	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Remember Curtis who had the crappy experience driving across East Texas
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,895	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Just had operated
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:32,223	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	One of the first black-owned Esso stations in New Orleans
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,503	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Where Curtis was born and raised
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:36,063	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	It was called the Bootsy and Buddies
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:39,647	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	The economic logic of stocking the green book was
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,671	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Pretty simple he says
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:44,511	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	If you want black people to buy your fuel
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:48,607	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Why don't you give them an opportunity to see that they can travel
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:50,655	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And find places to stay
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,703	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	While they're on the road traveling
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,263	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	The Curtis's dad kept

EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:57,311	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Or his customers
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:00,383	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	You know if somebody came in and said no
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,407	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Nobody on me
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:04,735	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	I'm thinking about taking a trip to Chicago my dad would say well
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:11,647	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Yep do you know where to stop between here and Chicago and other person would say no say what happened
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,671	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Green book will tell you
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,975	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And it gave you a sense

EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:24,447	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Into the green book came to cover listings in all 50 states and even some locations in Canada the crib

EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:41,087	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Depend on the green book for all the information
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:44,415	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	This guy has made traveling more popular
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,439	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Without encountering
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:45,951	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Embarrassing
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:54,143	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	But as a civil rights struggle continued
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:56,447	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Some people began to question the value
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:56,959	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	The green book
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:01,311	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Black people many of them began to feel that this was

EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:06,687	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	Susan ruhe is a professor of history at Brigham Young University

EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:16,415	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	It really took on an overtly political Town especially in its early days
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:19,743	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	And they were actually other black travel guides

EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,215	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	In each City
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,007	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	They were much
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:33,055	| 99pi-0201-thegreenbook-1 |	More attuned with civil rights
