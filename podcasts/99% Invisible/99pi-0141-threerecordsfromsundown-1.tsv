EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:50,335	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	He was so shy as a performer
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,639	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	When the circumstances
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,151	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Right
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:59,039	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And the only certainty that I remember most clearly as being right was
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:06,463	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Unscramble convention play the Festival Hall and his ride your Matic because they had a car accident the drummer been killed

EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,911	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Nick came out
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:16,959	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Didn't say anything

EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:31,295	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Play It Again already gave a big ovation
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,087	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Got an encore at the end
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,135	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And I thought
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:36,927	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	He's going to work
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,303	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Can you send him out on his own
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:47,935	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	You know Anna is a student union for kids bar the back
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:54,847	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Doesn't say anything no jokes has no chance
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:11:01,247	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Take me to Guitar Picks fights on time and he just has little intern
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:07,391	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Between songs he lost everybody
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,119	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,703	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Already stopped performing live
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:25,311	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And there was no other way in England those days you really break an artist
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:26,335	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	The middle Zedd

EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,863	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Difficult to remember
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:53,215	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	There wasn't really a template for doing this kind of record
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:57,823	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Record a singer with strings or with
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:00,895	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Larger orchestral arrangement
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,711	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	But not in a pump way
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:07,295	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	It was a kind of dry Ash intimate
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,575	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Sound on The Voice and
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,647	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And doing it so tasteful way
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:14,207	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Would not tell me they've been done much
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:16,511	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:21,631	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	We already tried one arranger the guy who worked on the James Taylor record

EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,007	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Just didn't work at all
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:29,055	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:33,407	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And Nixon said well I have this friend in Cambridge
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:34,687	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Robert Kirby
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:41,087	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And I went up to Cambridge to meet Kirby you know and I was a bit freaked out because I thought Nick is world-class
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,903	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	So we want the best
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:47,999	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	You want world is top Ranger London whoever it is will spend the money will get the guy
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:51,071	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And Nicholson will actually
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,607	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Let's try my friend in Cambridge
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,655	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	It's 19 years old
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:58,495	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And I think oh no no no I don't
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:07,199	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	But I would have met him and I just like the way they were together in the way my life Roberts and he seemed to
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:09,247	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Really really love Nick and his music
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:11,551	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	I just felt okay let's just go with this
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:17,695	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And so we did this procession in the first track they did was way too blue which I had never heard because you didn't
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,719	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	A way to play it to me
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:22,303	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,119	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	I suppose I could have gone down into the room
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:28,447	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And just listen but I tended to
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:34,591	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	You know that John would be the guy running around moving microphones and messing around in the studio and I sat in the control room
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:39,199	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Besides it was a climb you know the scrotum is upstairs
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:44,831	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Anyway, we down all it back up again so I was just sitting up there reading my paper and listening to
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:50,207	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	There were strings rehearse and you'd hear them John would focus on
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:57,119	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	One microphone another microphone and another microphone try to get that thing go downstairs move the microphone will the
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:14:03,519	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Chairs around active hearing these bits and pieces of this thing and send it to me
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:07,359	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	I couldn't figure out what it really did sound like
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:14,783	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And then finally got everybody in position and John got his sound he water and every microphone every
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:17,599	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Part of the six piece string string ensemble
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,391	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:22,463	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And then he just pushed all the fighters
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,303	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	We listen to this whole thing
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:33,471	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And I just oh my God
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:39,615	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Don't you have a while to show
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:52,671	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	A way to find somebody tell me

EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:23,135	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Have you seen the light I thought mommy made the record oh my God the critics going to love this is so awesome but we're
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:25,183	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	We're going to get headlines
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,743	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Melody Maker said
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:32,607	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	It was an awkward mixture of folk and cocktail jazz
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,423	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	So
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,447	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	I don't know
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,727	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	It seems very sad
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:42,591	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	What you

EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:31,743	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Strike back into the studio

EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,847	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	When approached
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:47,615	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Nick a lot
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:48,639	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	The first
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,431	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Leonard Cohen album
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:54,015	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Which I thought John Simon did a great job of producing
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:56,063	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:59,903	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	One of the songs I love it was so long Marianne
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:05,279	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	He has these girls mocking his line
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:08,095	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Hircine behind him against him
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:09,631	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Any kind of
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:15,007	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Contrast in the air brassiness to his delicacy
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:32,927	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And when he played me
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:35,487	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Korbel originally when he played it to me
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:39,839	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	That Chorus Line old pool boy so sorry for himself
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:42,911	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	He sang
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:49,311	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	And I said I just had this idea right away I said Nick let's
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:55,711	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Get some girl singer to sing that long when you answer at the end of them
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:18:02,111	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	He kind of looked at me funny like you sure
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:08,255	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	I said yes I'm sure okay
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:35,903	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	John Wooden I learned recording Nick very quickly that you just turn Nick off
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:36,927	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	In the markets
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:41,023	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	His next performance is always
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,047	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Great
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:46,911	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	You know you when we would record Nick with
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:51,007	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Strings or Rhythm Section or or whatever
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:59,455	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Even if it was out of the room and when he recorded with strings he recorded in the room and it's different from the way people do things today
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:05,855	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Trackside River man that's not an overdub string section and that's Nick singing and playing

EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:37,855	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Get a gray tank from strings or the brass the Rhythm Section or whoever the
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:44,255	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	The weakest link is you don't even have to listen to me then you listen
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:50,655	| 99pi-0141-threerecordsfromsundown-1 |	Always
