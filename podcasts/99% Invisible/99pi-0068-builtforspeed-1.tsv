EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:08,352	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	I'm Roman Mars
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:15,776	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	I want you to conjure an image in your mind of the White Stripes
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:22,176	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Not those white stripes but the White Stripes that divide the lanes of traffic going in the same direction on a major
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:27,552	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	How long are the stripes you can spread your arms out if you want to
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:34,208	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Over the course of many years of psychology researcher named Dennis Shaffer at Ohio State
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:37,280	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Costumes from many different parts the country
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:38,304	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	This question
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:40,352	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	And the most common response was
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:40,864	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Two feet
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:44,960	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	So do you like most people you estimated that those white stripes are 2 ft long
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:46,240	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Maybe a little more
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:47,520	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	But if you did
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:49,824	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	You be very very wrong
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:51,616	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	This is Tom and Jerry
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:54,176	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	When was Tom Vanderbilt summer writer in New York
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:57,760	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	And author of traffic why we drive the way we do
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:59,552	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	And what it says about us
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:05,440	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Every three pages of Tom's terrific book traffic I can probably turn into a 99percentinvisible episode
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:06,464	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	But back to the highway
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:13,376	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	What early on in my research I was talking to a highway engineering if your car is ever broken down on the side
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:17,216	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Are the road if ever been to force to get out of your vehicle
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:23,616	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	On a highway just take a moment to notice what a strange landscape it is you're having a stent in your
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:24,640	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Road sign
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:26,688	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Is there a huge they're not meant to be
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:31,296	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Experience as humans on foot they're meant to be experienced at 75
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:36,416	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Miles an hour with the Clearview typeface perfectly visible retro-reflective
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,696	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	And then there are the whites tree
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:40,256	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	You actually kind of got out of your car
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:42,048	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	And were able to walk on a closed Highway
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:44,352	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Walk from one end of those
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:47,424	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Stripes to the other you can find that
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:49,216	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	And I mean years ago United States
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:52,288	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Highway standard was 15 feet long
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,080	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Which is longer than
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,104	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Cartel
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:03:00,736	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Current Federal Highway Administration guidelines suggest a length of 10 feet with 30 ft between the dash
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:03,040	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	That's something that that is shocking to people
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:06,880	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	And remember most people in the Schaefer study said that those stripes
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:09,440	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Or two feet long that's such a vast
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,464	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Golf there between
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,048	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	You know that there are
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:14,816	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	If I see without them
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:16,864	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Margin of error going to sing
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:24,544	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	And it goes back to this fundamental point that when you're in a car at high speeds you're experiencing only a sin
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,312	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Of the landscape
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:27,360	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Rather than the actual answer
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:30,176	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	This kind of sense the landscape has been presented to you
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:37,344	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	To make you feel comfortable and to make a highway work at what are wheelie evolutionarily
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:40,416	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Ridiculous speeds for a human to travel
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,440	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	You have this big
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:44,256	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Flat wide open no kind of stretch of road that
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:47,584	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	You even if you have a 65 mile-an-hour sign
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:51,680	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	The message of the road is telling you something entirely different and I think
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:55,520	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Especially where a lot of our Behavior comes from
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,568	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Speeding willful
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:59,360	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	La breaking but a lot of it is just
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:03,456	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	People are paying attention to the visual messaging the road not to their speedometer
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:07,040	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Long dividing lines in clearvista
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,088	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Give the illusion
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:11,392	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	That you're going at a reasonable speed
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:13,696	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	As soon as something encroaches into view
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:15,488	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	You get a sense of how fast you're going
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,280	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	That's one reason why those
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:19,839	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Temporary concrete walls that Cruz put up
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:22,143	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Right next to the road during construction
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,935	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Are so unnerving
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:27,007	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	The air in perception of white stripe length
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:29,311	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Is attributed to the fact that when we drive
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:30,847	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	We tend to look
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:32,127	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	So far ahead
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:35,199	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	That we usually only experience the dashes in gaps
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:38,527	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	When are very far away in an angle where they look shorter
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:41,855	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	But there's no consensus as to why people all over the country
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:44,415	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	We're so consistently wrong
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,695	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	With the two Fiesta

EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,447	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Does White Stripes information
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:02,591	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	I don't want to leave you with the impression that the Y dividing lines are UNIF
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:05,151	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	You won't find Juno 10-foot
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:05,919	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Highway lines
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:08,479	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	San Jose Boulevard in New York City
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:12,575	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	And you probably won't find 10 or 15 foot stripes on Bridges or Highway on-ramp
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,623	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Or let's hope you don't do that soon

EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:42,271	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Paying the price
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,319	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Right now and some
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,599	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Suburban environments where you find these
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:48,415	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Arterial highways that were built
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:50,719	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Almost to Highway engineering standards
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:52,255	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Again these long sight lines

EDL	00:05:54,303	00:06:00,191	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	We go fast and then we went and built all kinds of development along those arterial highways was never really supposed to be there
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:05,567	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	But with so many people driving on these roads they became absolutely irresistible to,

EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,103	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Potential at a crash
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:39,871	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Could happen
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:40,383	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Through
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,431	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Again through lack of obstacles
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,223	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	You know General sightlines all these rich
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,271	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Crushed it happened
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:46,783	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Mitigate
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,319	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	The effects
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:50,623	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Survive what would happen to not punish the driver
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:53,439	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	For the mistake that he will inevitably make
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,743	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	According to language in the time
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:59,583	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	So you see that nowadays in things like in California will have your
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,375	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Guardrails that are
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,655	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Wire guard rails that
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:04,447	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Car strikes
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:05,983	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	That guardrail at 10
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:06,751	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	The catch
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,775	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	On the guardrail rather than
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:08,543	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Bounce back
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,311	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Backing out into traffic
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,383	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Another series of collisions
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:17,759	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	So this forgiving road is a positive thing in terms of good safety engineering
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:23,391	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	But they were they were so seduced by it that the call was made to bring it into the even the Surface Street Network
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:28,511	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	So things like Street trees began to be deemed a hazard
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:30,559	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Buy Engineers just outright hazard
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:34,399	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	That makes sense on a high-speed country road but
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:36,447	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	If you're talking about a residential street
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:38,751	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	We're not supposed to be going more than 25 anyway
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:42,591	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Is the presence of a street tree on the side of the road where it's providing
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:46,943	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Shade and Comforts pedestrian snow is that the same sort of Hazard is it even a hazard at all
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:49,247	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	The conclusion many planners
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,295	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Trees are a hazard
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:52,575	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Define pre-war suburbs
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,367	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	You have a son you have the
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:54,879	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	The street
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:57,183	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Set of trees and then
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:57,695	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	The sidewalk
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:01,279	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Post-war the Starship again happen where
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,583	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Trees removed on the other side of the sidewalk
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:07,679	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Suddenly pedestrians were put into the position of being the buffer
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,703	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Between drivers
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:11,007	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	And those menacing trees
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:14,847	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	As you move those trees away
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:16,383	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	The visual sensation of the road
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:17,663	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Became wider
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,455	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	And if there's one
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:25,855	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Iron law of traffic engineering it gets into this visual perception thing as well as the wider a road is or
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:29,695	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Is perceived to be the faster driver speed dance in Grease
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:31,231	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Of course you know the final if you look at
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:37,887	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Suburbia that they just kind of eliminated the sidewalk in the trees
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,167	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	All together
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:39,679	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	The final
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:40,703	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Final solution
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:48,383	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	And Tom Vanderbilt size you can almost data subdivisions development based on that shift
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:58,111	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Road engineering is that humans tend to consume
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:58,879	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Extra
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:01,951	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Engineering measures have been built in for their safety
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,791	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Much in the same way I like to draw the analogy with
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:10,143	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	So the research has been done on food packaging by by Brian wanzek

EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:17,311	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	I just ran over people large buckets of popcorn
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:20,383	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Filled to the top with popcorn to get them a smaller

EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:24,479	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Don't don't just eat more of a larger pack
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:27,039	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	It's whether there it has nothing to do with their level of hunger it's just
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:28,319	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	The size of the package
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,367	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Influences their behavior

EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:39,327	| 99pi-0068-builtforspeed-1 |	Time to consume a lot of the extras getting us back to this kind of
