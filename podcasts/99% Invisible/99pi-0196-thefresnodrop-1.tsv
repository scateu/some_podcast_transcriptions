EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:14,496	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	In September 1958 Bank of America decided to try and except
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:18,592	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	One that would have far-reaching effects on our lives and on the account
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:23,968	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	They decided after careful consideration to conduct this experiment in Fresno California
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:25,760	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The thinking was
EDL	00:01:25,760	00:01:27,808	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	No one was paying much attention to Fresno
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:29,088	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The plan failed
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:30,624	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	It wouldn't get a lot of media attention
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:33,440	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Dangerous low back down here
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:37,024	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Fresno was not the big metropolitan area is today
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:39,072	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	That's Joseph Russo
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:41,120	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	My name is Joseph Russo
EDL	00:01:41,120	00:01:44,704	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	I work with Bank of America since 1956

EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:50,848	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Started off as a teller and worked our way up
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,640	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	As most of us
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,408	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Young

EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,992	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Joseph was there when all this went down
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:02:00,064	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And so in September of 1958
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:03,904	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Bank of America sent out 60000 pieces of mail to people in Fresno

EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:11,328	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And that
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:16,448	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	He's talking about the credit card that's reporter Nate Berg here to tell you when I'm talking
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:21,824	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Bank of America had recruited about 300 merchants in Fresno to accept this new payment
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:25,920	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And they asked employees like Joseph two-hand credit cards out
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,944	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The people they knew
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:31,296	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	We did we pass around our friends and you know the neighbors that's about it
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:32,832	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	But that's for Joseph
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:35,648	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	He was skeptical about using a credit card himself
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:40,000	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Be honest with you I don't remember if I took your car drive better in order
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:42,560	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	If I waited a couple years
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:44,096	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	But dog
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:47,168	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	As a bank riding reap leaving credit myself
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:49,728	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Minot
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:54,080	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Well you have to pay back interest and I don't like giving money away
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,128	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Joseph wasn't alone
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:59,968	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The whole town of Fresno was a bit nervous about this new credit
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,480	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Card system
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:03,040	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The concept of credit wasn't new
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,320	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	But it never been done
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:04,832	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Quite like that
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:11,232	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Going back in to say the 1800s early 1900s you had
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:15,072	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Credit with a store or some kind of a business
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:18,656	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	It was just kind of a ledger book type of thing
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,192	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	This is Ken hallenbeck
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,728	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	He's a numismatist
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:23,264	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	A numismatist
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:26,080	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	That is someone who studies or collects currency
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:30,176	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Not just coins but it's paper money medals tokens
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:34,784	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Anything that some money or money substitute can is retired now
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:35,808	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Who used to work
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,112	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The American numismatic Association
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:39,648	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	New Miss Matic
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:42,208	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	So back in the late 1800s
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:45,536	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Every place from the Corner Bar to the local pharmacy
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,584	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The allowed patrons to keep open tab
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:53,728	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Big record everything in a ledger book and allow their customers to charge of a bill that they typically pay back
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:54,240	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	At the end of the month
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:57,568	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	For businesses this was an accounting nightmare
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:02,688	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Stores could have hundreds of accounts billing tabs for a dollar here and
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:03,968	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Dollar there
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:04,736	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And with each
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:08,064	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Chart a shopkeeper would have to haul out a ledger book
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:11,136	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And look up a customers records just to complete a transaction
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:17,024	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Eventually store owners cut down on some of the paperwork by assigning customers account numbers
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,839	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Which state would inscribe on little token
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:26,495	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Most of them are round or oval a hole in them and they had a number on him and that was your account number
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:30,079	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Kim has a collection of a few dozen of these old credit
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:32,895	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Many dating back to the early 20th century
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:35,455	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	I have one here at
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,991	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Pocahontas
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,527	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Pioneer
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,319	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Garage
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:42,111	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	But it has a head of an Indian on it
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:46,207	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And in the back it has a number 839
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:49,279	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	After credit tokens came something called charge of
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:52,095	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	They look like little dog tags for the Army
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:54,911	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	They were metal and had your name and information imprinted on
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:05:00,031	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Shopkeepers could make an impression of your personal information directly onto the bill
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:02,079	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Instead of having to write it all down
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:07,199	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The more accounts you had the more charger plates and tokens you had to carry around with you
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:10,783	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	It still wasn't a great system for the retailer or the customer
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:17,439	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	So in 1949 a New York businessman named Frank X McNamara
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:19,999	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Came up with an idea for a single charge
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:22,559	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Card that could be accepted at multiple established
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,351	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	He called it
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,119	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The diners
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:29,983	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Club card and with it you can make charges at a number of New York restaurants and hotels
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:32,031	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	But unlike the credit card of today
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:35,615	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	You could only use your Diners Club card in certain places
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:38,175	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The idea caught on someone
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:41,247	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	About 20000 people signed up mostly businessman
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:45,343	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	It wasn't a smash success but still the bank started to see an opportunity
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,647	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	So you have this
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:49,695	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Giant change taking place
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:56,607	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Right around and especially in the aftermath of World War II in the American economy was the basically

EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:19,391	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	There was suddenly things they wanted to buy

EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:22,719	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Or as

EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:29,631	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	You could buy things there and pay your bill at the end of the month
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:36,543	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	We didn't have an account with a store you'd have to go to a bank and get a traditional loan for any relatively large

EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:58,303	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Consumer and for the bank
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,399	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Bank of America wanted to find an easier way to make

EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:05,727	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Was
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,775	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	In the 1950s.

EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,335	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The bank and then I
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:14,431	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Bank of America really believed in the idea that
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,711	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Would grow
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,223	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	By helping consume
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:21,599	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	So it was Bank of America that decided that they would basically give clients a car
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,135	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Did they can put in their pockets
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:25,951	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	That would give them roughly a $500 line of credit
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:31,839	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Unlike the Diners Club Bank of America one of their customers to be able to use their card anywhere
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:33,119	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Not Justa restaurant
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:40,031	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And where the Diner's Club had to be paid off within 60 days Bank of America would allow its customers to pay them back whenever they
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:40,799	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	They wanted
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:43,615	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	They called her new credit card the BankAmericard

EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:52,319	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	You didn't have to get a bank or to approve your purchase
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:54,879	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And you didn't have to pay the bank back by any specific time
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:57,439	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	They called this revolving credit
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:00,511	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The card was essentially an instant loan
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:03,071	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Of course it was a loan with an interest rate attached
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,375	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	This was one of the
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,655	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Profound shift
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:09,215	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And the way people handle money
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,263	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Instead of it the banker being
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,031	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	In control
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,103	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Your money
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:17,407	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Upsetting the terms
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,431	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	For how you dealt with your money
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	With a credit card
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:21,759	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	You were the one setting the
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:26,367	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And you were the one making the decisions about what to do with your money
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:30,719	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Now all Bank of America had to do was convince retailers to
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:32,511	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Accept credit cards as payment
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,535	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	It convinced people
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,047	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The user
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,887	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Now because they were a new invention
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:40,447	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And because people didn't really know what they were
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:42,239	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And because there were no laws
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,263	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Surrounding
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:43,775	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Credit cards
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,335	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The way they tested the car
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,895	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Was they simply sent a mailing
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:51,455	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	To basically every Bank of America customer
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:53,759	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	In Fresno California which brings us back
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:54,271	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	To Fresno
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,807	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	They called it
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,087	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The Fresno drop
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:02,975	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Bank of America mailed out 60000 credit cards all over the
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:06,047	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Fresno had become a laboratory
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,839	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	For the future of personal finance
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:14,751	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The Fresno drop was supposed to be a controlled experiment with a bank could test the concept in work out any kinks
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:18,847	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	But within just a few months of the Fresno credit card drop
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:23,967	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Bank of America's Got word that one of its competitors in California was planning a similar program
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:26,271	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	So Bank of America quickly expand
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:31,135	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Mass Millions went out in the Central Valley Cities of Modesto and Bakersfield
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:35,231	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The bigger cities of Sacramento San Francisco and Los Angeles
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:38,047	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Within 10 months of the Fresno drop
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:41,631	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	More than a million BankAmericard have been mailed out across California
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:45,215	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Once the cards have begun saturating the bigger cities
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:54,687	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	People would go around to mailboxes in the suburbs and steal cars out of on days when the new
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,711	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The car tripping dropped
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The system was being abused
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:01,855	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	But the system was also randomly mailing out pre-approved
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,623	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Credit card
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:06,719	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Is that allowed anyone to buy it to $500 of whatever they wanted
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:09,535	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	No dead people get in car dogs will get in cards
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:12,095	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	It was just very very willy-nilly
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:16,191	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Despite these Mass mailings the cards didn't catch on right away
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,983	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	It was hard to convince stores to accept
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:21,055	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	They had to pay a percentage of the sale to the bank
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,335	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	It was hard to get custom
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:22,847	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	First used
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:27,455	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And when people did start using the cards they didn't always pay the money back
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:29,247	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Which was a bit of a surprise to Bank of a
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:33,343	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	People that mostly been pretty good about paying back traditional loans
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:37,695	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And what they forgot was in those days when you made a loan
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:43,839	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The customer look the banker in the eye in the bank or look the customer in the eye and they both had this kind of relationship
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:47,167	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And the customer would not want to let the bank or down
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:51,007	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Whereas with the credit card it was an anonymous thing
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:55,871	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And this one in four people weren't paying their credit card debt
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,175	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	In 1959
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:01,503	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	About a year after Bank of America did their first mass mailing in front
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:04,831	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	They mailed out more than 2 million Bank of America
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:08,415	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	But they hadn't made a single Cent lyrics pyramid
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,183	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The fact
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:10,975	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	They lost about 20 million dollars
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,767	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Until the bank
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,047	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Started making a few changes
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,631	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	They really start to think about it differently
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,911	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Bank of America setup
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,935	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The collections department
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:24,799	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	People who weren't paying their bills Heather cards revoked
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:27,103	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The government also started to regulate the credit card act
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:32,991	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	In 1968 the truth in Lending Act made it illegal to mail out credit cards to people who've never asked
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:35,039	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	From that point onward
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:37,087	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Instead of getting a card
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:41,183	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	In the mail you got instead of solicitation to apply for a card
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,719	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Which
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:44,511	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	It's in one form or another existed
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:47,071	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The stack it wasn't until 1961
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:50,143	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	3 years after the Fresno drop
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:52,959	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The Bank of America actually turned a profit
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:53,983	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	On their crazy credit
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,543	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	1968
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:59,615	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	They were making about 13 million dollars a year
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:02,943	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The Bank of America system which became a nationwide system
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,479	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Eventually became known as Visa
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,527	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	And the other card
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:11,391	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	That had competed with Bank of America they also Consolidated and they became Massacre
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:15,999	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The major credit card companies now make lots and lots
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,047	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Lots of money
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:18,559	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Every year
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:19,839	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Which is great
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,119	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	For that
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,143	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Maybe not so great
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:22,655	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	The rest of us
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:27,263	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Today over 70% of American adults have at least one credit card

EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:36,223	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	In 2009 more credit card reform was passed
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:39,039	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	It prevents arbitrary interest hikes
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:43,391	| 99pi-0196-thefresnodrop-1 |	Stop credit card companies from specifically marketing to college kids
