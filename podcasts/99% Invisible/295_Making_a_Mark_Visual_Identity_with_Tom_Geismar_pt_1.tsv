EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,336	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Their branches they were everywhere so
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:28,896	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	The idea that you could establish something
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:31,712	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Don't you be abstract as their mark
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:35,040	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	What channel is the Red Cross or Mercedes
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:39,648	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Chevrolet that mean there are some around there were some of the time
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:42,720	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	But not many at all
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:44,000	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And that was the idea
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,536	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	We can do that
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,816	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Stop for something
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:50,400	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That was bold and that would be recognized as representing the bank
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:57,056	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And so how did you come up with the shape like what were the drawings like what were you thinking when that shape was
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:58,080	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Applying to Chase
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:03,456	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	But we weren't something bold something to stand out something that could be reproduced
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:06,272	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	In various materials
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:08,576	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Something that could work at a small size
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:13,440	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Turn up the time is very important also that's something that could work in black and white in the newspaper
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:16,256	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	There was no color printing in newspapers at that time
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:22,143	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Something that could work on television but also in a letterhead or a formal announcement
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:22,911	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So we
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,447	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Try to keep all those things
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:29,055	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	In mind we looked at a number of different designs this particular one
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:32,127	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	It's also quite similar to
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:34,431	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Old Chinese coins
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:38,271	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	They were rectangular they had a hole in the middle
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,807	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And someone in that was
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:42,367	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Helpful in terms of rationalizing
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:44,159	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Why that particular design
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:45,695	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And so
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,999	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	In Rockefeller was
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,559	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Turn on your side in this but
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,607	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Did they expect something quite so
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:57,983	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Dynamic and radical in Revolutionary or they expecting something more akin to the
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:02,079	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Map of United States and the globe and the world banking
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:04,383	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Word on top of them what were they expecting
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:11,295	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Well you say they David Rockefeller certainly went along with this idea but the two
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,319	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Do people above him
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:16,671	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	John McCloy the chairman and George Champion the president
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,951	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	We're pretty shocked
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,511	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Women that when we showed it to them
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:24,607	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Championship why can't we just have a picture of the building
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:27,679	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Or the sculptures were going to have out front

EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:32,543	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	We tried to persuade him that was a bad idea
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:35,359	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Helen McCrory eventually said
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:38,687	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	David we've given you this project
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,711	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	If you want this
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:41,503	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	For the
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:47,391	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Retail Bank you can do it but I don't want to see it on my letterhead I don't want to see at my office
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:50,719	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	I don't want to see it I really don't understand it and don't like it
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:54,815	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Soon thereafter they adopted it and
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:57,119	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	The bank went ahead and did it and it was only
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,423	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	6 months later
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:03,775	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That we were down there and ran into McCoy in the hallway
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:05,055	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:10,431	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Barry was with a tie with a symbol on it with cufflinks with the symbol on it
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:12,991	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	With a pin in his lapel with a symbol on it
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,807	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So it was a great lesson to us because
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:18,879	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Suddenly someone who couldn't understand it
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:20,927	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	As an abstract design
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:23,743	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Now really accepted it
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,791	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	As a representation of
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,839	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	His his company
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:31,167	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So you mentioned the lessons of McCoy
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,703	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Employee
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,471	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	On board
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,007	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	With the mark
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:37,055	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	As soon as it became the mark of his bank
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,639	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Expand on what some of those lessons are and how you
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:42,687	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Use them to think about your work
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:44,223	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Today in and how you deal with client
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:47,039	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Well I think that's a big lesson
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:49,087	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And we learn then was that
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:55,231	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	What people react to is not the more but they react to is the institution that it represents
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,791	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So if you ask people
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:00,095	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Yo what do they think are good marks
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,375	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	They will
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,655	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Almost inevitably
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,447	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Mention
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:07,775	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Companies or institutions or whatever that they think highly of
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:13,663	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So they'll often say apple and others that they think highly of
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:16,479	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Dilemmas never say Imran for example
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,551	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Even though Enron had a very
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,319	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Good
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:20,831	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Mark
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:24,159	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Designed by a famous designer Paul Rand
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:28,511	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Nothing to do with the quality pretty much it has to do with what it represents
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:32,351	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So the chase logo with something that's from the ground up
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:34,143	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	A brand new invention
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,959	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	It's also done an umbrella I got a patient's and
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:38,495	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	An update since
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:41,311	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Was one of you talk about the PBS logo which is something that
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:42,079	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	I think a lot of
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:43,103	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	People are familiar with
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,663	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	What that process was like and then what you were trying to do there
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:51,807	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	You're very often we will try and build on something that's there if it has real real value
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:54,623	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And in the case of PBS
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,903	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	There was a
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,207	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	The problem
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:58,719	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:01,279	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	They and the station
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:03,327	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Where is public broadcasting stations
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:08,191	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	At the time people presumed it was the public broadcasting system
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:12,799	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	The way CBS is the Columbia broadcasting system it's on
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:17,407	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	At CBS you know they have a number of owned stations and whatever
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:20,991	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	End of the issue was that actually
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:23,039	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	The stations
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:26,623	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Had complete responsibility for raising their own funds
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,903	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	To keep in business
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:29,183	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And PBS is not a
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:33,023	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Conglomerate that supplies funding and someone
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,303	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Verizon programming
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:37,887	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	But not finding any people misperceived
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:41,471	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	What PBS was in there and their logo
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,007	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Was a very clever
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:46,079	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	PBS where the P was a person
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:48,639	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Service silhouetto of a man
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:50,175	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:53,247	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	The idea was could we do something
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:56,831	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That makes it clear that does public television
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,623	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Not some kind of
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,135	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Network
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:05,023	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So or I thought was actually at the time to take that P
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,071	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That they had out of the PBS
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:11,167	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Turn around 30 gave me lobotomy
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,191	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:16,287	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Pick some up a bit and then repeat it so that was the idea of multiple
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,311	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	People is in
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,591	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That was public TV
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:22,175	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	But that was the whole reason to do it but again it got filled
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,223	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	On something that existed
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:27,039	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	A part of the letter so it was no great
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,343	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Radical change
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:32,159	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	At the time but it was something more appropriate
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:34,207	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And something to solve a problem
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,487	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	To how do you
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,279	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Steer a client to select
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:39,583	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Name of the shape in the idea that in your heart
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:45,983	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	You really know is the right one like how many options do you give them but I'll need variations do you present is there a psychology
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,263	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	In presenting a logo
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:47,775	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	2 group
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:50,079	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Will today
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,383	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	We do want to prevent
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:53,919	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Options we almost
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,455	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Almost always do
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:59,039	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Because there is not necessarily one right answer
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,855	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	For these issues
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:04,671	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	It's just you're having to make a decision and go ahead with it
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:11,071	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	But we you know explain what the pluses and minuses are of the various options
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:15,935	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And you often have a favored which we try to push if we had
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:18,239	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Butters
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:20,543	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	There's not necessarily a computer
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,591	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	The obvious
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,359	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Right
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:23,871	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Answer
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,175	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And when you have a favorite.
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:31,807	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Give me state that it's your favorite or do you just presented first or presented last is there a
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,855	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Engagement ship in this at all
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:37,183	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	There may be a little bit but not
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:39,231	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Not that much and we don't usually state
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:42,559	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Which one we favor for showing options
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:44,863	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	But we encourage them to ask us
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:48,447	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	A later and we try to also get there
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:50,751	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Take out in one of the first things we say
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:55,615	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Actually when we're before we presented anything is it's never love at first sight
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:11:02,015	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So it's your thing is if you can imagine what it might be like it actually use
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:05,087	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And that's what we try to show when where showing
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:06,623	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Designs
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,647	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Have to be marks
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:11,743	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	What it might look like in various appropriate to kind of use
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:18,911	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So I see the chase logo on my iPhone it works really well as an app icon it is that a coincidence or something
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:24,031	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Has made it indoor over 50 years in in in Brooks on a tiny screen as well as a
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:26,847	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Trinidad and other tie tack and everything
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:32,735	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Well it is a coincidence but it happens to work very much in our favor because we've always tried to do things
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:38,623	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That are very clear very simple and that can be reduced to a small size
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:42,463	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So suddenly today it's a it's a requirement
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:47,327	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Really have almost every Mark that has any kind of social exposure
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,119	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And it does work well
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:56,031	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And it just happens I think maybe our approach was the right approach and we were lucky
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:12:00,383	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That it certainly applicable today and looked like a lot of work we get
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:02,431	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Today is because people have
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,967	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Mark's that can't work is it at
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:07,039	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So has the approach
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,831	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	For creating marks
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:10,879	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Changed over 60 years in
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:13,695	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Because of this or there are there other things that
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:17,279	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Are more fundamental in the in the change in the work that you guys do
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:20,095	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	You don't actually hasn't
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:23,679	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Change that much at least our approach to it hasn't changed that much
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:26,495	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Is that say mention we try to
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:28,543	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Really
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,079	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Get down to the basics
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:33,151	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Sing a basic Mark that can identify
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:37,247	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Whatever the institution is that we're identifying in a clear way
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:41,343	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And we have three criteria really which are the basic criteria
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,135	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That one is that at
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,927	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Be appropriate
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:45,951	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	You would do something
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:50,559	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Sports team that would be quite different for something you do for a bank for example
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,863	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	It'd be appropriate to
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,143	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	To the client
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,935	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	In to enter what they do
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:59,007	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Second one would be that'll be distinctive
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:12:59,519	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:04,127	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	You can see it you can remember it you can recognize it
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:05,407	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Maybe you can doodle it
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:10,271	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Quickly after having seen it a couple times
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:12,575	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Set that it that it will stand out
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:13,599	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And be recognized
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:18,207	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And then the third thing is just that it works in all kinds of sizes
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:23,071	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Different materials and so on if that's appropriate and it often is
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:26,143	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So if you can meet those three
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,935	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Criteria
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,471	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Then we're doing pretty well
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,263	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	How do you balance
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:33,823	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	The concept of being appropriate
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,871	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Towards a certain Institution
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:38,175	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And it being abstract enough
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,199	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	2
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:41,503	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	You know be this empty vessel that
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,039	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Rapport meaning into
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,599	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Well it doesn't have to be
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:49,183	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	An empty vessel that all it doesn't have to be abstract
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:51,231	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	For banking that window
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:54,303	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	We couldn't think of anything that's good
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:58,655	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Trappa lyrics persons banking but that's not always the case by any means
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,191	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	I mean if there is something
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:03,775	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Real that's appropriate than you try to work
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,359	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Understandable
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:12,991	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That's a lot easier for people to understand the other thing is that once we did the Chase Bank
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,271	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Mark
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:17,599	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Thanks rollover infect people over started using
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:24,511	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Making abstract sense because they didn't have anything like the exposure
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,815	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Dr. Chase
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:30,911	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That kind of thing only works really well if you
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:34,751	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	I'll have enough exposure that people come to recognize it
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,031	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Brian
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:36,799	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Rhino that makes
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,847	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Example I know that
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:40,383	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Your
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,919	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Group is responsible for a lot of
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,455	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Aquarium logos and those are
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:48,063	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	You know that they have nice shapes to them in their abstracted in certain ways but
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:53,695	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Waves and fish and things that you recognized as the things that that it represents as an aquarium
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:56,767	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Yes and I actually will those aquariums
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:15:03,167	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	They will have different emphasis in terms of the concept of the building and and the
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,191	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	He said that since I won
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:08,031	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And so we're even trying to represent that obviously fish
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,335	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And water are
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,871	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Key part of all of them
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,943	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	But summer about the oceans and summer about
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:16,991	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Freshwater and so on
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,783	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	You talk about
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:20,575	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	You know how you decide
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,087	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Nearest
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:23,391	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	In the very beginning stages
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,159	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Of working
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:24,671	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	The client
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:26,463	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Whether or not you're going to
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,743	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Do some kind
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:28,511	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Wordmark
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,279	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That uses
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,559	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	The company's name or
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:31,583	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Something more abstract
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,375	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Pictorial
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,143	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	How do you
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:34,911	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Make that up
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:39,007	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Well that's what was the key decisions
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:42,079	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	We don't surely make the decision
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:46,431	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	We we might show you both options for example
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:49,247	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And what the pluses and minuses are
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:50,015	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Proposed
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:53,343	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Two things that depends of course and put the name is to begin with
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:16:00,255	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	But generally if the name is is short and I shorted me maybe five letters or something
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:02,047	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Annie's distinctive
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:02,559	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Then
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:05,119	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	We would start with the idea
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,399	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Making that word
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:07,423	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Distinctive
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:12,287	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	I'm doing a lot of work for a lot of technology companies recently added
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:15,103	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	You know what they're
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:21,247	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Doing is pretty hard to understand and serve you very hard to represent in any meaningful way
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:23,551	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	You know it's not as if they're
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:26,879	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	They're harvesting apples or something that you can do Annapolis
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,391	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Whatever
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,951	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	It's extremely difficult
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:30,463	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Go to work
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:32,511	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Find something that's a
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:33,023	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Appropriate
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,327	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Meaningful but also
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:35,839	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Distinctive
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:39,167	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And if so is there a certain thing that you listen
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,959	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	For when somebody describes
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:42,751	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Company describes what they do
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,799	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That is a
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:48,127	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Key into your process of beginning to design something
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:49,151	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	For them or is it too stiff
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,175	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Every time
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:55,551	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Well we go through a whole process of trying to interview a lot of people
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:57,855	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Really trying to understand the culture
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:00,415	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And what they do obviously
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:06,303	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And to understand the competition and Racine with
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:07,583	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Against and
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,375	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Really together
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,143	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Pretty in-depth
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,679	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Understanding
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:14,751	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Of what the situation is in
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:16,799	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	In the process of doing all that
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:17,823	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And interviewing people
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:20,127	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Muffin ideas funny
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,663	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Some funny places come up
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:24,223	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Might be just a wisecracking
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:28,575	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Conversation or something but that's where a lot of the ideas come
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:34,975	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Sue in 1961 you can introduce an octagon and have a pretty simple
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:36,767	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Be bold and be assertive with Chase
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,535	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Because Chase is so big
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:42,399	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Now you know doggone it's closed off you can't put an octagon out there
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,935	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	As an abstract marched
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:45,471	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	You know for a company
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,495	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Is it harder
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:49,823	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Have a bold graphic
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:53,407	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Simple today just because of the number of
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,175	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Shape sorter
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:55,199	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Just limited in the world
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:57,503	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Well it is hard
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:18:00,063	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Chester there are so many and now with
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:06,975	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Little icons and emojis and whatever is just so much so much around so yeah
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:09,023	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Yes it is it is difficult
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:11,839	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	What we do now is before we show anything
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,887	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	To our clients we
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:14,399	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Have
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:17,215	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Done a preliminary legal search
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:18,495	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:20,543	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	We try not to show anything
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:22,591	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	To a client

EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:29,759	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Because we don't want them to fall in love with something and then find out
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:30,783	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	MLB can't use it
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:34,111	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Have you ever fallen in love with something and found out you couldn't use it
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:38,975	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Oh sure we just don't show it
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:43,583	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	I mean very much and one of the one of those
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:46,911	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Complications is of course the things are registered
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:50,239	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Has marks within a certain area of business
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,567	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	For example I want to wake up a week if it's
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,103	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Red star
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:57,919	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So what I mean obviously represents China
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:59,455	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	But it's also Macy's
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:02,271	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Is San Pellegrino it's Heineken
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:07,135	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	It's it's many different things and they're all doing it legally
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:09,183	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	They will have the right to use it
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:10,719	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Another so
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:12,767	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	It's not quite so simple
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:19,167	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So you might have something you come up with it maybe similar to something in a very different field
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:22,751	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And you have to register the mark in particular
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:24,799	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Yeah whatever area business here in
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:27,103	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And so then there's
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:28,895	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That decision to hear do you
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:35,039	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Go ahead presuming it's going to be okay because there's not going to be confusion because you're in a completely different

EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:37,599	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Or not
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:41,439	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Has this method of
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:43,487	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	You know introducing things to the public
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,279	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	That's really change
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,303	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Extend

EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:50,143	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	How do you approach that now in in what do you think of
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,703	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	The Serta Bloodsport of

EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:57,567	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And that kind of thing
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:20:00,895	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Well are you sure recommendation is don't say a word
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:01,919	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Just do it
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:06,527	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	I think if you look at more broadly I think people are much more
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:08,319	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Visually aware
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,879	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Today
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:13,183	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	You're always looking at their phone they're looking at
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,743	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Icons of looking at apps
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:19,327	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	They're looking at all these things in and so it's much more part of the
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,119	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Culture so
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:23,935	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	I think the desire to do something good

EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:30,079	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	The idea being a Critic is
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:30,847	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Is another part of
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:33,663	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	But I think overall
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:35,967	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	It is great that people are much more

EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:20,480	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	They're hard to describe because they look like a spider

EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:35,328	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	They are the immediately set about eating the the eggs
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:41,728	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	All the trophic eggs that their mother has late now spiders and a lot of other Arthur

EDL	00:24:54,528	00:25:00,928	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Is to shed their outer that system is cuticle
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:04,512	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So after their first molt that pretty much out of food
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:07,584	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So they've gone through the
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:10,144	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Trophic eggs that their mother has produced
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,960	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And that's when they do something really
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:13,984	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Kind of strange
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:20,384	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	The mother
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:26,784	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Basically thrums on the web drawing a baby's to R
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:33,184	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	So it looks like she drums on the web it and and they are attracted to that vibration of the web
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:39,584	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And they swarm all over her spiders are all about vibration
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:45,984	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	She basically does as she's plucking on her silk and attracting the youngster
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:52,384	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	First to come to her this is Doctor Linda Ray or

EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:00,832	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	They respond to the movements
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:02,880	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And move in
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:08,000	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Quarter as a group and start feeding and evidently they eat or within the hour
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:14,656	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	How does she get them to eat her do they just know this instincts really that
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:17,728	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	They noticed instinctually
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:24,128	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	What they do is it is basically inject this enzyme Laden
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:27,968	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Got juice and.
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:30,272	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And break down the inside of her body
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:34,880	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	It's almost like they slurp a rock through a straw
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:36,928	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Like a protein milkshake
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:38,720	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Eating her
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:40,256	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	Yeah eating her alive
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,560	| 295_Making_a_Mark_Visual_Identity_with_Tom_Geismar_pt_1 |	And then they
