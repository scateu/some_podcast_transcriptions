EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:29,600	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A few months back we sent producer Emmett Fitzgerald down to Santa Barbara on a really taxing reporting assignment

EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,040	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Something
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:01:59,808	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A little less
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:01,344	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Conventionally attractive
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:03,136	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Right on the horizon line
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:06,464	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That one too

EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:14,912	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Big offshore oil platforms
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:16,192	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	They look like
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:18,752	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Buildings out there floating in the water
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:20,544	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Giant battleships or something
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:24,128	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The prettiest people here
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,152	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Don't love them
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:37,184	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Those oil platforms off Santa Barbara are at the center of a complicated debate going on right now within the environmental community
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:41,280	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	About the relationship between nature and human infrastructure
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:46,656	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Although they have been a source of controversy since they first went in the water back in the 1950s and 60s
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:49,984	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I came to Santa Barbara in 1966
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,776	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	This is Roderick Nash
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:57,664	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Environmental historian who moved to Santa Barbara from New Hampshire to take a job in history department at UCSB
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:01,248	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And it didn't take him long to fall in love with his new home
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:03,040	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I began to realize what
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,320	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	People have told me they said
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:07,136	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Santa Barbara's like the American Riviera
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,416	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	It's kind of a paradise
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,720	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The land of Endless Summer
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:14,816	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But at the time he says there was a sense that this Coastal Paradise
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:16,608	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Sad lucrative tourist economy
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,888	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Was under threat
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,424	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Massive oil rig
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:21,728	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	It's going up all throughout the Santa Barbara Channel
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:23,008	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	They were cries
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:25,312	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	From the people Santa Barbara saying
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:29,152	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Not so fast let's let's think about the consequence
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:34,016	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	We look out at the channel this is the million dollar view this is this is what
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,296	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	How the economy
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:37,088	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And the culture of Santa Barbara is about
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:39,392	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And now suddenly but pretty
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,928	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Offshore oil rig shop
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:44,000	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Up there and we're not so sure that we're protected from
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,024	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Spills
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:48,864	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But at the time there wasn't a whole lot anyone could do
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,656	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	EPA didn't exist yet
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:53,984	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Dor no major environmental regulations in place
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,264	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And so the oil platform
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:59,872	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Went in and they operated without any major spills
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:03,968	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Until January 28th 1969
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:06,016	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I was working on the
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:06,784	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Fourth
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:10,880	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Floor of the El Paseo building that Overlook the ocean
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,160	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	This is Bud bottoms
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:18,559	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Local artists who actually passed away last year this audio is more video interview the bottoms did a few years back
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:24,191	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Back where you describe getting a phone call from a friend who had flown into Santa Barbara earlier that day
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:27,263	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	He was flying over the channel this particular day
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:29,055	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	They saw a big blowout
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,847	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Either there's oil
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:31,615	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	From Eddie V
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,919	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Platform by crazy
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,967	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The whole house. Here is black
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:36,735	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Good morning
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:43,391	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Union oil the owner of the platform in question had failed to build a large enough protective casing for one of its well
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:46,207	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Loyal which was under immense pressure
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:50,303	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Forced its way around the well and erupted to the ocean floor
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:54,143	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	1000 gallons of crude were pouring into the ocean every hour
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:57,215	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Rodger Nash heard about the spill that same day
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:01,567	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But he said it took a little while for the scale of the disaster to really set in
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:04,127	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I can remember walking down to the beach
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,151	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	No change
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:07,455	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	No change and then I walk down to the beach one day
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:10,527	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And it was a black tide there was oil
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,039	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:12,063	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Suddenly
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,855	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The postcard
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,391	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Beaches
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,159	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Santa Barbara
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,183	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	We're black
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:22,047	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Crude oil floats on top of water
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:24,607	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Until this bill was particularly deadly for Sebring
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,911	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Birds that dive into the water to catch fish
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:29,727	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	You go in and your feathers are covered with oil and you can't fly
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,263	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Can you fly
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,031	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Shop help
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:33,055	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Play on the beach
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,847	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	It was an apocalyptic
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:38,687	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Although Nash has the most uncanny thing may have been the
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,455	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Sound
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:40,479	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The waves
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:41,247	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	We're very quiet
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,551	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Because they were loyal
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:45,087	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	They had sort of a mushy sound
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:47,647	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Because what was really breaking was
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:50,207	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	2-3 inches of oil on top of the water
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:51,743	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	We stood there and cried
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:54,559	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I hear grown men and women
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:57,119	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Sitting there crying because the beach was half their life
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:00,191	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	We thought it was all over for us
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:01,983	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But as
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:04,543	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Sad as the 1969 spill was
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,079	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Bud bottoms was
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:06,847	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Mostly just
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,615	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Furious
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:09,407	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I got so angry

EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:11,167	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And removed from the water

EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:56,543	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But in the labs early days he had a really hard time getting grants to fund his fish
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,335	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:01,151	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	In 1995 I was at a
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,199	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	At a low point there was no question
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:03,967	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I had no fun
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,527	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But just when things were at their bleak
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:09,343	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Love got an unexpected phone call
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:12,415	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Iamsymphony says this is Lyman thorsteinson
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:14,719	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I'm from the national biological survey
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:16,767	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Which was a government program in the 90s
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:20,095	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That aim to catalog and describe ecosystems throughout the country
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,887	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And I swear to God this way
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:22,655	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	He said
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,447	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	If you had money
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:26,239	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	For research
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:27,519	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	What would you
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:28,543	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	What would you do
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,079	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	What does knockout signs usually works
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,103	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Nobody
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,895	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Nobody calls
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,943	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And says I have money
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:41,087	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	It's the other way around it's a very dickensian kind of thing it's like you're the little bigger boy you come over and you go like
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,111	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Pizza
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:45,183	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Could I have $100,000 set please
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,767	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Love thought about how to answer this
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:49,535	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Surprise question
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:53,887	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	On something that have been nagging him since he first came to Santa Barbara
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:57,727	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Back in his 20s love you to collect fish for local Aquarium
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:13:02,591	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And one day he and his fishing partner took their little Boston Whaler out to the oil platforms
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,639	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And started fishing around them
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:06,943	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	There is like fish up the wazoo
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:07,967	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:09,503	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	We could have filled up the
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:10,527	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Aquarium with all the fish week
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:13,855	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Ever since then he had wondered what was going on down
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,671	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Who's this dude like
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,463	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Offering me money and I said well
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:20,767	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I'm really interested in these oil platform
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,535	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Forms off here
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:24,351	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Their large structures I'd like to know
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:26,143	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The role that they play as habitat
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:27,679	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	4 fishes and he said oh that sounds
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:28,959	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Interesting
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:32,287	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And so funding in hand Milton love got a team together
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,567	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Rented a small submarine
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,359	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And began to study the Platte
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:37,663	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The first
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,943	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Dive I made in
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:40,223	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	In the submersible
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:42,783	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Was it platform Hidalgo which is located
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:43,807	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Just barely in
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:44,319	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Central Calif
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,111	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Written about
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,391	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	450
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:50,463	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	If you don't water he took the submersible all the way to the bottom
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:52,767	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The pylons reach the seabed
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:55,583	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I was like blown away I didn't actually know what
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,095	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Expect
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:57,887	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And there was a lot of fish
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:01,215	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	In particular schools of adult rockfish
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:03,519	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Were swirling around the base of the plateau
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:08,383	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And as he started making his way up the structure he saw a lot of smaller juvenile
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,175	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And we're talking
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:11,711	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Hundreds of
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:13,759	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Thousands of these young fish
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:16,063	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Bent the metal itself was
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:16,831	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Covered with
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,855	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Colorful invertebrates
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:20,671	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Cstars muscle sponges
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:23,999	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And these little crabs walking all over the struts
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:27,071	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Yeah I'm ever coming back on Deck to the research vessel on
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:27,839	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The hatch pops
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,119	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Everybody's
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:32,191	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	You know all the lab is there and then
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:35,007	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Crew the boats there and they're waiting for me to say something I said
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:36,543	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Yeah this was like
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,055	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I said this
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,335	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Amazing
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:38,847	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Place
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:49,855	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That platform dive was the first of many that Milton love and the other scientists that the love lab would do over the next
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:50,367	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	15 years
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,415	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Love remembers one dive in French
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,439	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Particular from this.
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,231	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Around a platform called
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:55,743	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Gilda
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,791	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	One of his colleagues went down first
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,583	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And when she came back up
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:00,351	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	She said
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,119	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Basically
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:03,167	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That was unbelievable
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:06,239	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The scientists always videotape these Dives
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,775	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Show people who didn't believe them
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:11,103	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And so she played them the recording right there on the boat
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:13,919	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	She put it in there and we're going like oh my God
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:15,967	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That's the most fish we've ever seen
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:16,991	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Around the platform
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:19,807	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Not every trip down with like that
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,831	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	All platforms
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,599	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Different love status
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,135	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Some don't have a lot of
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,439	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	It's always easier to hear
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:31,071	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But often love found that these oil platforms were like a little Oasis of marine life
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,887	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The ocean is a big empty place
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:34,911	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	An animal
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:35,935	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Tend to concentrate
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:36,447	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Around
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:37,727	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Stuff
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:40,287	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The only reason they're there is they like to hang out with
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:40,799	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	What's stuff
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,871	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Many invertebrates need a physical object
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:44,383	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The latch on
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:47,455	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Rockfish want to hide in nooks and
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,479	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Crannies
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:50,271	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Just be around anything with a little structure
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,063	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	They don't care what the
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:53,087	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Structures made out of
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:54,367	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Pipe
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:57,183	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	NBA platform it can be a tiring
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:57,951	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Iraq
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:16:01,279	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Oil platforms are particularly popular structures with the fishes
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:04,095	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Because they have a lot of surface area and complexity
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:07,167	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And they extend hundreds of feet through the water column like a
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,447	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Marine skyscraper
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:10,751	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Rockfish live at different depths
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:11,775	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Throughout their life cycle
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:13,567	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Oil platform the sink
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,591	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Affordable home
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,615	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Profession of all ages
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:17,663	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Younger fish tend to live
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:18,431	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Higher up the platform
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:21,503	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Time After Time Love was Finding
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,015	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Lots of fun
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:23,295	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	There were so many
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,599	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I started thinking like
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:26,879	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	What is this mean
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,391	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Biologic
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:30,975	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Like okay so we're seeing a lot of juvenile fish
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:35,839	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But how important are these platforms really in terms of the overall ecosystem
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:41,471	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The bottom of that love and his team looked at one particular species of rockfish
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:42,751	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Boccaccio
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:44,799	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Yeah I got a big mouth that's what it means
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:46,079	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Italian boccaccio
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:46,847	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Means big mouth
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:49,919	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The boccaccio are heavily fished around Santa Barbara
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:52,223	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Around this time the stock was so depleted
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,271	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Did the government close the fishery
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:58,111	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But would love to the survey of seven different oil platforms
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:01,695	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Victor Solis baby book got you and then we were talking
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,975	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A lot of
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:04,767	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	About 450 thousand
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:08,095	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Put that number in context love called up a scientist
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,119	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The national Marine
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,143	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Fisheries service
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:12,703	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Who is responsible for counting all the boccaccio on the bus
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:13,983	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Coast
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:14,751	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Name is Alex
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,543	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	So I said Alex
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,847	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	We estimated that
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:21,407	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	There were 450000
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,431	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Baby boccaccio
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:24,735	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	At the 7 plus
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,271	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Is that important
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,063	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Cuz you don't like maybe it's not
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:29,343	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I didn't know
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,391	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	So he had a model
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:31,903	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Betty Hughes
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,463	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	So he plugged it in and he came back
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:36,511	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Couple weeks later and he said
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:37,535	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Well
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:40,351	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That's 20%
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,911	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Cabal the baby will catch you on the entire Passage
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:44,447	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Rapid7 platform
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:47,775	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And babies are particularly important
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:49,567	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	To rebuilding the overall population
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,591	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I'm going like
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:53,407	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	You know what that seems like those platforms
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,175	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Important
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,223	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	For rebuilding
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,759	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That particular
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:58,783	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Species
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:02,111	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Still as Love's results were coming in
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:03,391	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A lot of people were skeptical
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:07,487	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Like maybe the rigs were just luring fish away from natural habitat
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:09,279	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Lymphostatic
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,303	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Totally valid
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,327	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Concerned
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,095	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Does happen
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:12,607	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A lot of artists
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:17,215	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But after years of studying these oil platforms details
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:19,263	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Continent that at least for some species
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:20,031	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Betta fish
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:22,847	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	What platforms are giving the overall population of boost
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:25,919	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Preponderance of evidence
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:26,943	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Is that for
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:31,295	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	8 or 10 or maybe 12 species of rocks
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,063	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Fish
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:34,879	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	There are more of them in California
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,415	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Because of all these platforms
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:39,487	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Then would be here if the platforms
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:39,999	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	You're not here
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:43,071	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And some scientist would go even further
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:48,703	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A few years ago someone else tried to calculate just how biologically productive the platforms were
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:52,543	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The most productive habitats are places like rainforest
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,055	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Coral reef
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:56,127	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But when the scientist ran the numbers
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:56,895	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	He found
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:19:00,479	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That these platforms are the most productive
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:01,247	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Habitats
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,039	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	In the world ocean
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:04,319	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Anywhere
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:07,135	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Now we we should take that with a grain of salt
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:09,183	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Tons of habitats that scientists haven't
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:09,951	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Studied in this way
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,999	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But the point is
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,791	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	These are fully functioning
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:17,375	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	They contain all the animals
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:18,911	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That you would expect
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:19,423	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Tusayan
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:21,215	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A myriad of Nach
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,263	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Which banks
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,031	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The question
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:27,103	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Is it in the interests of the people of California
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:27,871	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	To blow up
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:29,151	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A fully functioning rave
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:30,687	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And destroy it
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:33,759	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	In 2010
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:36,319	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The California legislature decided it was
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:39,135	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Any past ad to 503
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:41,183	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A bill known as rigs to reefs
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:43,231	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Oil companies
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:45,279	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	To leave an oil platform in place
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:48,095	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	If it could be shown to have a net benefit
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,119	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	On the marine environment
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:53,471	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The oil companies would still need to plug the wells and Lop off the top
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:55,519	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The platforms that boats could travel over it
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:59,103	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But they would be allowed to leave some of the structure in place
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:00,639	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	So far though
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:02,175	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	No one is made use of this pill
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:07,039	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And the future of California's Offshore platforms is still very much up in the air
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:11,903	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A lot of environmentalists aren't sold on the idea of turning Riggs
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:12,415	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Winter wreaths
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:14,463	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	They have concerns about liability
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:16,255	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Potential for future leaks
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:20,607	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The original lease agreements specify that the platform's orbit
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:22,655	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Fully removed when the oil ran out
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:27,007	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	There wasn't a loophole that said they could stay if they turned into beautiful fish habitat
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:28,543	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	To me it's breaking a promise
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:30,079	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	This is Carla Frisk again
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,871	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	From Goodwill promise was
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:32,895	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	These would go away
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:35,455	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And now they don't want them to go away
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:37,247	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Tell
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:41,599	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Community don't worry we're going to clean up our garbage after we're gone and then
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:48,255	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And even if you love fish and I really do love fish
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:50,815	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Her frustration is understandable
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:56,703	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Environmental activist in Santa Barbara have had to deal with oil in their backyard for the last 50 years
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:03,359	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	In 2015 an oil pipeline a few miles north of Santa Barbara started leaking right into the ocean
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:08,479	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	It was a horrible reminder of the 69 spill and the dangers of living with oil in
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:08,991	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Structure
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:14,623	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And now the oil companies are saying hey these giant structures in the ocean that cause you all these problems
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:19,232	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	They're actually good for the environment look at the research their habitat
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:20,000	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	It's not
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:27,424	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Carla is not convinced the oil executive support rigs to reefs because of their concern for the rockfish
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:29,984	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	My feeling is that they're motivated by saving money
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:32,032	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Save a whole lot of money by not pulling nose out
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:34,080	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The rig
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,616	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Is off Santa Barbara or massive
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:36,640	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:39,456	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Some of the largest oil Platforms in the world
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:42,272	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Philippe removing them would be extremely
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:45,856	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Difficult and avoiding those costs could save the oil companies
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:46,880	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Millions of dollars
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:50,976	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Under the 2010 rigs to reefs spell those savings will be
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:52,000	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Split with a state
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:57,888	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	What environmental groups don't love signing off on a policy that feels like a handout
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,400	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Did the oil in this
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:02,240	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Especially because environmental groups are currently fighting
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,776	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	New offshore oil development
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:09,664	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The Trump Administration is indicated that they want to issue new offshore oil and gas leases off California
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:13,760	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	California has resisted the plan but environmental groups worry that
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:19,904	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	If the cost of decommissioning go down and the oil companies can argue that these structures are actually good for wildlife
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:23,744	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	They could have an easier time building new oil platforms
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:28,352	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Do offshore oil drilling is the worst case scenario that all
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:30,912	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Not just
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,448	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Because of the risk of future spills
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:38,848	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Because if you want to stop the worst impacts of climate change we're going to have to start leaving fossil fuels in the ground
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:43,712	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Milton love agrees that climate change is one of the biggest threats to the world's oceans
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:45,760	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And so I asked him
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,040	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	What he thinks about the fact
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,576	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But the oil industry
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:50,112	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Probably likes his research
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:52,672	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I have tended to avoid dealing
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:57,792	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	With the oil industry to the extent I can but obviously they read my
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:58,816	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	My papers
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:00,864	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	They like it
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:03,424	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I guess I mean it
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:04,448	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	CEO comment
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:06,240	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Go like this is great stuff
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,544	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I love your stuff
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:10,336	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Thank you thank you thank I'm not ready
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:15,968	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But his findings have definitely helped oil companies make their argument
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:17,504	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Stent
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:18,784	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:19,808	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	My findings

EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:23,904	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The oil companies

EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:28,256	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That's just what happens with facts
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,072	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The facts
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:34,912	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Of Milton loves research don't mean that oil infrastructure is
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:36,192	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Is good for wildlife
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,216	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That usually is
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,264	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I just mean that
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:42,080	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A few instances off the southern California coast
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:45,664	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Oil platforms have become useful habitat
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:47,712	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	For a few different species
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,224	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A fish
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:53,088	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	He's not in favor of building new offshore oil platform
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:55,648	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Or even building lots of new artificial reefs
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:57,440	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But in this situation
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,720	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The artificial Reef
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:23:59,488	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Is already there
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:03,072	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	My view is once you put something in the ocean and it becomes
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,864	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Habitat for animals
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,912	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I don't think you should pull it out
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:10,240	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Cuz like why should we punish those animals just cuz they have The Misfortune of

EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:46,240	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Okay
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:52,896	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,520	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	NPR
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:23,360	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Think about doing
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,128	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Astoria
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:24,896	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Like this
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:26,432	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	We talked about The Accidental benefits
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,736	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Of human putting stuff in the ocean
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:29,760	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Is that you could
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,808	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Possibly Come Away with the idea that
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:35,392	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	This isn't necessarily a good thing all the time that we should just
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:39,744	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Dumb stuff in the ocean
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,256	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Report that piece
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:42,304	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	To address this issue
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:43,072	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Head on
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:45,632	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A little nervous
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:46,400	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	About
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,936	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	With the peace you know you could kind of
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:50,496	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Draw the wrong conclusion of like take the conclusion of
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:51,008	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The peace like
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:53,056	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	It too far
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:54,080	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Yeah if you start to think
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,360	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A fish like
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,384	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Together around
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:57,920	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Stuff then let's just
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:27:02,528	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	What are the water and the crazy thing is
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,808	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	We have done this
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,600	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	We have built artificial reefs
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:07,904	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A lot in the past and made a people have
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:11,488	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Thrown all kinds of things into the ocean thinking that
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:13,280	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	This is going to be beneficial there has been
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,560	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Old washing machine
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:16,352	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Subway cars
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:20,960	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	They even sunk in Old aircraft carrier once off the Florida Panhandle
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:21,984	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Became known as the
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:23,520	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The great carrier Reef
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,544	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Clever
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:29,152	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And the results are mixed often will you put
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:35,296	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Structure into the water it does attract fish
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,320	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Support these
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:43,232	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Sorts of projects artificial reefing are far fisherman because concentrates all the fish in one place
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:46,816	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Play some music to catch and so an argument against artificial reefs is that
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:48,864	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	They lead to Arkin exacerbate
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:49,376	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Overfishing
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:56,288	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And that's totally a real concern is also one of the more egregious examples of a misguided
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,824	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Artificial reefing attempt
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,104	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That I came across
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:03,456	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	What happened in the 1970s were people dumped half a million
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:08,064	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Tires automobile tires into the ocean off Fort Lauderdale
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:10,624	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Ostensibly you know in the NFL to create
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:11,904	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	An artificial Reef
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:14,976	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That seems like the worst possible substrate
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:19,072	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	To build a wreath upon
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:22,912	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Completely and it was an abject failure it's like a 30-year
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:27,776	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	30 acre Dead Zone around there now it end and not only that but like
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:34,176	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Delta Tires Leach stuff that was detrimental to a natural coral reef fish having come through the worst
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:36,736	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Case scenario of taking this idea and going
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:37,760	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Too far with it
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:42,112	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	So the lesson is that we should not dress till the ocean with our stuff
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:46,976	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Absolutely not I do not take that weapon away from the store anyway
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:50,560	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But we are going to put cumin in
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:51,328	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The structure into the ocean
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:55,680	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	As humans were going to put things out in the marine environment we're building
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:59,776	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Breakwater's around Harbors we're building bridges were building
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:05,920	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	A lot of oil platforms moving the future probably going to be building a lot of renewable energy
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:08,224	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Twin platform for offshore
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:08,992	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Wind
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:10,016	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	So this is Jeremy
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:15,136	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Place he's a professor of marine biology at Cal Poly Pomona
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:21,536	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That ran the numbers and Quantified how biologically productive the California oil rigs are if you remember that from the story
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:22,560	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And Jeremy's
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:27,424	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Argument is basically that you know with all of this infrastructure we should be thinking about
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:28,960	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The impact it will have
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:35,360	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	On the marine environment and seeing if there are ways that we could design the structure before it goes in the wall
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:37,920	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Water so that it has a chance
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:38,944	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	To become
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:40,224	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Beneficial habit
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:43,296	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	So in the oil platform Astoria it was at
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:43,808	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Total accent
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:47,136	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Peking rapes but he saying that maybe
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:50,976	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	We can actually do some of this intentionally or maybe even do it better
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:52,000	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	With some intent
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:56,608	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Think about how we could design human infrastructure
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,888	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	To maximize its habitat
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:02,240	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Annie's particularly focus on the question of offshore wind
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:04,544	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Which to me is this release date Apple because
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:06,080	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Unlike oil platforms which are
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:10,176	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Problematic when it comes to climate change offshore wind
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:13,504	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Is this climate solution in this potentially
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:15,552	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Important kind of solution out
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:18,880	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Yeah we know that we're going to need to build a lot of these structures
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:22,976	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The coming decades like if we want to avoid the worst case scenarios when I
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:23,744	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Comes the
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:25,536	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Climate change we're going to need some
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:26,048	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Offshore wind
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:29,632	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	On and hopefully now these Offshore platforms
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:35,008	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Start can be put into designing them and then once they're put out there we can study them and understand
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:38,848	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	You know the positive and negative that's going on and try to revise those overtime and
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:40,896	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I'm and do the best we can
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:43,712	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I would all the stuff for putting out into the marine environment
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:45,504	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	So is this happening anywhere yet
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,272	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Does anyone
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:48,320	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Actually designing wind platforms
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:50,112	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	With biological life
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:51,904	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Priority
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:54,208	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Yeah we're kind of at the beginning of this
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:31:00,096	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But the place right now in the world with the most offshore wind is the North Sea in Europe
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,376	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:04,448	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	There are a lot of wind turbines there that are just
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:07,264	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	They're basically just attached to the seabed by a
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,544	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Single pole
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:13,408	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Doesn't have a lot of complexity that structure and one of the things that's really
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:14,688	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Great about
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:19,552	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Offshore oil platforms as if they've got some of that structural complexity that fish
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:21,600	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Penta light show in the North
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:27,744	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	See one thing that people are doing is starting to think about like how can we add a little bit of structural complexity
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:28,512	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	2DS
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:29,792	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Wind turbine
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:36,704	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And you're up in the North Sea they're doing things to increase the complexity on a down at the base.
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:40,544	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	There's opportunities to create more complex habitats surrounding it with
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,824	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Cory rocker
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:43,360	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Different structures
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:49,760	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	To try to improve the habitat for fish living down there but you know off California that situation is actually really
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:55,904	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Difference the ocean floor is as you go through out to sea on California drops off a really quickly and gets a really.
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:57,696	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And so
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:32:01,536	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Offshore wind turbines in California if they do come
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:03,584	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Are actually going to need to be designed to
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:04,352	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Float
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:07,424	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	There's a whole set of new challenges in terms of deploying
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:09,984	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Is floating structures but a lot of them
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:12,032	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Artist going to be underwater
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:13,568	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Is very similar
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:16,384	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Sort of structure to the top part
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:18,688	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Underwater of these offshore oil platforms
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:21,504	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Kind of where we're at right now is trying to
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:24,320	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Studied official living on these offshore oil platform
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:26,624	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	It's kind of a proxy what you would expect
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:29,952	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The fish are going to experience living off these floating wind platforms
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:36,864	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	So Jeremy is hoping that his research can inform the design of the structures if and when offshore wind becomes
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:37,632	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Cereality
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:40,960	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	In California but you know
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:44,288	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	He's at he's a marine biologist is obviously focused on fish
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:45,568	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	There are
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:51,968	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Huge engineering challenges and end design challenges with offshore wind and solar
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:53,504	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	MultiCare about
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:58,368	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Fish is not necessary is not necessarily be the easiest
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:32:59,648	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	I think the
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:02,976	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The economic and Engineering challenges
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:04,512	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Are pretty great
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,536	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	With these structures
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:06,816	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	So
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:11,936	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Initially at least it's probably hard to come in and say well then let's think about how he's going to be good for the fish
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:14,752	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Ultimately that I think that's what we should be doing
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:17,568	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	At the end of the day we still we shouldn't get
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:20,384	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Too carried away with these with these ideas or
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:26,528	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Think that we can design perfect habitats and at the expense of natural ones I think that you know
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:31,392	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Anytime a piece of infrastructure into the water it's going to be
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:37,792	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Disruptive on some level and then that's always that's always true and we always need to be thinking about how to mitigate
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:40,096	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The negative impacts that a big
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:44,704	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Piece of human infrastructure is going to have it with offshore wind
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:47,520	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Nothing that you are obviously very concerned about is
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:48,288	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Is seabird
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:51,616	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Buy the whole other set of of design challenges you how do you
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:54,432	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	How do you build these structures in a way where
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:55,456	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	They don't disrupt
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:56,480	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Seabird habitat
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:57,248	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But I think
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:34:00,064	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The first step is like how do we mitigate
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:05,440	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Disruption and damage and then you can start thinking about what are ways in which we could
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:06,464	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Maybe actually have
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:07,488	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Small benefits
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:08,256	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Right
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:10,048	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Designed to never replace
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,072	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The concept of conservation
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:15,168	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Total Innovation and design and impact is on should go hand-in-hand
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:17,728	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	And even though we can make a nice habitat
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,776	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	On the bottom of a platform
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:21,824	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	It doesn't mean that we shouldn't be
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:22,592	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Protecting
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:23,104	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	The natural

EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:26,688	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Just as much as we always share
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:27,200	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	You know like
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:28,992	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Replace it.
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:33,088	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Completely there's no but nothing you're going to design is is better than
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:37,952	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	What's in leaving nature alone exactly right completely end
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:39,232	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Some of the most interesting
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:41,792	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Work that's being done
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:45,632	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	In terms of artificial reefs that I think people do support is
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:52,544	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Assisting about habitat restoration you know a place where we've done a lot of damage with some other kind of development is there a way
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:54,080	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	That we can intervene
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:57,408	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Again when did some kind of design solution
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:35:02,784	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	But for the purposes of of trying to rehabilitate something that was already there
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:03,552	| 338_Crude_Habitat_pt_01_update |	Which policies in which
