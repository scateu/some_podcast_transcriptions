EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:08,864	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I'm Roman Mars
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:16,032	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We wanted to do a story about gerrymandering for years
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:18,336	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Once you take it as a given
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:21,152	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We want to live in a representative democracy
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:24,480	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The next question becomes how are we best represent it
EDL	00:01:24,992	00:01:26,784	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We need to divide ourselves into groups
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:29,344	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	From what basis should the lines be drawn
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:32,416	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Basic geography is a place to start
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:36,768	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But there are always exceptions and nuances that make defining voting districts
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:39,584	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Solium on Geographic boundaries problematic
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:42,144	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I think of this as a design problem
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:44,704	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Maybe the most important design problem of democracy
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:51,360	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Our friends over at 5:38 recently drove deep into this topic with a six-part series that examines gerrymandering
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:53,408	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In different states around the country
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:54,176	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It's called
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:55,456	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The gerrymandering project
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:02:01,088	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It turns out each state that they profile is dealing with representation and gerrymandering differently
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:07,744	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The states are really acting as the Laboratories of democracy that US Supreme Court Justice Brandeis said they were
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:11,072	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We're going to spend the whole episode this week
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:14,400	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Flooring that series and playing scenes from four different episodes
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:17,216	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	About gerrymandering in four different states
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:21,056	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Our guide along the way will be the host of the gerrymandering project
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,848	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And producer at 5:38
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:23,360	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Galen druke
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:25,152	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Thank you for being here going
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:26,688	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Hey Robin thanks for having me
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:29,504	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So this might seem like an obvious question but
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:31,552	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Just laid out for us what is gerrymandering
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:34,624	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Gerrymandering at its most basic is
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:38,464	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Drawing district lines to achieve a specific
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,232	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Golf
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:40,256	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I think the most
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:44,352	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Common form of gerrymandering that people are familiar with
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:46,912	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Partisan gerrymandering which would be
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:53,824	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Drawing lines in a way that Advantage One party over another but you could also draw lines to protect income
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:56,640	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Cummins or you could racially gerrymandered
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:59,200	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Dilute minorities voting power
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:04,832	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So there's more than one kind of gerrymandering but at its core it's just manipulating lines with a goal
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:06,880	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	To implicit
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:07,392	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,184	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The idea that
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:11,744	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A gerrymandered district is manipulated
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:18,144	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Is that there's some natural way that a district should be drawn and that doesn't seem like it's running how do you really determine
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,936	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Natural state of a district is
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,728	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Yes you're right
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:24,032	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	There is no redistricting plan
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:24,544	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That is
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:29,152	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Blessed by the grace of God you know there are not Rivers
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:31,456	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Streams mountains and Reed Ithaca
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:36,832	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Often times people will just refer to something as gerrymandered when they don't like
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,880	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The result or if it looks
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:41,184	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And who decides how District
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:41,952	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Rescheduling
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:42,464	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	General Lee
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:45,536	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	For the most part state legislators
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:48,096	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Come up with maps that have been approved
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:49,632	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	By State Governor
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,168	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:56,544	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In some cases states have overhauled the process to give the power to an independent Commission
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:58,080	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But for the most part at State gov
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:02,688	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The party in control can achieve
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:05,760	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	An advantage over the party out of control
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,808	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Is my packing and cracking their voters
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:10,368	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Which would mean in some instances
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:13,440	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Putting a lot of that party's voters in one dip
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:16,256	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So is to make them waste a bunch of there
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,024	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:20,095	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Theoretically any vote over 51%
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:22,655	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Would be a wasted vote it's not helping to elect
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:25,215	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And then on the other hand you have
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,495	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Cracking which would be
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:31,103	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Dividing up that parties voters so that they can't reach
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:32,383	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	51%
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,407	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In any one District
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,711	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Forcing them to waste votes in another
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:44,159	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So in the 538 Series game looked at four different states that are either currently dealing with or have recently
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:46,207	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	With the question of gerrymandering
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:49,535	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Tape and talk a little bit about each of those States
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:51,071	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We'll start with Wisconsin
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:57,727	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So just a little background Wisconsin Republicans one unified control of the state government
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:01,823	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	This was a particularly big deal because it happened to be a redistricting here
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:08,223	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It was the first time in decades that a single party and had total control of the state government as the state read
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:09,503	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Andrew is political maps
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:12,319	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Republicans took advantage
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,879	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	They drew maps that Democrats allege
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:17,439	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Are very favorable to Republican candidates
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:21,023	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	This obviously didn't sit well with the Democrats and they filed suit
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:27,935	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	For a long time anti-gerrymandering activists have been trying to find cases that they could bring before the spring
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:32,031	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Court to try to get a ruling that this kind of political manipulation
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:33,567	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Is unconstitutional
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:36,383	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Violates either the First Amendment or the 14th Amendment
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:40,223	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And one civil rights lawyer in particular a man named Peter oral
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:43,551	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Started digging into the Wisconsin case and uncovering details
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:47,391	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	He found out that Republicans had drawn these maps in a secret office
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:53,023	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And that Republican lawmakers had signed secrecy agreements not to discuss the shape of the new districts
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:58,143	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The Earl didn't know the extent to which Republicans have gone to secure a partisan advantage
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:00,191	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Will it Galen take it from here
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:02,239	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Earl and his partner
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:05,055	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Still didn't have a full picture of how the maps were drawn
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:07,359	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A detail that would be key to their case
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:09,919	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Should I continue to dig deeper
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,967	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And I noticed the email records from some people
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:15,551	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Didn't match the email records from the people they were communicating
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:18,623	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And that raise suspicions and we began to
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:20,671	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Demand more and more information
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:25,023	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And the court finally ordered them to turn over that hard drive so we can friends see if we look at
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,839	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So the attorneys hired a forensic Examiner
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,631	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	He was able to determine that
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:31,423	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Hundreds of thousands of documents have been deleted
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:32,703	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A wiping soft
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:37,823	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Prior to that hard drives being turned over to us but they were able to uncover the deleted.
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,127	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Including a number of spreadsheets
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:44,991	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And those spreadsheets are what really told the story we were able to see every iteration of the mat
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:47,039	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	As they went from the Baseline
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:48,831	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	To the man that they finally adopt
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:54,719	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The map drawers used years of partisan voting data to design maps that strongly favored Republic
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:58,047	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We found out that there was a professor by the name of Keith
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,607	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Daddy from the University of Oklahoma
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,911	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Who have been hired by the Republicans
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:06,495	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	To develop a very sophisticated multivariate
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:09,311	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Regression analysis of partisan performance
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:11,615	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Based on on boats
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,895	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In the Assembly districts
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:16,735	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	From 2006-2008 mm
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,503	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	10
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,527	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And they actually
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,343	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Downloaded this proxy
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:22,367	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Into the
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:24,671	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Software that they were using to draw the maps
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:31,071	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So when the man throws moved the lines on the software they could see how it affected the partisan lean of the district
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:31,839	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In real time
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:35,935	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The three Republicans who were responsible for drawing these Maps
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:37,983	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Declined to be interviewed on the record
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:38,751	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And then
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:43,871	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	They think they kept upping the ante and how many republican seats they were guaranteed
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:48,479	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The map that ultimately came up with was designed to elect Republicans
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:54,879	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	259 of the 99 assembly seats with just 49% of the vote
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,671	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	With a minority of the Statewide vote
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:59,231	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	They had accounted for in effect
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:04,863	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The largest swings between Democratic turnout and Republican turnout
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,399	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	During the preceding decade
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:11,263	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The plaintiffs are now presenting those spreadsheets to the Supreme Court
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:13,055	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	As evidence that the Republicans
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:15,103	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Set out to disadvantaged Democrat
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:20,991	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The moment that we realize this was like it was like I was Eureka moment and the rage they anger
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,783	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That I felt
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,575	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The hours
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,343	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Bat
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,111	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	These
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:26,879	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	People
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:30,975	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Would Commit This level of a crime against the Democratic process was
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:31,999	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Which is astounding
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:34,047	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	At that point
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:36,095	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We decided we were going to do something about
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,655	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I mean the sound
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,703	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Completely pernicious and
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,215	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	COTA bus
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:47,871	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	What is the defense against that's like what is the actual argument that can be made is this a smoking gun
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,919	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So the most blunt argument
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:52,991	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That Wisconsin Republicans will make is that
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:56,319	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Partisan gerrymandering isn't illegal
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:58,879	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	State legislators have been drawing Maps
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:02,719	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That Advantage One party over another for like over a hundred
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,487	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Year
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,255	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And so
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:06,559	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	They're basically saying
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,839	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	This is a bit
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:11,679	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Hypocritical you know why are Democrats all of a sudden outraged about
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:15,263	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Partisan gerrymandering after they've been doing it for years
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:15,775	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Themselves
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:19,359	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Democrats in the case will respond and say you know this is
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:21,663	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Civil rights issue when it's gotten so far out of hand
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,711	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That the Supreme Court does
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,991	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Finally need to step in
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,271	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,831	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Then the Republicans will say
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:31,135	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Okay if the Supreme Court is going
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:31,903	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Stop in
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:35,743	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Then you have to have a very clear standard of what is and is not
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:37,023	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Fair in drawing Maps
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:41,375	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And ultimately that's a really really difficult line to
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,191	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,215	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Judicial
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:47,775	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Branch doesn't really want to get involved with drawing
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:49,311	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Every line on a map
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:53,663	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I mean you could see why they be reticent to do this but this is up to legislature
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:57,247	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	For sure I mean for conservatives on the court who
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,527	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Strongly believe
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:00,575	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That judicial overreach is
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:03,647	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A threat to in our governmental system
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,951	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Yes. That would be terrible if
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,743	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Courts around the country
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:08,511	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Basically
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:10,815	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Drawing maps that were supposed to be drawn
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,327	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	By mistake
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:13,887	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So if they are going to wade into the
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:17,727	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Issue they want to be able to have like a very clear standard
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:21,311	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	For what is and is not fair and then get themselves back out of the
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,103	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The process so that State Legislature
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:24,127	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And follow the
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:24,895	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Guidelines
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:27,967	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Anthony Kennedy has made it clear in the past
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,735	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:30,015	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	He does not like parties
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:30,783	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Gerrymandering
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,063	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Keys Radisson however
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:33,855	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Awaiting into this for that exactly
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:36,415	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	He doesn't want chords across the country
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,439	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Repeatedly
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:39,231	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Getting involved in this issue and dry mouth
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:44,351	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It's a weird is that Wisconsin situation currently stand
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,375	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We are waiting for
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,191	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The Supreme Court heard oral arguments
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,471	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Last fall
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:50,239	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,031	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We will have a decision in this case
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:52,543	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Baijiu
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:57,151	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You know the decision in this case could be a pretty big
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:00,991	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If the Supreme Court sides with the Wisconsin Democrats
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:03,551	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That could mean that there's a
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,343	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Whole lot more
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:05,855	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Court cases
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,647	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Following the same model
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,439	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Saying that
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:11,487	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The maps in those states are illegal and need to be
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:19,167	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So Wisconsin is a pretty obvious example of partisan gerrymandering
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:24,031	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But now we're going to turn to North Carolina where legislators have drawn lines with race in my
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:28,383	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The Voting Rights Act has been interpreted over the years to mean that
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,919	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	States need to draw Maps
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:34,271	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That don't dilute minority voters and allow minority communities
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:36,063	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	To elect candidates of their choice
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,599	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	North Carolina
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:40,671	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That meant in the early 1990s Maps were drawn
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:44,511	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So that certain districts would favor African American candidates
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,023	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It works
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:50,655	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	North Carolina elected black representatives to the US House for the first time since reconstruction
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:53,471	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	This was a huge success for the African American community
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,263	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It was also good for another group
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,055	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	North Carolina Republicans
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,847	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Do understand why
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:11:59,871	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Through this
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:02,943	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Black North Carolinians overwhelmingly vote democratic
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:06,783	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	My packing these voters into a small number of District
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,807	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	For black candidate
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,575	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Likely win
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:13,183	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The legislature also diminish black voting power in other District
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:13,951	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Around the state
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:17,535	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Alone Republicans to dominate the overall political landscape
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,047	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Escape the state
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:21,375	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Different people in North Carolina have very different opinions about this
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:25,727	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I want to play some tape now from the North Carolina episode of the gerrymandering project
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,751	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Illustrate
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,543	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Super complicated dynamic
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:30,335	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I have never
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:33,151	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Personally been one that think that increasing the numbers
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:35,711	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The black caucus
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,479	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,759	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Congress for example
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:41,087	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Necessarily equated to a plus 4th Ave
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:41,599	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	American commune
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:42,879	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Derek Smith
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:45,183	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A political action chair for the state NW
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:48,255	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	They can ensure that African Americans get sent to
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:55,167	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Legislative bodies and that looks good on Election Day when they can stand up and say look look at what we did for you all we help kitties
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:55,679	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Eva Clayton
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:57,471	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And Mel Watt
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,239	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Into Congress
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,263	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In the 1990s
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,055	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But on the whole
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:02,847	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The effect was
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:05,663	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But that was when the state began to shift towards

EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:30,719	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We see that there were four black men elected

EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:34,047	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Represent the state of North Carolina in the house

EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:37,631	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We see
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:39,167	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	About a hundred year Gap
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:41,215	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Before mrs. Clayton

EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:46,847	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In state after state
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:47,871	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Across the South
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:49,663	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That 100-year Gap
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:51,199	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Persistent
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,223	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Same Gap
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:54,271	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In South Carolina
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:56,319	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We said in Alabama
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,087	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Florida
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:58,111	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We say
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:01,695	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	1871 and then another hundred-year Gap
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:04,767	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Is there we can see it in Georgia
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,791	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In Louisiana
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:10,911	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	From 1875 and then not until 1991
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,447	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In many states
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,983	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Batgap only ends
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,263	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In the early 1990s
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:17,823	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	When states were forced to draw
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:18,847	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Majority-black District
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:22,687	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So it's easy to understand
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,991	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Why the conversation about majority-minority
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,783	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Can be so contentious
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,295	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Unemotional
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:30,367	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If the law favors unpacking minardi District
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:34,463	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Could become more difficult to ensure that African-Americans are elected
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,487	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The same rates
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:35,999	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But they happen
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:41,119	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Example North Carolina State Legislative map is currently being redrawn
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:43,167	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Unpack the majority-minority desk

EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,591	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Actually regret
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:53,919	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I losing my district and the coalition
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:56,479	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That have been formed in that District I regret that
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:59,807	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	At the same time the gerrymandering is

EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:02,367	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	She says it's for the best
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,391	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I'm convinced
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:09,023	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That even if people like me lose out to have a firm foundation
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:13,887	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Upon which we are doing this redistricting we will be better off over time
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:19,263	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	This is the episode that most
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:24,895	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Broke my brain I think I don't know you putting it together but there is so many
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:27,711	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Interest that have to be balanced in so many interests that I
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:29,503	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Really support
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:31,295	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Want to have happen
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,831	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I know it's it's
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,367	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Crazy
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:37,183	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	How many values you have to juggle to draw these lines
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,975	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Yeah and I mean
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:40,767	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	This is really
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,535	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Even just
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:44,095	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The tip of the iceberg when it comes to
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,887	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	All of the interest
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:47,167	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That you have to consider
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:50,239	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Drawing a district map
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:54,847	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	This is a really difficult conversation especially for Democrats to have
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:56,127	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Because on one hand
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:59,967	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You know they want to have the best shot at winning majorities that they
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,479	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Can
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,015	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	On the other hand
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:05,855	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If we are going to no longer have majority-minority
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:09,439	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That might involve amending the Voting Rights Act
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:13,023	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And that's a really difficult conversation for
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:15,071	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Because as a platform Democrats
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:16,351	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Support
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:19,167	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Enhancing the voting power of minorities
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:26,079	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Can we talk about this in value of competitiveness and and that brings us to the State of Arizona in twenty eleven
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:29,407	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	They tried to give power to draw Maps over to an independent Commission
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:34,015	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And a big part of the goal was to increase competitiveness and elections
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:39,135	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Can you describe what the thinking was an end and why they create commission to preference this button
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:39,647	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Guitar value
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:42,975	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Yes if you ask Americans they love competitive
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,279	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You know of course from their eyes
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:51,935	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Complicated but in general competition is a Americans value like what's more
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:53,215	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Competition
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:55,007	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In mm
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:56,287	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Arizona
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:20:00,383	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Through a ballot initiative meeting that just Arizona's all across the state
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:01,663	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Voted on this
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:04,479	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Single item saying do you want to create
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:07,039	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	An independent commission to draw the state map
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:08,831	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Take the power away from the state line
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,623	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:12,159	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Arizonans voted yes
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:18,559	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And so for the first time in 2001 an independent commission through the maps and then for a second time in mm
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:19,327	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	11
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:20,607	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	An independent Commission
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,679	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And in doing this you know
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:24,447	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:25,215	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Drafters of
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,263	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Ballot initiative
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:32,127	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Had to basically say these are the criteria for drawing the maps that this independent Commission
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,151	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Have to follow
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:35,967	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And uniquely in Arizona
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:38,271	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	One of those criteria was competitive
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:41,087	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In fact it's the only state in the country that
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:41,599	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Wires
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:45,439	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	An independent commission or even lawmakers for that matter
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,719	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	To try to make this right
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:47,231	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	What's compatible
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:49,279	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Invite competitive you mean that
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:51,327	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I depending on
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,351	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The candidate
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:55,679	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Maybe I don't know
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:21:01,823	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Equally likely that a Democrat or Republican to be elected I mean I need to find competitiveness in the kind of
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:03,103	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Monkey world
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:06,943	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	538 we Define competitiveness
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:07,711	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	As
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:11,807	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Within five points of the national average in a presidential election
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:13,087	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Show
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:15,391	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Basically a district where you would expect
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:17,952	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And so
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,720	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	VSCO
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:21,792	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Very controversial very fast can you tell us what happened
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:25,120	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So at the time in 2011
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:26,912	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Republicans control
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:29,984	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Both chambers of the State Legislature
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:30,752	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:34,080	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You know they were not all that interested in enhancing
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,360	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Competition because it happen
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:40,224	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Mission would mean probably a better chance that Democrats will take some of those seats away from them
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:42,272	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Then on the other hand of course Democrats
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,040	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Water copter
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:45,088	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	At the heart of this was
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:47,904	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	One woman who was the independent charity
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:49,696	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The commissioners
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:53,792	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Five people to Republicans to Democrats and one independent chair who ends up being
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,560	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The tiebreaker
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:58,912	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If you listen to the episode you can decide for yourself whether or not that's a good song
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:04,288	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Ultimately this independent chair calling Mathis
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:04,800	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Became
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:06,592	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The focal point of
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,872	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	All of this
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:08,896	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Disagreement
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:11,456	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Between the two parties over how the district should be drawn
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:12,992	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:13,760	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Things actually
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:15,040	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	What kind of scary for her
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:19,392	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Okay so we're going to play a little bit of the Arizona episode of the gerrymandering project
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:22,720	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Which deals with these maps that were drawn to increase
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,488	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Competitiveness
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:26,304	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And this thing starts in a public hearing
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:29,888	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	About the map drawing company that the independent commission chose
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:31,424	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Let's all rise for the Pledge of Allegiance
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:34,496	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I pledge allegiance
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:35,520	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	To the flag
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:37,824	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Of the United States of America
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:40,128	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I want to see right now for give me
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:41,408	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I'm not going to use nice
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:46,272	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Because I am so upset over this situation
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:49,600	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The best way to describe it I think is it was like a beehive
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:52,416	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	All kinds of people were there and
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:56,000	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The way they were looking at me I could just tell
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,024	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	They weren't happy with me
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,816	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That's calling Mathis
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:01,120	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It was June 30th 2011
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:04,960	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And she was chairing a public hearing of Arizona's independent redistricting
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:10,592	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The group of citizens tasked with redrawing Arizona's political boundaries
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:11,616	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It was a packed
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:12,384	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Room
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:18,528	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Standing room only my husband actually was there and he went and stood in the doorway he was concerned frankly for
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,832	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The safety of all of us
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:21,600	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Cuz it just seemed
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:24,416	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Like a heightened level of in
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:30,560	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The commission had just decided which mapping company should draw Arizona's new District Lines
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:33,120	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	What are the boundaries that help determine who you vote for
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:34,400	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And Republicans
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:39,008	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So slanted have your votes been against Republican
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:41,568	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If there is no question what the goal this commission is
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:45,920	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But what can we expect when the independent is not really an independent
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:47,968	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	She's married to an activist Democrat
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:50,272	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	One after another each of the
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:53,088	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	People who filled out the request to speak forms came up and
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:56,160	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Prettymuch berated me mostly
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,440	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	There are many
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,720	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Mapping company
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:23:59,232	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	He's out there
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:02,304	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Sorry I am
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:02,816	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So upset
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:05,376	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That you could have picked
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:07,936	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That are non
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:08,704	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Who article
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:11,008	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Why didn't you
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:15,360	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The mapping company had done work for Democratic campaign
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:17,408	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And Republicans blamed math
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:19,200	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Choosing a bias company
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:24,064	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	After attending the last two meetings my feelings are that this is a predetermined process
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,600	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	With one agenda
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:29,440	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Remap Arizona to improve Democratic representation
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:31,232	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	What were you saw
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:37,632	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	After the the mapping insulting was appointed was a lot of pitchforks and torches here in Arizona
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:40,448	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Because I think the public really knew at that point
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:42,496	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That the mapping wasn't going to be
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:45,056	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You know I told this commission was
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:45,568	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Supposed to be
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,104	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Non
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:47,616	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Partisan
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:51,200	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Damn it you can't get any more parts
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:53,504	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It was scary
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:57,088	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A few weeks after the mapping consultant decision
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:59,648	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A sitting state senator
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,440	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Had suggested
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:03,488	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Reported in the press that
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:06,048	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	There was a Target on me
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:07,072	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:09,888	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And that was scary
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:12,704	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	He said quote the gun is loaded
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:14,496	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And it's just figuring out what
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:16,032	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	2 pointed out and when to pull the trigger
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:18,080	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	According to the yellow sheet report
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:20,128	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A political newsletter in Arizona
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,920	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Antinori told the Press
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:24,480	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The time that he uses military analogies
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:27,808	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Because he was in the military and that he wasn't targeting anyone
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:30,368	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	When people talk about targets and guns it's
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,648	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Not
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,416	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Something to mess with
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:34,464	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Only six months earlier
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:36,768	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Malthus's congressional representative
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:38,304	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Had been shot to the Head
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,072	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	At Point Blank
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:41,376	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I was in Tucson when it happened
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,400	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:44,960	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Anybody who was in Tucson
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:48,544	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Remember that day very well because it was
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:49,056	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Was a dark
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:52,640	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	During a constituent meeting at a grocery store in Tucson
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:54,176	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Congresswoman Gabby Gifford
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:55,200	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I need to another p
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,480	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Rashad
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:57,504	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Sex diet
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:58,528	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That unfortunate
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:02,624	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Awfulness occurred in January of 2011
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:05,952	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And I was sworn in March of 2011
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:08,256	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And so this was that summer
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,560	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	After that and
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:14,400	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It's just
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:18,752	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It's hard to talk about it
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:21,568	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Mathis says she and her husband bought plywood
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,080	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	What at Home Depot
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,616	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And boarded up their bedroom
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:24,896	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And I
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:26,432	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Ended up
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:30,784	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Kind of making our bedroom at least a safe Zone because we just felt
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:31,808	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Kind of like
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:34,112	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It'd be nice to be able to sleep at night
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:34,880	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And not worried
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,416	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Somebody was
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:38,976	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Looking in the windows are going to do anything
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,768	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	They also went to the
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,536	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Justice
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:44,608	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In Washington we talked to some folks at doj and
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,376	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And they had
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:47,168	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	FBI person sit in
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:49,472	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Their safety concerns would continue for years
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:53,312	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In 2012 with litigation still ongoing
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:54,336	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Their house was
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,640	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A year after that
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:57,664	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The commission's office
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:58,432	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It was broken into
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:00,480	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And the computers of all the commissioners
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:01,248	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Stolen
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:02,272	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We don't know
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:04,320	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If it was related to redistricting
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:04,832	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:06,880	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That did occur
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,416	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	NASA says her mother
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,720	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But I never
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:12,768	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Was going to quit I just knew that if
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:13,280	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If you quit
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:16,864	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You're giving into that's exactly what they want you to do
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:20,192	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Really intense
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:22,496	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So what happened with these
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:25,056	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	New competitive maps that were drawn in Arizona
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:27,104	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You know the story
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,384	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It ends up being
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,408	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The most
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:30,688	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Intense
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:32,224	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I think redistricting
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:32,736	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Process
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,272	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Probably the country is
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,832	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The governor and legislature impeached
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:40,160	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Mathis then she gets reinstated ultimately
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:40,928	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Babe
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:41,696	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Pasta Maps
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:43,232	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:45,792	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	They did end up enhancing
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:46,816	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Competition
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:48,352	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In Arizona
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:51,936	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	During the 2016 election there was one District
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:54,240	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Arizona
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,264	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That voted
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:55,776	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	4
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:59,360	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Hillary Clinton for president and voted for a republican in the house
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,664	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And there was another District that voted for
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:02,944	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	For Trump as president and voted
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:03,968	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A Democrat
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:07,040	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That's pretty rare in
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:11,392	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Dehydrate these days where we have a very polarized political environment and generally
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:12,928	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Democrats and Republican
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:15,488	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Live together so it's very rare that we
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:16,768	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	See those kinds of voting
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,048	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So yes
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:20,352	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The districts that they set out to create
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:21,888	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	As competitive Def
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:23,168	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Do function outcome
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:25,216	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But of course
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:28,288	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The path to getting there was a very acrimony
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:31,104	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I mean
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:33,664	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	When you went there and
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:38,784	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Did this story I mean what did you think of competitiveness as of value when it comes to drawing
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:40,832	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Soup
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,112	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It's a complicated one
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:43,648	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	When we look in American polity
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:45,952	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Text because you know we say we want competitive
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:47,232	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Shenzhen
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:51,840	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Inferi competitive elections make lawmakers more accountable right
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:57,984	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If you're basically guaranteed to win your primary when your general election then you're not
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:58,752	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	.
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:28:59,776	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Accountable and
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:03,616	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If voters don't have options then do you really live in a representative democracy
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:05,920	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	At the same time
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:07,200	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Patterns in
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:10,016	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The ways that American voters have
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:10,784	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Clustered
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:13,600	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Make competitive difference really hard to achieve
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:16,672	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Republicans and Democrats don't live in similar areas
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,976	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And less and less American voters
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:20,512	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Switch back and forth
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:21,536	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Between parties
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:22,048	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	From want to watch
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,352	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And so
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,120	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:26,144	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Really have to kind of
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:28,960	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Work at creating competitive
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:30,240	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Districts
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:31,008	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It's okay
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:33,824	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The last date you covered the gerrymandering project
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:34,848	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Is California
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:38,688	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Lake Arizona they also started an independent commission to redraw District
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:41,248	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But they did it for a slightly different reason
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:43,040	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Here's a clip from that episode
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:45,600	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	What caused California to creative
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:49,440	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Did not have to do with the same old partisan type of Jerry
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:56,352	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It is much more to do with protecting thing Compass the way they draw the district lines is to protect the incompetence
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:57,120	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That's
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:58,656	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Well I'll let him introduce
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:02,496	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I'm Arnold Schwarzenegger and it was governor
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:05,824	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Of the State of California from 2003 to 2011
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:08,640	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	He back redistricting reform as governor
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:10,688	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And has since continued to advocate for
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:12,736	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I'm a big believer that you must
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:14,784	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Terminate gerrymandering
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:15,552	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	America
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:20,672	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	When you look at the district lines the way they're drunk they make absolutely no sense to anyone
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:22,208	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But it is all designed
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:24,768	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	To keep Democrats separate from Republican
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:26,048	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Best strategy for drawing
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:30,912	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Created an environment in which of lawmakers felt entitled to groups of Voters
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:32,192	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	They saw it's beneficial to

EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:54,208	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	During the 2001 round of rediff
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:56,256	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	She testified to the legislature
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:58,816	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	About how the line should be drawn
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:00,608	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	To keep Asian communities hole
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:07,008	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	As we traveled up and down the state we were hearing these stories about people feeling for the first time the
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:07,776	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Prince of
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:09,568	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Talking about their communities
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:10,848	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Fences during the process
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:13,408	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	She got a call from a democratic assembly /
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:15,200	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I had received a phone call
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:18,784	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	From a legislator from San Francisco
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:21,600	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And it was my first time talking to
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:23,904	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You know assembly person or a senator
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:27,232	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And as a Young attorney it was quite exciting to receive this phone call
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:28,256	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:30,048	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	This person called me
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:32,096	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	To essentially tell me Kathy
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:34,912	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You're not going to put another in Asian in my desk
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:37,984	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I asked her to identify the lawmaker
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:39,264	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Carole migden
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:42,336	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	She's out of office now so I guess I can say her name
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,872	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It brought me to tears
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:45,920	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Because it was a realization that
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:47,968	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We still have
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:53,856	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A lot of racism in this country and even in a very blue State like California people
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:55,904	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Come to power with a sense of entitlement
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:58,464	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That allows them to
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:31:59,232	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Make
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:02,560	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Decisions about excluding People based on race
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,864	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In order to protect their own seats
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:06,144	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	When reached for comment
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:08,704	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Carole migden said she did not recall the conversation
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:13,056	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Any idea it was clear that the legislature was not interested
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:14,848	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Did in considering public testimony
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:15,616	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Like fat
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:18,944	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	What we found out was it after 4 months of
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:19,712	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Public hearings
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:23,808	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The legislature went behind closed doors and Drew the line
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:24,576	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:26,112	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	They are always intended to
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:30,720	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The California Senate passed the maps on September 12th 2001
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:33,024	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And the assembly passed them a day later
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:35,840	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	While the rest of the nation was rocking from
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:41,216	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	This terrorist attack but it happened and there was essentially a media blackout
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:43,520	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Quite honestly there was
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:46,848	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A real moment of reflection about
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:49,408	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Whether or not our democracy is functioning
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:53,248	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Their incumbent protection plan was overwhelmingly
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:54,016	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Successful
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:56,576	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The deal that was passed
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:57,600	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In 2001
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:33:00,672	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Made California's map almost impervious to change
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:02,976	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Only one incumbent
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:05,536	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Lost re-election in a general election
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:07,584	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Between 2002 and 2010
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:11,424	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	California has insulated itself from the political volatility
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:12,448	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Facing the rest
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:12,960	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Country
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:15,520	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Few of the races were even close
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:17,568	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Ua265
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:19,872	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	US House races in California
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:24,224	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Only 14 of them were decided by less than 10 points
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:25,760	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Just 5%
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,808	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	California's Congressional elections
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,088	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Competitive
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:31,904	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I always said you know that the Soviet politburo
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:34,208	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Edward changeover
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:36,256	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Then our system here in California
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:43,424	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So what happened in California like how did they combat this problem of income and see them
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:44,704	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Incumbency bias
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:46,752	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Californians
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:51,104	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In the. From you know the early 2000s to 2010
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:54,944	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	As you may remember in California we're very very
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:55,968	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Chat with the state
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:59,808	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I mean at a certain point I think their approval rating
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:00,832	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Was
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:02,368	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	At 10%
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:03,648	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:04,672	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So you had
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:07,744	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Governor Schwarzenegger and activist
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,280	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Really agitated
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:10,560	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Against the law
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:13,120	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And so between
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:14,144	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Common cause
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:16,704	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The organization
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:19,776	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And other non-partisan and partisan group
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:22,080	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	As well as the governor that kind of
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:23,872	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Got together and bats
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:24,896	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A again
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:26,688	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A ballot initiative like in Arizona
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:29,760	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	To take the power of
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:31,296	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Drawing these different Maps
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:33,088	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Away from the state legislature
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:34,624	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And to give it to an
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:39,488	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And so what is the basis that they that they independent commission Drew their Maps
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:40,512	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Show
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:46,144	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Where is in Arizona we had one of the criteria was competitiveness that was not the case in
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:50,240	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	One of the main criteria in California
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:51,008	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Was
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:54,336	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	To respect and Empower communities of Interest
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:56,384	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And that relates to
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:59,456	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Kathy fangs experience with the Asian American community in Kyle
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,224	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	California
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:04,576	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And the way that she saw them basically being disregarded in favor of it
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:05,600	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Combat zone
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:06,624	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Electoral priority
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:09,184	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And so what the
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:12,512	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Independent commission did in California was a traveled around the state
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:16,096	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And listen to members of
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:18,400	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Communities basically say
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:20,704	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Basically Define their own communities of
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:23,264	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That could range
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:25,824	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Anywhere from Koreatown
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:29,408	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	To get a one example is
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:34,272	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You know a group of people who has horses in LA or
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:38,624	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You know one example was even like the soundproofing Community around LAX
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:40,160	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The LAX airport in Los
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:46,560	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That's interesting Enzo how successful were they anyway what did they what did these Maps end up
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:50,400	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Resulting in one of the complications with this
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:57,312	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Way of mapping is that it's hard to tell whether or not people are being sincere about what they can say
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:58,848	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Center as their communities of Interest
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:35:59,616	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Like
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:02,432	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Political consultant came in and
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:05,248	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Basically organized people around
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:10,112	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Communities that may have been disingenuous in an attempt to influence
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:12,672	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The map drawing process for partisan reasons
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:16,768	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	There is good reason to believe that they were successful in some
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:17,536	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Cases
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,816	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Ultimately though
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:20,096	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I think California was
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:21,376	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Pretty successful
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:23,680	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	At appeasing
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:27,008	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Both sides of the aisle and getting a relatively
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:29,568	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Fair map I mean if you look at different
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:32,128	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Statistical analyses of
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:34,432	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The vote percentage compared with the seat chair
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:38,016	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	California's maps are pretty fair to Democrats
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:45,696	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So what are your takeaways from all this reporting you got you were steeped in this for months and months and months and what did you come away with
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:48,000	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Indeed I was
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:49,024	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Trophy
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:51,584	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If we look at the four different examples
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:52,864	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That we've just
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:55,680	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	First what you don't realize is
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,448	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:58,496	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	All of these different priorities so
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:36:59,776	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	One being
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:01,312	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Fairness between the two parties
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:03,360	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	To being
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:05,664	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Fairness in representing minorities
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:08,736	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Three being competitiveness in elections
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:10,784	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And for being respectful of
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:12,576	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Communities as they exist
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:13,088	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	On a map
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:16,928	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You'll start to understand that these things do Contour
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:19,488	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Star situations in which
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:23,840	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Enhancing the opportunity for minority candidate to get elected
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:25,376	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Could pain
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:27,936	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Republicans add an advantage electoral
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:32,288	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So ultimately the people who draw Maps
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:33,824	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	How to make
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:34,336	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Difficult
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:35,360	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Value chart
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:38,176	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Often times the people who draw Maps only care about part
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,480	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Right and so you know
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:43,040	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That's basically the maps the way that maps have been drawn
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:43,552	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	For a long time
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:47,648	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Play for going to reform the process you still have to be
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:48,928	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Off Lease Auto
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:53,280	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	About the values that you want to prioritize amongst those for
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:56,352	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And which of these four states do you think
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:57,120	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Is doing the best job
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:01,216	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If you look at California that is the place where
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:04,288	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You will talk to both Republicans and Democrats
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:05,568	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	To say that
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:07,872	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The mapping process overall
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:08,384	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Westfair
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:12,480	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And you know they're obviously Democrats Republicans who will disagree with that
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:14,528	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But it was a rare example
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:16,320	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In the months that I spent
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:16,832	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Reporting on this
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:20,928	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That you did come to some bipartisan
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:22,464	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Agreement about the success
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:25,792	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And is this a function of it
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:30,400	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Being drawn by an independent commission is this what the success really points to
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:34,752	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I think that's part oven times Americans distrust
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:36,288	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Partisan legislators to
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:40,384	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Put aside their partisanship in order to do what is
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:41,664	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Quote unquote
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:42,176	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Fair
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:43,968	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Obviously
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:45,248	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The people who wrote
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:47,808	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The ballot initiative in California
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,856	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Looked at some of these
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:51,904	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Examples in other states
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:54,208	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	They you know they're already been around everyday
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:56,256	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In Arizona the other states to look at
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:58,304	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	As well and
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:39:00,864	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Think about where other states may have
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:01,632	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Gone wrong
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:04,960	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Try to correct
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:06,240	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You know you said that
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:09,056	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Of the American states are Laboratories
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:10,080	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Democracy
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:11,360	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:14,176	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A result of different states
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:17,760	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Getting to tryout litigate vote for
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:19,808	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Yo draw maps how they want to
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:22,880	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Is that we get to see the results of a whole bunch of different
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:29,536	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And I do think the people in California were very thoughtful about the way that they wrote the law.
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:33,888	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So what do you expect will come out of Wisconsin case
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:37,984	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The million-dollar question
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:40,544	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Honestly I have no idea
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:41,312	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But I can tell you
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:44,896	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If Wisconsin Democrats win this case you will read in
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:48,224	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Plenty of newspapers Supreme Court and gerrymandering
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:51,552	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And I can tell you right now that
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:53,088	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That will be sick leave
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:54,368	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Ally
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:55,904	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:40:01,280	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If the Wisconsin Democrats win What will what it will actually do is start a very long process
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:03,840	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Determining what ultimately
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:05,888	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Is fair when it comes to
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:07,680	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Partisan advantage
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:09,216	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In drawing map
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:09,728	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Right
EDL	00:40:10,240	00:40:12,032	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I mean unless the Supreme Court says
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:18,176	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You know you have to use this statistical model and has to be within this percentage of baba baba baba blah blah
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:20,224	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Which I have no reason to
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:24,064	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Then it's going to start a process
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:24,832	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Of a
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:30,464	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A lot of different lawsuits that litigate this in different ways that ultimately try to land on
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:31,232	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	What is fair
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:33,536	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And you know what it could be
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:36,352	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We never really land on anything I mean
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:40,704	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That's what's happening with the Voting Rights Act right now is that we don't have a strong
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:41,472	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Conception
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:44,544	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Of what is fair in how much
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:45,056	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	The cluster
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:46,848	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Minority voters together
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:48,128	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Right
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:49,664	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That could end up happening
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:50,688	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	With partisan
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,200	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Gerrymander
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:55,808	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And you can say that's all worth it and we need to have that debate and
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:56,832	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You know
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:40:58,624	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You know
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:04,256	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We're happy for all the lawyers that are that they're going to be employed for the coming decade
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:07,584	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Off of all of these lawsuits but it's a conversation we need to have
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:08,352	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But you know
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:14,752	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Even if the Wisconsin Democrats don't win I don't think there's a conversation about gerrymandering goes away because ever seen even now in
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:15,264	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Pennsylvania
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:17,312	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	There are a lot of different Avenues
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:17,824	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Is to litigate this
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:19,616	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And so
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:21,408	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	No matter what the decision is
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:22,944	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In the Wisconsin Supreme
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:26,784	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I can promise you that this is going to be a conversation
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:40,608	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So why don't we just have computers draw District Lines
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:42,144	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Will Galen hasn't answered
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:43,424	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Fabulous
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:46,496	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Between the beats
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:48,800	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Bongs and chatter of our devices
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:52,128	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:53,407	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If
EDL	00:41:53,407	00:41:59,807	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:07,487	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	It is a creation of Sonic trash
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:10,815	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:14,399	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:31,199	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:32,991	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Flash podcast
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:39,135	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Tequila told me that when the gerrymandering project came out when the biggest questions they got from listeners
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:40,159	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	News about algorithms
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:41,951	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Why not take this
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:44,255	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Whole process out of the hands of humans
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:48,095	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And just use an algorithm to draw totally random boxes on a map
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:48,863	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	In some ways
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:50,655	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You could you just
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:55,519	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Write new laws saying that we want an algorithm to draw a nice neat shapes
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:56,031	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	On a map
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:44:01,151	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Probably the area where you run into the most trouble is the Voting Rights Act
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:07,551	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Which specifically requires that minorities not have their votes diluted enter sometimes
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:08,831	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Just drawing Maps
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:10,367	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Randomly according to shape
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:13,695	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Could potentially violate the Voting Rights Act
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:16,511	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	On top of that whether or not we're talking about a minority
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:17,279	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Community
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:21,375	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Often times people want their community in one District right
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:23,935	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If you're going to have a representative you want them to represent
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:24,447	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Something
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:27,775	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And so if you have an algorithm that draws the map randomly
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:32,383	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	People might not feel like they've been grouped together with their community
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:33,663	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	An algorithm cannot
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:36,223	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A hundred different
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:39,551	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Community meetings and listen to people talk about
EDL	00:44:39,551	00:44:40,575	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Where their Community is
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:42,879	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	If you work at
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:43,903	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	California
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:45,183	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Independent commission website
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:46,719	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	One of those like
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:47,743	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Commonly house Prussia
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:49,279	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Why doesn't an algorithm
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:53,375	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Algorithm can't listen to community property
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:56,959	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Galen is not against using algorithms and redistricting
EDL	00:44:57,471	00:45:03,359	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But he says they don't change the fact that drawing lines on a map forces you to make difficult choices
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:04,383	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	You still have
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:06,687	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Program the algorithm
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:08,735	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	To prioritize
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:12,063	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Certain values the same way that you would have to
EDL	00:45:12,063	00:45:15,135	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Construct a legislative body or an independent commission to do that
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:20,511	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	So you know in the program you have to say we want District to be compact
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:22,559	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Or we want
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:25,887	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Districts to respect existing Municipal boundary
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:29,215	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	We want you algorithm to make the district
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:29,983	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Competitive
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:34,847	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	I mean still itches like algorithm time value so I don't understand how it's all that all it really seems to
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:36,127	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Potentially solve is
EDL	00:45:37,151	00:45:38,431	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Calling Mathis doesn't get death row
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:43,039	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Right I think there are plenty of people who will tell you that algorithms
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:43,807	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Have
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:44,831	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	A place in this process
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:47,903	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	And yes it can make this process
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:50,463	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	Easier and potentially Fair
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:51,999	| 299_Gerrymandering_pt_01 |	But it's not a silver
