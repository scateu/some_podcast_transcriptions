EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:15,008	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Over the years I guess about 20 people have written to us suggesting that we

EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:35,232	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	West the date for the 1930s and they were part of the Transcontinental Airway system that help planes carrying mail
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:39,584	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Find their way across the US before the age of reliable radar and GPS
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:46,496	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	When they were operational they were painted bright yellow were accompanied by a tower topped with a bright rotating Beacon
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:51,360	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Today the towers and paint are long gone but many of the giant arrows remain

EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:03,392	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	There's not too much more of a story there
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:05,696	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I'm glad I know it I'm pleased about it

EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,888	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But ultimately
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:17,472	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The arrows are not something on which we can hang a whole episode
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:20,800	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	We come across these kinds of stories all the time
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:24,128	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Not Justa suggestions from the audience but in our own research
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,664	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	There are tons of little
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,688	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Interesting

EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:31,040	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Cut out of an episode or just
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:35,136	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Don't want it 6 weeks of production in 20 minutes of airtime for whatever
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:37,184	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But we still kind of love
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:41,536	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So as a little change of pace we thought we throw them all together
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:45,120	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	In a couple of episodes featuring me interviewing the 99 Pi crew

EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:49,472	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	That's what we've been calling
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,752	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I think you're going to take it
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:52,032	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I certainly had fun talking to
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:54,592	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So without further ado
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,104	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	First.
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,384	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Is Sam Greenspan
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:06,624	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	What are my favorite things about this job is that I get to go to research at the University of California at Berkeley Library
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,672	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	In the environmental design Library
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:13,280	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And it's a smart building
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:16,096	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The library itself has all these Vasily chair set
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:18,400	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Might actually be able to buy house but
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,168	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Anyway
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:25,568	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I was over there I was doing research on the story that would eventually become the plot of Zion which aired on the show last week
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:30,176	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Yeah that's that this is worried about those were the founders vision for the Church of Latter-day Saints in
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:33,760	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Pinto Lake City in their efforts to create like an Urban Brick of really big
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:34,528	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Exact
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:35,296	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Exactly
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:38,624	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I was reading this article just in my research there
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:40,672	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Called the Mormon Village
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:43,744	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Genesis and antecedents of the city of Zion plan
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:46,048	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	By Richard H Jackson published in the journal
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:49,120	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Brigham Young University studies 1977
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:54,240	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Here's the author of this article talking about how most towns west of Appalachia all kind of developed
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:57,568	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The same way and so Roman if you would read this quote from him
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:03,456	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The cities and towns which were founded during this period were remarkably similar
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:06,016	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	With the exception of Circleville Ohio
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:09,088	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Most town-plots consisted of a regular grid pattern
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,880	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	With straight streets Crossing at writing
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:12,672	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Ashley I
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,440	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I grew up
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:18,559	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	In Newark Ohio which is only about 30 miles away from Circleville Ohio so I know Circleville
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,607	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I don't know if I've been there like it famous for
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,911	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Mountains like an Indian Barrel
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:29,567	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Funny you should mention that will Circleville is also known for something else or maybe not known for something else but it has
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:32,383	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	A quite amazing history
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:35,455	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Up urban planning
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,991	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	To look so what did you find out
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,807	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Okay so from that one glib note in this
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:42,367	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	In this journal article about morning villages
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:48,767	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I found this other article in the Journal of the Society of architectural historians for 1955 Sky name John
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:49,791	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	BMW wraps
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,583	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And it had an article entitled
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,887	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Redevelopment in the 19th century
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,655	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Colon

EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:03,359	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Pickaway County Ohio named Daniel Dreisbach
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:07,199	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Was deputized to establish a new town will become the county seat
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:12,063	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Dreisbach decided on a piece of land to head to Native American Earthworks
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:17,183	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Mounds basically one in the shape of a square and one the shape of a circle in central Ohio
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,719	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	These types of melons are like
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,767	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Will incorporate into landscape still life
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:27,167	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I grew up going to Indian Mound Mall Newark Ohio and so they're in Newark they're in Circleville
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:31,519	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	They're all around there's a big their big part of the landscape and the carnival or
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,543	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And the Mystique
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,335	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Central Ohio
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,615	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And they really are like
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:39,199	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	In the center of the city like there was no regard for them they just put
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,223	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	City on top
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,015	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Of the mountain
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:44,831	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Circleville is totally case of that Daniel Dreisbach
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:47,647	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Just wanted to plop a city right on top of this
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,671	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Native American Mound
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:53,279	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But what he did that his contemporaries found so weird
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,839	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Was that he used the circular
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:56,863	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Earthwork
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:59,167	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	To build a city with a circular grid
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,983	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So normally so imagine we're kind of like
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:05,055	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Floating over a city you can kind of see
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,591	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	They're floating over Chicago right now
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,615	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Big
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:14,271	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Salt Lake City all kind of crossing at right angles
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:17,343	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It's just sort of like you know grid-like wrap paper
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,903	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So this looks more like
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,951	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The wheel of a pirate ship
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:25,535	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Right what's the steering wheel of a pirate ship
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,327	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	There's a storage Central node
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:33,471	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And an Android box plan there was the the county courthouse would be in the middle and there's kind of a big closet around
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,263	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And then there's
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:39,615	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	A circular Street around that and then another circular Street around that one
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:41,151	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It'll be sort of
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:44,991	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	These roads that I'll shoot off from the courthouse that all kind of connect
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,551	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Outwards that all lead back into
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,087	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The center of the Earth
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,879	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Which is all being formed
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,671	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Mighty circular
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,439	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Indian male
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,719	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Yeah I was sort of the framework
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:57,023	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Matt was going to give me idea
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,815	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Established
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,839	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The early eighteen hundreds
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,119	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	People start moving in
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:04,191	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But to the founder Daniel Dreisbach sis may
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,471	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The circle villains
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:06,239	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Heat it
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:08,031	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Like really really hate it
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:10,079	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It was dismissed as
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,639	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Childish sentimentalism
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:14,943	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	People complain that the round Street
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:16,991	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It's made for awkwardly shaped Lots
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:19,295	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The Builder house is kind of in a weird ways
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:22,623	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So 1837 about 30 years
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:26,719	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The people were so fed up with this circular grid
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,279	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	They appealed the Ohio State Assembly
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:36,191	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	They just wanted some Ohio
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:38,495	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Squaresville more less so
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,775	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	They hired a company
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:45,919	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Call the Circleville squaring company yeah
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:53,855	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And squaring company was hired to D Circle Circleville
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:57,183	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Two decades but eventually they were successful so
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:08:00,255	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Today if you go to Google Earth and you look up
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,279	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Circleville Ohio
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:04,863	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Zoom in
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:08,191	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It just does a grid it looks like
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,215	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Every other
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:10,751	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Bordentown
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:14,335	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	In central Ohio to Circleville square and Company was extremely excited
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,359	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	They did their job
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:21,759	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	For sure All That Remains are a few around the buildings I hear I haven't been there
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,527	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Never been changed
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:25,087	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Reminder have not yet called it squaresville
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,623	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And the City of Municipal seal
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:33,023	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	That's pretty nice it's like it's like
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:35,327	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It looks like the original Urban plan
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:37,631	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I believe that's Daniel box
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,399	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Original
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,423	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Drawing
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,703	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Or some some kind of
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,751	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Reproduction based on Dreisbach
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:45,823	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Original plan where you can see the courthouse in the middle and you can come see all the
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:48,383	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The other radio streets coming off of it
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:51,711	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Yeah it looks really cool pretty good co
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:53,247	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It reveals some good history
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:56,063	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	That's so cool I mean don't put on a flag that's a good to you
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:58,111	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Yeah I think it's like she just beat you know the
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,647	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	History of the Pirates
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:01,439	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	That would work
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,719	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	That would work
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:16,287	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So I'm Kurt Kolstad and I am the digital director
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,823	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	At 9% invisible
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,591	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	As well as I went
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,127	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	What is that mean
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:22,431	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Basically means I manage
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:24,223	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Content and design on the website
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:27,295	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So we produce articles for the website
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,831	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	We also please companion piece
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,599	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	For every episode
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,647	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	That contain additional materials
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:32,927	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Videos
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:33,951	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Lynx images
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:35,231	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:39,839	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	People listen via episode can go on the website listen to the episode but also surf around 4
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,351	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Traditional media
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,631	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Right
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,679	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So if you are listening tonight
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,215	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But you never been to the website
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:48,287	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	You are missing out because there's at least
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:51,103	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Two and maybe three more stories a week
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:52,383	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Better on the website
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:53,919	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	That
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,455	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Have nothing to do with what is being
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:59,039	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Write 2 in a lot of cases we have
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:03,903	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	An idea for a story and there's just kind of not enough there for
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:05,695	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	As to make a full episode
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:07,999	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But it wouldn't be long enough it wouldn't be in-depth enough
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:10,559	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Or simply to visualize a lot of cases
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,607	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	If it's something that
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:15,423	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	You need absolutely need to see a graphic
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:17,727	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	An image or a video for
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,263	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The subject matter to make sense
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:23,103	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	We're going to have to make that into an article instead of an episode
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:27,199	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But the topics are really the same it's you know it's built environments it's
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:27,967	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	CNN News
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:30,271	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	99% invisible things you see at the world
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,807	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Do not make sense of
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:38,719	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And it's a lot of cases these ideas they've been kicking around in the office for years and now they've kind of finally
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:40,255	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	An outlet in the form of what
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:41,791	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Which one is like
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:42,815	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Quintessential
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,839	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Really popular one that
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:44,607	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	That would be
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,911	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So the Dutch reach
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:51,263	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Has been a real hit this year and I don't think anybody expected
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,079	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It's a pretty short piece
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:56,127	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	How about a pretty simple fix
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:11:01,503	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Two pretty common problems that just resonated with listeners and readers in a way that nobody could have
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,039	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So what is the Dutch race
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:06,111	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Dutch reach is basically a technique
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:07,391	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	For keeping bikers
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,415	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Cyclist that is
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,695	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Scrum getting doored
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:10,975	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:16,095	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	If you're driving along you got a Viking Land on your right and parking to the right at bat
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:18,143	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And you pull over into a parking spot
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:20,447	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And you go to open the car door
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:22,495	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And a cyclist is coming
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,007	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	You might not see
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:26,591	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And that's because in part
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:28,383	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	You're opening the door with your left hand
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:29,919	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	If you're an American driver
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,199	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:35,295	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	You're just you know you look in the rearview mirror you might not spot them
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:41,439	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But there's one simple way to make sure that every time you open a car door you're looking to see if cyclists are approaching
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:43,231	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And that's by reaching over yourself
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:45,023	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	With your other arm to open the door
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,815	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Saloniture I have this
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,839	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So you pull over
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:51,167	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And instead of opening the car door with your left hand which
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,447	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Inclined to do
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:54,751	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	You reach over with your right hand
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:55,775	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And it causes you to come
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,311	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Westin look over your shoulder
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,847	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And really check
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:11:59,871	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	If there's a cycle
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:01,663	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Exactly
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,175	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,991	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It's very simple solution
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:08,575	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Doesn't have any Associated cost it doesn't take any extra
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:11,647	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Time Italy any driver could do in any bites of this
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,927	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Be grateful that
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:13,951	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The driver is doing
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:18,559	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It's a solution we can all relate to it something that deals with a problem built environment
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:22,143	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Probably isn't going to be fixed anytime soon other ways
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:28,031	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It just costs too much and takes too much time for cities to overhaul these systems course and Ideal World we'd have protect
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,543	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Bike Lanes
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:31,615	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And I need to know everything to be perfect
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,383	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:35,455	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	In the world we live in this Dutch reach solution
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,735	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Which comes from Holland
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:37,759	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Hence the name
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,807	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It gives drivers a way to
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:42,111	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	To do something simple that will help improve safety
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:42,879	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	She for everybody involved
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:46,207	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Interested
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:46,975	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	What's all that
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,743	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I just shared it
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:50,559	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Like crazy because it was something you could like understand quickly
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:53,119	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It's giving sort of common sense but it's one of the Great
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,935	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Like a perfect sort of story like the exes
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:58,495	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	You witness early figure out on your own
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,263	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But when you see it
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:00,543	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It feels like
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:04,639	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Exactly it's the kind of solution that once we
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:05,919	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Eurostar
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,967	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Teaching people to do this and driver's education
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:12,831	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It would just become second nature and we wouldn't even think about it as
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,623	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The Dutch reach it would just be
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,159	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The way you open a car door
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:21,279	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Cool
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:22,047	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	All right
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:22,559	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Thanks
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:40,735	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Tell me who you are

EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,415	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	To use came on like a few months ago
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,719	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Yeah I came in
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,231	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Help out when
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,511	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Delaney
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,023	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Wizometer
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,607	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	We decided to
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:00,447	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	What kinds of little stories that maybe
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:03,775	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	You'll be researched as producers and reporters butt
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:09,919	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Don't really quite qualify as a full nine NPI stories were there like little things were cut out of other stories so
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,455	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So what is you are a minister
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:16,575	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	This is a story about a special soccer stuff
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,879	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	TDM in the northern Brazilians
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,159	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	State of amapa
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,951	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Like a super remote status
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,047	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Order something
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,095	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	1000 people
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:29,631	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And

EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:33,471	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But there are a couple little
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:35,519	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The capital city
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:36,287	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Maca powder
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,567	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And

EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:41,151	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Is known or is assertive
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:43,967	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Visit there one of the things that
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:44,479	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	There
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:47,039	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Write on me
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,831	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Equator and the number of landmarks
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,623	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Signifies
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,903	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Where the equator is in the
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:52,415	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	City including
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:55,999	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	One of the Central Street is called Avenida equatorial which
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:57,791	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Rotten
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:59,839	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Supposedly along the Equator and has a red stripe
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,887	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Center of
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:04,447	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Of the street and another thing that sits
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,983	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Right on the equator is that the
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:06,751	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	City soccer
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:08,031	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Which is
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:10,335	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	10000 person
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,103	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Arena
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:13,407	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	That's called estadio Milton Correa
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:16,223	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Local soccer
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:16,735	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Bureaucratic
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:21,087	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But everyone just calls me meme
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:22,111	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The big 0
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,647	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	After after the stadiums
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:27,231	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Urbini equator is the 0
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:33,119	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The stadium itself sits on a latitude line video on the equator but that
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:35,423	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The equator runs directly
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:37,471	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Down the Midfield line of
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:38,751	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Death of the football pitch
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:39,519	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Soccer field
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:40,799	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And so
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:45,919	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Small Brazilian
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:49,759	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Professional soccer clubs but because of the midpoint lies the equator it's like
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,551	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Each side
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,575	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	In the game
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:58,719	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Is representing an entire hemisphere small local Club games are are really like
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:03,583	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Battle between North and South
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:09,471	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Middle East in Asia

EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,543	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And you know it
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:15,615	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	That's kind of all there is
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:19,199	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	My look up on YouTube some games in
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:23,807	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And she are you know for the sake of it here's a clip of someone scoring a goal
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:29,951	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The big 0
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:51,455	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Tell me your name
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:54,015	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	My name is Delaney Hall
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:54,783	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	What are you doing here
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:57,343	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I'm a reporter and producer
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,623	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Sometimes I edit
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,183	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So what is your mini story
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:06,303	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So my mini story actually came to us from one of our listeners
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:10,399	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Woman named Carrie Nugent from
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,679	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Because I was at a conference
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:12,959	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:15,263	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	She had on very memorably
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:17,311	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	A camouflage baseball hat
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,615	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	With orange letters that said
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:23,199	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Asteroid
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:29,087	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Yeah I mean she is an asteroid Hunter she's an asteroid scientist at
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:30,367	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Caltech
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:32,159	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And she actually has her own
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,719	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Podcast called space pod
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:38,815	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Where she talks with different scientists who study space
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:41,887	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So our listeners right in a lot
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,935	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Saying you should do story about this so you should
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:45,727	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It was right about that and
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:47,775	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Kerry suggested one that I
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,287	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Really like
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:49,823	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So what is about
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:53,151	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Before I can tell you
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:58,015	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	What carries suggested I have to back up a little bit so earlier this year there was this enormous
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:00,319	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Discovery in astronomy
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:06,719	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And there's an experiment called the laser interferometer gravitational-wave Observatory
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:12,351	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The shorter way to refer to it as ligo
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:16,447	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And scientists working on that experiment detected a signal
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,727	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	From space
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:19,263	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	They turned into a sound
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:20,799	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So I'm going to play the sound for you
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:35,903	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Am I listening for the one that one that's going
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:43,327	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	What that sound that sound is the sound of two black holes collide
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,119	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Riding an unleashing
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:48,959	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The energy of a million trillion Suns
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:55,359	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Doesn't actually sound like much and that's because the black holes Collide a bill
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,127	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Million years ago
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:19:03,039	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And so the sound has been traveling through space for all of those years getting fainter and fainter as it goes
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:08,159	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And by the time it actually reached us here on Earth it was just that little boy
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:12,511	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But the scientist amazingly
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:13,279	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Heard it
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:15,071	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Why is it so amazing
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:16,351	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Because it is the first
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:19,935	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Direct evidence of gravitational waves
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:20,959	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Which are
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:23,263	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Physically ripples in space-time
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:30,431	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And gravitational waves were predicted more than a hundred years ago by Einstein in his theory of Jen
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,455	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	General relativity
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:36,063	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And that Siri totally reimagined the rules of his
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:39,903	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Basically instead of a static framework
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,951	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Einstein had this Theory
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:44,255	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	That matter and energy
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,791	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Could actually do
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:46,559	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Stewart
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,839	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The geometry of the universe
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:50,143	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And create these ripples of grab
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:54,239	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And so he had theorized
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:56,031	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Do gravitational waves exist
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:59,871	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But this sound was the first evidence that there
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,383	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Real
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:07,295	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And so it basically was evidence that this wild Siri that Einstein had that have been mathematically prove
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:08,575	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Prevent
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,343	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It seems like
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,647	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Well
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:14,207	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Yeah yeah it was
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,231	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Kind of mind-blowing
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:18,303	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The discovery generated at
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,839	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	None of news
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:20,863	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Obviously
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:24,447	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But as carry our listener Rodan to point out
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:26,495	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	There is a design angle
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:32,127	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I'm always in favor of design angles
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:36,991	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	What she was interested in and what she said you should really look at is the instrument
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:41,343	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The machine that detected the sound
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,367	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Is amazing
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:44,671	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	An extremely
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:50,047	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	You know it would have to be sensitive in order to pick up a sound that's been
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:54,399	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Traveling through space and decaying for a billion years
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:57,215	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So Carrie said you should do a story about this instrument
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,007	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The detective the sounds
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:06,687	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Why did we do that story cuz it's so hard drive its like the Somme
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:09,503	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	How much technical detail will probably
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:15,391	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Saying things that are wrong right now even in a mini story it's just it's
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:22,304	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	You know it's too technically complex and sort of difficult to describe on the radio I mean the machine
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:22,816	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Peanuts office light
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:29,984	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Part of its in one part of the country and part of its another part of the gun is like
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:33,056	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Like stretch
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,592	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Really complicated but
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:39,200	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	There was this one element to it that that I love and that I think
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:44,576	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	We can do justice to right now
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:47,392	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So basically the detectors on this instrument
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:50,976	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	They had to be totally isolated
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:53,024	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	From the vibrations and noises of the outs
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:54,304	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	World
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,328	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Because
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:58,912	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Environmental noise might have interfered with what
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,424	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The scientist
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:01,472	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Actually trying to hear
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:04,800	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So they're trying to hear this tiny faint sound
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:08,384	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And then meanwhile there's just everyday noise all around them
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:11,712	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Trucks driving by
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:15,040	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	People talking rumbles of the Earth
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:15,808	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Wind
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:22,208	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	At everything
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:24,000	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	There might be a thunderstorm
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,792	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	All of that noise
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,328	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Can meth with
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:31,424	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So basically to deal with that
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:33,728	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The scientist first of all tried to isolate the
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:37,568	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And they put them in giant
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:41,152	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Isolate them from from all that outside noise
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:43,712	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And then on top of that
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:45,760	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	The experiment employed
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:46,528	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Two people
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:48,064	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Who were environmental Mana
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,880	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So their job is to figure out
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,672	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	How environmental sound
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:55,232	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Might interfere with the experiment
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:57,280	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Terry actually talked
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:59,072	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	To the guy who ran the Explorer
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:00,864	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Dr. Dave Ramsey
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:03,424	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	He's the head of ligo and here he is
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,472	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And they do tests
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:06,240	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So dope
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,776	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Speakers
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:10,592	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	In the vacuum time either vacuum tanks and you can
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:12,128	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Play your favorite Symphony and
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:13,664	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Measure its effect
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:18,784	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Yeah so they they play these recordings they did stuff like Brew play recording the
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,320	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Howlin Wolf
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:22,880	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And they even had a staff member
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:29,280	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Ride-away on his Harley to record the effect that the rumbling motor had on the
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:29,792	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Experiment
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,328	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Is a great entry
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:35,168	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	By the team that was doing the environmental monitoring
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:38,240	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Bubba rides off in a motorcycle
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:43,872	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Facility managers in Hanford and he was doing a test for
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:46,176	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And so over time they generated this
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:48,480	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Huge library of
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:52,576	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	What different kinds of Sonic interference might do to the experiment
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:55,904	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Genuine signal appeared
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:58,208	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	They would know
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:59,232	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	That it wasn't just
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:00,256	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Environmental noise
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:01,024	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I thought I was in love
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:04,352	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Did it wasn't Bubba
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:07,424	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It's hard to convey like how crazy it is
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:09,216	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Is the day were able to detect this sound
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:12,032	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Another crazy thing is they detected it
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:18,432	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Like right after they turned the experiment
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:20,224	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It was my mistake this is one of the biggest
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:21,504	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Side effects
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:27,648	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Discoveries ever yeah yeah and I I I really love this kind of science story or
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:30,208	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Or this detail about sort of depressed
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:34,560	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I'm just all the mundane everyday
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:35,584	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Stuff that can
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:38,400	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Get in the way of that grand Magna
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:40,960	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	That's okay
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:42,496	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So we should thank you
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:44,288	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Yes yes
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:47,104	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Tom so thank you dr. Carrie Nugent
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:48,384	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	She's one of our listeners
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:52,736	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And she did a whole interview with dr. Dave racing
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:55,040	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Is the head of ligo it's on her podcast
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:55,808	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	It's called space
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,576	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Pod
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:58,624	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	And she just know so much more about
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:03,232	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	If you have any questions or complaints
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:07,328	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	To read them the doctor New Delhi
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:17,824	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So that was many stories volume 1
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:19,872	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	In the final episode of 2016
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:23,968	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	I interviewed all the 99 Pi producers for this project
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:26,272	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	So you hear the rest of the crew on the 1st

EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,344	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	In the meantime
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:30,880	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	We're all going to take some time off
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:37,024	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	But I'd also like to use this time to collect a few mini story suggestions from you is kind of like
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:39,072	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	That I can talk about in between the stories
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:40,096	| 99pi_0241_ministoriesvolume1_1 |	Katie sarife
