EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,584	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Is frozen Muse
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:19,008	| 56-Frozen-Music |	It's only very recently in the history of music that we've been able to freeze music into an object
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:22,848	| 56-Frozen-Music |	In my life the form of the subject matter to lie
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:26,432	| 56-Frozen-Music |	One spot vinyl albums and cassette tapes
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:30,272	| 56-Frozen-Music |	And there were two first songs per album side a
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:32,832	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Inside B
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:34,880	| 56-Frozen-Music |	The energy of a first song
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:37,184	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Made it stand apart from the other songs
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:38,208	| 56-Frozen-Music |	At least my head
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:43,328	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Then the CD came along and eliminated side B and there was only one first song
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:46,912	| 56-Frozen-Music |	And the actual number of the track that you can see
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:49,472	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Prominently displayed on the CD player URI
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:52,032	| 56-Frozen-Music |	That became my index for sorting songs
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:56,896	| 56-Frozen-Music |	An MP3 is jumbled my sense of track order in albums begin to feel more like
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:00,480	| 56-Frozen-Music |	A loose grouping of individual pieces rather than a conceptual Hall
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:05,088	| 56-Frozen-Music |	I can do this all day and you're welcome to try man let's just let's totally has the Sound website
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,624	| 56-Frozen-Music |	But my point is this
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:09,952	| 56-Frozen-Music |	When it comes to music the form of the thing
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:10,464	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Matters
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,000	| 56-Frozen-Music |	But no effect
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,536	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Has-been is world-changing
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,072	| 56-Frozen-Music |	As the original innovation
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:18,144	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Freezing music in time onto a recording
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:21,984	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Or a single version of a song a single performance of a song
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:22,752	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Became
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,032	| 56-Frozen-Music |	The song
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:28,384	| 56-Frozen-Music |	This inherently mutable method of communication
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,176	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Was fundamentally changed
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,480	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Songs
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:36,064	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Astonishing things and I also don't think most people really
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:39,136	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Even know what they are
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:42,976	| 56-Frozen-Music |	That's the songwriter composer and producer Jon Brion
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,512	| 56-Frozen-Music |	No I didn't talk to John Bryan
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:46,048	| 56-Frozen-Music |	But I know people who did
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:50,912	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Jim derogatis and Greg caught are the hotel radio program I'm a huge fan of called sound opinions
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:53,216	| 56-Frozen-Music |	It's a rock and roll talk show
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:54,240	| 56-Frozen-Music |	And if certain
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:57,056	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Nietzsche snarky corners of the internet
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:59,872	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Have darkened or concept of Music journalism
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,920	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Sound opinions
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:04,224	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Is your beacon of light my friend
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,760	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Anyway
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:10,624	| 56-Frozen-Music |	John Brian came to WBEZ in Chicago to talk to sound opinions in 2006
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,904	| 56-Frozen-Music |	And at the time
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,440	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Brian Tedesco produced
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:16,000	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Kanye West album late registration
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:20,095	| 56-Frozen-Music |	He was also already well known as a film composer of a lot of really great movies
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:21,631	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Mini by Paul Thomas Anderson
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:27,775	| 56-Frozen-Music |	I heard the show broadcast on WBEZ while I was sitting in my car in a parking lot of a Taqueria in Logan Square
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:31,359	| 56-Frozen-Music |	And I thought about this section of their interview about
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:33,407	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Songs versus performances
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:34,687	| 56-Frozen-Music |	At least
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,479	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Once a month
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:36,991	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Since then
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,783	| 56-Frozen-Music |	For 6 years
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:43,391	| 56-Frozen-Music |	But only recently did it on me that this is a perfect 99percentinvisible story
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,183	| 56-Frozen-Music |	So here it is
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:47,743	| 56-Frozen-Music |	John Brian sound opinions in 2006
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:50,559	| 56-Frozen-Music |	I distinguish between
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:55,167	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Look for lack of better terms I call songs and performance piece
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:56,959	| 56-Frozen-Music |	And
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:02,335	| 56-Frozen-Music |	What most people like are specific performance as we've grown up in an era of
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:02,847	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Recording
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:05,151	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Had you know the very thing
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:06,687	| 56-Frozen-Music |	One of the very things I love
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,711	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Recording has
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:12,831	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Killed people's ability to hear songs purely as
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,343	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Core change
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,879	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Melody and
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:16,927	| 56-Frozen-Music |	It's a very
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:20,511	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Strange and beautiful art form cuz when it's right do you know it
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:21,791	| 56-Frozen-Music |	But
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,583	| 56-Frozen-Music |	What we have sort of Lost
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:24,607	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Is
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:27,423	| 56-Frozen-Music |	I don't know the best example I can give would be
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:27,935	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Led Zeppelin
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:33,055	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Those things are the ultimate performance pieces and I'm a big
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:36,127	| 56-Frozen-Music |	I think they're just absolutely astonishing
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:39,199	| 56-Frozen-Music |	And the sort of Dynamics they had
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:40,991	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Sorely lacking in
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:41,503	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Music today
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:43,807	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Record making is
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:44,319	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Great
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:48,159	| 56-Frozen-Music |	The true band in the sense that you really could
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,951	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Tell who the individuals
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,023	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Remarkable thing
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:58,399	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Consider most of those things
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,191	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Songs
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:03,263	| 56-Frozen-Music |	And the way I can sort of prove my point is
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:10,431	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Have you ever listen to anybody else play Led Zeppelin song and got all that was a great satisfying experience
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:13,503	| 56-Frozen-Music |	What people like is that
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:15,807	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Specific guitar sound
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,087	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Specific performance
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:18,367	| 56-Frozen-Music |	In concert with that
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:20,159	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Specific drum sound with that
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:21,695	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Pacific drummer playing that song
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:22,463	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Pacific Park
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:28,351	| 56-Frozen-Music |	And it's beautiful it's a beautiful thing they're all different types of art and creative expression
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:30,399	| 56-Frozen-Music |	However
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:32,447	| 56-Frozen-Music |	If I were to sit and go here
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:43,199	| 56-Frozen-Music |	And I can play
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:45,503	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Ghetto 30 others that
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,271	| 56-Frozen-Music |	That's the thing
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:50,879	| 56-Frozen-Music |	You know I know it could sound like a snobbishness it's not
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:52,671	| 56-Frozen-Music |	I love these records
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:54,463	| 56-Frozen-Music |	They're great
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:55,999	| 56-Frozen-Music |	However it is
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:59,071	| 56-Frozen-Music |	There's a difference between
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:06:59,583	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Is that
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,119	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Anna song
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,167	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Say a Gershwin song
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:07,007	| 56-Frozen-Music |	You could actually play in the style of Led Zeppelin and have it completely
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:10,079	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Satisfying experience all the time
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:16,479	| 56-Frozen-Music |	But when you start playing Zeppelin songs in the style of
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:19,551	| 56-Frozen-Music |	1920s music it suddenly it's laid bare that it's like
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:24,415	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Oh no it was about those people in those people were in a room that it was
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:26,463	| 56-Frozen-Music |	I was great and I love it
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,999	| 56-Frozen-Music |	But I considered a performance
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,023	| 56-Frozen-Music |	When I consider
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:31,583	| 56-Frozen-Music |	A lot of rock the people listen to be
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:32,607	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Performance
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:38,751	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Necessarily song so you know I heard you had the time you work here recently and there's a songwriter
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:40,799	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Comes into the band and goes
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,871	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Here's the thing I've got and then they you know
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:48,479	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Brock with holy hardness and and all the greatness they've got with them getting a room
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:52,831	| 56-Frozen-Music |	I mean that's part of what makes a band like Radiohead
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:54,623	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Stand out at second
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,415	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Record came out we all collectively went
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,207	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Oh my God
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:04,607	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Actual songs in this guy's an amazing singer
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,631	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Exactly what I mean
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,399	| 56-Frozen-Music |	Okay here
