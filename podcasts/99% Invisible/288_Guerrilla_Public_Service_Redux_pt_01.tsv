EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:22,336	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	It was early Sunday morning August 5th
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:24,384	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	2001 Los Angeles Califor
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:28,992	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Richard ankrom and a group of friends were on the 4th Street Bridge
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,016	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Of the 110 freeway
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,064	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	They were about to commit
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:35,648	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Give me a high-profile dangerous situation
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:37,952	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Natalie can I get arrested I could kill somebody
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,720	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Really
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,000	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Was terrified of that
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:40,768	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	But let's back up
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:43,328	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	About 20 years prior
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:48,192	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Richard ankrom an artist living in Orange County was driving north on the 110 freeway
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:50,240	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	As he passed through downtown Los Angeles
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:53,056	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Who's going to merge onto another freeway
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:53,824	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Dye I-5 North
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:56,128	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	You missed the exit got lost
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,920	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	For some reason
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:58,944	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	It just stuck
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:06,368	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Years later when Richard moved to downtown Los Angeles he was driving on the same stretch of freeway where he got lost at
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,392	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Decade before
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:11,744	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	We looked up at the Big Green rectangular sign suspended above
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,280	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	I realize why I missed the exit
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:14,816	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Because it wasn't
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:16,352	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Adequately signed
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:17,632	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Bad wayfinding
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:21,728	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	The exit for the I-5 wasn't indicated on the green overhead sign
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,776	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	There was even a big open
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:27,104	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Space where there should have been a blue and red Interstate Shield
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,384	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And above that
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,920	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	It should have said north
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,968	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	It was clear to Richard
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,480	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Caltrain
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:35,040	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	California Department of Transportation
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,064	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	I made a mistake
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:42,464	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Sir Richard and artist and sign painter decided to make the Interstate 5 North Shield himself
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:46,304	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	In the place he thought it should have been all along
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:48,096	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	High above the 110 freeway
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:51,936	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	You would call it an act of Guerrilla public service
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:53,728	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	I would like to do is to be

EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:56,800	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Ord
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:57,824	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Or actually to show
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:03:59,616	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	What you can do with artwork

EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:08,064	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Richard started by studying LA freeway sign
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,624	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Holding a Pantone swatches
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,648	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Perfectly matched

EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:16,768	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Did dangled over Bridges to measure the exact dimensions of other signs
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,047	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And most importantly
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:22,911	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	He downloaded the Necronomicon of California road signage

EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:02,847	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And why
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,663	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Less than eight

EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,071	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	It wouldn't be obvious

EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,111	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	He took me to the
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:18,879	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	The spot
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:19,647	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Xiaomi
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,415	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Stashed
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:23,231	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Okay we're basically here
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:27,583	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Right now the it isn't that fit but it was a lot thicker and I had
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:31,423	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Play sweet but I not trade stash the ladder and the sign
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:34,239	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	After he hit his things
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,263	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	He climbed a tree
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:36,543	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	I just sat there
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,591	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Don't do everything
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:43,455	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	I just heard calm myself down by being there and hang around with it and I
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:43,967	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	4
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:47,039	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Richard was worried that he might drop the sign
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,599	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Onto the road below
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:51,647	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Drivers going 60
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:54,207	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	B+ miles an hour would have no time to react
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:56,511	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Something landed on the road in front of them
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,303	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Or Worse onto their car
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,095	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	That was a scariest
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,375	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Saying about
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:02,911	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Somebody got hurt
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:07,519	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Project
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,823	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	It would have defeated the whole
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,591	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Idea
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,639	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	But despite some reservations
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,407	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Richard was
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:13,919	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Pretty confident
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,199	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Call the Whole Thing Off
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,479	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,759	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	He gone too far to turn back
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:23,135	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And that brings us back to the morning of August 5th
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:23,903	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	2001
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:30,303	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Richard did not act alone he asked several friends to film the insulation from different Vantage points
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:33,887	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Amy inoue was one of the friends he Enlisted the film
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,655	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	We did it
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,959	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	6 a.m. or 7 a.m. on
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:37,471	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Sunday morning
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,263	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	It was tense
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:40,031	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,055	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	We all thought we were going to
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:49,759	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Richard had chosen the Sunday morning to put up the sign knowing that there would be little traffic and The Morning Light Rising above
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:52,319	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	The skyscrapers would be just right for filming
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:59,231	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	What he hadn't anticipated was that Caltrans at also picked that morning to do work on the same stretch
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,999	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Batch of Highway
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:02,303	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Yes they happen to be doing some other work
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:04,095	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	On the freeway
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:04,607	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Just south of
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:07,679	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	When they saw the Caltrans workers
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,959	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	They thought about turning back
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:13,567	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	But I had surmised after all this is a pretty large city there be more than one sign
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:16,639	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	My assumption was that think the other guy was too
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,687	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Richard Park his truck
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,991	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	When everyone was in position with their cameras
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:21,503	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	You went to work
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:24,319	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	The hardest part was getting over the razor wire
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,087	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	With the ladder
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:28,671	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Once he was up on the catwalk really 30ft
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,183	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	About the highway
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:31,743	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	He started screwing in the new sign
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,023	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Careful not to drop any
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:33,791	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Screws
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:34,303	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Cars below
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,095	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Halfway into it
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:36,863	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	We just
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,143	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Felt like okay
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:44,287	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Lincolnway with it or what.
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,359	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	The whole thing took less
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,383	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	30 minutes
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:49,919	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	As soon as it was up
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:52,735	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Richard pack up his letter rushed back to his truck
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:58,623	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Blended back in the city awesome
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:08:59,647	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	I think we all went out
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:03,743	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	We're super relieved in
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,255	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Really happy
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:11,167	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Only a small group of people knew that the Interstate 5 shield with the word North hanging above the 110 freeway
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,191	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Was it work
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:14,751	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	He didn't stay to us Don't Tell Em
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:17,311	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	So our friends all knew about it
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,175	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Happy
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,223	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	But it never
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,527	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Tweaked-out
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,599	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	For a while
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,111	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	For a while
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:32,159	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	For nine months
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:34,207	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	The secret stayed within a small community
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:36,511	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And then Richard sprengeri
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,791	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Repeat the story
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:43,167	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	What the hell Gary why can't you be cool just be cool Gary Richard Secret
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:45,215	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Without the Caltrans
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:49,823	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And the Press from the fake magnetic sign on his beat up blue truck
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:56,223	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Work order proclaiming rush but it is against the law to Capron says it has no plans at all without charge
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:58,783	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Cards Against actually found out what happened
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,575	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Apparently they sent a crew out there to inspect
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:04,415	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Richard was hoping to get it signed back from Caltrans after they took it down
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:06,719	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	He was thinking you would hang it in an art gallery
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:10,303	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	But Caltrans didn't take the sign down
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,607	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	The Caltrans inspection
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,887	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Cuz that's really that
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,655	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Define elope

EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,215	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	How good the artwork is
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,263	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	It stayed up for 8 years
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,823	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	9 months and
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,871	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	14 days I believe
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:24,639	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	It's not exactly
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:25,663	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Pretty close to
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:31,039	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Interviews about the incident with other news organization
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:32,831	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Caltrans didn't exactly
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,623	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Dawn Richard's handiwork
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,415	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	They were pretty kind about
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:38,207	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Here's the Caltrans spokesperson
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:41,535	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	At the time he did a good job but we don't want him to do it again
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:45,375	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And in fact you did such a good job that I'd like to offer him a job application
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:48,191	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	More than eight years after Richard sun went up
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:51,263	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	He got a call from a friend who noticed some workers taking it down
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:55,103	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Richard contacted Caltrans to ask if he can have his signed back
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,639	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	By the time I tracked him down
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:58,175	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	It already been crushed
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:58,943	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Bale
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,455	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Going for
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:01,503	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Who knows what it turned into
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,271	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	You could be a waffle iron
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:08,159	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	After Caltrans took down Richard sign they replaced it with a brand new one
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,951	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	But this time
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:11,743	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Incorporated his ideas
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:12,767	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Into the new design
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:15,583	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	They out of the 5 north and The Shield
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,607	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Not only
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,631	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	That's fine
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,911	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	What to do additional one
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,423	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Up the road
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,079	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	A little epilogue
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:30,687	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Richard's highway sign is a happily Ever After Story the sign work
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,479	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	People appreciated it
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,759	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	No one got hurt thankfully
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:37,087	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Even Caltrans was really pretty nice about the whole thing
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:44,255	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	There's another gorilla sign story out of New York City a group that calls itself the efficient passenger project has been hanging
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:46,047	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Find in New York subway station
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:47,071	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	To tell people
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:50,143	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Where they can board the train to make the most efficient transfer
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:55,263	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	The project is not at all affiliated with the Metropolitan Transit Authority
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:57,823	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	But the signs look just like MTA sign
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:00,127	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Black with white helvetica lettering
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,151	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	They say things like
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:04,223	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Bored here for best transfer to the 4 5 and 6 train
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,783	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Board here for best transfer
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:08,319	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	F&M trains
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:14,719	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	It's the kind of knowledge that you build up over time as a regular Subway Rider and this gorilla sign maker is offering
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,999	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	To everyone
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,047	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	I know some of the plot of the signs
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,327	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Not all New Yorkers are
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:22,399	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	These are secrets some say
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:28,799	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	People should have to earn unbalanced the cars they say leave signage to The Experts
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,335	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	The MTA for their parts
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,383	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Is taking down the signs
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,663	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	As fast as they go up
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:35,967	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz

EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:08,031	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	The efficient passenger project isn't the only group that's gotten ambitious with modifying New York City subway signage
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:14,175	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	99p ice Kirk Olson is here to talk about a similar intervention and some other creative works of gorillas
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:19,551	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Thank you actually led me to the story of a Rhode Island School of Design Sue neighbor Ryan Murphy
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:22,879	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Also took up the challenge of Subway signage
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:27,999	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And his project was pretty simple but also pretty clever he installed a bunch of signs
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:31,327	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	About exits at eye-level about 5 feet up
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:32,607	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	On stair risers
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:37,983	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Daddy was that train passengers looking at the staircase from below could then figure out if those steps would take them
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:38,751	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Where they wanted to go
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:43,103	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Stair risers are basically the flat front of a stair that you see
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,127	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	From the front
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:47,199	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Yeah so think you walking up the staircase it would be
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:53,599	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Right in front of you and you just have to look at it and be like oh yeah that's the exit I want to be able to get a more easily find a way
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:56,671	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	The system is a lot of real estate that signs to Havant
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,695	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Occupied all that much
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:01,023	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Ashley and of course
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:07,167	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Like the other sign project has got taken back down and clearly the empty is not particularly open to gorilla
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:14,591	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Snopes there they're not have you covered a bunch of these on the website over the years ohyeah Super entry Buddies
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,871	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Kinds of gorilla public service
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,943	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And those unpaid activist who do them
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:22,527	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Creative people who see everyday problems as Civic design Opera
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:25,343	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And mostly of course there were cats removed
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:29,183	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	But in some cases these projects actually lead to something more permanent
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:32,255	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Kind of like the highway sign that David talked about in our peace
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:35,839	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Exactly end up here in Northern California there's another group called
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,399	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	The San Francisco transformation eejit
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:41,983	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Which is of course a spoof on the city's Transportation agency
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:46,591	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And their crew has illegally built a number of gorilla bike Lanes around the city
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:51,455	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And often they just kind of Barclays out with ordinary orange traffic cone switch
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,991	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	So you can just pick up and haul off
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,807	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Since I get taken away with a mainly due
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,343	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Is highlight
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,367	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Design problem
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:58,879	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	With the current
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,183	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Yeah in a lot of cases
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:07,839	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	But in late 2016 they decided to create a protected bike lane on a stretch of road along Golden Gate Park
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,887	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And they use what are called Soft
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,167	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Or see if hit post

EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:22,175	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And these provide a visible and physical presence but they're also easy to knock over so they don't really pose a danger to
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,991	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	But instead of just taking the post
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:27,295	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Style and the city did something pretty remarkable
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:31,647	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	They agreed to run with the idea and it's all protected van on that same spot
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:34,463	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Legal reasons I couldn't just leave up the post-credit
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:36,767	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Same idea
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:42,143	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	I mean it seems like a pretty big win for like a really small group of people that are activists for bike safe
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:45,727	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Yeah it was totally a 3-point shot for these guys at the transformation
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:50,079	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	But there are three goals of one drawing attention to unsafe conditions
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:56,223	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	To increasing safety for cyclists and pedestrians and three getting the city on board with more rapid and effective safety
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:18:00,063	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And so this is I mean we talked about ones that happening
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:01,087	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	California
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:03,903	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Rena Ware particularly Rowdy bunch of
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:07,487	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Leftists in such a mean does it happen another places
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:11,583	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Yeah it does not totally unique to California and
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:14,143	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Cruising your cabinet install gorilla bike Lanes
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:20,031	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Ellen Seattle there's this group called The reasonably polite seattleites that actually made a lane
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:22,079	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	They got taken down with initially
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,895	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	He was like really nice about it
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:30,271	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Politely offered to return the post to the installers and then finally they actually agreed that
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,551	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Just put that girl away
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,319	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Backup
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:38,719	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	There's activity andele there's activity in San Francisco activity in Seattle is this a West Coast liberal thing
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:45,119	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	It kind of seems like there's a lot of that I talked to you earlier this year
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:47,679	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Call the San Francisco Public bench project
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:54,079	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	2nd and everything isn't so much about Road Safety is it is about just making the city a nicer place to live by installing free
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:54,591	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Free benches
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:58,431	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	So I contacted their founder 499 Pi feature and he said
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:03,807	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Basically like he's been on boards and committees he's worked on promoting public space but he really finds his
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:09,439	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Building benches to be more rewarding and over the past 40 years he's actually installed
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:11,487	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Or 70 benches around the city
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:14,047	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And he keeps improving his design as he goes to
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:15,839	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	It's so how does that work as heat
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:22,239	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Never gets permission to do emerges doesn't Rogue no matter what
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:28,639	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Make them cheaper these loopholes in the city codes which allow for sidewalk Furniture if you can of meet the right guy
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:31,711	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Criteria and you don't obstruct sidewalk so you have found a gap
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:32,223	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	To put them in
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:36,831	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	In most cases he requests a bench for a specific spot
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:38,623	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And then they agreed to keep an eye on it
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:41,695	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And then if the community feedback is positive the bench becomes the
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:47,583	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Does permanent picture of the neighborhood and he also offers tablets instructions to anybody who wants to can I DIY this and
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:48,863	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Take up the mantle
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:55,007	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Okay so it's easier to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:58,591	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	3 got interventions and built spaces like roads and sidewalks but
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:02,687	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Activity related to Green spaces to
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,711	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Indeed there is
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:10,111	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	The freeze Guerrilla gardening covers a lot of ground but essentially refers to any active planting where people
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,135	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Aren't supposed to plant
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:14,975	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	So give me a garden without a permit would be a sort of simple example
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:16,767	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And these can be about
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:19,839	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Beautification activism food production or a combination
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:22,911	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Does Little League Grassroots reaction to

EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:28,799	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Yeah a lot of cases it can be pretty small-scale and incremental like filling in vacant lot
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:30,591	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Where to get a nicer Greenery

EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:57,215	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And not all the interventions are just about
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:21:00,799	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Beauty really they're they're trying to create something functional on the environment
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:06,431	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Yeah I'm into this group in San Francisco of gorillas grafters and their idea is I mean
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:11,039	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	We have a lot of greenery but it's mostly
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:13,599	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Is they don't want fruit creating messages attracting animals
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:18,720	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And these guys are grafting fruit bearing branches on the trees in the city
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:20,512	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	To try to provide like local food source
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:22,816	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	Wow
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:28,960	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	And they don't care about the food messes and stuff well I think I think that their idea is that you know the good outweighs the bad
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:35,360	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	So far these interventions have been about creating a better Urban environment for the public good
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:39,456	| 288_Guerrilla_Public_Service_Redux_pt_01 |	But not every single one of these sign changes are doing it
