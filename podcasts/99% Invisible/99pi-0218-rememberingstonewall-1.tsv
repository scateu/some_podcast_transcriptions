EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:49,663	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	And so we all had to sit down at our table
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:52,479	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	And we would be sitting there almost like school children
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:57,343	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	And the cops would come in now depending on who is on which cop was on

EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,871	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	The place would be so dimly lit
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,431	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	But as soon as the cops are going to come in
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:58,271	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	The collected percentage of whatever they were coming in for

EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:20,287	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	And you say show me your identification and they all take out their identification
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:23,359	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	And file out and and that's it and you say okay

EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,727	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	Nothing would have stopped us
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,263	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	I guess

EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:17,791	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	As we were bringing the prisoners out they were resisting
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:21,119	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	People started gathering in front of the

EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,295	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	As we put her in the car
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:42,623	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	Open the door on the other side and jumped out
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:46,975	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	At which time we had to chase that person
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:48,511	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	And
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:53,119	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	He was caught but back into the car
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:56,959	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	Made another attempt to get out the same door the other door
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:13:00,543	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	And at that point we had to handcuff the

EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:07,711	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	From this point on things really began to get crazy

EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:38,687	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	They pretended for sure and she turn around and she matched the top with a high heel
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:44,575	| 99pi-0218-rememberingstonewall-1 |	She knocked him down and then she proceeded to first come for her have the keys to the handcuffs I wanna
