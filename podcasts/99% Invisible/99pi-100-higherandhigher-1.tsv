EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:46,111	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	While the Chrysler Building was
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:49,695	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Sort of make a monument to what Chrysler had achieved but also
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,255	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	New ground in Ark
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:59,679	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	At the time Cass Gilbert Woolworth Building
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,215	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Towered over everything
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:03,519	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	792 ft tall
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:07,359	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	What's the tallest building in New York and in true Monument to me fashion
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,407	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Chrysler set his sights
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:10,943	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	On his building being taller
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,735	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And the Woolworth Building
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,759	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The tallest
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:14,271	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	In the city
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:19,903	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And even though the Manhattan company building didn't quite have the same motivation to be the tallest
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:20,927	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	To celebrate
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:22,207	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	One man's greatness
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:24,767	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The team decided that they wanted to take
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:26,815	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And be the tallest
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:31,167	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	I think the motivation initially for the Wall Street Building for the Manhattan company building
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,191	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Is
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:35,775	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	One because of the cost of land downtown in Worcester
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,311	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	You have to build High
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:40,383	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	You know got their spreadsheets out and decided
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:42,175	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Exactly how high that would be
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:47,551	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And then they decided to go a little bit higher to have the in-form otter of the world's tallest building which
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,087	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	When your
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:52,159	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Selling office space is something that is real estate agent
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:54,719	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	You consider hand out a car and says do you want to work
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,743	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	In the world's tallest building
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:58,303	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	So it was a
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:58,815	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Sales tax
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:00,607	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	As well as an economic
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:03,423	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And so the race was on
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,703	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	2x partners
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:06,239	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Van Allen with the Chrysler Building
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,775	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	In severance
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:09,055	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	With Manhattan company building
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,591	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	We're going to battle it out
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,615	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Supremacy
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,639	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	On the skyline
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:16,479	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Initially the Chrysler Building was the first to announce that side
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,783	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Chrysler and then I'll wait a little bit further along
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:23,903	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And so they announcing early 1929 that they're going to
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:25,439	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Roughly 822
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,743	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Star than the
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:30,815	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Woolworth 792 a couple months after that
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:33,375	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Greg Severance comes out and says we're building
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,399	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	To 840
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:37,471	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And then you have this over the course of
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:38,751	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Of that year
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:42,079	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Tickly that summer even as the buildings are going up
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:45,407	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Setting the foundation even as their War during Steel
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:48,479	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Then Island and Severance are both changing their plans
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:51,807	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Both not knowing what the other person is doing but sure
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:52,575	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	That
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,367	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Their respective bosses
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,135	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Want to go higher
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,951	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And I think at this point they very much want to beat each other
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:59,743	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	But it wasn't just a high price
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:01,535	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	It was also a speed race
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:06,655	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	At the point in the in the summer of 1929 when both of these buildings are going up very fast
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:09,215	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	It's it's very much who can
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:11,263	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Did the Woolworth Building first hookah
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:13,567	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Get out release that first statement saying
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,591	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	World's tallest building
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,895	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	In the public was into it
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,175	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	It was a race
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:19,455	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Almost weekly
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	There were
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:21,759	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Newspaper articles
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,527	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	About
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:28,415	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	This buildings going higher Christ was going to be 900 ft man Company Billings going to be 950 ft
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:35,583	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Severn twins premature statements and it was very much covered in the press and in all
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,887	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Call the New York newspapers of that time which were many
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,447	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Front page photographs
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:40,959	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	It was pretty incredible
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:47,615	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Pitbulls Chrysler and vanilla we're not content just being the fastest on the toilet
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:50,943	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Remember that I'm going into Chrysler's office
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,479	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Chrysler's on the floor
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,527	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	You know with plans spread out on the carpet
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,575	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Looking at how the lobbies going
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,343	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Shut up
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:59,647	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Walter Chrysler was very interested in Arden arcade
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:02,207	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And so he wanted a beautiful building
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,535	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	A building like none other in the world
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:10,911	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Meanwhile at the Manhattan company building they see what's happening on the Manhattan company building is there just adding floors
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:16,543	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Thirsty well the foundation will be able to do this if we had four floors if we had 10 floors
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:21,407	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	We are at the top we can go higher so it was almost incremental movements
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,175	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Honda Manhattan
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:27,807	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	On the Chrysler Building they were achieving the last-minute height advantages in two ways
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,831	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	1
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:32,415	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Originally the Dome of the Chrysler Building at Arch Dome was
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,439	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	What's much more
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:36,511	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Compact as you see it now it's almost like it's stretched out
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:39,071	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And that happened because of the height race
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:41,887	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	I wanted to find more floors it wanted to get
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,655	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Tim Moore height
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:47,263	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And so that elegant elongated Dome that we love on the Chrysler Building
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:49,055	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Was the result of this silly I Rise
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:53,919	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	But the sneaky masterstroke that ultimately led the Chrysler Building to
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:56,479	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	It surpassed the Manhattan company building for good
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,783	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Was the gleaming Spires
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,551	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Called
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,063	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The vertex
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:05,951	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And that was 185 foot triangular Spire that was built
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:09,023	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Inside the stairwell basically the fire
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:09,535	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Stairwell
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:12,095	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Inside the building at the top of the building
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:14,911	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Manhattan company building had no idea what we
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,191	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	What's going on if brought up each
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,215	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Peace separately up
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:18,495	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The side of the building by Derek's
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:23,359	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Instructed it inside the fire tower in one day at the Manhattan company building
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,639	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Finished top.
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,431	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	No chance to add any more floors
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:27,455	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Suddenly
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:29,503	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Best concealed vertec
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,831	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	From inside the building
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:37,439	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And it's better now I'm sad sort of like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	They put this thing on top of the building
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,511	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	It was 185 ft
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,071	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Tall and made the Chrysler Building
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:43,839	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	1000
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:44,863	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	46 ft
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,655	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Hi in the tallest structure in the world
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:48,191	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Now surpassing the Eiffel Tower
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,727	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And if you're thinking
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:52,799	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	This is stunt of secretly riveting a giant metal
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:56,127	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Expired 900 feet in the air sounds ridiculously dangerous
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:56,639	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	You are
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:02,783	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Is extremely dangerous I I can't imagine today it not getting approval everyone basically
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,295	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Thinking from
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:05,599	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Chrysler the Van Allen is this thing
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:06,879	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The fall
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,695	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And if it does you going to impale half a street
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,231	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Armoire
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,023	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And you can imagine the damage that would have
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:17,887	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Now you probably know and can clearly picture the now-classic
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,679	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Art Deco style of the
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:22,495	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The steel-clad arches
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:23,775	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Sunburst
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:25,311	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Triangular windows
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,847	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Not to mention the hood ornament
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,127	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Eagles
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,407	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And the hubcap freezes
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,455	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	It was made for a car guy
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,503	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	But it's doubtful
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,271	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	That you
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:36,063	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Even heard of them and Company
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,343	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	First
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,623	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Because now it's called 40 walls
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:41,439	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Building
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:43,743	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	But also
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,047	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Cuz it just never took hold in the public hunting
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,071	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	You know
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:53,215	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Curiously the Manhattan company building 40 Wall Street got all the accolades
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:54,751	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	It won awards
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:57,567	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The design was mostly by this Japanese architect
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:59,103	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Yasuo Matsui
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:01,407	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	So we did in a wonderful and in the trade
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:03,967	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And it was just basically a fairly Bland look
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,575	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And then you have the Chrysler Building with this
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:11,135	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	New Dominus nuvertex something
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:13,951	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Really new yorker the world has never seen
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:15,743	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	It was pretty remarkable stuff
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:18,303	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And it was almost Universal
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:21,887	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Sleep and it was considered a stunt design
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:24,703	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Some people called it a monstrosity know it was
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:31,103	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Largely reviled by architectural critics and it was only overtime at the Chrysler Building
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:32,127	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Became the sort of
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:33,151	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Hazard landmark
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:38,783	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	That it is and if the story stop there you might think Van Allen the artistic Maverick won the day
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,575	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The Chrysler Building
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:43,391	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	What's the tallest structure in the world and even though
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:45,951	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Design with Pandora Jewelry we all know that
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,975	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Eventually got it
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,743	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Do
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,511	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	But the story
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:50,047	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Does not in there
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:52,351	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	After all this hubbub
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:55,679	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Partner against partner fighting for who would be the tallest
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:57,727	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Amir 11 months later
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:13:00,543	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The great Empire State Building was completed
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:03,103	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And it became the tallest building in the world
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,639	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	For nearly 40 years
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:06,431	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Brinkley
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,455	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	I don't care about that so much
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:08,735	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	What happened next
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,015	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Was the real trash
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:12,575	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The lack of business acumen
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:15,647	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	That probably contributed to the Van Allen and Severance parting ways
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,951	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Really came back to buy
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,719	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	William Van alen
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,279	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	He never actually had a contract
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:23,583	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	With Walter Chrysler to design the Chrysler.
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:24,607	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Chrysler
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:28,191	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	At the end of the the day so I'm not going to pay you your feet
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,215	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Sweden have a signed contract
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,263	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	It was widely sort of
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:34,591	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Considered normal at the time for the architect to be paid
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,127	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Roughly 6% of
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:37,663	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The cost of the building
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:40,991	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	That sum of money is is what van all expected
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:43,039	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	What Chrysler was willing to pay
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,831	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Van Allen ended up soon Chrysler
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,879	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The newspapers
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:47,647	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,671	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	At the end of the day
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:49,951	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Cass Gilbert
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:51,231	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Woolworths
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,255	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Came inside you
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:52,767	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Yes
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:53,791	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Percentages
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,327	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Typical rate
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,095	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	That's what man on ship
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,399	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And I wanted that
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:01,215	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	But then Allen was never given a major Commission
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:01,727	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Again
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:06,847	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Both because the Great Depression in head
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:09,919	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And also because he had now sued his Patron
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,199	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And that was something
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:11,711	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Things that I think
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:12,735	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Others
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:13,759	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Shied away from
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:18,111	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Ben Allen spent most of the rest of his life teaching sculpture
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,903	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The bozarts Institute of Design
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:22,463	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	But Severance on the other hand
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,999	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Continue to succeed
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,791	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The Manhattan company building
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:29,119	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Did terribly like every other office building
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:32,447	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	In New York at the time but Severance you know when into
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:33,983	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The depression and
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:37,055	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Got a bunch of government work actually built a bunch
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,079	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Hangers for
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,615	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Her balloons and such
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,919	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And so he did quite well and
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,455	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Live nicely in
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,735	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Died in luxury
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:46,271	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	So that's at least 1/2
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:49,087	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	But we do have a happy ending the fact that
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:50,111	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The Chrysler Building is so sore
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,391	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Howard Stark
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:55,231	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And then Alan we did get the commision of a lifetime
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,279	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	There was no expense spared by
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:57,791	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Chrysler
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,583	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	If you ever go into
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:00,095	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The Chrysler Building
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,911	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	From the lobby all the way to the
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,423	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The top I mean
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:04,447	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Just
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:05,727	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Expense
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:07,519	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Inexpensive
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,543	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Expanse images

EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:16,991	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Just an incredible building

EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:19,551	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	The bottom inside and out
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:22,111	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And very rarely do you have
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,671	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Commission where money is no object
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:28,255	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	In Savannah on was given one shot and I think he can
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:33,119	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Greg Severance was standing in front of me
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,143	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Think I'd say
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:36,959	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	I wish you worked it out with Van Allen
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:37,983	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	You did well
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:38,495	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	You deserved
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:40,031	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	I think
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,311	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	You would have been greater
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:41,823	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Together
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:45,151	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And if I could talk to Van Allen
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:45,919	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	I'd say
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:48,479	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	I'm sorry you didn't get the Biltmore great structure
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:50,015	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	But no
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,551	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	That you created the building
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:57,695	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	I can stop the most architectural e blind and generally disinterested person dead in their tracks
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,487	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And they will Marvel
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:00,511	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	At your accomplice
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,047	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	No
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,631	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	And to Walter Chrysler
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,143	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	I'd say
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,447	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	You
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:10,751	| 99pi-100-higherandhigher-1 |	Pay your bills
