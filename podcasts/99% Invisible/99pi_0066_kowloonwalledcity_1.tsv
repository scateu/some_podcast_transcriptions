EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:45,472	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	But smack in the middle of that territory known as Kowloon was an enclave that wasn't included in the
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:51,360	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	A place that would at least officially still be controlled by the Chinese
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:53,152	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	It was a large fort
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:56,992	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Built decades earlier to put a check on British expansion
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:59,808	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	But it evolved into something very
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,344	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Very different
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,928	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	This was the first

EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:14,400	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Taking it in yet
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:18,240	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	The first analogy that the mind is it looks a little bit like the

EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:24,384	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	It's a city block
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:28,736	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	We're not looking at a neighborhood
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:29,760	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	That's nestled in
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:30,272	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	In the city
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,320	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	We're looking at

EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:34,880	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	But that is in the middle of nowhere

EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:44,096	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Staggering
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:47,680	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	That's my friend Nick vanderkolk from the program love and radio show me photos
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:50,240	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	He was the first person who told me about
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,008	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Display
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:52,288	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	It became known
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:54,336	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Is Kowloon walled City
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:57,664	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	And even of the walls eventually came down its name was still appropriate
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:01,760	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	There was no mistaking the boundaries between it and the rest of Hong Kong
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:07,648	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	I just became a waltz 13-story high-rises overlooking a comparatively sparse Waters
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:10,208	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Buildings evolved
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,768	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Drawing tendrils of bridges
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,304	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Pipes and wires
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,584	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Encroach on other building
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:18,912	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Until the city turned into a single giant organized
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:22,496	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Because it was an illegal no man's land
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:27,104	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Not under British jurisdiction but pretty much ignored by the Chinese authorities
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:29,920	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	It became a magnet for the displaced in the marginal
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:33,504	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Thousands of people move their after war with Japan broke out of
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,272	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	The 30s
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:37,088	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	And even more move there after the Republic of China went communist
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:40,416	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Attractive gangsters drug addicts
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:42,208	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Sex workers refugees
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:46,048	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	And also do a lot of average people from all over China who needed cheap rent
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:47,072	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	And so opportunity
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:49,888	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Kowloon walled city was at its height
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,424	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	The dentist place
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:51,936	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Anywhere
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:52,960	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Ever
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:57,568	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Had a population density of about 3.2 million people per square mile
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,616	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Comparison Manhattan
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,408	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Has a population density of about
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,432	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	70000 people
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:03,456	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Per square mile
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:05,504	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	That means that Kowloon walled City
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,040	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Was about
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:07,808	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	46
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:09,088	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	X is done
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,368	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Has Manhattan
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,392	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Only put that another way
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:15,232	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	If Manhattan want to get anywhere close to that kind of density
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:18,559	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Every man woman and child living in Texas
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,095	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Would have to move there
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:25,471	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	I came across it very much by accident
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:29,055	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	I came around one corner and
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:30,591	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Saw this
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:33,151	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Structure that looked
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,455	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Really different than everything else
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:38,271	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Around it that's red Gerard
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:38,783	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Photographer
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,343	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	He live in Hong Kong in the 80s and 90s
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:42,367	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	And that
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:42,879	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	When I
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,695	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Where is the walled City and
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,975	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Started photographing there
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,815	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Its density was immediately apparent
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,887	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Buildings have been built
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:56,447	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Up against each other without any space between
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:01,311	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Each homeowner or each person who rented with
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:03,359	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Build a different kind of caged
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:06,431	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Balcony that would stick out
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:08,479	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	A meter or two from their apartment
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:14,367	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	It was a way of opening up the apartment and getting more space and and air and Light
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:21,279	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	I went for a first walk into one of the alleys and immediately struck by what's over here
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:24,863	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Had enough just angle electrical wires
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:29,215	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	And wet garbage that have been thrown from the upper floors
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:32,031	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	TV antennas all over the place
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:39,199	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Credible noises from the various manufacturing metalwork small kind of Foundry
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,991	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Cotton Mills
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:46,367	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Kitchen furnaces burning for barbecuing pork or doc or whatever
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:51,743	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Sunsations underfoot as you go down from Ali's no into
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:55,327	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Watery squishy stuff watery squishy stuff
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:06:00,703	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	You know stuff between buildings that you're walking on I mean I really don't even know what
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,263	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	All manner of
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:10,175	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Greg took a lot of photographs of the walled City
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:12,991	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	There's one probably one of my favorites of his
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,015	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Lama temple
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:16,831	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	It's much shorter than the 13-story high-rises around it
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:19,903	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	Over the temple is this huge metal grate
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:21,951	| 99pi_0066_kowloonwalledcity_1 |	If it's there to keep trash off the roof
