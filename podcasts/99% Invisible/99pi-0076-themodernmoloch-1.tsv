EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:39,392	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	Bizarre to us today until you recognize that this thing was
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:41,184	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	Killing thousands of children every year
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,792	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	So that was 1923 90 years ago
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:49,888	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	But understand why cars were being compared to a child eating God

EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:06,016	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	But not very carefully
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,552	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	At the turn of the century
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:10,624	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	There is nothing moving faster than about 5 or 10 miles an hour
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:15,232	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	Responsible parents would say their children go outside and play in the streets
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,000	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	All day
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:20,095	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	Even after the first cars appeared in the cities right around 1900
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:23,423	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	They had to conform to the customs of the day
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:25,215	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	Which meant that traffic
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:27,775	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	Slowly
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:30,335	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	There's wonderful video
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,639	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	Like 1905 people walking down mark

EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,967	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	And San Francisco before the earthquake
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,503	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	And people are just
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,551	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	Striding right in wherever they want to go
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,087	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	Children

EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:48,255	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	It's not to say that the
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:49,279	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	The street
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,071	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	Off of the sidewalks
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:54,143	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	For everybody because people prefer the sidewalk
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,959	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	It's dryer it's cleaners got less horse manure
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:59,775	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	There weren't even really many rules about what you could do or not do
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:02,591	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	People are solving problems the way they solve problems
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:05,663	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	When you're walking in a crowded hallway like
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,943	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	You know I love in a car
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:08,991	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	High School building between classes and you have

EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:16,671	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	And they start to figure stuff out like you know usually keep right while you're walking
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,951	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	It's not like the law
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:23,583	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	You know but there's no understanding you go that way I'll go this way I'll keep that right I'll get that guys are going to go to the right or to the left
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:25,119	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	Free from England and I think
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:28,447	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	The closest thing we have to that now is a city park
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:29,727	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	Or maybe a pedestrian Mall
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,263	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	You go to a city park
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:34,335	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	And you you're mostly Guided by
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:38,943	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	Understanding understanding psych you can use the park for whatever you want
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:40,991	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	Provided you don't endanger other people
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:43,039	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	You don't break the law
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,831	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	And you don't make a nuisance out of yourself
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:47,903	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	And then you pretty much okay and it's a lot like that in Street

EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:04,031	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	In the middle class if they're lucky
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:05,567	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	So the streets
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,615	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	We're starting to get more crowded

EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:12,351	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	So

EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:24,383	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	That predominantly is a winners history of the automobile
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:26,687	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	And that's the history that says this was inevitable
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:30,783	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	And it has to do with America's love affair with the automobile
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:35,903	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	The automobile
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:52,031	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	In 1961 there was a TV program called the DuPont show of the week

EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:18,655	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	And in this show Groucho Marx introduced Americans
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:20,703	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	To the thesis we've all heard
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:24,287	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	Which is that there's an American love affair with the automobile

EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:41,439	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	So that's the love affair thesis and the genius of it is that
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:44,511	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	By saying we have a love affair with the car
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:49,375	| 99pi-0076-themodernmoloch-1 |	We are saying that our relationship is irrational and not subject to logical
