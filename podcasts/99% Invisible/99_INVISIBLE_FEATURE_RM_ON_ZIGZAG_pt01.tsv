EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:42,879	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I texted our little chat to Jen who was also headed to the airport to meet me for a flight

EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:55,935	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	End
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,983	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That's badass
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:58,495	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:01,823	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	You guys both are like we're both going to
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:06,431	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Do your thing so police report
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:13,599	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Josh and I are really lucky to have families who lived
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,879	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Nearby who helped out a lot
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,671	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Jen doesn't have that
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,439	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Most people don't
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:24,607	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	But that wasn't stopping both Jen and I from worrying how we're going to make this podcast and run a business
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,143	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Steam
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:29,471	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And that takes more than a cryptocurrency that doesn't exist yet
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,775	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	It takes cash
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:35,103	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Just why
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:37,151	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Jen and I decided to go on a wreck up
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:37,663	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Mission
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,455	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Trip to San Francisco
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:42,015	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	To see if we can find a back-up plan
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:43,039	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	A plan B
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:45,855	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Because that's what responsible adults do these days
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:50,463	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	They'll put their savings on the line they get rich people to invest in their business
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:57,887	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	So far we've lost our first grant that was chapter one that we've been counting on
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:04,799	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That was awful then we got in this other small grant that was having real money and having cryptocurrency that still didn't
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:05,567	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	This yet
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:08,127	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Is like ziggety-zag Ade but like
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:12,223	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Maybe it was trying to find some stability but having an investor
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,527	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Or would that just create bigger problem
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:15,807	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We weren't sure
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:24,255	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Then I had done our fair share of reporting on tech companies that put their profits ahead of basic Humanity to a
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,279	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Appease shareholders
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:28,095	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	But there's also the good side to Silicon Valley
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:32,191	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Big Ideas can happen because people believe in them
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:32,959	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And back then
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,727	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Was big money
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:41,151	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Okay we just landed here is our planet it's jam-packed we were meeting with an angel investor named Jesse
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:42,431	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Torelli that afternoon
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:48,831	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And I guess we're going to catch her

EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:09,823	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	To a coffee place to meet Jess Pirelli

EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,199	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	@twitter
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:17,759	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	You've done your homework Jen poyant
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:20,831	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Go to the copy shop we were going to meet Jess a little early
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:26,463	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We just could not stop talking about what we had seen on our walk to the coffee shop
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:30,559	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	It's definitely the most extreme version of wealth disparity that I've ever seen
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,071	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	In America
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:35,679	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Yeah look down and person after homeless person is lying in the streets
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:38,239	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Look up and there are spiffy
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:42,591	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Extremely wealthy people zipping by on motorized scooters and their athleisure wear
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:47,967	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Jen and I had to abruptly end our conversation about the economics of San Francisco
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,991	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Just arrived
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:55,903	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We all agreed that the cafe was way too noisy
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:08:00,767	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We grabbed some iced coffees to go
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,815	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I went down the block to Jesse's apartment building
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:04,607	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Thank you
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,911	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	She said we could talk in the conference room by the lobby

EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:22,015	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Who I've known for a long time
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:27,391	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Founding partner of hashtag angels
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:31,231	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Which is an investment Collective I co-founded with five other women
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:31,999	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	3 years ago
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:37,631	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I spent my career working in Silicon Valley at
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,935	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Twitter over eight and a half years
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:43,263	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Start working for Venture Capital firm
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,823	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We were frankly initially buried
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:49,663	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Resistant resistant
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,967	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We have reservations are skeptical about
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:59,135	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Because we were a little worried about having to push for these returns
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:00,927	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Define incentive
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:03,487	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That is a smart question for you to ask and it doesn't work of us
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:06,559	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	You're really thoughtful founder which is
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,607	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	How do I make sure
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:12,447	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Vision our expectations and hopes I have for my company
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:15,519	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Aligned with the expectations of an investor
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:20,895	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	A lot of time because you get that right
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:23,199	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Obsessed with it
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:24,991	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Like we talked about it all the time
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:27,551	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Venture capital
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:30,879	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Is a great way to finance if you want hyper-growth
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,927	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And so
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,207	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Hyper-growth
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:38,047	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	It's not to be obtuse about this is is the rate of growth and the
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:41,631	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I want to grow that's going to take
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,703	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Anywhere from one to five years I would imagine
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,471	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	For us too
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:50,591	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Launch 3 shows and then spend those off into those different multi-platform
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,383	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	But I guess the question
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:53,663	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Is the
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,943	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Maybe the exits
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:59,551	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Strategy be expected to exit all those questions about what
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:04,671	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	What do the investors want back like what level of growth is expected in
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,975	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Do we have to know all that at the beginning
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,791	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Generally if you're raising venture capital
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,839	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	At investors are looking
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:15,167	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Are looking for a business that they believe
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,959	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Can transform an industry
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:20,799	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Was this a pitch or more like a tutoring session
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:22,079	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I guess my hope
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:27,199	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And I want to be upfront about it is that we do have investors who care as deeply is
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,735	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We do about the
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:30,527	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	You know that societal impact of the
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,295	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Stuff that we make
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,599	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That's really important
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:38,719	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I mean I definitely want to be big so I think these ideas need to be big in their big ideas
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:42,559	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	But I also think like is there room for that to be
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:44,863	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	At this point Jen kicked me under the table
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:45,887	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Conscientious
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:48,191	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	By accident she told me later
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:51,007	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	But at the time I thought you wanted me to shut up
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:54,079	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I think so I think it's all about finding that right
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,103	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Set with an investor
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:58,687	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And given how important that is to you and given
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,455	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Trump
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,991	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Growth
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:07,391	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I think being as exactly as you're being rather explicit about your goals are for their send what success looks like to you
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:09,183	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Who is going to help you find an investor
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:11,487	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That aligns
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:15,839	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And I can do you know anyone like this is sound like farfetch.
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:19,423	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Wait was this weird that we were kind of pitching someone to fund our work
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:25,823	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Which would basically criticized the tech platforms that they had also funded
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:30,943	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I think these people exist I think I want to send a little bit more time with you on
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:35,551	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	The ambition for what you want to build and what that business and scale might look like yeah
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:37,343	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	This face should be
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:39,647	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	All about building a product and get a few customers
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:44,511	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	If you need money right now then you got to think a little bit about like okay what is the right sourcing
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:46,815	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Whether it's revenue or Grant or seed funding
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:49,887	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	But if you have a time for your back in a fundraising mode
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:56,799	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I think we can
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:57,311	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	But they take
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:03,199	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Tapastic the process is very often very bureaucratic
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:05,247	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And we might have
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:10,879	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	But that takes time to come out
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:17,791	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We're definitely going to have to go into debt unless we get some Defenders I think that's basically what
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,583	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	No that's correct
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:21,119	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Yeah for sure
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:25,215	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	She haven't looked at her watch yet but the Justice we were wasting her time
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,495	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	AAA
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:32,895	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	You always take care of most of the rescuer and so it's about finding the right alignment with those that believe in you and believe what you're building
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:39,295	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Show friends and family around maybe possible so far does seem like something word
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:44,927	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	The impact investors might be the better fit but I don't want to jump to that conclusion with edges like really like
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,463	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Talk through that
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,511	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	It sounds like you have
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:53,119	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	An incredible background to do this you've been successful duena Senor prior roles
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:13:00,031	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Can I take a look at some of that
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,151	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	How big of a business is this is this the next
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:07,455	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Like massive
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:09,247	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Like Global Media Company
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:14,879	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Is this the seed of something that can be really big and is that what
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,159	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	They want to build
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,951	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Do they believe there's a path to doing that
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:22,047	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	How quickly can we come back and do that
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:22,559	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	This week
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:28,959	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Cool

EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:17,663	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That leads me to okay just wasn't right like to even want to go back and actually try and picture

EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:29,439	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I think the bigger thing is what we're going to do like
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:36,351	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We work our asses off until we watch this show and then we go back to Lake Amado are we to see where the fun

EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,456	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:53,760	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	The way it operated in the beginning was that
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:55,040	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I didn't
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,064	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Pay myself
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:58,112	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I mean were there moments where you were like
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,416	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	What is it
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,512	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I just feel like you can always get a job
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:07,328	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	So what does failure mean in this case
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:10,144	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Tele means you do with the thing that everyone else does
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,704	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That's not really failure right right
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:14,240	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	It's true
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:14,752	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	It's like
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:17,056	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I don't know I didn't
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:19,872	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I feel more scared of it now
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:21,664	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And I did then
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,200	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Yeah because
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:25,760	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Can employees
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:29,088	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Opiate self like
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:34,720	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	A lot of the revenue that operates radiotopia is the percentage of my show because my show brings in a lot of AD Revenue
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:36,512	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Until like
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:38,560	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Now I feel like
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:39,072	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Timeout
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:41,120	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Keep hustling
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:42,656	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	It's like different
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:47,520	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We've been struggling to decide how to fully fund the show
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:53,664	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Did they decide I suppose we've been talking about whether we should seek out investment or get grants or
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:26:00,320	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Yes make the thing and then get the sponsorship that way you should do all of it
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:00,832	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Right away
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,904	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Radiotopia fundraising
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:09,024	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Because we have a model which supports shows that can support themselves completely as Advertising based
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:11,072	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:13,632	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We really need donations to support
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:15,936	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Asleep at the hole
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:16,704	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Slate of shows
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:20,288	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And then we then we have to do that to me is like
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,056	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That's how we make art
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,848	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Like rather than Chase Commerce
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:26,176	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	What you just said
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,712	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Art rather than Commerce
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:28,736	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Kind of
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:30,272	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Thumbs up
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:31,296	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	The
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:34,624	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Soul searching that you and I have been doing Jen
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:40,512	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	So the question that we keep getting is what do you want it depends what you want what do you want what do you want
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:47,168	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I think we're getting closer to knowing what we were
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:49,472	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Well I think it's because the news
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:56,640	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We starting to succeed in these ways where she was being asked to speak she's doing the Ted talk so we could naturally see a model
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:59,200	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That would work that was bigger than just a show
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:00,736	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We are
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:04,576	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	About to document this experience both of making the show making this business
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:07,648	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	All the different choices that were just talking about right
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:12,512	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And it feels very vulnerable to admit all this on tape
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:16,864	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Yeah I can see that I'm glad I wasn't talking to you my friend
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:18,912	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Publicly is to women to do it
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:22,240	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	But you also I get that
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:23,520	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Can I get that that's a risk
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:26,592	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We also you're going to get a lot of strength from that too
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:31,200	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Again it's like this balance of risk and reward and you have a greater risk
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:36,064	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Can we bake and also it's just like
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,088	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I fully believe
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:38,368	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,416	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Your uncle
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:42,464	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	In life is to live an extraordinary
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,512	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Like live a weird life
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:48,608	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I think that's true I think there's that there are a lot of women out there
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,632	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That need to
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:51,168	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	To hear other women doing this
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:52,448	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	You don't
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:55,776	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We've asked for a lot of advice from a lot of people and every
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:59,872	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Bit of advice when it comes to business seems to be like well the way of business works like
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:06,272	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	You're not going to be able to do this like a lot of people kind of say like it's not going to work
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:09,856	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	It depends on what type of business you have or one
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:11,904	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I totally I think
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:14,976	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	You know like
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,536	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Videos of bad startup in a good business
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:20,864	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Because it doesn't
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:26,752	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Return money the way they wanted to and if you do you have to grow and make things that you don't care about
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:28,032	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:30,592	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	He just want to make a show and pay yourself
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:31,872	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	You can do that
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,664	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That is not that Steep Hill to climb
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:34,432	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	You could do that
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,992	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And then from there you begin to go
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:40,576	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I think that you follow your gut when it comes to that.
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:45,184	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And personally I think that there's no money without strings attached the only money I've ever
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:47,232	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	It has strings attached. I like
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:48,768	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Is money from the audience
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:53,120	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I guess I'm going to be very
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:57,728	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Business and fraternal or something
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:58,752	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	How much you got saved
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:00,544	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Do you have a year saved
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:02,848	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Can you live without making any money
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,640	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I definitely cannot
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,944	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I like 2 months baby laugh
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:11,808	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:16,160	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Is that asymmetry in your needs does that cause attention in your choices
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:24,096	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I would say that at the beginning where I was like well if I'm going to invest in the company I want to own more of it and gents it now
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:31,520	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I worried it like you're putting in different sacs
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:35,872	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I mean if a company can never pay me back that's
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,712	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Tell me something
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:42,528	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That's what I kind of think I'm really
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,320	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Money is freedom
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:45,344	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That's what it's for
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:47,392	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	The hard part of ownership is that the
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,184	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	The runway
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:50,976	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	SB kind of long
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:53,792	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Yes for you gets the points sustainable
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:56,608	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And if the runway is short then
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:58,144	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	It actually
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:59,680	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	It f**** with the sustainability
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:01,984	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I think we're trying to figure out
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:07,616	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	What's a minimum we can pull in through all these various funding
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:10,944	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Sources if we're not going to do the BC thing and still
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:12,480	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Sustain ourselves
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:16,832	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Until that Runway gets long enough for it to become really sick
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:19,136	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I mean it's something you have to be prepared
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:20,928	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	2
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:23,488	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Recognizance.
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,000	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Working
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:26,304	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I just think things like what
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:29,888	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Is it it's kind of easy if you don't have a lot of other pressures
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:32,960	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	To hold onto something that you maybe shouldn't be holding on to
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:35,776	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	What would make you sun set this whole thing
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,640	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	It's a really good question
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:44,224	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	But you know it's that is so hard to answer cuz if you had
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:46,272	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Ask me that about note to self I wouldn't have
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:48,832	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Shit happens and you have no idea
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,720	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Set this whole
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:58,560	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Is it a better opportunity
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:00,096	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	It's like no cuz this is
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:02,144	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	This is the best
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,936	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	But let me ask you this
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:07,008	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Can you just make 99 Pi forever like
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:08,288	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Well I wonder that too
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:10,336	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I've given myself
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:13,920	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	A kind of a timeline
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:18,272	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Of I need to make it as successful as possible
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:20,320	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	43 now
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:25,696	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I don't know if the end of it's going to happen when I'm 50
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:29,792	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I think I would probably go your route faster like right now
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:31,584	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Weird
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:34,912	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	People are doing projects inside of
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:36,704	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Rainbow
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:38,496	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Which will be new things for the word
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:41,312	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And I can't really talk about him but we could say this much
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:44,384	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I could imagine
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:45,920	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That my life
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:47,456	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Is
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:48,480	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Not
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,248	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Hosting
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:50,016	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Yashow
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,296	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Running Shop
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:52,832	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And also it's just like
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:54,624	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:56,672	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Feel myself more tired
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:57,696	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Can I ever have
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,768	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I just can't
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:02,304	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I can't work this hard
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:03,072	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Forever
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:18,944	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Roman thank you so much
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:20,736	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	You guys are taking action
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:26,112	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I don't know but it's a good chance like it's like that's the thing it's like it's more you were that's why raise up your work
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:27,904	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	It's like
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:28,928	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	I don't own it
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:29,952	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And we don't own it
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:36,864	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	It's your chance to take we just get to be part of it and we'd like to be a part of things that we're proud of
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:42,496	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Our session with Roman kind of felt like a motivational pep talk
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:46,592	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We don't have to stand on chairs and yell like a Tony Robbins event
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,896	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Dyspeptic was way more chill
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:51,456	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Thank you and welcome
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:53,248	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	My pleasure I'm so happy you're here
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:55,552	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	This conversation was just what we need
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:57,856	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Jen and I were resolved
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:32:59,648	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Investment money
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:00,160	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	For now
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:01,440	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Was not for us
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:03,232	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Another
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:04,768	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Enemies Act
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:08,608	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	That we needed to focus on making the podcast
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:09,376	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	This podcast
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:11,424	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Stick to the mission
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:13,728	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	And then if we made it that far
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:14,496	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Weed reassess
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:20,128	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	So we went back to New York and even put a big red circle around one summer day on the calendar
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:21,664	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	We labeled it
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:22,944	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Financial Reckoning day
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:29,856	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	But it felt good to know we have the support of not just one
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:31,136	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	But to Collective
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:33,696	| 99_INVISIBLE_FEATURE_RM_ON_ZIGZAG_pt01 |	Roman and radiotopia
