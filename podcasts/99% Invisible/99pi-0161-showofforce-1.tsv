EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:48,544	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Who would go on to have great careers
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:51,872	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But in the 1940s there was something else
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:54,432	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Some of those artists and designers
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:55,200	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	How to do
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:58,016	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	That's our own Katie McCall
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:59,040	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	There was a war going
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:00,320	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	World War
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:02,112	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And the Army needed artists
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:03,904	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Because well
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:04,928	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	They had
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:05,952	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Kind of a crazy idea
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:13,888	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And it was a crazy idea that came out of one of the most conservative organizations you can imagine the United States are
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:17,216	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	That's Rick Beyer more about Rick in a minute
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:19,008	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And had to go up the line
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:22,080	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	High-ranking generals appetizers Eisenhower himself
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,616	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	To get approval
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:24,896	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The crazy idea was this
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:27,968	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The United States Army with design a deception unit
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:31,296	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	A unit that would appear to the enemy to be a large Armored Division
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:33,344	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Thousands of soldiers
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:34,624	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Tanks
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,648	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Trucks guns
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:37,184	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Only this unit
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:38,720	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Would actually be equipped with fake tanks
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:40,000	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Fake truck
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:41,280	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Fake guns
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:43,584	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And Man by just a handful of soldiers
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,888	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And it really is something
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:47,424	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Unusual
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:50,496	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Rick buyer has a forthcoming book about all of this
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,520	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And also made it
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:52,288	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Film about it
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,568	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Hold That Ghost Army
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:56,896	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	People say to me well did the Germans have something like this
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:59,712	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Did the Japanese have something like this
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:03,552	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And when I said is the Germans and Japanese did deceptions
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:06,368	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But I haven't found anybody
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,136	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Ever
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:07,904	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Who had
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,440	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	A unit
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,208	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Quite like this
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:18,144	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But I like groups began landing on the northern coast of France this morning
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:20,192	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Strongly supported by Naval and Air Forces
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,472	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	D-Day
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,776	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	1944
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,592	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Want to start of the most critical. Of War
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:33,504	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The Allies landed on the beaches of Normandy and began to liberate France from the Germans who had occupied it for 4 years
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,016	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	At that point
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:36,832	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	They were ultimately Marching for Berlin
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:39,136	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And the success of the Normandy Landings on
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:42,208	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	D-Day was due in part to deception
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,024	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Using a variety of techniques
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:51,424	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The Allies tricked the Germans into thinking The Invasion would happen at a different time and place
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:52,960	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But a couple of US Army men
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:57,312	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Ralph Ingersoll and Billy Harris wanted to take deception to a whole new level
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:04:00,128	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	They wanted to create a mobile deception unit
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:03,968	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	I'm going to put that on the battlefield and give that to the generals to use
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:05,760	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	For whatever set of circumstances
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:06,784	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Come up
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:09,856	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	What were the circumstances in which a unit like this
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,624	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	This would be needed
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:13,952	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	What's the American forces are guarding a border
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,000	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But there's a hole in ones
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:20,607	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And it's a German the realize there's an unguarded spot
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:22,399	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	They can use it to break the line
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,703	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But the Americans
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,239	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Don't have any troops
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,263	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	To fill that hole
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:33,663	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Sometimes they can't send the real truth because the real troops are needed someplace house and sometimes they can't send them
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,175	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Because
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:37,759	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	They just don't have enough or they can't get them there in
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:40,319	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Time that's where the ghost Army came in
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:45,695	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	This top-secret unit was officially called the 23rd headquarters special troops
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,487	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And nicknamed The Ghost Army
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:47,999	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	After the war
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:54,911	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The so-called ghost Army would impersonate a larger Armored Division might be the 6th Armored Division
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:05:01,311	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Vision or some other one it changed but a division that was made up of say 15 or 20
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:07,711	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Thousand soldiers when they the ghost army or actually only about a thousand men
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:10,527	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Make it seem like something is there that isn't there
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:13,087	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And if you want people to do that you're going to want artists
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:19,231	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The Army was interested in recruiting people with art with an art background
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:22,815	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Do installations of sorts
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,351	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	That's Jack Macy
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,631	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	I'm jacked Macy

EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:51,743	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Where he discovers that a lot of the other guys in his unit are also artists
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:53,279	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	A good 50%
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:56,863	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And one of the things all of the artists have been working on
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,911	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Was designing steak
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,679	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Tanks and trucks

EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:10,943	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And so that's when I discovered my first

EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,791	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	In about a half hour
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,839	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	From nothing to a full tank
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,887	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Was rather quite interesting
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:30,399	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:34,495	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But the visual deception unit had more than just
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,031	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	It stank
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:37,311	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And trucks
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:38,847	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And artillery
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:39,871	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Angie
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:45,503	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And all sorts of vehicles virtually every kind of vehicle the Army has
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,783	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The ghost Army had
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,319	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Inflatable versions of
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,087	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Musically
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:53,439	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Anything to make themselves appear to be the full size armored divisions that they were
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:53,951	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Pretending to be
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:57,791	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	This stuff was all meant to be believable from a distance
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:01,119	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Four planes flying overhead or maybe people looking through binoculars
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:04,191	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And at a distance Inflatables were super realistic
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,727	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	You had to be careful
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,007	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	About certain details
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:08,287	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:10,591	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The barrels
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,615	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Of the tanks
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:15,967	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The Seroquel of course that was a mess
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:18,527	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Plastic gun barrels never a good thing
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,855	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But there were other details to consider
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:23,391	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	A real tank weighs 40
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:26,207	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Tons and when it drives across the field
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:26,975	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	It leaves
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:27,999	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	A set of tank tracks
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,535	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Text that are really obvious
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:30,815	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	To Ariel LeConte
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:36,447	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	So the deception unit would actually use a bulldozer to make fake tracks around the fake tanks
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:41,055	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But there was one cardinal rule Jack says about working with inflatables
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:42,591	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Never
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,871	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Under any circumstance
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,407	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Will you ever
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:48,735	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	To carry an inflatable across the road
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:52,319	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Obviously two dudes carrying a 40-ton tank would look
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:53,599	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Wrong
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:59,231	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	You weren't supposed to casually pick up and move an inflatable vehicle in a place where you could be seen
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:03,071	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	When the artist soldiers weren't busy with their dummy tanks
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:05,631	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Jack says they did what artist
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:07,935	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Still spent that time sketching
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:11,263	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Local people local architecture
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,543	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Churches
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,847	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	All through Normandy
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:15,871	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Across France
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:17,663	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And into Germany
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:24,063	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	During their travels through Europe when they weren't sketching local architecture the ghost Army was often
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:24,831	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Acting
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,879	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And they call it special effects
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:28,927	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And I call it play-acting
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:30,207	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Because that's really what it was
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:33,535	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And the idea was supposed to go into town
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:36,351	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And sit down at a cafe
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,399	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	So that anybody watching us
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:40,703	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Remember the Germans occupied France
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,983	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Dance for four years at this
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:44,543	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Yeah there were spies
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,311	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Everywhere
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,359	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	We wanted them to sink
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:49,151	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	That not only did we have
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:51,199	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Actual tanks which of course we didn't
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:55,295	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But that we actually were members of the 2nd Armored Division
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Witchery factory wiring
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:09:01,695	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	They stenciled fake unit numbers on their trucks they made fake patches to put on their sleeves
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:08,095	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Sometimes they seem to be having a little too much fun with this part of the job like the time they stole a bunch of
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:14,495	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Two cases of expensive cognac from a Tavern just to piss off the tavern owner they knew to be a jerk
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,775	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	German collaborator
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:20,639	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	They're hoping that he is Dan going to be so angry at them that he's going to go to the Germans and tell him
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:26,271	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Will not only do I know that the 6th Armored Division is here with their General was at my Tavern today
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,319	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The whole point
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,343	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And the ghost Army
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:31,135	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Want to make sure their presence
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,159	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	What's known
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,951	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The ghost Army needed to be
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:38,047	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Seen and heard and perceived by the Germans as being real
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:42,143	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	I'm turntable one goes a recording of trucks moving in
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:46,495	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Which brings us to the deception unit that I probably would have been drafted into
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:47,775	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Sonic deception
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,847	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	So they would record the sounds of
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:53,663	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Tanks going down Rose or the sounds of truck
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Except man reaching a certain point in all the men jumping out and then be able to
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:02,367	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Play them back in such a way as to make the enemy think that those things are really happening
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:06,463	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	This was also new and strange that the Army made a top-secret
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:09,791	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Film what explain how sound can be used to deceive the enemy
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,583	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Init
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:12,351	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Actors
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:16,703	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Badly portray a group of German officers who were in the midst of being punked
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,983	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But it's Sonic deception unit
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,287	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Thanks
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,895	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Oot here
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,711	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Report Stephen it sounds
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,991	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Tanks moving in
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:29,503	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Assembly
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,295	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	About that
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:36,415	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The movie goes on to explain that the Germans in that scene were fooled
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:39,999	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	A Sonic, they had convinced them that an Armored Division
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,279	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Under cover of Darkness
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,815	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	That moves along the river lacrosse
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:48,191	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Tank destroyers unreserved up here
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:50,751	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	They moved into position
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,543	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And they waited
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:55,615	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And we crossed down here where they were
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:58,431	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The phone goes into great detail
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:01,247	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	About the process of recording and playing back
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:05,087	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Sounds the best loudspeakers
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:08,671	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The speakers can project sound as far as 50
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,695	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Tmall
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:11,743	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And there was a huge library of
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:12,511	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Sounds to choose
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,279	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	He's from
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,303	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	For example
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Engines make different sounds depending on the terrain and they had all of those differ
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,191	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Kinds of sound
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:27,359	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	At the little Hill this one projected the sound of Tanks going up
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:33,759	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	This one projected Banks going down
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:39,903	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	They would look at what they're trying to simulate what are we trying to make people think
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:43,999	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And then they would take all the appropriate child
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:47,327	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And mix them together to create a
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,607	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Sonic
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,119	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Stewart
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,191	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	People who heard this
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,215	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Say that it was
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:57,055	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Unbelievably Erie that it was so realistic that
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:12:00,383	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	You started seeing vehicles that weren't there
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:07,807	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The third component of the ghost army or the radio operators
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:12,415	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	It was well known that the Germans listened in on radio communications of Allied troops
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:16,255	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	So the ghost Army was trying to impersonate a real Armored Division
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:19,071	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	It have to send the right kinds of Transmissions
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:20,351	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	They bring in
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:22,655	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Trained radio operators from All Sorts about
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,423	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Units
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,959	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	To have the very best operators
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:26,751	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Depart of the radio deception
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:29,823	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	All of the units paid incredible
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:30,591	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Attention to detail
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:33,151	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But the radio operators
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,687	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Had to be perfect mimic
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:40,575	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	They had to learn the exact keystrokes of an individual Morse code operator in the unit they were in prayer
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:44,159	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The way a radio operator in the
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:48,511	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The 4th Armored Division always starts his messages with 4
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:50,559	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	..
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,607	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Because that's just what they do
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:54,655	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And if you don't do that
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:56,959	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The German intercept person listening
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:57,471	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Is going to say
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:58,751	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Will wait a minute
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,031	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Does that really from the 4th
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:00,799	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Armored Division
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:07,455	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	They have three different units visual Sonic and radio and their operating separately but they're
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:13,087	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	All organized by the same people so they're very carefully working on different components of the same plan
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:18,207	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The three separate units might only be vaguely aware of what one another were up
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:18,719	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	2
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:23,071	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And everything was kept completely secret from the rest of the military
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:26,655	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	It's a fact of their mere existence ever lead to the Germans
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,191	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The whole deception
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:30,495	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	As well as the safety of the ghost Army
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,263	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Could be compromised
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:35,359	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The ghost Army carried out 21 different deception mission
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:36,639	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Between
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:40,479	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	June 1944 and
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,247	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	March
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,015	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	1940
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:44,063	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	35 pretty much the entire time
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:45,599	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The US Army was operating
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:50,463	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Rick says one of their most important missions was Operation bettembourg
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:53,023	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Which took place near the border but
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:53,791	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Between France
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:54,303	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	In Germany
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,095	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	So picture this
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:58,911	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	There's a river near the German border the Moselle River
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:02,751	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	German troops are on one side and American troops are on the other
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,543	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	They're part of a front butt
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,823	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Hundreds of miles long
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:08,127	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	General George Patton
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:11,967	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Realizes that there is a 75-mile gap in his line
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:14,015	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Unguarded 75 MI
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:17,343	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But the Germans come across the border
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,367	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	If they knew about it
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,159	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	So they bring in
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,183	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The ghost Army
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:24,255	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	So they they arrived in
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,303	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	About middle of the night
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:30,911	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	It is in September 44 and they using all three units
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:32,447	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Visual unit with insulated
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,215	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	People tanks
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:34,495	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Radio guys
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:36,543	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But especially the Sonic design
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,311	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Option unit
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:40,383	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Because most of the Germans are on the other side of the Mosel River
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,919	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	There within earshot
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,687	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	In other words
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:45,759	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And so it's a great opportunity to use sound to
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:47,039	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Build it up and make it
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,831	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	It seem like so many
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:51,391	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Hank Snow moving in and so many troops are moving in
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,791	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The deception goes on
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:58,815	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	For 7
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:14:59,583	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Days
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:02,399	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	7 days is a long time to fool any
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:08,543	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The ghost army soldiers are getting nervous they've never done a deception for this long before
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:11,871	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And even General Patton is nervous he wrote a letter to his wife
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:16,991	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And he says one bad spot my line but I don't think the Huns know about it yet
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:21,599	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	We're holding on to it by the grace of God will have it plugged by tomorrow
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:24,927	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And the next day the 83rd division Moves In
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,463	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And takes over for the ghost Army
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:29,023	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And the Germans never caught on
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:30,047	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	To the ghost Army
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,583	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	During that operation
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,095	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Or any other
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:39,007	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Over the course of the war the ghost Army lost three soldiers and had several dozen wounded but overall it was one of the safer
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,543	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Assignments of World War II
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:44,383	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Being in the camouflage unit I always felt
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:45,919	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	I was kind of lucky
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:48,479	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	That's Jack Macy again
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:52,831	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Camouflage unit was just another name for the visual deception unit
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,855	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Wish I had friends
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:56,159	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Lahore in the Infantry
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,183	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Shovel workout
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:01,791	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But being assigned to the camouflage Corps
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:04,095	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Away from the front lines
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:07,935	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	It's true that the ghost Army suffered far fewer casualties than other units
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:13,567	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	That's probably because they were really good at their jobs if their deception was ever uncovered by the Germans
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,359	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Would be catastrophic
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,895	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	For the men in the ghost Army
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:20,479	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	They're operating without any heavy weapons
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:22,015	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	They don't have any real artillery
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:25,087	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	So they're kind of putting on this show of force
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,391	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	In a very vulnerable place
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:30,207	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Jack remembers the Armenians
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,231	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Extremely fondly
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:32,767	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	He got to see Paris
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,047	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	See Paris
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:36,863	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The great cafes and the Beast Rose
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:39,423	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Completely
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,215	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Fabulous experience
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:45,567	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	After Jack Macy left the ghost Army he went to Yale
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,335	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	School of
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,615	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Garden architecture
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:49,151	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	GI Bill of Rights
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,175	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Thank God
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:53,759	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	After Yale he went on to design some amazing things
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:59,135	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	He designed the kitchen used in the American national exhibition in Moscow in 1959
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:02,207	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Would a famous debate between Nixon and Khrushchev took place
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:08,351	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	He work with Buckminster Fuller on a geodesic dome for the 1967 World Expo in Montreal
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:11,167	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And Jack Macy wasn't the only artist
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:13,471	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	In the ghost Army to have a great career
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:17,567	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Remember all those artists that were constantly sketching around Europe
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:20,127	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Well some of them became pretty famous
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:20,895	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	After the war
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:22,431	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Ellsworth Kelly the
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:25,759	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Minimalist painter and sculptor was in this unit
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:31,647	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Arthur Singer a wildlife artist to Illustrated birds of North America and many other books
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,415	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Bill Blass
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:33,951	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The fashion designer
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:37,279	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Jack Macy and Bill Blass we're good friends in the army
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:41,375	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Jack likes to say that Bill Blass was the only Soldier
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,911	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	That read Vogue and
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:43,679	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Is Fox Hole
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,447	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Not only red
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,519	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But he made sketches
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,823	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Skechers wherever he went
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:52,639	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Forever working away
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:56,223	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Getting ready for the great moment when he would leave the army
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:18:03,903	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	The government officially kept the ghost Army a secret into the 1980s because they were hoping to be able to use some of the deception
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,183	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Tactics in future complex
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:09,279	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Some units were told not to talk about their experience
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,047	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Ever
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,071	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	2NE1
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:14,911	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	But apparently not everyone got the same directives on this
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:15,935	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	I was in Company B
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:17,983	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And we were never told
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:19,775	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	That we were not supposed to talk about it
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:23,359	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	So I was blabbing about the ghost Army II die
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:23,871	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Leicester
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:26,943	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And everybody I had everybody reduced to
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,991	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Gigantic laughs
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:31,551	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Set amusement wdid as a fake
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:32,575	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Yunnan
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,903	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Pretty amusing thing
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:38,463	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	It is amusing but
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,999	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Beyond music
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:42,559	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Strange and amazing that they tried this
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:44,863	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	And that they actually
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,375	| 99pi-0161-showofforce-1 |	Pulled it off
