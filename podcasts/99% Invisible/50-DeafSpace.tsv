EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:24,640	| 50-DeafSpace |	The characters almost never look at each other
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:30,784	| 50-DeafSpace |	They mostly look straight ahead is a good reason for this location

EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,720	| 50-DeafSpace |	That's our reporter today Tom dries
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:43,072	| 50-DeafSpace |	He went to gallaudet University in Washington DC to talk to a researcher
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,352	| 50-DeafSpace |	And Robert service
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:49,472	| 50-DeafSpace |	Gallaudet is the only University in the world designed entirely for the Deaf
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:49,984	| 50-DeafSpace |	And hard-of-hearing
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:55,872	| 50-DeafSpace |	Robert is death himself and he's been looking into this question of how deaf people walk in
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:56,384	| 50-DeafSpace |	Inside
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:58,176	| 50-DeafSpace |	He told me about his latest pics
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:02:59,968	| 50-DeafSpace |	So I'm doing at the
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:05,600	| 50-DeafSpace |	Comparative study between people who are speaking walking along H Street
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:07,904	| 50-DeafSpace |	Yeah that's actually the voice of Carolyn wrestler
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,928	| 50-DeafSpace |	She's an interpreter I
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,208	| 50-DeafSpace |	Gary Oldman
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,488	| 50-DeafSpace |	So I'm doing it
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:15,584	| 50-DeafSpace |	Comparative study between people who are speaking walking along H Street
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:20,704	| 50-DeafSpace |	And walking together speaking to one another so to hearing dyads with the same kind of
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,472	| 50-DeafSpace |	Camera on their head
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:22,752	| 50-DeafSpace |	And then to death
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:27,104	| 50-DeafSpace |	Dietitian
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:29,152	| 50-DeafSpace |	Fancy term in sociology for a pair of people
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:32,224	| 50-DeafSpace |	So Robert put cameras on these two pairs of
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:34,272	| 50-DeafSpace |	People hearing and deaf
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,064	| 50-DeafSpace |	He had them walk down the street
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,088	| 50-DeafSpace |	And he did this
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:37,856	| 50-DeafSpace |	So we could put
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,136	| 50-DeafSpace |	Precisely monitor whooped
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,672	| 50-DeafSpace |	People look at when they walk
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,440	| 50-DeafSpace |	Can tok
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:43,232	| 50-DeafSpace |	Verses when they walk in sign
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:45,024	| 50-DeafSpace |	You sound very clear differences
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:47,840	| 50-DeafSpace |	Securing people look straight ahead the whole time they were walking
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:50,400	| 50-DeafSpace |	You might see just a few
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:53,216	| 50-DeafSpace |	It's very rare seconds when the person would look at the other
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:55,008	| 50-DeafSpace |	Person who they were walking beside and speaking
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:57,056	| 50-DeafSpace |	If they wouldn't ever make eye contact when we look at the
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:00,384	| 50-DeafSpace |	Pause what's up people there was a continuous maintained icon
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:04,992	| 50-DeafSpace |	So because American sign language is a visual language
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,528	| 50-DeafSpace |	It requires constant
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,296	| 50-DeafSpace |	Eye contact
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,600	| 50-DeafSpace |	But maintain eye contact also mean
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:11,136	| 50-DeafSpace |	You can't pay full attention
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,904	| 50-DeafSpace |	Zenni Optical
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,952	| 50-DeafSpace |	Close up ahead and that's a problem if your walk
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:17,536	| 50-DeafSpace |	I mean I guess if you can think about yourself as a person you can hear
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:24,447	| 50-DeafSpace |	If you weren't looking at the road as you were driving and looking at your passenger it was your driving down the road you can imagine how difficult
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,471	| 50-DeafSpace |	That might be the mediator
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:27,519	| 50-DeafSpace |	Your car down the road will the same kind of things happen
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:29,823	| 50-DeafSpace |	Deaf people but we watch out for one another
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:34,943	| 50-DeafSpace |	For walking and signing to work the people holding a conversation need to keep an eye out for optical
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:39,295	| 50-DeafSpace |	But it's not like deaf people make a deal at the beginning of a conversation
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:41,343	| 50-DeafSpace |	You talk I'll be the lookout
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:47,487	| 50-DeafSpace |	When deaf people look at one another there's an agreement and internal agreement unspoken agreement that's understood between the two
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:48,511	| 50-DeafSpace |	Conversing
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,559	| 50-DeafSpace |	That was like the people
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:53,119	| 50-DeafSpace |	When you're in a conversation you're in a kind of dance
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:53,887	| 50-DeafSpace |	We are not
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:56,191	| 50-DeafSpace |	Discussing what's happening between each other
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:57,727	| 50-DeafSpace |	But you just sort of know what the neck
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,239	| 50-DeafSpace |	Move should be
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:00,543	| 50-DeafSpace |	That's exactly it
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:06,687	| 50-DeafSpace |	When you're dancing you kind of work with your partner in the way they breathe the way they move their body and you respond accordingly the same thing
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,735	| 50-DeafSpace |	Conversation
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:13,855	| 50-DeafSpace |	When they're designing buildings post-hearing Architects are not thinking about providing a venue
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:14,623	| 50-DeafSpace |	For this dance
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:19,231	| 50-DeafSpace |	Robert says a lot of spaces are too narrow and confining for a good cover
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,535	| 50-DeafSpace |	There's this sense that
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:25,119	| 50-DeafSpace |	Buildings were not designed in such a way that they accommodate def
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:27,167	| 50-DeafSpace |	People so how does that feel I guess
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:28,703	| 50-DeafSpace |	The best way to say that is like weave
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,471	| 50-DeafSpace |	Feel like sardines
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:32,287	| 50-DeafSpace |	You know like we're all lined up one after the next
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,335	| 50-DeafSpace |	Converse in that way in
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,103	| 50-DeafSpace |	There's no he's in Arkham
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:39,711	| 50-DeafSpace |	Haitian actually also true of many buildings at gallaudet University
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:42,783	| 50-DeafSpace |	Even though it's dedicated to teaching the deaf and hard-of-hearing
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:48,159	| 50-DeafSpace |	It's a relatively old campus a lot of buildings were built in the mid-1800s
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:51,743	| 50-DeafSpace |	And it looks like a typical Northeastern liberal arts college
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,023	| 50-DeafSpace |	But there are signs
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,559	| 50-DeafSpace |	The school is different than your West
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:55,839	| 50-DeafSpace |	Senior Amherst
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:58,655	| 50-DeafSpace |	Mister whatever take for example the doorbells on campus
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:05,823	| 50-DeafSpace |	Nowadays people use lights you can flick a light switch and let somebody know that you're at the door but in the 1800
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:08,383	| 50-DeafSpace |	Dreads before electric light that use the vibration
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:15,295	| 50-DeafSpace |	The university has a display of an old doorbell it's about 4 feet high with a round metal handle attached to a chain
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:18,367	| 50-DeafSpace |	And at the other end of that chain is a lead weight
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:20,159	| 50-DeafSpace |	It arrived at the door
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:22,975	| 50-DeafSpace |	And you'd simply pull the chain
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:26,559	| 50-DeafSpace |	With that
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:28,095	| 50-DeafSpace |	Hit to the floor
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:30,655	| 50-DeafSpace |	When we're listening to the chain
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,191	| 50-DeafSpace |	But that hit to the floor
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,727	| 50-DeafSpace |	You'd meaning
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:34,495	| 50-DeafSpace |	Italy get it coming
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,543	| 50-DeafSpace |	The tunsel Bauman
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:40,639	| 50-DeafSpace |	He's now the director of design and planning at gallaudet Bauman is not dead
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:41,663	| 50-DeafSpace |	And in this case that is his
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:46,527	| 50-DeafSpace |	And this was one of the really cool but kind of anachronistic Innovations at gallaudet
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:52,415	| 50-DeafSpace |	Several years ago the university realize that some of its standards of architecture and innovation
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:52,927	| 50-DeafSpace |	At slipped
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:55,487	| 50-DeafSpace |	So the ass handle to help lead a group
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:59,071	| 50-DeafSpace |	Project that would rethink the campus design with deaf people in mind
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:00,863	| 50-DeafSpace |	They called the projects
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:01,375	| 50-DeafSpace |	Death space
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,423	| 50-DeafSpace |	Death space really
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:05,727	| 50-DeafSpace |	Started at the beginning of time whenever there
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,519	| 50-DeafSpace |	Are deaf people there is
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,311	| 50-DeafSpace |	This idea of death space
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:14,431	| 50-DeafSpace |	Deaf people have sensibilities of adapting their world tour their way of being
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:19,039	| 50-DeafSpace |	The campus took those ideas and poured them into the design of a new building
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:22,111	| 50-DeafSpace |	Call the Sorenson language and communication
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,903	| 50-DeafSpace |	But everyone calls it the SLCC
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:26,719	| 50-DeafSpace |	It was built in 2008
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,511	| 50-DeafSpace |	And also working on a new door
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,071	| 50-DeafSpace |	Hansel Bauman showed me around
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:33,631	| 50-DeafSpace |	And I saw that there are a lot of little innovation
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:37,215	| 50-DeafSpace |	Some that come to mind immediately like the type of doors
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:42,079	| 50-DeafSpace |	If you're walking and signing a normal door will stop your conversation cold
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,455	| 50-DeafSpace |	United sweet
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,991	| 50-DeafSpace |	Just passed through two sliding doors
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:53,855	| 50-DeafSpace |	The sliding doors are purposely designed to allow people to continue
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:57,695	| 50-DeafSpace |	A signed conversation as they enter the building so you don't stop
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,719	| 50-DeafSpace |	Open the door
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:00,511	| 50-DeafSpace |	Start the conversation again
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,047	| 50-DeafSpace |	And then there are more subtle changes
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:06,911	| 50-DeafSpace |	One of the big Ideas behind if space is avoiding eye strain
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:09,983	| 50-DeafSpace |	That's because when you communicate all day with your eyes it's
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,263	| 50-DeafSpace |	Easy to get tired
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:13,311	| 50-DeafSpace |	So if you have bad lighting
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:16,383	| 50-DeafSpace |	Conditions for example which is backlighting glare
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:19,199	| 50-DeafSpace |	High contrast between dark spaces
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,223	| 50-DeafSpace |	And white spaces
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:24,063	| 50-DeafSpace |	Air conditions in the environment which individually vibrate
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,599	| 50-DeafSpace |	Like if you have horizontal lines and
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:27,135	| 50-DeafSpace |	For the blind
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,415	| 50-DeafSpace |	You'll start getting vibration
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:31,999	| 50-DeafSpace |	All those annoyances in of themselves
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:35,327	| 50-DeafSpace |	May not be so bad but taken together over the time of a day
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,119	| 50-DeafSpace |	It's beginning of eye strain
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:39,423	| 50-DeafSpace |	And I strain really wears people out
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:40,703	| 50-DeafSpace |	Basically
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:47,103	| 50-DeafSpace |	I've actually noticed that myself like when I look at horizontal blinds and get that sort of eye vibration
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,127	| 50-DeafSpace |	And I thought I was just
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,943	| 50-DeafSpace |	Weird I don't think you're weird Tom
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:53,247	| 50-DeafSpace |	So the Sorenson building avoids those traps
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:09:00,159	| 50-DeafSpace |	It has enormous windows in a lot of diffuse light to reduce Shadows while you have some direct light coming on
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,207	| 50-DeafSpace |	It's still
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:04,767	| 50-DeafSpace |	Can filled with this diffuse quality of life
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:07,071	| 50-DeafSpace |	There's really not a lot of Shadows on the
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:07,839	| 50-DeafSpace |	Face
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:11,423	| 50-DeafSpace |	There's not a lot of distraction on surfaces behind us
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:15,263	| 50-DeafSpace |	And when we walked by a classroom Hanzo pointed inside at the color scheme
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:20,895	| 50-DeafSpace |	The color of the blue classroom that's a color we've been experimenting with his is a good
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:22,943	| 50-DeafSpace |	Contrast the range of skin tones
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:25,503	| 50-DeafSpace |	You can so clearly see
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:29,855	| 50-DeafSpace |	Sign language in there in that room better when you say you can the next door
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,391	| 50-DeafSpace |	Not all of the changes worked
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:35,487	| 50-DeafSpace |	In the building's design they decided to round off sharp corners
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:39,327	| 50-DeafSpace |	That's because if you can't hear footsteps from around the corner
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:41,631	| 50-DeafSpace |	A lot of times you won't know someone's coming at all
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,423	| 50-DeafSpace |	If people bump into each other
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,215	| 50-DeafSpace |	So they rounded off these
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,543	| 50-DeafSpace |	Again a lesson learned we didn't we realize
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,079	| 50-DeafSpace |	Two people now hug that
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,359	| 50-DeafSpace |	Curved corner like a race car
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,151	| 50-DeafSpace |	Can you still kind of have that problem
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:56,735	| 50-DeafSpace |	So our strategy now is to create glass corners
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:01,087	| 50-DeafSpace |	It allow you to kind of see through the corner but it still extend that.
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:01,855	| 50-DeafSpace |	Time
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,879	| 50-DeafSpace |	I think you have the
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,391	| 50-DeafSpace |	Before you get to
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:07,487	| 50-DeafSpace |	The building is definitely Pleasant to look at
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:10,303	| 50-DeafSpace |	The color scheme is nice the lightest pleasing
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:12,095	| 50-DeafSpace |	But as someone who can hear
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:15,423	| 50-DeafSpace |	Probably would not have noticed a lot of these little changes if
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,703	| 50-DeafSpace |	Hanzo hadn't pointed them out
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:22,591	| 50-DeafSpace |	But after walking around with Hanzo the most striking thing about the building was the level of
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,103	| 50-DeafSpace |	Thoughtfulness
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:27,711	| 50-DeafSpace |	Everything in the building seems to have a specific thought behind it
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:32,575	| 50-DeafSpace |	Chairs are on Wheels so you can constantly rearrange them in circles
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,879	| 50-DeafSpace |	And they made benches out of wood
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:37,695	| 50-DeafSpace |	Because you can feel vibrations more easily Through the Wood
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,487	| 50-DeafSpace |	And they try to
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,791	| 50-DeafSpace |	Strategically place air conditioning units
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,071	| 50-DeafSpace |	So they don't make as much noise
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:46,911	| 50-DeafSpace |	That's because it turns out that hearing aids can pick up that sound
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,447	| 50-DeafSpace |	A really jarring way
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:51,519	| 50-DeafSpace |	And for honzel working on deafspace Hazmat
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,543	| 50-DeafSpace |	Becoming sensitive
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,591	| 50-DeafSpace |	To arrange of issues that you never thought of before
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,383	| 50-DeafSpace |	I think
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,151	| 50-DeafSpace |	The
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:58,687	| 50-DeafSpace |	The window that
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,479	| 50-DeafSpace |	The death experience

EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:05,599	| 50-DeafSpace |	Is to provide us with a new kind of awareness around
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:07,135	| 50-DeafSpace |	What's working and what's not working
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,159	| 50-DeafSpace |	In a row
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,951	| 50-DeafSpace |	That we might accept
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:10,975	| 50-DeafSpace |	Everyday is
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,999	| 50-DeafSpace |	Just kind of our condition
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,279	| 50-DeafSpace |	We're not aware of it
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,559	| 50-DeafSpace |	It's not
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,607	| 50-DeafSpace |	In front of us in a way that we can
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,375	| 50-DeafSpace |	Name
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:19,935	| 50-DeafSpace |	What's the aggravation in the room where the environment
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,447	| 50-DeafSpace |	Strasser
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:22,751	| 50-DeafSpace |	We don't have a way to recognize
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,799	| 50-DeafSpace |	I think it's part of everyday death
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:25,567	| 50-DeafSpace |	Experience
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:29,919	| 50-DeafSpace |	That's why everyone involved in the death Space Project says it is not just
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,431	| 50-DeafSpace |	For deaf people
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,735	| 50-DeafSpace |	Fundamentally this is about Universal
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:35,295	| 50-DeafSpace |	Designing to the widest range of people
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,575	| 50-DeafSpace |	Possible with a variety of a
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,111	| 50-DeafSpace |	Because
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:39,391	| 50-DeafSpace |	Not only is it more inclusive
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:41,951	| 50-DeafSpace |	The monster we better design
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,463	| 50-DeafSpace |	Regardless of

EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:55,775	| 50-DeafSpace |	Black analysts turn out to be better for everyone
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,055	| 50-DeafSpace |	Now you see that application
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,615	| 50-DeafSpace |	Designing for the Deaf
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:02,175	| 50-DeafSpace |	Maybe more subtle but if we mitigate eye strain
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,967	| 50-DeafSpace |	Hearing aid interference
