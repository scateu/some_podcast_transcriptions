EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:10,175	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	In that material
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:12,991	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	We didn't really give you enough contacts understand that little bit
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:17,087	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	But here's the result there's a time was more are exchanged when you use the
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:22,719	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Swing door then when using revolving door air
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:23,231	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Spencer
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:26,047	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Death and Russia again the designer in New York
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,863	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And this factoid really resonated with me
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:33,727	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Which makes total sense because opening a swinging door is like tearing a hole in a building
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:36,031	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	All that heat or air condition
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,799	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Leaks out
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:41,407	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And the building has to kick into high gear to make up for that temperature and humidity fluctuation
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:48,063	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Dan waslaski and his team observed by building on MIT campus that had both revolving doors and Swinging Doors
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:50,367	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And found that the revolving-door usage
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,391	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Sad and about
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,671	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	25%
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,951	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	The team realized that
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:56,511	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	In addition to conserving energy and helping the environment
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:07:03,167	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	They can also save MIT more than $7,500 annually if everyone just use the revolving door in this one building
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:04,447	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:09,311	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	They found the kid raised revolving-door usage at that building to 60 or 70%
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:10,591	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	What system simple signage
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,639	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And even though the MIT study
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:14,943	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	What's on in Boston and Andrew was in New York
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:16,991	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	It seemed like a pretty transposal data set
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:23,391	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	To all this inspired Andrew Shea in New York City decide to take up his friends challenge back from when he was in grad school
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:28,511	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And see what some simple observation and signage could do for one building in New York
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:30,047	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	That building was Columbia University
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:34,143	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	It was the applied sciences building at the brand new building
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:36,703	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Three sets of Swinging Doors and three sets of revolving doors
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:38,239	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	At the one end
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:38,751	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Entry point of this bill
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:43,359	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Andrew started by just watching the building I spent probably altogether about
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:43,871	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	2 months
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,407	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Once a week
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,687	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Tuesday Mornings
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,967	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Some of those weeks I was there for
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,735	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	For twice a week 2
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:50,527	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	I watch people
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:52,831	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	In the building and counted
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,879	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And he counted
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,927	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	For about 20 hours in a 2 month period
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:58,207	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	I just never that only
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,743	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	28% of people reviews
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,511	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Using the revolving
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:03,583	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	So my first invention was
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,351	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Is chest tube
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:04,863	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Create a bear
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,167	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Took eight and a half
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:07,935	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Depay 11-piece
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:09,215	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	The paper I wrote for Elise
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:09,983	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Simply
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,263	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Please use revolving doors
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:15,615	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Yeah that factoid about revolving doors exchanging 8 times less air than Swinging Doors
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,639	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Very
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:17,407	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Curly taper
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	It cost 50% of
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:20,735	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	People
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,527	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Two then go ahead and use revolve
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:25,087	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	So that's a 30-point and Grace
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:25,855	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	It was a thirty percent
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,647	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And that of course
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:29,695	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	I wanted to know how it go
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,719	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Get that number even higher
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,743	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	May 2nd
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,023	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Can sign the shape of an arrow
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:35,327	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And this era was smaller than the first time
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:38,911	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	But then revolving-door you said actually fell five points from his previous attack
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,191	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	To 53%
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:45,567	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	So Andrew treatment larger and he also made it mask Columbia University's visual ID
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,615	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Columbia has like a light
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:48,639	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Blue and dark blue
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:50,175	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Color palette and their branding
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,991	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	So my Hope was that The Branding would help
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:53,503	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	People
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,039	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Connect with it more and
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,319	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And taken more seriously
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,367	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And the fact that 71% of people
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,903	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	End up using the revolver
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:01,183	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	As result of that
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,975	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	71%
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:06,047	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	That's up 43 points and where he started
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:06,559	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Twenty Eight percent
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:12,191	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Here at 99 piht we were curious to find out if that could happen here in the Bay Area
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:18,335	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Turn Avery truffelman to go stick out of building in Downtown Oakland
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:24,991	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Text Evan
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:30,367	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Mrs. Avery in sand in the observation stage
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:33,183	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	The residual scientist part of me has to remind you here
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:37,535	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	All the data sets were talking about today are very small so I understand that
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:40,095	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	But everyone's observations are aligned
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:42,911	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Given the choice revolving doors just
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:48,543	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Part that popular so far and how we doing
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:51,871	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Forever swinging 04 revolving
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,687	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Birthday
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:57,247	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Nobody is using revolving doors
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:59,295	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And when someone has a revolving door
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:02,623	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	It was notable
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:05,695	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Market one
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:07,231	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Revolving door
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:22,847	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	After a half-hour they tallied up the results
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,127	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Crank It Up
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:30,271	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Tell me to 259 people use swinging doors for people use revolving door
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,319	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	In a 30-minute.
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:33,855	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:42,815	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	These are the signs designed by Andrew Shay is an arrow that says please use revolving door
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:47,423	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	The Exchange 8 times less air
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:54,591	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	None of the people using revolving doors were watching
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:56,895	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	See what happens
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:10:59,967	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Batman
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:04,831	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And uses the revolving door
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:07,391	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Another guy
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:11,999	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Directions
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:13,791	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	They're already
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:18,655	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Increasing the revolving-door traffic flow
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:22,239	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	It doubled in less than 5 minutes
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,823	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And after another 30 minutes
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,871	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Teen99 pile the results
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:30,175	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Winter holiday
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:30,943	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	4

EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:40,927	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Alright how are you
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:44,511	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Okay so these are people who use The Swinging Doors even though the sign was on them
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:50,143	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45

EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:57,567	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And then people who use the revolving door this time or 5:10
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:59,615	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	1520 2065

EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,943	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	There was no sign that building
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,223	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Between the hours of

EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,807	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	On Monday
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:09,087	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Originally it was 1.5
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,135	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	After
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,927	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Define thirty and a half percent
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:14,975	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	The people went through the revolving doors
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,767	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	When there's a sign pointing to them
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,327	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	First 1.5
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,095	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Percent without the time
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,823	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Now we did not try testing all the variation
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:36,223	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	So people could have interpreted the signed as intended taking in the message that revolving doors were more energy efficient
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:38,015	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And adjusted their behavior accordingly
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:41,087	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Or they could have just thought the swinging door was out of order
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:46,207	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Or they could have just noticed something was out of the ordinary and it none of them into using the revolving door
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:48,767	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Whatever happened with this much is clear
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:51,583	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Putting up an arrow on a door makes people do things
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:53,887	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	If you want to get people to use a revolving door
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,911	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	That's a good place to stay
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:13:02,079	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And with that salmon Avery left the lobby of that building and took down the signs
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:06,943	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Just like Andrew Shea took down his signs at Columbia then shared his results with the powers-that-be
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,735	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	But nothing ever came of it
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:14,367	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Dan Wesolowski says that MIT did eventually incorporate some of the basic concepts of his study
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,135	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	When they created
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:18,463	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Sustainability stickers to place on their outer doors
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:20,255	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Although he thought his sons were better
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:26,143	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Another really powerful way to increase the use of revolving doors is to address the issue in the architecture itself
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:29,983	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	It turns out they're actually much more effective revolving doors
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,775	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Like at the Marriott Hotel in Oakland
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:38,175	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	It's much larger is the visual focus of the entrance and it has three dividers which are actually big enough for you to
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:39,967	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	To be inside one of them with stranger
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:41,759	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	If not feel too weird about him
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:43,039	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	And they were evolve automatically
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,087	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Most importantly
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:47,391	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	The doorman won't open The Swinging Doors for you
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,671	| 99pi-0093-revolvingdoors-1 |	Unless I see you're already going for the
