EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,936	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	I'm Chris Messina the inventor of the hashtag
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,216	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Designer
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:50,752	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	And translator
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,056	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Human culture
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:54,848	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	That's probably a little bit bloated
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:58,944	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Chris was the first one to use a hashtag on Twitter
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,480	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Before it was even called a hashtag
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:04,320	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Tag back in August of 2007 when he was going to an event called barkcamp
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:07,904	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	It's a nerdy thing it's everything it's it's an event that you go to
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:10,720	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	That's completely unstructured in unplanned and the participants.
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:13,536	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	So the participants needed a way of organizing
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,072	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Which led Chris to tweet the
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:15,840	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	The very first
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:16,608	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Hashtag
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,912	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Even though at that point it was just a pound sign
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:21,728	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	How do you guys feel about using
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:22,240	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Pound
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,520	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Barkcamp
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,544	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Four groups
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:30,944	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Putting a pound sign in front of the word barkcamp helps the other people at barkcamp take out the
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:37,344	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	The word bar camp in their Twitter stream and encourages all the other bar Camp distance to use
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:43,744	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Conversation
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:50,144	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Some people got on board and agreed to use the pound sign
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:52,448	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Most were like okay you go do that
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:56,032	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	The pound symbol had already provided other corners of the web
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,848	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Internet relay chat AKA IRC
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:02,432	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Use the pound sign to represent chat rooms or conversation Channel
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:04,992	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	There's another social network to the time called Raikou
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:05,760	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	That also have these Channel
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:08,320	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	So there was other stuff that came before me
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:11,904	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	But Chris was using bunch of pound signs throughout his tweets
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:12,672	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	I was putting
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:13,952	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Pound symbol
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:14,976	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	In front of my word
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:17,536	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Bieber like I don't understand what you're doing
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,071	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	You're putting all this strange punctuation info
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:20,351	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Your stuff end
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,375	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	It looks dumb
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:23,167	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	But the True Believers did by the sign
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,215	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	One Twitter user called it a
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:25,983	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	A hash
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:26,751	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Tag
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:27,775	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Because hash
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,799	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Is the British name for the
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:30,335	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Sign and these are being used
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,103	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Is a category
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:34,943	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Tags and then the hash and the tag. Conjoined into one word
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:38,271	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Chris actually brought the hashtag idea to Twitter headquarters directly
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:40,063	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	But they thought it would never catch on
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:40,575	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Monkey
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:43,903	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Then a few months later in October of 2007
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,975	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	The purpose of the hashtag was fully realized
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:48,511	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	A friend of mine was down in
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:55,423	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	San Diego his name is Nate Ritter and he was using Twitter basically pulling all the stuff together around these fires at work
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,447	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Are going on in San Diego
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:05:02,847	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Wildfire in San Diego
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:03,615	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	He was
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:07,199	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Prefixing all of his tweets with sand space Diego space fire
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:13,343	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	So Chris told Nate but he should switch to hashtag San Diego fire all one word and then other users would imitate
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,391	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	It worked
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:19,231	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	People trying to find out about the fire knew exactly where to look on Twitter
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:23,583	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	And this was a moment where everyone went that's what friends are for
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,119	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Clarify
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:27,679	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Hashtags were nothing that Twitter planned on
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,983	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	And they kind of drag their feet on incorporating it
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:33,311	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	There must be a better way to organize all this in
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,335	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	That's fine
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:35,615	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	I'm weak I'm looking for
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:37,919	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	The hashtag and
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:40,735	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Andy lorek
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:43,807	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Letting employee at Twitter officially brought in the hashtag
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:45,343	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	The users brought in the hashtag
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,111	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Like what all I did was
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:47,647	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	#Detroit
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,695	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	One line of code
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:50,719	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Give me about fifteen
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:56,351	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	That one line of code meant that when you click on a word with a hashtag in front of it

EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:50,943	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	It had a lot of various uses

EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,087	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	The keys thing
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,879	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Is the thing that symbol had to do in order to
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:03,743	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Survive because symbols that didn't make it onto the typewriter keyboard got pretty unpopular

EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:11,167	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Fast forward to 1963
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,983	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	The invention of the touch-tone telephone
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:16,799	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Hi this is a bell systems new
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,079	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Hyundai
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:21,151	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	The touch tone phone used buttons instead of a rotary wheel
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:26,271	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	So unlike previous phones the numbers didn't have to be arranged in a circle on the dial anymore
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:31,903	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Bell Laboratories a research subsidiary of AT&T
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:35,487	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Experimented with a few different designs for the telephone keypad
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:38,047	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	They try to arranging the numbers into rows of 5
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,327	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	A circle across
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,607	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	The step pattern
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:45,727	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	But they ended up using the numbers 1 through 9 in a three-by-three grid
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:48,543	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Can you put zero alone in the bottom center
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:51,103	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Years later in 1968
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:57,503	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Why not add keys to either side of the zero this would make the keypad into a rectangle
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,807	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	View more options on the phone menu
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,599	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	To repeat these options
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,367	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Press the star key
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:05,695	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Because unlike rotary phones
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:10,047	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Touch-tone phones allow you to continue to dial after the connection has been made
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:16,191	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	So you can punch in extensions and navigate automated menus
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,751	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Press 2
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:21,311	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Originally Bell Labs wanted
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,847	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Pretty shapes on the 2X
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:23,615	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Star buttons
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:27,455	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	That made prototype phone that had a five pointed star and a diamond
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,735	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	On either side of the zero
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:30,527	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	But an engineer named Doug Kerr
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:33,599	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Would have none of this diamond and five point star business
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:36,671	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	That's because by that time a new thing of coming to the picture
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:43,839	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	The possibility of customers dialing directly from their phones into a computer for such things as checking bank balances
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,887	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Is there validating their credit cards or what have you
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:49,983	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Doug Kerr wanted to make sure that the two new symbols will be one second
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,007	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Computer could recognize
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:55,103	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Ones that appear on a keyboard and were part of the computers vocabulary
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,895	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	So there would be no uncertainty
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,687	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	About how a certain button
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,967	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Would be recorded
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:02,015	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	And the data that went into the computer
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:05,087	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Bell Labs was pretty set on their star and Diamond idea
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:09,439	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	To the compromise was an ass trick for the star in a pound for the diamond
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,207	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Because
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:10,975	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	You know the
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,487	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Center
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,535	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	How to look Diamond like I guess
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	For a second AT&T was like can we at least call it a diamond there's no reasonable reason
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:24,031	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	It's not a diamond that all AT&T didn't know what to call this button in their manuals
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:29,663	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	And this led to the creation of what some people including Keith Houston consider the symbols official name
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,687	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	The octothorpe
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,455	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	The octothorpe
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:34,271	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	One day I was out with my
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,295	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Engineering partner
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:42,207	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	And we got to talking about it and thought maybe we should come up with a new name in marketing for AT&T
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:45,279	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	During the time being is engineering partner look at the symbol
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:47,583	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	And saw that I had eight line sticking out of it
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:49,631	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	So we'll put the word cocktail in there
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:54,751	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Tendentious audited are we just a wealth phe RP
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,287	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	In there too
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:58,847	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Because it sounds kind of Greek ashamed

EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:34,175	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Originally the only reason octothorpe ever caught on with him Bell Labs was because Engineers thought it was funny joke

EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:26,911	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	It's
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:28,191	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Probably one of the most dense symbols
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,471	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	And so
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:35,871	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	When you're reading a sentence or you're reading a tweet it stands out

EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:49,695	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	That's how we do and this is all probably going to sound so dated in like

EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,999	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	For two years
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:53,279	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Or maybe a few months
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:56,863	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Getting hashtag out loud I'm going to sound like someone reading a telegram

EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:13,247	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	The hashtag is a way of
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:15,551	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Changing our language to be more computer friend
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:20,159	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	And what we're needing to do is actually invert the Paradigm where the computers become more friendly to you
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:23,999	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	So we're probably not going to be using hashtags
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:24,767	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	The way Twitter uses
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,047	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Hashtags
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:26,815	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Forever
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,863	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	But this won't mean the end of the symbol itself
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:35,775	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	It started out on paper but then it leaped to typewriters computers and phones and it seems like it's probably going to stick around
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,567	| 99pi-0145-octothorpe-1 |	Whatever we decide to call it
