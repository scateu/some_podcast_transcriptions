EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:34,048	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	I'm Roman Mars
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:40,704	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Today Show is about something so tiny and unremarkable and ubiquitous
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:43,264	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	But I can't quite believe we're doing whole episode about it
EDL	00:00:43,776	00:00:44,800	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	It's sand
EDL	00:00:44,800	00:00:48,896	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The tiny grains of eroded rock that we sculpt in the castles at the beach
EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:52,992	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Send my nuts like a topic worthy of our attention
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:56,064	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Vince beiser wrote a whole book about sand is called
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:59,648	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The world in a grain and I promise you it is fascinating
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:01,184	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Is my conversation with Vince
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:02,464	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	All about sand
EDL	00:01:02,464	00:01:04,512	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And how it transformed our civilization
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:13,472	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You know when you were spending a few years on this I imagine you told someone you're working on a book about sand
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:15,264	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	What was the look on their face
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:18,848	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And how did you explain to them to make them understand
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:21,152	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	How cool and important the subject is
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:25,504	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So every single time I would get this looked at was just like
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:28,832	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Like why my trap
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:34,720	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You know why am I trapped in a conversation with this person who's about to you know who's so obsessed with the most boring
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:35,488	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Thing on earth
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:37,792	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And based my comeback was
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:41,376	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Why would I write a book about what sounds like the most boring thing in the world
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:43,680	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And the reason is because
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:48,288	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Sand is actually the most important solid substance on Earth
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:51,616	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	It's the literal Foundation of modern civilization
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:52,640	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:55,456	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And so how do we use sand in our daily life
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:56,992	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So basically
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:59,296	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	If you look around you
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:03,648	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Right now I don't know where you are but chances are excellent no matter
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:06,464	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	What kind of building or office or room you're sitting in
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:09,792	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Floor underneath you the walls around the ceiling overhead
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:13,376	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The building you're sitting it is probably made at least partly out of
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,400	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Concrete
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:18,496	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Just like every shopping mall every apartment building every
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:20,800	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Office tower everywhere in the world
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:22,848	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	From Beijing to Lagos is made out of
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:23,616	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Concrete
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,152	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And what is concrete
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:27,712	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Concrete is nothing but Sand and Gravel
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,736	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	That's been stuck together
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:31,552	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The roads that connect all those buildings
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:33,344	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Also made out of sand there either
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:35,648	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Concrete are there asphalt asphalt is also J
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,672	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Sand that's been glued together
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:40,256	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The windows in every one of those buildings are made of sand
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:42,816	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Glass is nothing but sand that's been melted down
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:44,608	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The Silicon chip
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:46,656	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The power our computers or cell phones
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,192	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Also made from Sand
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,728	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Other words
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:50,496	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Without sand
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:52,032	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	No modern
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:54,080	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And here's the real kicker
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:56,128	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	We are starting to run
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,992	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Possible if you feel like there is
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,528	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So much sand in the world
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:05,344	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	There is a lot of sand in the world
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:07,904	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	It's actually the most abundant thing on the planet
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,672	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:10,208	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	We are also using
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,768	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Way more of it than ever before in human history
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:17,120	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	We use more sand than any other natural resource in the world
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:18,400	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Except for air and water
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:22,752	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	We're about 50 billion tons of the stuff every single year
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:25,824	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Which is enough to cover the entire state of Calif
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:26,592	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	California
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,360	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Why
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:30,944	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Don't we just go to the Sahara and take all the saint there
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,736	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Write great question
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:33,760	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So there is a course
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:37,344	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You know practically infinite amounts of sand in the desert
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:37,856	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Problem is
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:40,928	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	That's and is pretty much useless to us
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:43,744	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The reason is that desert sand
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:50,144	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	As a different shape that actual greens are shaped differently than the sand grains that you find at the bottom of rivers
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:50,656	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Beaches
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:55,776	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	It's been eroded by wind rather than water over if you know thousands of millions of years
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:58,336	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And as a result the greens are a lot
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:03:59,616	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Rounder and smoother
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:02,688	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And the crazy fun at the bottom of rivers
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:05,248	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So the number one thing that we need sand
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,784	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	4 by far is concrete
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:10,368	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And that desert sand just doesn't lock together
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,136	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Format
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:13,440	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Strong stable structure that you need for conch
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:15,744	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	If I could difference between
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:19,583	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Trying to build something out of a stack of little marbles as opposed to a stack of little
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:23,167	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	It's all that desert sand pretty much
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,215	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And so we have to get it
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:25,983	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	From
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:30,079	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Water eroded sand that comes off of mountains and then accumulates in
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:33,663	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Rivers and things like that that's that's the sound we need
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:34,943	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Exactly
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:37,759	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Exactly this is why I become such a problem because
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:41,343	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You know when you're talking about extracting millions of tons of
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:42,367	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Saint from
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,903	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Bottom of a lake or the bottom up
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:48,511	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	River inevitably we are doing tremendous environmental damage
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,791	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	To get that sand
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:54,911	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Ripping up riverbed stripping beaches bear stripping Lakebottom spare
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,703	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Even picking it up out of the ocean
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,471	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Cousin
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:59,519	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Huge environmental damage all over the world
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:01,567	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And in some places
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:03,615	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Supplies have gotten so tight
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:07,199	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Organized crime has actually moved into the industry that
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,991	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Black Market in sand
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:11,295	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So the demand for Sandi's Sewing Center
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:13,087	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	That is actually leading to
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,367	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Global
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:18,207	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Conflict it's true there is so much demand for sand that
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:22,303	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In many places around the world people are being imprisoned
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,839	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Tortured and murdered
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,119	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	By the hundreds
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:26,399	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Oversand
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:32,543	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And the violence is probably at its worst in India where they actually called in the sand Mafia
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,079	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	But it's
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:40,223	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	By no means the only place a lien keenyah in Indonesia and Gambia and many other places around the world
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:44,063	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Same kind of thing people are are fighting and

EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:49,695	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And you've actually witnessed some of this
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:51,231	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In India you witness
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,279	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Some of the crime associated with
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:53,791	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Cassandra
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:57,375	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Yeah absolutely this is what got me started on it is I just
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:58,655	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Stumbled across
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:03,007	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	An article about the murder of a farmer in India
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:04,543	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:07,871	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	What really caught my eye was that he had been killed over
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,383	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Send
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:11,967	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And you know that point I was like most people I never even
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,735	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Thought about
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:17,343	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Send my life and never given it a second thought Beyond like how am I going to get this sand out of my bathing suit
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:22,719	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	But then I do a little more research and found that special in Indian
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:24,767	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Hundreds of people have been murdered over stand
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,303	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In the last few years
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:28,351	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And I just thought that was the
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:34,239	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Craziest thing I've ever heard of like what what in the world would makes and so valuable so important
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,007	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	People jail for it
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,567	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And what I discovered was
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,871	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Did its sand is really the
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:42,431	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Substance that we need to build cities out of
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:46,527	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And in India as in most of the developing world right in China
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:48,831	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Nigeria Indonesia you name it
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:51,135	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	We're building cities
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:54,719	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	At a rate and at a speed that has never happened before in human history
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,767	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Means we need huge amount
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:57,279	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Send
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:07,263	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Weiser says that today massive amounts of sand are being moved around the world
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,031	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The glass
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,567	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Beer chips and asphalt
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,871	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The years and has more
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,663	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The little ground beneath us
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:16,479	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Into a commodity that's mined and refined
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,783	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And sold in a global Marketplace
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:21,087	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And will Sanders the bases
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:26,207	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	I'm so many different products by far the biggest driver of a demand for sand
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,487	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Is the production
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:28,255	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Concrete
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:31,583	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Yeah it's the story of concrete is complete
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:35,679	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Completely fascinating to me I didn't know anything about it until I started the research for this book
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:40,031	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You make concrete by taking sand and gravel and
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:42,335	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Gluing them together with cement
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:46,431	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And you can make cementing in a few different ways but basically
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:51,295	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You take a substance like lime and you bake it down and it turns into a powder
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:54,111	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And then when you mix that powder with water
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,159	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	I-84 misses paste
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:08:00,767	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The clues together all that sand and aggregate but the real magic of it is
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:05,887	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	It does more than just hardened it actually forms a chemical bond between all those
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,935	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The constituent parts
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:10,495	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Like the grains of sand in the gravel in the cement
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,799	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Which is why it's such a great Building Material rights
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:14,847	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Really really strong it's really flexible
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,127	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Anyway
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:19,711	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	There are at least a couple three ancient civilizations that
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:22,783	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Somehow figured out how to do this the ancient Mayans
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,319	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Use the form of concrete
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,623	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Ancient Egyptians
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,159	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Might have had a form of cement
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:32,255	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	But there was the Romans who really figured it out and they actually used concrete
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,047	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And I really
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:36,863	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Extensive way they build roads out of it they do
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,143	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Aqueduct out of it
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:41,983	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	They build buildings out of there still standing today like the pantheon
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,519	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In Rome
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:47,615	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Has a concrete roof that's over 2000 years old and it
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:48,895	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Still standing
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:51,711	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So here's the really bizarre twist to the Romans
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:53,759	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Figured out how to use concrete music
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,295	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The great effect for centuries
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:58,111	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	But then when the Roman Empire collapse
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,647	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The world should have
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,415	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Forgot
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:03,999	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	How to make concrete like the secret of concrete making
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:06,303	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Have disappeared with the Roman Empire
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,839	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And nobody built
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:10,911	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Anything with concrete for about 1500 years
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,215	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Brookside now
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:15,263	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	I love the story because I feel like
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:21,407	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	It's the stroke that you seen a lot of Science Fiction and Fantasy that there's this ancient forgotten knowledge that holds the key to the Future
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:25,247	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Is that a busy week never exist in the real world
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:25,759	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Except
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,807	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The story of concrete
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:34,207	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Concrete is it amazing technology that gets completely forgotten for hundreds of years until the turn of the century
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,999	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And then it re-emerges
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:37,535	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In a big way
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:40,095	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And what really made the big change
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:42,143	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Was
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,191	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	An architect named Ernest Ransom
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:48,031	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Was a British architect who had immigrated to the United States
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,055	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Set up shop
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:50,079	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In San Francisco
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:53,407	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And he started tinkering around cement and with
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:53,919	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Concrete
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,455	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:57,503	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Figuring out different ways to
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:58,783	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You're the perfect mix
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,575	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And eventually
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:03,391	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Literally threw tinkering in his backyard
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:06,719	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	He came up with the idea of reinforced concrete
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:09,535	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Which is concrete with those steel bars
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,071	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Running through it
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,351	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And that is was
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:16,447	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Ernest R and sounds great Innovation Paisley found the pie pudding

EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,407	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Of the concrete
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,943	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And you realized
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:33,087	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Wow this is an incredible building material I can build the walls and the roofs of structures with this stuff
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:36,671	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And it'll be cheap and it'll be strong and

EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:01,247	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Why on Earth would we
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:03,039	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Take a chance on your wacky new idea
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:06,367	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So he literally tries for years and years
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:10,975	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Sell people on this idea and he gets a few commissions he manages to build a
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:12,767	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You get a few buildings
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:15,839	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Built out of concrete in a couple of different places
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:18,399	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Two or three of them in San Francisco where he lives
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,191	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,983	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Then comes 1906
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,287	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The Sam great San Francisco earthquake

EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:01,663	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You know it wouldn't make it withstood the fire
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,711	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	That stuff looks great
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:06,271	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And in your book you talk about how
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:09,855	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The new concrete industry that was developing really took advantage
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:15,487	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Which of these images from the San Francisco fire in the concrete warehouses that survived his way to argue that
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,511	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Like hey check out this

EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:54,399	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And he was almost like
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:59,007	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Like their computers and digital technology in the 90s
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:12:59,519	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	It's the way that

EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:14,111	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You know as though concrete was going to solve every problem known to man it was really
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:15,391	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	People are just
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:17,439	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Ecstatic over it and in fact

EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:21,535	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	He was just in love with concrete
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:23,071	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	He thought concrete was going to be
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:29,471	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You know it was not only going to be an important building material but they basically you could build anything out of concrete
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:33,055	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	He built several completely all concrete

EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:37,663	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	At what she furnished with concrete furniture
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:39,967	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Even though the concrete piano
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:43,039	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	50 Cent touring around the country
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:46,623	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	It doesn't allow architects
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:48,415	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Quite inventive because if it
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,695	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You know
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:52,255	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Its ability to be shaped and all different kinds of way
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,047	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Oh absolutely
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,583	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Absolutely I mean you know
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:57,631	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Look at things structures like
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,911	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Like the guggenheimer
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:03,775	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You know this the Sydney Opera House these incredibly fanciful

EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,871	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You can make those things out of bricks
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,919	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You know RR Stone
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:12,479	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Yeah no concretas
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:13,503	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Alien addition 2
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:18,111	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	To making it easy to to build really strong durable structures it makes
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:18,623	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Is it possible
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,159	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	To build
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:22,463	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Some of the most beautiful land and inventive
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:23,743	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Structures in the world
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:26,303	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Not to mention the most useful I mean
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:27,839	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Things like
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:29,887	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You know these enormous dams
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:32,959	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	That's really made possible the
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:35,007	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The modern Southwest in a lot of ways
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,823	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And we went through
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:43,199	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In the Western World we went through our phase of a building a lot of concrete in the 20th century and now
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,223	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	There is a
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:47,551	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Huge growth in cities in Asia and Africa
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:50,111	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So is that where a lot of the Santa's going today
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,903	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Yeah so we
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:56,767	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	I mean we're still building of course in the Western World we still use a lot of sand in a lot of concrete here
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:59,327	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	But it is absolutely dwarfed
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:02,399	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The master we use in the western world is
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:05,215	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Absolutely dwarfed by what's going on in the developing world
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:10,847	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And the reason for that is number one there's more and more people in the world all the time right populations growing
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:14,431	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And more and more than we're moving into cities all the time
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:18,015	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Same thing to happen in this country a hundred years ago people left
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:22,367	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Agricultural Countryside they left farming villages
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,647	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And moved into cities
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:26,463	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The same thing is happening in India and China
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:30,303	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Oliver Africa but on a much bigger scale and how much
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:32,607	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Faster rated a much more compressed
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,143	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Time frame
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:37,215	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So to give you an idea we're adding the equivalent to
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:39,263	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Eight New York cities to the world
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,799	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Every single
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:42,847	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Here yeah
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,895	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Here's another way to think about it
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:48,223	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The amount of concrete that we use every single year
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:50,783	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Is enough to build a wall
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:55,647	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	88 feet high is 88 feet wide right around the equator
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,415	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Every year
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:58,719	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And most of that is happening
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:02,303	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In the developing world and more than anywhere else it's happening in China
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,583	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	China is
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,887	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Far and Away the world's number one

EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,487	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Heavy
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:33,791	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Cubic yard of sand weighs more than a ton
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:39,167	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	If you have to transport it more than a few miles the cost of it goes up very quickly
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,215	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So basically
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:45,311	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Builders in China and everywhere else are always looking for sand that's close by
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:46,591	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:50,943	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Think about Shanghai for example Shanghai is one of these cities that is Jessica
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,711	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Exploded
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:53,247	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In the last 20 years
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:55,039	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	More skyscrapers have been built
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,319	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In Shanghai
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:58,367	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In the last 20 years
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:00,415	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Then there are in all of New York City
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:02,719	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So obviously they are using
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:05,791	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Just a staggering amount of sand where's it all coming from
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:07,071	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Well
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,607	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Fur in the early
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:11,423	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Part of this Century there getting most of it from the Yangtze River
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:14,751	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	They're just scooping it right off the bottom of the Yangtze River
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:20,895	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And that caused a lot of problems number one it was causing Riverbanks to literally collapse
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:23,199	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Apps right when you dig out the middle of the river
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:26,527	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The sides of the river off and just collapsed taking with it
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:28,575	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Agricultural land villages
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:32,159	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You know it is snarls up shipping in a really terrible way
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,183	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And also
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:35,743	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Does serious damage to the river's ecosys
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:38,559	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Emacs anything that was living on the bottom of the river
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:41,887	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Obviously has gone their habitats just been destroyed
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,911	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And also
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:49,311	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	That when you set up the water like that it blocks the sunlight from reaching plants that are growing underneath
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,079	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The water
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:51,871	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Huge damage
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:56,991	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And the Chinese authorities realized this they were like well this is a serious problem for the Yangtze River which is
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,783	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Probably important
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:03,135	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Resource for China is the source of drinking water for hundreds of millions of people

EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,695	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,719	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	They had to ban
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,279	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Buy sand mining on the Yangtze River
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:10,815	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	As a result
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:14,399	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Sand miners just to push their operations
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:16,191	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	She doesn't miles Upstream

EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:20,031	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	It's called Lake poyang
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:23,871	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So lake poyang has now become the biggest

EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:29,759	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	230 odd million tons of sand are scooped out of the
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,295	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Lake every year
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:33,599	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And that now of course is starting to
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,903	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Generate its own set of Environmental

EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:51,263	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So basically where does China get its Ann from it gets it from wherever is Handy
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:56,383	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And when you wrote that much pressure on whatever river or lake or whatever is Handy
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:57,663	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	It causes problems inevitable
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,479	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	I mean is this
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:02,271	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	A race to the bottom of weed
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,551	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Going to run out of sand
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:06,111	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So we're not going to
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:12,511	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Completely run out of sand anytime in the foreseeable future we're not going to be fighting over the very last little

EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:21,727	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Right there still a lot of it on the planet
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:23,519	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:26,847	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The stuff that's easy to get at has been mostly Tapped Out

EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:32,223	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And and easy to get our hands on
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,783	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Is increasingly disappearing
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:38,111	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And we're having to go further and further and do more and more damage
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,391	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	How to get the stuff
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:43,743	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The same thing that you see happening with oil where we're having to do things like
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,511	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Fracking
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,791	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Offshore oil drilling
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,327	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	To get the oil that's left
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:49,375	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Similar kind of thing is happening
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,655	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Sad we're having to do
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:53,471	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	To dig deeper and deeper into more and more damage
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:55,263	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	To get at the dwindling
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:55,775	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Supplies of sand
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:58,335	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Beyond the damage that
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:00,895	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You can inflict on the land by
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,431	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Mining the sand
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:03,967	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	What is
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:06,271	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The cost of concrete to the planet
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:10,623	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Yashow concrete has some very significant costs number one
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:12,415	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Is carbon emissions
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:14,975	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So manufacturing cement
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:15,999	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	I is
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:19,327	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Depending on how you measure either the second or the third biggest
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:22,911	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Carbon dioxide is better greenhouse gas emitter
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,423	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	On the Platte
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:28,031	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Did the energy that's required it takes up a lot of a lot of energy to
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:29,567	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	2
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:31,359	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Incinerate all the
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:35,199	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The line that you need to make cement number one and also the process
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,479	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Self gives off a lot of gas
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,271	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So it creates
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:40,319	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Somewhere in the neighborhood of 10%
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:42,623	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Of all greenhouse gases are created by
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,159	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The cement industry
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:45,951	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Course you need cement in Bangkok
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:47,999	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So that's that's number one
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,047	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Number two
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:52,607	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Is that by covering so much ground
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,887	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	With concrete
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:57,983	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You created a lot of places What's called the urban heat island effect
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,775	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The sun's Heat
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:02,335	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Gets soaked up and held by all that concrete
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:06,175	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The temperature of cities can be raised by as much as
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:07,455	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	10 or 15 degrees
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:12,063	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Just due to the fact that the concrete has is retaining all of that
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:15,391	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And that's obviously a big problem in the world
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,928	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	It's getting harder all the time
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,976	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Another fact
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:20,512	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Impact it can have
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:21,792	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Which is better can make
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:22,304	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Flooding
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:23,584	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Worse
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:24,608	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Because
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:26,656	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	For the most part concrete is not
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:27,424	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Poorest right at
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:29,216	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Water flows over it
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:30,496	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:33,056	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	What princess what happened in
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,592	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In the last
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:35,872	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Set of floods in Houston
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:43,040	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Is it made those floods worse because when those rivers rivers overflow their Banks all the water goes pouring into
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:43,552	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Cities
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:48,928	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And it has nowhere to go it just flows through the concrete streets of the Cities
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:51,488	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So it can really exacerbate
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:52,768	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Flooding I really
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:53,536	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Serious way
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:56,864	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Do we need to build with as much concrete as we do
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:58,656	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	No
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:00,448	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Kitchen hutch Shelf
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:07,104	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	I mean listen we need concrete right this is not ring it's not analogous to oil
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:09,920	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Right which is something that we can actually replace
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:12,992	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	What's something cleaner and more sustainable
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:14,784	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	What's solar and wind
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:16,832	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Concrete is a great building at
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:18,368	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	It is created
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:21,184	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Safe durable housing for
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:23,744	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Billions of people the world over who didn't have it
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:24,768	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	20-30 years
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:26,304	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	That's pretty good
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:28,352	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	We need concrete we got to keep using it
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:30,400	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	But yeah we could use a lot less
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:31,936	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	How can we do that
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:33,728	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Well
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:35,008	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	First of all by
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:37,568	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Figuring out ways to restructure how we live
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:41,664	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And said we don't need quite as much infrastructure cars being the most obvious
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:44,736	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Also just by making things
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:46,784	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Smaller I mean I just got back
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:50,112	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	I was just getting some talks about about my book
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:51,392	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In the Netherlands
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:53,184	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:56,768	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The size of the hotel rooms that I stayed in woodshock
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:23:01,376	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Any hotels being American I mean they are
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,144	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Tiny
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:04,448	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	There's room for a bed
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,216	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	A single bed
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:06,496	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And a little desk
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:07,776	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And a window
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,312	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And a little sink
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:10,592	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And that's it
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,920	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Hi there I mean you can literally fit
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:17,504	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Two or three of these rooms in the average Motel 6
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:21,856	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You know it's kind of shocking when you first walk in or in that size but really like
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:24,672	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Who cares I was in most of these towns for one night
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:26,720	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	I'd go in the ghetto
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:30,560	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Do a little work on my computer go to sleep get up pack up and leave
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:32,096	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	I don't need more than
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:34,144	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	That's all I didn't need more than that amount of space
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:38,496	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	All the millions of hotel and motel rooms
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:41,056	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In this country we could easily cut
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,104	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Many of them in half
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:45,664	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You know or
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:49,504	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Houses I mean you know Americans famously we build
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:52,064	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Cheyenne houses we love to have

EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:56,928	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Tract houses in the size of the average American
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:57,440	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Open Home by the way
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:59,232	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Has nearly doubled
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:00,512	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Justin the last
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:02,816	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	We don't need that much
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,352	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You don't need

EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,752	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	We can easily
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,288	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Cut down
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:13,568	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You know create a system of
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:16,128	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Extra taxes or tax
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:17,408	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Sentence for whatever
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:19,200	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	To encourage people to live
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,480	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Smaller
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:21,248	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And I
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:23,040	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Cement we would be no less app
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:27,136	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Are there other materials we could be using
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:29,184	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Yes and that's the other thing
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:32,000	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	There is a lot of research going on around the world
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:35,840	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	To come up with other materials that we could use in concrete rather than
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:36,864	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Since and so
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:38,912	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	There are people who are looking at using
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:40,448	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Bamboo
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:42,496	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Or shredded plastic
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:47,872	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Or recycled tires shredded tires or hemp actually there's a thing
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:49,408	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	There's a product called hempcrete which
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:50,688	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Actually buy right now
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:52,736	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And all those things I think
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:55,296	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Help I think they're all to the good I think they should all be
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,320	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Encourage
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:25:01,184	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	But at the end of the day there's only so far we can go with with alternative
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:03,232	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Materials because the like I said we use
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,024	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	50 billion tons
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,560	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Sub sand and gravel every year
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:08,608	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And even if we could replace
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,144	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	All that sand with you know
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:11,680	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Bamboo
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:15,776	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Where we going to come up with 50 billion tons of bamboo every year
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:17,824	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Right that would create its own set of problems
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:20,384	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Raid spray
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,176	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	I mean I think
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,736	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The real way to think about
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:26,528	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The sand
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:27,040	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Crisis
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:30,624	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Is too kind of referring to question the question isn't really
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:31,648	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	What's going to happen
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:34,208	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	When we run out of sand
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:34,976	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And the question is
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:37,024	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	What's going to happen
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:38,304	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	When we run out of
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:38,816	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Everything
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:41,632	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	We shouldn't just be thinking about like how can we
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:43,680	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Solve the problem of sad because really
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:46,496	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	It sounds familiar right we know
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:48,288	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	That were using too much
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,056	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Freshwater
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:51,616	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	We know that we're cutting down too many trees
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:54,176	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	We know we're harvesting too many fish out of the ocean
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:55,968	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	We know we're burning too much fossil fuel
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:58,528	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Now come to find out where using too much sand
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:01,344	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Welcome to My Mind these are not
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,112	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Separate
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,136	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Problems they're all
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,928	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Symptoms of the same problem
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:07,488	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Which is just that we're consuming
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:08,256	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Too much
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:09,536	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Write the way that we live
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:12,864	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Here in the western world and that lifestyle that we have now

EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,032	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,568	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Let's make our choices
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:34,592	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Is correctly when we

EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:11,456	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And turning it back into limestone
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:14,272	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So that if we talk about carbon capture

EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:34,240	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	But when the most promising Green Building Materials that people are using right now is actually one of the oldest building materials on
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:35,008	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	On Earth
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:35,520	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	What
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:39,104	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	A wooden building stores carbon within it and so
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:43,200	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	If you can build with more wood instead of concrete you have the potential
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:46,016	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	To dramatically reduce the embodied carbon emissions
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:49,856	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You could potentially even have a building that is a net carbon negative
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,904	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And with that goal in mind

EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:01,632	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So Mass Timber is a term that defines
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:03,680	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	What buildings that are made out of large
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:05,728	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Pieces of wood so massive
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:07,008	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	This is what
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:11,360	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You make Master Timber products by layering sheets of wood on top of one another
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:12,640	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And then compressing
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:14,688	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Create extremely strong

EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:27,488	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And the advantage of mass Timber is that
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:30,304	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The thick pieces of wood have an inherent fire resist

EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:39,264	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And you make it a little too small sticks they all burn up and you get a pile of Ash
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:41,312	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	But if you start with really big D
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:42,080	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Pieces of wood

EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:08,448	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Why is anything weird
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:15,360	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Because we haven't heard of them if you went back a hundred fifty years nobody would have heard of a steel building
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:20,480	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Wright cast iron so they were cast iron buildings in cast iron melted in
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:21,504	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	People were very concerned about it
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:22,784	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So if you
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:24,576	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	If you look back
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:25,344	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In time
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:28,160	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	There's been a massive Innovations about what we do
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:33,280	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And if you look back in time there's been massively large tall wood buildings that have built-in last
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:34,048	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	To the long period of time
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:35,584	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Sophie
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:37,120	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	We learn a trade
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:38,144	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In a
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:39,936	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	That is handed down to us
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:43,520	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	I'm from other people so a lot of what we learn we've been told of work
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:45,568	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So we have confidence two things
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:46,592	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Because they've been done before
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:47,872	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:49,664	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	I don't think it's unreasonable to be
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:52,224	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	A little conservative
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:54,016	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	I mean we wouldn't want to build a high-rise building
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:56,064	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	And kills lots of
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:58,112	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The people nor would we want to build a building that
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:33:01,184	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Wasn't able to maintain over a long period of
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:06,048	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	My driver is climate change
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:07,584	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	My driver is
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:10,400	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	In order to
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:12,192	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Have the building sector be part of

EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:15,776	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	End
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:20,128	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	The risks will be trying novel materials new methods
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:21,152	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Of using those

EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:37,024	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	But it's not that straightforward
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:42,400	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	You to really analyze every aspect of the supply chain before you can make such a declaration
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:45,984	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	One of the most important things to consider is where that would is coming from
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:47,264	| 361_The_Most_Important_Solid_Substance_on_Earth_pt01 |	Because the forest
