EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:06,687	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Japan launched an early-morning attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:10,271	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	It came as a profound shock to the US
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:15,647	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And the next day President Franklin Delano Roosevelt announced the country would be entering World War

EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:38,687	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	World War II would be the most widespread war in history
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:43,807	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	The US would be fighting in Europe and the Pacific and parts of North Africa
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:45,087	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	All at the same time
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:49,695	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And it was a huge challenge to coordinate troops across that much territory
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:55,071	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	It was obvious the only communication possible would be by radio
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:57,375	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And that radio
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:59,935	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Was of course insecure
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,215	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	The enemy is listening
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:07,871	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	In other words there wasn't really anything besides radio that can stretch across the distances involved
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,919	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	The radio is easily intercepted

EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:23,391	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And Bell Labs went to our old friend Homer Dudley
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:26,975	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	The guy who invented the Talking Machine of the World's Fair
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:28,767	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Dudley
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,047	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Need you to figure this out
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,327	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Really fast
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,863	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	They were under
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:39,007	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Tremendous wartime pressure to produce this thing quickly I think the whole design took about a year
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:42,335	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Thankfully Dudley had already been working on
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:43,359	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Technology-related
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:44,639	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	This problem for years
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,199	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	It all went back to the voter
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:50,015	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And to another related invention of Dudley's
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:50,783	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Is called the Vogue
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:57,695	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Music nerds might know that turned vocoder because it's the great-grandfather of the machine you here in all kinds of pop music today
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:02,047	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Vocoder with short for voice in
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:04,863	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And the Machine could break down a human voice
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:11,007	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Separated into its basic components and then compress and transmit those components via short
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:14,591	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	You could transmit the minimum amount
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,615	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Signals required
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:19,455	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	To reconstruct that message at the other end
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:21,247	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	This process was important
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:26,367	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Revolutionary actually because it allowed the human voice to be digitized and compressed
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,671	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Send across big distances
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	But the vocoder didn't fully disguise the boys
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:36,095	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	The transmission could still technically be pulled out of the air and decoded
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:40,703	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	To Dudley and his team had to add a layer of unbreakable encryption
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:44,799	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And that's how the bolt cutter became just one small part
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:51,199	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	How much larger and more intricate apparatus

EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:33,695	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Because a lot of the electronics was so delicately

EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,303	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	How to do it
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:17,631	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Communications is the most important thing
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	You have to do it
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,983	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	With Safety and Security that
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,007	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	You know nobody else is

EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:30,943	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	The Sig Sally terminal in the Pentagon was connected to a network of close to a dozen other sigsaly terminals around the
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:37,343	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	These were located in the most strategically important places where politicians and military leaders would need to be talked

EDL	00:11:54,239	00:12:00,383	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	This network allowed leaders in Washington DC to talk securely with any location that had a terminal
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:03,199	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	All they needed was a shortwave radio connect
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:06,271	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And one other key component
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:09,087	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Pair of photograph records
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,623	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Of totally random noise
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,671	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	This is where the encryption Park
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:16,767	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Because for every conference that happened over 6 dali
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:19,327	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Both the sending and receiving terminals
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,607	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Had to have identical record
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:23,167	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Which played the sound of noise
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:30,591	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	The noise would combine with the boys components as they were transmitted via shortwave radio making it impossible

EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:35,967	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	On the receiving end the random noise will be extracted in the voice restored
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:39,807	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	In cryptography these records are what's known as a one-time key
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:41,855	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	So here's how they work
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:44,159	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Random noise would be generated
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:47,487	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And then pressed on a gold master
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:51,071	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Normally a phonograph record you would reproduce
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,351	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Thousands of them
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:56,959	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	From a single master in this case they made exactly to record
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:13:01,823	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Be identical and now totally unique records would be assigned a matching code name
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:04,639	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Annies code names were awesome
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:06,431	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Like red strawberry

EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:15,903	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	So what's a President Harry Truman in Washington DC wants to talk with prime minister Winston Churchill in London
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:19,999	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Truman keeps one of the two records in Washington DC
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:22,047	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	The second one
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,327	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Would be sent
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:26,911	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	To the station at the other side of the ocean
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:33,823	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And then placed on this special Precision turntable that was a part of the

EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:40,991	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	At the scheduled time for the conference sigsaly engineers in DC and London would tune in to WWE

EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:54,559	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	So that we can synchronize our control clocks
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:56,095	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Exactly
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:58,143	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Then they get their identical records
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:00,191	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Spending on their respective turntables
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:01,983	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	At exactly the same moment
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,799	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Once the records were synced
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:08,639	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Truman would speak into a handset in Meigs conference room at the Pentagon

EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,391	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Proposal in 19
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:25,279	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	The signal would go down into the basement or Don was running the Sig Sally terminal
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:30,143	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	The terminal with digitized Raymond voice mix it with random noise from the record
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:33,727	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And then transmit that signal across the ocean via shortwave radio
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:40,383	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	On the other end the 6th alley terminal in London would reverse the process
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:42,175	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	It would remove the noise
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:43,711	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Reconstruct the boys
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:45,759	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Beat it through Churchill pants
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:51,391	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	After so much processing and such a long distance
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,695	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	The boys didn't sound very good
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,975	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Like gibberish
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:57,279	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Orated from the bottom of a
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,047	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Barrel
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,583	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	But it wasn't Elitch
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,143	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	You had a kind of train your ear abish
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,679	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Anyway
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:06,495	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Then Churchill would reply
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,311	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And the whole process
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:24,415	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	In this way Truman and Churchill could have a completely secure real-time Converse

EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,559	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	When the conversation ended
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:31,583	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	The two records
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:32,863	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Remember
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:35,423	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Are contained the top-secret random noise
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,191	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Key
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:36,703	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Would be
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:44,127	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	That's because if anyone was recording this communication as it traveled over the ocean the random noise record would be the key
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:44,895	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Key to the Kryptonite
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:51,295	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	It would allow them to subtract the noise in the same way that 6 lb Engineers did at each end of the transmission
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:56,415	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	So the records were the most classified and sensitive component of success Ali
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:58,463	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	By the end of world war
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:02,047	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	2 there had been a total of about 3
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:02,815	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Thousand
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:05,375	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Top secret strategic conferences
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:08,447	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	In other words at least 6000 vinyl record
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:09,727	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	That were pressed
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:10,751	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Delivered
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:13,055	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Used and then destroyed at the end of the
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:17,663	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	DeBary today or if they run a memory type technology but
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:19,711	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	By that time it was
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:21,759	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Even thought of
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:24,575	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Voice Communications in terms of being digitized
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:30,975	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And because of my voice
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:32,767	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	So if
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:34,815	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	People were listening in
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:37,631	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	To that signal if Germans were listening in
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:38,655	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	What would they hear
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:42,495	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Nothing but random noise just
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:44,287	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Total white noise
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:51,967	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	I mean it might have been so unintelligible that they didn't even realize they were listening to anything at all
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:52,735	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Never
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,783	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	New of the existence of the system
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:57,343	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And they never had any inkling
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,391	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	That it was an encrypted
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,159	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Speech
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:06,303	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Exactly that's why I said Sally was nicknamed The Green Hornet after the popular 1940's radio show
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:13,215	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Because an intercepted Sig Sally transmission sounded like nothing more than a hornet's but
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:21,151	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Sig Sauer was involved in pretty much every major military operation after 1942
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:26,271	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	It was even critical in the planning of the Manhattan Project in the dropping of the atomic bombs over Japan
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:31,135	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Scripting and listen in on those six conversations
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:35,999	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Even though he didn't know at the time the meaning of the code words they were using
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:39,327	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And I'm assuming that she is coming over in the Titleist Manhattan Project
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:42,911	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	But I question know what the Manhattan Project was
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:45,215	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	John didn't reflect mod
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:48,543	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	John the grave implications of those meetings he overheard
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,591	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	He was an engineer
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:51,615	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Doing his best
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,639	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Keep the equipment running
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:58,527	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	You didn't pay that much attention to everything that was said you're more concerned with the transmission
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:03,135	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	But he knows it would have been hard for the Allies to win the war without Sig Sally
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:05,695	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	It's hard to say what we would do if we didn't have it
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:09,279	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Even if that Victory sometimes came at a brutal price
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:15,935	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	At the end of the war the six Sally terminals were dumped in the ocean
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:17,215	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Almost
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:19,775	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Every encryption device
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:23,615	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Was intentionally destroyed when the war was over
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:27,711	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Security purposes to the extent of destroying
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,479	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	The plan
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:35,135	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	But not before the military develop successors that were smaller and simpler and easier to set up
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:39,743	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	These new devices still work in the same principles of encryption as Sig Sally
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:44,351	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	And there were used for secure Communications during the Cold War the Korean War

EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:52,287	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	A lot of the information related to Sig Sally wasn't the classified until the mid 1970
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:56,383	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	When AT&T sue the US military under the freedom of

EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,687	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Once it was public
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:01,247	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	Technology that originated with Sig Sally
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:03,551	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	When on two entirely new realm
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:08,927	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	The vocoder for instance went on to have a whole new life in music
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:15,327	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	In the 1970s electronic musicians like Kraftwerk began using a smaller version of the machine to cry

EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:45,023	| 99pi-0208-vocoder-1 |	But the vocoders reach actually goes Way Beyond
