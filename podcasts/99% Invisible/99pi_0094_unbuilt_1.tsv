EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:32,095	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	There is the way to do it and there's the way to rebuild quickly
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:36,191	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Everyone who would Embrace did it first pretty sooner than symbol
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:40,031	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The business of San Francisco is getting back to business and rebuild and showing people
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,823	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	We don't have time to do these crazy things
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:46,943	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Burnham and his supporters kept trying to do these crazy things from near and far
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:50,015	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	But none of the real things he proposed
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:51,039	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Stuck at all
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:52,575	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Because they just
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:57,439	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	What had seemed to be an opportunity for them to be done
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,231	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	In fact
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,791	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Created the pressure
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,327	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Just to go back to the way things
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:06,655	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It's Lower Manhattan after 9/11
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,447	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	What's New Orleans
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:09,983	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	After Katrina
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:11,775	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Again and again and again
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,567	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Those are two things
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:16,383	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	High-speed hanging Bullets Over The Bay
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,663	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Analogical City
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:23,807	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	That we can hold in our imagination than curse our forebears for being so short-sighted
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,087	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	But quite honestly
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:29,183	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	A lot of things probably most of the things that we
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,207	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Gold designer belt
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:32,767	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Would have been just terrible
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:35,583	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	I mean here in the Bay Area alone
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,631	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Plenty of near disasters that
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:39,935	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Lowe's
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,215	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	To becoming a reality
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:43,263	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Stuff so bad
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:45,055	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	He'll make you want to reach out and
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,335	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Hug and NIMBY
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:49,663	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And the culprit in the most terrible plans for the city
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,199	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Was the automobile
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:56,831	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	They were proposed highway system that would carve up San Francisco in unimaginable ways
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,623	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	But here
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:00,159	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	They are certainly not alone
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:04,255	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The invisible never built parallel universe bands Coast to Coast
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,303	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And there are cartographers
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,327	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Are these unbuilt world
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:10,143	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Our producer Sam Greenspan spoke with one of them
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,679	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	A guy who calls himself
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:15,007	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Been smoking Rockin I go under the name of vanshnookenraggen
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,799	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It doesn't mean anything it's pure gibberish
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,359	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	My actual name is Andrew Lynch
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:22,431	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	AKA Andrew Lynch
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:25,759	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	He's a professional realtor and amateur cartographer
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:26,783	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	In New York City
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,063	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Annies maps that he made
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:30,623	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	They first glance look like
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,135	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Google Maps
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,951	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	New York City of the streets and everything
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,999	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	If you ever looked at a Google map
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:38,047	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	You know exactly what this looks like
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:40,607	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Cray for the landmass blue for the water
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:42,911	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Arterial roads there yellow if there side streets
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:45,471	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	White it's just like any other map
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,239	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Except
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,007	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Except that
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,799	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The mattress looking at isn't
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:49,823	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	But really there
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:52,639	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Andrew's map doesn't represent what is
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:55,455	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It represents what almost was
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,735	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	What I've done is
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:58,271	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	To draw
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:00,319	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	What Google Maps would look like
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,087	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	If
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:02,111	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Robert Moses
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:04,415	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Had gotten his way in the
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,439	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Mid-twentieth century
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:07,487	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Okay so first we got to talk about Robert Mueller
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:10,303	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The true power broker of New York
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:16,703	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And we know that Robert Moses was the true power broker of New York because the title of Robert Caro's 1100 pay
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,983	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Age biography of him
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,495	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Is
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:20,031	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The power broker
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:23,615	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	I've read it it's so good it's daunting but
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,383	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Power through it
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:29,759	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It really is worth it in public housing
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:33,087	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	He did a lot of the master planning of New York City and its surroundings
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,391	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Stephen restructure the city government
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:37,439	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	But some of what he's most famous
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,487	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	I really Infamous for
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,767	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Is what didn't get built
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:45,119	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	You see Robert Moses was a Man Who Loved highways
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:49,215	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	He wanted to build two highways through Manhattan 1 to downtown
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,983	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Through
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,519	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Soho and Tribeca
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,567	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	+ 1 through Midtown
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,359	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Just south of 34th Street
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:58,431	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And that's what Andrew Lynch has drawn into the Google Map
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,735	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	What does highways would look like
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:01,503	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Today
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,783	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Now if you're thinking
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:07,135	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	This is totally insane massive gnarled
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:09,183	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Perpetual traffic jam through Manhattan
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:12,255	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	You have to understand what was going on at the time
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,559	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Manhattan wasn't made for cars
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,119	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And a lot of people really wanted them
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,911	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	So just like cities today
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:23,775	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	They were trying to solve the problem of a city that didn't function in the modern era
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,311	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And also
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,079	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Here's a fun fact
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:28,639	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Robert Moses didn't drive
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,175	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Can drivers
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:32,991	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Cardizem around an indoor
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:35,039	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The horrible New York traffic for him
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,855	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Sit in the backseat
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:40,159	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	In gaze out the window at the scenery
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:42,463	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	But the rest will be in to have to drive ourselves
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:47,583	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	These highways probably would have inspired no small amount of terrible anxiety
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,887	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	This was a spaghetti network of
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,191	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Wrapping themselves
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:52,703	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Around building
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:54,495	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Real talk
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:59,103	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Probably would have been too much worse than any other giant Highway interchange
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,383	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Anywhere else
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:02,175	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	I'm like everywhere else
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,223	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	These highways wouldn't have worked
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:08,063	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	We know now that traffic always expands to fill whatever the capacity
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:11,135	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	I mean maybe you could drive from Manhattan to Jersey like
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,671	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	5 minutes faster than you could today
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:16,767	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	But the real tragedy here wouldn't have been the failure of the highways Misha
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:18,815	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It's a total catastrophe
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,607	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It would have been left underneath
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:25,471	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The Manhattan expressways would only feel like a slight nuisance if you are in a car
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:26,495	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Put on the ground
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,543	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Lower Manhattan in particular
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:31,103	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Would be almost unrecognizable
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:35,199	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It just so happened that when I was talking with Andrew we were in lower Manhattan
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:35,711	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Right on barracks
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:39,039	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And as he was telling me about all this unbuilt
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:39,807	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Stop
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:43,903	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	I realize that a lot of these things were mere blocks from where we happen to be
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:46,207	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	I asked Andrew if he can give me a tour
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,743	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	What's not there
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:49,791	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Going off
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:54,143	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Right in front of us
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,423	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Would have been
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:56,191	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	If we go down a couple blocks
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:57,983	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	We could like stand right under it
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,311	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	You can hear the street traffic
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,639	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It would have been ten times worse than this
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,711	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It would have been dark
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,503	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It would have been like we were approaching

EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:19,743	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Lots of car noises
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:26,143	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	But wish you always get next to a highway there would be these ramps going along the side streets rapping
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:31,775	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Brown building to get from 3/4 stores in the air you have to have ramps coming down
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:32,799	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The highway itself
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:38,943	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Running down to West over there good luck finding anyone deliver Winston everywhere

EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,743	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Experience trying to
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,023	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Take a tour of
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:54,559	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It's
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:57,375	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	You have to have a very active imagination
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,911	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Which I do
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,959	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	But if you want to try it
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:05,055	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Stand under it and then come here and then try to remember what that feels
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:07,103	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Back in the real world
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:08,895	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Things are quite nice around lower Manhattan
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,431	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Where were standing out
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:11,711	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It's open
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,735	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Was trees over there
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:16,575	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Is big buildings right here none of this was
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,879	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It's a little bit of a Plaza
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:21,951	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Got shops
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:24,255	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	We're looking over there if there's
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,279	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Townhouses
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,303	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Tenements
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,839	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Probably are asking way too much
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:28,607	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	What's for rents because
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,119	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Cuz where we are
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:30,655	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Nothing
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,959	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	None of this none of this would be
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:37,311	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Which brings us back to Andrews map of Robert Moses unbuilt Manhattan
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:40,127	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	I think what's most striking about these documents
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,407	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Is out on striking they are
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:44,479	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	With your Google standard Greys and blues and yellows
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:47,295	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Andrew create a map to show how terrible these days
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,855	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	But in creating a map
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:51,647	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	He was actually able to see the project
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,415	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	From the Planters point
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:54,463	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	As I went through
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,255	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Cutting across Manhattan
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,815	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Before I drew in the highway I just looked at
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,863	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The swap that I had
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:01,375	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Erased
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:02,911	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It was an interesting
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,679	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Feeling
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,703	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	I could put myself in Robert MO
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:05,983	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Shoes wear
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,775	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	I'm not looking at a city with him

EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:10,591	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And because I don't think
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,127	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Don't see the homes
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:13,919	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The buildings
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:16,479	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It's very tempting just be like okay
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:16,991	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	You just put it right there
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,527	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	You know not realizing
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:19,807	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	There's a disc
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,319	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Building out
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:22,623	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	I know what that building me
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,159	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The place of peace
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:25,951	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	People live that people go that I've been to
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:26,719	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And now it's
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,487	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It's off the map.
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:29,279	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It's funny to hear you describe your own
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,351	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	I wanted
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,375	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	To put this
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:34,655	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	For the everyday for
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,935	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	To look at this
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:36,703	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Inside wow
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:37,215	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	That would have been
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,519	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	I would have loved to be able to make
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:41,055	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Review
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,847	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	I like put yourself right there so you could
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,383	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Does Maps stand
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:44,895	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And under the highway
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,175	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	See what it was
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:46,687	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Was like
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,223	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It does have the
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,503	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Great Dark Mass above you
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:52,319	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The story of how all this didn't come to be
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:52,831	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Is a long
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:56,415	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It often centers around the activist named Jane Jacobs
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:59,231	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Who led a campaign to keep one of Moses highways
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:01,279	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	From destroying her beloved neighborhood
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:01,791	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Greenwich Village
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:06,399	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And there are other factors like the massive cost of those highways that were proposed
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:08,703	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Fat captain from happening as well
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,263	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	But the interesting part.
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:14,079	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Is how that threat the Lower Manhattan Expressway
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:17,151	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Crystalline the story of Jacob's neighborhood
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:18,943	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It's almost as if
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:19,711	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The threat
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:20,735	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	From Moses
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:25,087	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Made Greenwich Village into the place that now seems destined to become
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:27,391	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And that brings us back
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:29,439	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	To the San Francisco Bay Area
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:32,511	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Is John King and Alison area
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:34,303	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The unbuilt can in fact
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,607	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Start what does Happ
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:39,423	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	So if you drive north
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:40,447	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	On the Golden Gate Bridge
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:42,495	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Immediately to your
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:45,311	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Left as you start to reach the end of the bridge you see
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:48,895	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Tremendously beautiful Hills overlooking
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,175	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The ocean
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,967	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	I'm in the base the other side
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:55,039	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And there's nothing built on those Hills it's
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:17:00,415	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It's all natural Landscaping those people biking and walking and it's really help it go all the way out to the headlines
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:06,815	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And when you see it for the first time it's kind of hard to believe that this much open beautiful landscape exist right next to one
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:09,375	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	One of the most expensive cities in the world
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:12,191	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And just kind of remarkable because obviously it would be
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:15,263	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Some of the most Prime real estate in the area and facts
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,311	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	In the sexiest
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:21,919	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Someone attempted to do there and in the early sixties a developer thought
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:24,223	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	What a great place to build
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:28,063	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	20000 homes or so for people who are going to work in San Francisco
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,599	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It was called
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:36,767	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	This was not seen as a rapacious idea at the time this was seen it how business is done
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:40,095	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It was a massive mix of houses and hours
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:41,375	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:46,751	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It was approved with very little controversy by The Marin County Board of Supervisors
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:52,639	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Limoncello being approved with enough to alarm people and start people reacting to it
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:59,551	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And it led to lawsuits it led to opposition it led to local city starting to fight it
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:06,719	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	When the dust settled the project did not get built currently the only thing that was built was the gate that was going to lead to the marketing
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:08,255	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Center at the very start of the property
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:14,911	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	So the Golden Gate National Recreation Area was formed out of concern for all the various plans that were being proposed
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,959	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Francello is blocked
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:18,751	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:22,847	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Sutro Baths Lands End in San Francisco had a proposed kind of
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,639	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Cancun type resorts
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:31,039	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	And if you are at all familiar with Lands End in San Francisco where the Sutro bath ruins are you no help
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,319	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Silly that notion sounds
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:36,159	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It is only Cancun as interpreted
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,183	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	By the North Pole
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:40,511	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	It is said there were various projects like that
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,095	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	What was proposed
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,911	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Never got built
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:47,935	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	But it said
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:51,263	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	The events in motion that in fact
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,543	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Tramadol landscape we have
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:02,527	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	What projects like that did in the early sixties
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:05,087	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Is that they were a signal
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:11,999	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	Two people who cared about the topography the bay area in the proximity of open space to urbanized space
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:12,511	| 99pi_0094_unbuilt_1 |	How to say
