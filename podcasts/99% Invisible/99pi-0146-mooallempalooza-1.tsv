EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:57,951	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	There was a Ragtime tune called possum the latest craze
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:05,375	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Does tap travel around the South some people actually start giving him live opossums in cages when he would make public appearances or
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:07,167	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Handing them over like they were floral the kids
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:14,335	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Soon baby possums were in toy stores from New York to San Francisco because real opossums weren't actually that, Nancy
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,871	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Cities that and no one really knew what they were
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,919	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	A toy store in Brooklyn
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:24,319	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Brandon in-store promotion with a live captive opossum that they could show off the kids so the kids could familiarize in

EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:31,487	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	I found an advertisement for the story that read do not let it be said
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:34,303	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	But any man woman or child in Brooklyn
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:36,351	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Has not seen the cute little animal
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:39,679	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Whose name is mentioned more in all parts of the world today
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,447	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	In any other
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:47,103	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	President on the newspapers
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:53,247	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Hauser morning the passing of the dolls and and how sad it was at these teddy bears were coming into nurseries in vanquishing
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,039	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	And now the ra poems
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:58,367	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	In newspapers about Billy possums displacing teddy bears
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:01,439	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	But since you probably never heard of a billy possum
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,999	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	You can guess what comes next
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:09,631	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Next it was a total flop and the Billy possum was forgotten and almost entirely out of stores within a couple of months
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:13,471	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	What's another word for Billy possum never even made it to see Christmas time
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:16,287	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Which is a special kind of tragedy for toy
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:21,663	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	There are several possible explanations as to why the Billy possum never took off
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,431	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	The first
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:24,479	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Probably thinking right now is this
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:28,575	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Opossums are ugly and nobody likes them
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:31,903	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	It was also the dawn of the mechanical toy
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:36,255	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	And even some teddy bears that evolved into wind up animatronics
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,791	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	There is a French maid teddy bear
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:43,167	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	That quote wines up and is calculated to indulge in a number of ludicrous somersault
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,703	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	How could a limp
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:46,751	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Stuffed Billy possum compete with that
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:49,055	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Pajama Willam argues that
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:53,663	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	At its heart the acceptance of teddy bear and the rejection of Billy possum
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,967	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Comes down to their origin story
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:59,039	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	In the story that was told about Roosevelt and his bear
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:01,343	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	It was a very kind of tender moment where
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:04,159	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Rosella showing the bear Mercy
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:07,487	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	And when you look at that cartoon the way the bear was drawn
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:13,375	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	It looked like something that you would want to just sweep up into your arms and take care of and that was vulnerable and that needed your help
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,679	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	It looked like a teddy bear as we know it
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:19,519	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Although no one knew it at the time the story with Taft it didn't give it anything else
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,287	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	You're tough
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,823	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	State is Boston for supper
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:24,127	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	I need a lot of it and he ate so much
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:30,527	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	The Doctor's first several helping is a doctor seated nearby apparently passed him a note suggesting that it might be a good idea if you slowed
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,295	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Down a little
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:37,695	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Taft even bragged reporters the next day about how much possum he consumed fly like a possum and I ate very hard on the other
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,463	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	But it last night
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:40,767	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	And it did not disturb in the slightest
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,559	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	My digestion or my sleep
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:44,351	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	The possum was vulnerable I guess
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,655	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Splayed out on a bed of taters but
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:52,543	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	You're not exactly routing for it I started feeling really bad for tattoo and the more I read a little bit about him
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,335	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	He was this totally colorless
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,359	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Politician
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:58,687	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	And you didn't actually been want to be president by some accounts
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:00,735	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	How you assert strong-armed into it
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:07,135	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Original any never really measured up to Roosevelt's Charisma and charm I mean Roosevelt was the kind of guy who
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:10,207	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	No matter what he did history seemed eager to glorifying for it
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:16,863	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Case in point the messed up thing about the famous story of Teddy the bear on that hunting trip in Mississippi
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,655	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Is it isn't even the whole truth
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:20,703	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	You have to remember that Roosevelt was
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:26,335	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	A hunter he was there to hunt bears he wasn't a Peta activist or something like this
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:29,919	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Well he did show the bear Mercy it was very particular
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,199	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Kind of Mercy
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:33,503	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	After he refused to shoot it
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:35,551	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	He said put it out of its misery
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:40,415	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	And then one of his Hunting Buddies came in and slip the bear's neck open with a knife
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:44,511	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	They Carried the Bears body back to Camp over the back of a horse
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:47,327	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	And they basically ate off it for the next several days
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,375	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	And the last name of their trip
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:51,679	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	They finish it off they roasted its paws
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:55,263	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	And I kid you not date the paws with a side of possum and taters
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,175	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	So that's why you will never cuddle up
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,199	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	With a billy possum
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:06,271	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Just like you will never watch a betamax tape
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:09,343	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Or travel to go betron with weeder one
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,135	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	And you will never again
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,183	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Tonka Hydrox cookie
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,791	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Mandamus Hydrox cookies
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,095	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	They're really tasty
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:27,775	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	We have one cardinal rule on 99percentinvisible
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:29,567	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	No Cardinals
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:31,871	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Meaning we don't deal with the natural world
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:32,639	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Only the built world
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:39,295	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	So when I read John wellons brilliant book called Wild Ones a sometimes this main weirdly reassuring story
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:43,135	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	About looking at people looking at animals in America
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:47,487	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	I didn't think I'd ever do an episode of 99% invisible about it I just read it for fun
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:53,375	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	But then I saw John perform stories from the book live with musical accompaniment and I thought
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:56,703	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	I need to put this on the radio
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,495	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Gaston College radio
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:03,359	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Anyway what you need to know about Wild Ones is that it isn't a book about nature
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:07,199	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	It's a book about how we fit nature into our modern lives
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:10,015	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Wild Ones is about the QT stuffed animals
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:11,807	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Eco tours
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:15,135	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	In the Byzantine methods of conservation that involved
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:18,719	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	When our experience with Wildlife goes from something natural
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,743	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Do something
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:20,255	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Design
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:24,351	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Human-animal interaction has become a designed experience
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:26,655	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	In the story of that transition
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,935	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	As the title of the book suggests
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,983	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Is sometimes dismay
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,519	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	And also
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,055	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Weirdly reassuring
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:38,687	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	John William is friends with the band black prairie and as he was writing the book
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:42,271	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	They can talk to this idea of the band creating a soundtrack to the book
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:46,111	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	And the result was an extended EP called Wild Ones
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:48,927	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	The musical score for the things you might see in your head
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:51,487	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	When you reflect on certain characters and incidents
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:52,511	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	That you read in the book
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:59,167	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	The writer and the band then went on a short tour with the song and story Extravaganza that I'm going to play for you today
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:02,239	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	When I saw them perform this live in San Francisco
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:07,103	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	I'm freaked out it was so good and I costed them in the dressing room and said
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:09,663	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	You have to let me share this with my audience
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,199	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	So here it is
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,479	| 99pi-0146-mooallempalooza-1 |	Eureka
