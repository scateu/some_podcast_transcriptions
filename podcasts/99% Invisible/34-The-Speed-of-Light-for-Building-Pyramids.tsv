EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:11,328	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	And when he saw the Great Pyramid in Egypt for the first time he reacted pretty much the way I imagine most people react
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:15,168	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	When you actually come and see something that somewhere in the region of 40 stories high

EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:31,296	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Festival how did they do that
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:32,832	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Then I start thinking
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:34,112	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	How would I do
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:38,720	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	In a recent article in design intelligence he took those questions

EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:45,120	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	As if a client gave him a brief to build something like the Great Pyramid today we got these incredible challenges
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,936	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Why you doing something that's never been done before

EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:09,440	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	As a present a engineer
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:11,232	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	So some of the things they knew
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:12,512	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Why
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:14,304	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	If they built on the Giza plateau
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:16,608	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	They could put stones that
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,632	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	To a certain pressure
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,168	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	On the ground

EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:25,824	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	You can look at other pyramids and see the previous mistakes that were made out to no
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,616	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	What the ground capacity was
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:30,176	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	I'm think about determine the size
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:30,944	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Inside the Great Pyramid
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:33,760	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Because if you're going to build the tallest building in the world
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:35,552	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	How tall do you want it to be
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:42,976	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Or just a bit taller than the last till this building got to make a decision decision was made for them by
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:45,536	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	The quality of the ground that they were building up
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,560	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	So that was number one
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,840	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Secondly they had
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:49,376	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	The Builder in the Pharaohs life
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,424	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	I'm pretty sure that somebody

EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:58,592	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	You know with the best will in the world we can only lay this number stands a day
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:00,128	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Am I can only Assemble
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:06,016	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	This many men and assembling men to be the right wording here because and I totally miss this
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,296	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Historical revision
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,088	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	But the consensus now is that
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:13,696	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	It was a rather privileged well treated class of Egyptians that built the pyramids
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:14,464	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Not
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:14,976	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Slaves
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,024	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	That blew my mind
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,583	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Cecil B Demille is going to be pissed
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:22,399	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Twenty thousand men can only lay this many times a day

EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,495	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	35 years so
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:29,567	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	You know that many men sounds that many stones * 35 years
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,615	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Means it's going to be this hot
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:36,223	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	So the ground Can Only Hold so much mass without buckling the workers can only build
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:38,527	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	So much an affair with Lifetime and finally
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:43,135	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	The material had to be delivered to the side in time to build the thing
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,159	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	And I would think

EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:56,863	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	What has happened is that they were used to building walls
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,423	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	But when the world turns a corner
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:01,727	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	That point becomes very stiff
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:05,055	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	And because the temperatures vary hugely between day and night
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:07,359	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	These materials least walls
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,383	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Binding contract
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,407	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	When it contracts
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,711	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Masonry will always break
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,247	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Next to the stick
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,807	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	So every time there was a corner
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,831	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Found a huge bus
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,599	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Bicycle crack
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:19,391	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	So they clearly didn't understand
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:20,927	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	The thermal performance
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,207	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Of mud brick
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:27,839	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	And that problem is exacerbated by the fact that they laid these mud bricks on a mortar bed
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:31,167	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	So they actually have two materials for building so they do
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:31,935	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Mud-brick
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,215	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	And Malta
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:36,287	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	And by putting these different materials together
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:38,847	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	They thermally move at different amounts
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,383	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	I made crack
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:42,175	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	So somebody must have said
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:45,247	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Well if we only use one material lay the bricks dry
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,783	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Would they have performed better
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:48,831	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	And the answer is yes
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,111	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	And the pyramids
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,391	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Are exactly that
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:54,207	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	There is only one material is used
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,487	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	That means
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,511	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	The pyramid st. Louis
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,303	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	I got very hot in the day and very cold at night
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:01,887	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	But the material throughout the pyramid is consistent
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,423	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	I'm so it didn't crack
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,983	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Because they move together they effectively breathe
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,775	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	And because they breathe
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,055	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	To account for the
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,591	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Changes in temperature
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:13,663	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Able to last a long time without cracking and breaking up
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:16,735	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	This prompted Burroughs to think about modern building
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:22,111	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Where we put so many materials together all the time steel and glass and aluminium
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,647	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Concrete
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:25,183	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Cementitious materials and pasta
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:28,767	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	And I saw you walking round modern buildings in
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,815	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Looking at where all the cracks where
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,863	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	I know every crack is Italy joints
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,911	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Between different materials
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:37,471	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	I'm starting to think maybe we could
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:40,799	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Think about this a little bit more time if we did
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,871	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	We can actually make buildings last longer
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:44,895	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Just buy
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:46,687	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Thinking hard about those joints
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:49,503	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Which presently we solve by putting
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:53,599	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	You know Dewey material in the joint to try and take up that feel movement
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:54,879	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	But if we just
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:55,647	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Detailing back
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:56,671	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	In the first
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:57,951	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	They would last
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,743	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Nothing
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:02,047	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Galanga buildings lost the most sustainable AR
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:03,327	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	So long as I live
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,375	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Materials we use in the long run
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:12,543	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Longevity is probably the most basic route to sustainability in the pyramids are the poster children for longevity
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,479	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	In addition to chemistry
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,783	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Adhering to basic principles of physics
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:25,855	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Keeps your building around for Millennia with little or no maintenance
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:29,183	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	A pyramid is a nice stable shape
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:32,767	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	And I think they would have loved not but it isn't as simple as the way I was thinking about
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,815	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	If I had a bucket of sound
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,583	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Can I put it on the floor
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,631	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Then it actually nuts
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,655	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	What makes a pyramid shape
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,447	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	So intuitively
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:43,519	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	They never the thoughts is a stable thing to do
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:46,591	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	But actually one of the interesting things is
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:48,639	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	That the gradient of the science of
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:52,223	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Is not determined like sand by snot
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:53,503	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Natural angle of repose
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,807	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	You can actually make it whatever you want to make it
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:58,367	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	But you can see from the prior permit
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,135	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	It's from a step pyramid
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:02,719	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	On the bent pyramid the pyramids that preceded the Great Pyramid
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:05,791	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	But they were sort of going a little bit steeper
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:07,583	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	But they never never really got above
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,095	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	50 degrees
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:11,167	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	I'm cuz I think somebody felt that this is sort of
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,727	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	A maximum angle about which
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:14,495	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	You should never exceed
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:18,335	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	So get an empirically derived knowledge sets the agenda
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,615	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	If you put these things together
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:21,407	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	How much Stone you can get
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,967	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	The bearing pressure that you can put on the ground
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,247	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	I'm the angle
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,295	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	United determines the height of
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:30,623	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	The building and I'm pretty sure the simple mathematics in the world between the ark

EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:34,207	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	Gave a practical limit
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,487	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	So what could be built
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:43,167	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	This exercise in using engineering principles to augment the archaeological data may give us some insight into why the Great.
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:45,983	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	That is both the oldest and the largest Pyramid of Giza
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:49,055	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	These people probably thought it was the limit of everything
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:55,711	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	It's the biggest bearing capacity it's a steep as they can go and it says many stones as can be laid in a lifetime
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,759	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	You can't do any bigger than that
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,807	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	What's the speed of light
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,087	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	If you like for building permits
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:07,743	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	I know it's no Revelation that the pyramids are well-designed
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,023	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	I'm not an idiot
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:14,655	| 34-The-Speed-of-Light-for-Building-Pyramids |	But learning about these practical considerations from Steve Burrows just made me appreciate their Majesty in a new way
