EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,927	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	When the form is stationary
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:28,767	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Like a cube for instance looks like a cylinder when you spin it around 5
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:33,631	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	If you want the children to start to see that there's some invisible parts

EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:48,479	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	And then the toys would ship from being about perception to being about creation
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,527	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	They would become more versatile
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:52,319	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Pliant and constructive
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:58,719	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Locks gave way to paper string wire little sticks and peas that could be connected in Stockton just
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,487	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Structures
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:01,791	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Objects would get more abstract and creative
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:02,815	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Leading to the finals
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:06,911	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	The last is really just working freely with clay
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:09,215	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Play being the most malleable evolve
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:10,751	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	It's rigid and it's off
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:14,079	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	And there's a whole range of things a child could build with it
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,871	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	But even at this final stage
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:18,687	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	This wasn't the kind of creative free for all week
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,223	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	We tend to associate with childhood play
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,783	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Pro Bowl head children sitting at desk
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:25,343	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Workstations with grids lay down
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:27,647	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	So it's not free play
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:29,439	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	The fact that the table
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,975	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Has an underlying grid
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:33,279	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	He's very much at the
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,815	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Root of
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,351	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	The directive play

EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,935	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	And there's an underlying order
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:43,775	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	And so in this very structured very dramatic way
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,335	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	The gifts encourage students to think abstract

EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:55,807	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	In the child could use those same blocks to build a house
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:58,623	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	And then tell stories of a family living in the house
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:01,951	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	So they were modeling the world different ways
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:03,487	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	All using the same
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,255	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Set of objects
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:08,095	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	The children realize that they can create a new

EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:23,967	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	They were places that taught about shape and form and color
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:27,295	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	And when kindergarten graduates went out into the world

EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:53,119	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	That was one of the reasons that they were not so shocked when our turn in that direction

EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:16,416	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	And the very first playgrounds in Berlin Germany
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:19,744	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	The first playgrounds were actually piles of sand
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:21,280	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Which are called sand Gardens
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:27,424	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Which really popped up in Berlin in the the 1850s and 1860s
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:29,472	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	There wasn't much to them design-wise
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:30,496	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	They're basically just
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:34,848	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Huge piles of sand dumped in public parks for kids to play around
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:35,872	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	And a group of
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:38,176	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Charitable ladies from Boston
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:41,760	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Saw this and Gardens in Berlin and thought Oh
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:44,576	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	You know the children in the settlement houses in Boss
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:48,672	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Austin The Immigrant children don't have anything to do during the summer when school's out
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:51,232	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	So they decided to bring these tan Gardens to New England
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:53,536	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	The thinking in part was that
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:59,680	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Dense urban areas didn't have a lot of places for kids to play especially kids whose parents couldn't afford a big private
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:04,032	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	So saying Gardens would be useful additions to cities
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:07,616	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	So they picked an empty lot and kind of the dentist part of Boston
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,640	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	And they just
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:10,688	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Poured a pile of sand in it
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:13,248	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	And said okay it's the same Garden
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,272	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Come play
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:19,904	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	And then the kids spent the summary no digging in the sand making mountains of the sand playing in the sand
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:24,768	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	And it was hugely successful and garden started popping up all over the country
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:26,816	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Often in public parks
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:31,168	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Sometimes they were staffed with play leaders who would teach organized games and
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:34,240	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Marching exercises in calisthenics and songs
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:36,544	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	But also more traditional organized Sports
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:42,432	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	There is also this push to americanize the Immigrant children and so they teach them how to play baseball
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:45,504	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Which was thought to be a very collaborative and Democratic sport
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:50,624	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	And so the same Garden actually starts to shrink and become a box
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:53,440	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Rather than a gardener box rather than a whole lot
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,464	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	And they have
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,512	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Paved areas in grassy areas
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:59,072	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	So sanh Gardens kicked off The Playground movement
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:02,144	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	Organized around ideas of American culture

EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:07,776	| 349_Froebel_s_Gifts_pt_01 |	And then there's a whole proliferation of amazing
