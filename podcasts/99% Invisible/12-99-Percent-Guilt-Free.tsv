EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:38,624	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	Turns out that

EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:45,024	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	Just electricity was really expensive so the only turn them on when they needed to
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:49,888	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	And they typically would not turn them on on the full Moonlight nights when it was clear at
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,936	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	People just had the understanding that that was enough
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:55,264	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	Light to see by Insidious and it was a waste of energy to the light on top of that
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:57,568	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	And that really change with the National Grid electric
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:04:02,944	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	Vacation in the 1930s when they actually needed a way to burn off excess energy at night when no one was
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:04,736	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	Would using electricity in their humps
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:08,064	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	And the street Light Grid actually be down as a way to do that as much
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:08,832	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	What is a way to
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,904	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	I sent that almost every city
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:12,928	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	To be illuminated
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,464	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	Very brightly
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:16,512	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	Twenty-four hours a day
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:18,303	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	The standards for lighting that are in place
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,863	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	That. So this is an effort to make
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:22,143	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	Beautiful energy efficient
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:22,911	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	Version of a thing
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:27,263	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	Designed and used historically to burn energy on purpose
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:34,175	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	I think we've gotten used to talking about sustainability in terms of a lot of metrics and numbers and less about
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:35,711	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	People's direct experience of it
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,735	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	So we're looking at ways
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:37,503	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	Is to really bring a
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,807	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	Tangible personal experience per level
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:45,439	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	We see ourselves as part of the stronger direction that the whole sustainability mooc
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:47,231	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	We'll go we believe in the coming years
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:50,815	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	So where's my friendly neighborhood Moon responsive street light

EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:14,623	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	I think the lot of the current design discussion is about how to
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:18,207	| 12-99-Percent-Guilt-Free |	Make design more relevant how to make it part of this process
