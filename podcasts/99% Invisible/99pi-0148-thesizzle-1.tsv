EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:13,536	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Companies should think more about sound
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:16,864	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	You're sitting in the Chili's at the dinner hour at 5
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:20,448	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	And let's say it first nobody's ordering the sizzling fajitas
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:21,984	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	But then
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:25,568	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Maybe about 20 minutes 30 minutes into the dinner hour and and I've seen this
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:30,176	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	All of a sudden one person order sizzling fajitas
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:35,040	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	As the server brings out the sizzling Skillet of fajita meat and onions
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:40,672	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	And you hear that sizzling sound literally every I every single person in that restaurant
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,440	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Their head
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,000	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Turns to the server
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:47,840	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Walking past them and they follow that server with their eyes
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:49,376	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	And then they smell
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:52,192	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	The burnt onions in apple and now you're hooked
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:54,752	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	And now everyone orders the sizzling fajitas
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:58,080	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	And in the back instead of making that one order they make 15
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,872	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Yeah they called the fajita effect
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:02,432	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	My family fell victim to the fajita effect
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:04,224	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Too many times to remember
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:07,552	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	We may even have initiated the original fajita effect
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:10,368	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Patient zero of the fajita effect
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:16,768	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Chuy's by the way did not invent that distinction goes to a Texan by the name of Sonny Falcone
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:20,863	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	He was selling a subpar cut of meat called the Faja in figured that
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:26,751	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	If you cooked it out in the open with law spice people didn't care about the quality of meat
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:31,615	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	It got to Chili's because Larry Levine was the founder of Chili's
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:35,967	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Had seen restaurants around the Rio Grande Valley so they do their version of it
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:41,087	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	He had the idea to make sound the star of the show and so when Chili's opened up
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:47,743	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	They put that sound of sizzling fajitas in their first ever commercial fajitas sold like crazy
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:52,351	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	In the wake of their massive success Chili's printed up T-shirts for staff but said
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:55,167	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	I survived the summer of fajita Madness
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:56,703	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Now they
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:01,311	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	They serve enough fajita meat to fill to nuclear submarines a year
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:04,895	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	I really hope someone feel to nuclear submarines of fajita meat to get that measurement
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:14,367	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	It's surprisingly difficult to get people even really creative people
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,391	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	To think about sound
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:19,487	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	To Value it in the same way they value the visual environment
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:21,535	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	But sometimes there's one person who gets it
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:25,887	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	An Apple computer is one of those people with a guy by the name of Jim reekes

EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:42,271	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	But whatever his title was
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:45,599	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Jim was working on sound for the Macintosh computers
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:48,159	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Which was neglected stepchild of
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:54,047	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	All things Mac no one really cared about the sound until the end which is unfortunately typical
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:55,071	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Exception
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:06:00,447	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	He's a composer and a musician and he understood the importance of sound more than most of his colleagues
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:02,239	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	And Jim have
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:06,335	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Strong feelings about the startup sound that was on the Mac at the time
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:09,663	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	I just hated it I could not stand it
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,943	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Here's what it sounded like
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:14,271	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Here is a couple more times cuz it goes by really fast
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,599	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	So when Apple
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:20,415	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	First start it up it was
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,183	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Makino
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,975	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	The computer is far from perfect
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:24,255	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	They crashed a lot
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:28,863	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	And every time you turned it back on you heard that jolting sound
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:31,167	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	So Jim set out to make a better one
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,959	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Mac just crashed
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:34,239	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Again

EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:52,927	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Just a bunch of pissed-off frustrated people are super annoyed and you're wasting their time that's a hard audience place
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:55,999	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	I got to change everyone's mood
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:57,791	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	So I was thinking
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,815	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Zen like
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,351	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Meditative
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,143	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Sound
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:07,775	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Similar to a gong or chanting ohm
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:14,431	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Of course we're all familiar with the sound he came up with
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,711	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Oh that's nice
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:17,247	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	So much better right
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:22,623	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Only problem was Jim ask for permission to put this new sound into the Prototype
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:24,159	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	For the new Mac and
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:24,927	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	I was
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:31,071	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Tell him I couldn't do it we already have a sound you're not allowed to change it was just on and on and on
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:34,911	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	But Jim knew the people who were responsible for building the Prototype
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,959	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	I played it for them and then
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:39,263	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	They liked it and so
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:40,799	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	When no one was around
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:46,687	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	We put her into the build and the Quadra 700 shipped with the sound in it
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:50,271	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	That was back in 1991 when the Quadra 700 Mac cost
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,807	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	$1,000
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:55,135	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Jim says he never got any props for the sound
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:55,647	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Just grief
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:58,719	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	And yet that sound with a few minor tweaks
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:01,279	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Husband the Apple startup sound ever since
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,839	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	So I think we can assume that Steve Jobs liked it
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,631	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	It's his big giant

EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:21,503	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Sound with the Apple brand
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:24,063	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	And brand is just the experience
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:25,599	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Or

EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:30,975	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	So

EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:37,887	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Lbnl like imagine a really beautiful car
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:42,239	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	That just had this horrible engine always backfire
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:49,919	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Actually there are people who make sure that beautiful cars sound beautiful
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:52,479	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Or at least they sound right
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,551	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	One of them is Sean Carney
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,087	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Hi my name's Sean Carney
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:09:00,159	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Mustang powertrain sound quality engineer
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,719	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	John works on Mustangs
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:05,791	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	And there are all kinds of things he and his team can tweak
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:11,935	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	To get the sound they're looking for
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:17,567	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Inner tubes have different shapes and different perforation synonyms of the whole pattern Venom
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:23,711	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Kind of like you can control the sound of a horn by placing your fingers over different holes
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:26,783	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Chongqing control the sound of the Mustang
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:30,623	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	And it's an easier job for the standard V8
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:33,951	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	But then sometimes they'll put out a specialty Mustang
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:40,863	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	In 2008 Mustang decided to put out a remake of a Mustang that appeared in the movie Bullet in 1968
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:47,519	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	In the movie is a pretty famous Chase sequence where Steve McQueen drives his Mustang all over the Streets of San Francisco
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:58,271	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Show me the team wanted to make the 2008 Bullitt sound similar to the 1968 Bullitt
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:04,671	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Dora come see a car like a bullet it's about in his car the whole movie
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:08,767	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Strong you back into those old memories
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:12,351	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	If I was like that for 4
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,375	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Yamoto band
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:17,215	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	They're trying essentially to make a new car sound old
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:22,591	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Which is challenging because cars made in 1968 or built completely differently
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:27,199	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Battle of the carburetor and we use a fuel injection for Thurman
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:29,759	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Play all the things
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,527	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Completely change
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,831	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	How the engine confirmed
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:39,231	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Sean was never going to be able to duplicate the sound of the Bullitt car from the movie exactly
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:43,583	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Sing in the movie was enhanced with sounds recorded from a race car and apart from that
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:46,911	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	It's actually illegal in most places to drive around in a car that loud
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:49,727	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	A big part of what we try to do is
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,287	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Which better identify
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:56,127	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	What are those key characteristics of being played
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:58,687	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	By that classic American
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,455	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	V8
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:04,831	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	I found the tent in the movie came out people talk
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:05,599	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	About the sound
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:08,927	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	And most people thought Sean and his team have gotten it right
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:11,231	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Here's the 2008
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,023	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Bullitt Mustang in action
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,031	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Sound is
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:24,543	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Actually
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,847	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	In front of all of our senses
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,639	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	It's the one we react to quickest
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,663	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Even quicker than touch
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,967	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	That's Joel Beckerman again
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:34,015	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Brands that are not paying attention to this
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:37,343	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Not paying attention to sound in association with experiences
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,135	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	They're really going to get punished
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,671	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Case in point
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:46,047	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	In 2010 Frito-Lay decided to come out with a new biodegradable SunChips bag
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:50,143	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Only problem was they never considered what that packaging sound
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:53,215	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Here's a YouTube video someone made about the bag
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,007	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Delicious
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,031	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Sentence level
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:12:02,943	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Things that I cannot get over is the noise that this bag make I don't know what it's made
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:09,343	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	If you ever want to
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:12,415	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Do you want to get one chip out of this bag
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:13,951	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Good luck
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:18,303	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Mega on YouTube was not the only person to notice how noisy the bag was
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,351	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Someone created a Facebook page
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:23,935	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Called sorry I can't hear you over this SunChips bag
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,727	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	And I got 40000 likes
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,519	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	And it became a national news story
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:31,103	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Bad to pull the new back and go back to the old bag
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:33,407	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Good intentions bad execution
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:36,479	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	John Tyler refer to this kind of sound as a Sonic

EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:59,263	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Joel and Tyler imagine a world where all the sounds we hear have more thought behind them
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,543	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	More intention
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:05,151	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	It would be very rare that you would actually hear the sound that something made
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:08,223	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	That thing would trigger a better sound
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:13,343	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	In Tyler's World they can make the SunChips bag sound like this when it's opened
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:16,159	| 99pi-0148-thesizzle-1 |	Every time you get a chip you're like
