EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,336	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	It was only up for 30 years

EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,200	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	It broke families into
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:01,504	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Now let's remember how we got here
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:05,344	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	In 1945 Berlin was the Fallen Nazi capital
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:08,672	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	The weary Victor's could agree on two things
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:09,440	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	1
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,464	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Hitler was bad
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:11,744	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	2
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,280	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Germany needed a big change
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:16,096	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	After that they did not agree on very much
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:18,656	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Berlin with carved up into two sectors
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:21,216	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	With Western countries controlling the west of the city
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:23,008	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	And the Soviet Union controlling the east
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:27,616	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	West Berlin had a booming post-war economy life was tougher
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,384	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Annie's Berlin
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:32,992	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	So in the decade that followed more than two million people fled from east to west
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:36,064	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	East Germany was losing its most skilled workers
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:36,832	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Jobs
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,648	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	And reunite with their families across the border
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,720	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	And East Germany with losing face
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:44,768	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Whatever you East Berliner who chose to defect
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:47,072	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	And that's why in 1961
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:50,656	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	East Germany close its border to West Berlin
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:51,424	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	With a wall
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:55,264	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	But this isn't a story about the design of the Berlin Wall
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:58,080	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	This is a story about one design
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:58,848	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	To get through it
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:03:59,872	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Or relay
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:00,896	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Underneath

EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:06,528	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	The tunnel had a diameter of less than one square me
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,832	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	We have to
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,600	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Save
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:12,160	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Space the less we excavate
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:15,744	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	You couldn't sense
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:18,047	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	You were laying on your back
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:18,815	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Girl

EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:23,167	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Weather feeds we were driving the Spade into the front
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:26,239	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	You couldn't dig for more than 2 hours
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:36,991	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	In 1964 Roth West 21
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,039	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	At the Free University of Berlin

EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:50,303	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	But you haven't really ever built anything and like virtually everyone in West Berlin Roth new and wizard

EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,983	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	How could they get to the West
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:01,055	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	You couldn't have trouble with a woman
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,847	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Couldn't fly over it
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,151	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	It was the only way
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,431	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Ticketon
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:12,575	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	In 1964 westerners could still visit the East if they were in good standing with the East German government
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:16,159	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	That year Ralph took a trip with his parents and sister
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:16,927	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	From the West
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,695	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	To the east
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:19,231	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	To visit extended family
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:20,511	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	My cousin
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:23,071	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Approach my sister and me and said can you do something
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,351	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	For me I must get out of here
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:32,543	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Rumors have been going around of tunnels popping up beneath the city
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,079	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	So when I get back to
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:34,847	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Timberland
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:38,431	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	I had an idea
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,479	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Who was involved here
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:44,063	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	And I approached him
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:47,391	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	People living together in the student Salvatore
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:51,487	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	I approached him I asked him and
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:54,047	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	40 Slater was in the tunnel
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:06:01,215	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Better be clear the kids were tumbling from west to east they were tunneling into communist eastborough
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:04,287	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Ralph of defunct Bakery along the border
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:07,615	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	It it closed because too many of its customers were stuck in the east
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:13,247	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Near the baker's entrance you could actually see East German guard towers looming over the wall
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:17,343	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	And in that Bakery young berliners were tearing into the ground
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:19,903	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Trying to dig a tunnel under the wall
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:21,183	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	East Berlin
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,207	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	We were digging
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:23,999	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Vertically down
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:26,815	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Until we got to the ground with tape
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:29,887	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	If you don't want your tunnel to flood it stay above the water table
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:35,263	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	And from there we said okay half meter above the ground holder table we dig for it
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,287	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Straightforward horizontal
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:37,823	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Very simple
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:42,431	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Very simple in theory and practice Berlin is a nightmare underneath the surface
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,223	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	The city is a swamp
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:51,135	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	The ground is so wet and Sandy that to this day construction workers have to pump water out of Berlin soil
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,671	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	In order to build new Subway tunnel

EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,559	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	In trouble spots
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:01,375	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	But the soil over by the bakery
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,655	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Happened to be perfect
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:03,167	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	For tunneling
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:04,959	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Because he was
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:09,311	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	BD geologic soil is
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:11,359	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Consisting mainly of
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,895	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Play
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:15,199	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	That means if you dig there a hole in it
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,735	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	It is self-supporting
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,527	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Rats and collapses
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,575	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	And this is one of
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,367	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Very very few
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:22,879	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Areas
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,183	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	In and around Berlin
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:30,047	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	That you have such as sulfur make that made it for us so
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,839	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Interesting of course.
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:37,471	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	So from an engineering perspective this Bakery seemed like the perfect place to dig a tunnel
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:40,543	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	But strategically it seem like a terrible choice
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:43,359	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	This was the spot where right after the wall was built
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:47,711	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Some Germans in the East try to jump out of their apartment windows
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,223	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Into the West
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:52,319	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Which Middle Eastern government extra careful about security
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,623	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	During the lifespan of the wall
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:56,671	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	5 people died
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:57,695	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	On this stretch of border
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:03,327	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Talking about a bunch of twenty-somethings digging a tunnel the length of 1 1/2 football fields
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,607	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	With a garden Spade
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:08,191	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	And a wheelbarrow under one of the most fortified borders on Earth
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:11,263	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Ruffles actually joining the second tunnel that this group of Doug
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:13,567	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	The first tunnel in stretched nearly 500

EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:18,943	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	The day they reach the backyard of an apartment building in the east
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:19,711	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	It was snowing
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:23,551	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Because the air inside the tunnel was warmer than outside
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,599	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	They left a small circle of melted
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,367	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Snow
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:29,183	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Which basically told the Stars ain't you there's a
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,207	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Tunnel over here
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:32,767	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Within a few hours the study found out
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,559	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Flooded the tunnel with water
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:38,143	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	But Ralph, says that being 20 years old and free Berlin
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,679	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	They were all naive enough
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,447	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	To try again
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:44,031	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	One of the student leaders Wolfgang Fuchs
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,823	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Proposed a bit of reverse psychology
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,847	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Wolfgang
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,895	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Who was really smart guy
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:50,943	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Take a note
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,223	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	The Stasi
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:53,247	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Buffoon
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:58,879	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	He would not even dream about that we use the same location
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,159	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	For another Channel
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,719	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	So idiotic nobody could be
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:04,767	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	I need break
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:09,119	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	And also tunnel rail started working on in the summer of 1964
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:12,703	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	The bakery where the tunnel started was in the basement of an apartment building
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,471	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	For the retirees
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:17,311	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	A group of 20 or so students going in and out all the time
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,847	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Would have been suspicious
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,127	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	So they had to be stealthy
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:22,175	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	They can only come in and out every couple weeks
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,455	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	In other words
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:29,343	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	They had to live there the bakery had become a makeshift home they slept in military cots
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:33,695	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	And warmed up canned food on a little electric stove that ran on borrowed electricity
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:37,791	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Of course we need more power
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,351	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Then that retired couple
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,399	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Is using normally
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:45,215	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	The most stupid man of power company would say
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:50,847	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	My goodness normally that pay you back I know about $20 a month and now
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,895	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	They consume for 200
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,967	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	So wonderful
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:56,735	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Our
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:58,271	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Friends managed
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:00,831	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	To get to the power supply cable
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:04,415	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Before it went into the distribution board
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:09,279	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	For the power was metered and registered to the various apart
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,839	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	The windows were painted white on the inside
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:13,119	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	To minimize suspicion
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,655	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	But maximize lighting
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,935	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	In the bakery storage room
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:18,239	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Flour and salt and sugar
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:21,311	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	I've been replaced with heaps and heaps of dirt
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,103	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	And when they need fresh supplies
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:25,407	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Bike tools baked beans
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,431	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Spare parts

EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:29,503	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	That was where Ralph came in
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:32,575	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	I had a job as a student on the weekend
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,623	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	To deliver

EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,911	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	And that was of course

EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,791	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Intuitive
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:16,863	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	It's already almost 50 cubic meters yeah and then
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,655	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	20:45
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,447	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	I never thought about it

EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:37,599	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Through the summer and into the autumn
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:41,439	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Rubbing his friends scraped and carved and heaved enough dirt
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:44,255	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	I feel for 18 wheeler big rigs
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:48,863	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	All the while worried the Stasi would spot them coming in and out
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:51,679	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Or detect them with special acoustic sensors

EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,335	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	They finally reached they eat
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:01,151	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	They tamed for a basement just like last time
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,199	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	But again they miscalculated

EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,415	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	And that was gross
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:14,719	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	They hadn't noticed that the Border Zone slope
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,743	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Slightly downward
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:21,119	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Which is forgivable given the fact that they couldn't properly survey the land but this time they were lucky
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:23,935	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	That come up inside an abandoned shed
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:26,239	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	Soon after the tunnelers left the shed
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:31,103	| 99pi-0104-tunnel57-1 |	They sent a crew of Messengers above-ground legally into East Berlin
