EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:12,192	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	The chair is a difficult object

EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:30,880	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	If they've designed a big building chances are they've designed a thing on which to set
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:34,720	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And this makes sense the chairs will be signature design pieces for Ark
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:39,840	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Because chairs are almost like teeny tiny buildings for one person

EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:47,008	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Chairs
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:48,800	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Well I think every designer
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:51,104	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Really would love to design a chair
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:53,152	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	I mean there's so many interesting things about yours
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:56,480	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	This is designer Bruce Hannah I'm a teacher
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:57,504	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Pratt Institute
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,272	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	In Brooklyn New York
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:00,064	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:02,112	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Design things for know for years
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:03,904	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Including plenty of chairs
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:05,952	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Free office for everything
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:06,720	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Cheers
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:08,256	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Exist
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:11,072	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	They kind of look like placeholders for human beings
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:13,888	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Are you going to a restaurant that's empty and there's a little place hole
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:16,960	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Yet when the people sit in the chair
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:18,240	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	It disappears
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:20,288	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	The person replaced
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:24,896	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And so there's this distinct challenge for chair designers
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:28,224	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	To make this thing look fantastic when empty
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:30,784	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And remain comfortably invisible when in use
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:34,880	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And Hannah's pursuit of seating Innovation actually led to something else
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:37,184	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	When he was experimenting with foam cushioning
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,488	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Hannah accidentally invented
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,000	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Dinner
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:42,048	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Well actually it's called the phone
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:45,632	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Still really cool if it did it come out of Designing
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:49,984	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Are you a much more interested in the chair yes those designer sure do love chair

EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:53,312	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	They keep turning out new ones all the time
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:56,640	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Which brings me to one of my favorite headlines from The Onion
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,152	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Quote
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:03:00,992	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Report confirms no need to make new tears for the time being
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:02,784	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Because yeah
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:04,320	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	There are already a lot
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:06,368	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	I think you could say that about anything don't have enough cards
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,672	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Personally
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:09,952	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	I wouldn't be against it
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:11,488	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	But new chairs are out
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,000	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Who is coming out
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,816	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	The fit our ever-changing needs
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:17,888	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Because chairs determine how we use
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:18,400	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	The space
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:20,704	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Anna brought up this great example of
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,728	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Seating in cafes
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,520	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Cafes used to be places for
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,568	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Another places
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,080	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Is 4 working
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,872	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	So people are sitting
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,896	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Interacting different
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,944	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And so the furniture
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:31,456	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	The vault
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,248	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Space
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:33,760	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	In the action
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:35,808	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Throughout our lives
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:37,088	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	We have been told
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:38,368	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Sit down
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:41,952	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	In school in the office and the Plate Company of a dinner party
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:45,280	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	In a car or plane or bus or movie theater sitting is the default
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,840	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	We spend a lot of time in chair
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:54,752	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	But I'm sure you heard all the talk lately about how unhealthy tears are especially if he was in public radio which I bet
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:55,520	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	You do you feel

EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:13,952	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	I think I sound like five articles with the headline
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:15,232	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Sitting is the new smoking
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:19,839	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	The absolute number of hours that you sit is directly correlated
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:21,631	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	With mortality from all causes

EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:14,367	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	In the argument of the chair is that we should stop sitting in chair
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:19,487	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	At least we should stop sitting in them for so long after 3 hours
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:21,023	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Doesn't seem to have much concert
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:25,375	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	But Professor Kranz takes Innovative chair-sitting to another level
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,679	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	I try to eliminate

EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,615	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	See how should we say
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:42,015	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Professor Kansas house was full of floor cushions tatami mats and lots and lots of unconventional

EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:53,279	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And when she's not in her home feeding Oasis and out in public
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,839	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Versatrans does a lot of standing
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:57,887	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Instead of sitting when she gets tired
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,167	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Cheops Tennille
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:05:59,679	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Or Squad
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:01,215	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Or lie down
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:05,823	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	I laid down in a bank and somebody came up and asked me if I was having a heart attack
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:08,127	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	I just kind of them you know I understand
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:13,759	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	But I said no I'm fine I'm just resting cuz the line is so long

EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:19,391	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Gutsy to actually avoid the chairs everywhere
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:23,231	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	So how the rest of us gets suckered into the seated position
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:26,303	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Well it all started when we got off the farm
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:31,423	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	In the twentieth century we moved from being an agricultural economy or most people worked on farms
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:33,727	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Then we move into
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:36,799	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	A manufacturing economy were a lot of people worked in factories
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,847	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And some sad
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,615	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Some stood
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,919	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	To work the machines
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:44,223	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	In the longest conveyor belt
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:46,783	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Not to over romanticize life on the farm
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,831	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	They were still doing back-breaking work
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:54,207	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	They just probably had better posture and less carpal tunnel syndrome and then we moved into a service economy
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:58,303	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And that seems to be where the chair really took off
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,095	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And became the dominant
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:01,631	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Redis

EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:05,727	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And then when we settled into the service economy
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:08,799	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Sitting became the way to type in file and fill out paperwork
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:10,591	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	You could do that standing but
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,639	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	For reasons I don't
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,663	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Fully understand
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:19,807	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	We did it sitting until office chairs become V chairs the chairs that people spend most of their dad
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,367	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And until very recent history

EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:26,207	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	They were made
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,231	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	To fit your job
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:29,023	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	So you had a managerial one you had a
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:34,655	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Bruce Hannah had to design a few of these kinds of office
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:38,495	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	The status oriented chair design meant then some cases
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,263	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	You had
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:40,799	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	320 lb
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:42,847	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Executive sitting in a gigantic
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:45,663	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Because it really was about his presence when he was
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,199	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	For her price
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:49,759	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And then you had
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:50,527	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	The

EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:05,023	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Right now I think it's what society says
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:05,791	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	That will make me

EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:13,727	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Pieces of machinery would sell like hotcakes
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:17,823	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	No one except guilin cramps first came out people said well
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:19,871	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	You know nobody's going to pay for
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,663	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	An ordinary Clerk
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:22,687	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	To have
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:26,015	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	An adjustable chair with all the bells and whistles
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:28,575	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Oh that's way too expensive that Will never happen
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:32,927	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Well then there were repetitive strain injury in a whole lot of lawsuits

EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:37,279	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Insurance companies suddenly thought it was a lot cheaper to buy those

EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:51,103	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Is a vast improvement over

EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:56,991	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	But Krantz argues that some of those bells and whistles on office chairs actually don't help that much
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,063	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Specifically those ergonomic chair backs
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,855	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Because in all likelihood
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:04,671	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	You are probably sitting in this chair
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,951	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	While working at a desk
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:08,255	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And the desk
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:08,767	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	It turns out
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:11,583	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Is the chairs devious accomplice
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:15,167	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	The True Villain is the table
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,191	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Flat surfaces
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,727	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Force you to lean over
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:20,031	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	So you never really take advantage of the chair back
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:23,103	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	The chair in particular
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:26,687	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Asks us to sit at this right angle position

EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:38,207	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Forward
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Or more likely slump
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,023	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Even if you have
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:42,047	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Excellent posture
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:46,399	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	It's hard to avoid leaning over your keyboard or your dinner or your book
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,167	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	So the hand
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:50,495	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Gets seduced into coming forward

EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:57,407	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And Galen Krantz says that when you curve your spine into the sea shape
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:11:01,247	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	It's bad for the spine of course but it also compresses your organs
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,271	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	What does really bad
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:05,599	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Especially for hours on end throughout the day in an office

EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:40,927	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	If you're on torso strength

EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:45,023	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	With the strategy of getting your sit bones out to the edge of the chair

EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:54,751	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Back support can they get your body out of the sea shape
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:58,335	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	It positions the body halfway between sitting and standing
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,103	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And if you take
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:02,687	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	That body position and lean it backwards what do you get
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,455	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	A lounge chair
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:05,759	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And that's how I'm
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,551	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Position right now
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,319	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:12,415	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Dylan Krantz was reclining in a lounge chair for this interview I'll be in the lounge
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:14,463	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And I'll have you in the rocking
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:21,375	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And she put me in a rocking chair because unlike a normal chair it allows for more fluidity and movement
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,935	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	This all sounds great and healthy and fun
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,727	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	But in practice I was sitting
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:29,055	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	All the Way Forward rocking right to the very front
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:32,127	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Retching my microphone out to Kranz
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:33,663	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	She was lying back in her lounge chair
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,199	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	And it hurt
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:40,063	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	I just wanted to chairs in a flat desk to rest my arm on
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:43,391	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	But I don't know maybe I just wasn't used to this alternative world yet
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:45,439	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Maybe I need to get acclimated I don't know
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:48,255	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	I mean Professor Kranz looks pretty comfortable in her lounge chair
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:52,607	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	4 people got so into standing desks and treadmill desk

EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:03,871	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Of all the solutions to the seating problem the lounge chair is the solution that requires the least physical effort
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:06,943	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Will still supporting the human body in a healthy way
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:12,831	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	But it's not like there's one single piece of furniture that will correct all the problems of chair-sitting no
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,879	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Lounge chair is not the answer
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,415	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	There's no the answer
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,951	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	What we need
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,719	| 99pi-0139-edgeofyourseats-1 |	Is variety
