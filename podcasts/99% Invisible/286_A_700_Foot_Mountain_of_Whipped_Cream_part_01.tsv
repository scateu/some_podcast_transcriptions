EDL	00:53:10,015	00:53:13,087	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	The backstory there for that scene was that that was not in the book
EDL	00:53:14,879	00:53:16,671	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	Spielberg brought in the Great
EDL	00:53:17,439	00:53:19,487	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	Screenwriter and filmmaker John Milius
EDL	00:53:19,999	00:53:21,279	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	To write that monologue
EDL	00:53:22,047	00:53:27,167	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	And then apparently Robertshaw himself to who was a playwright went in and
EDL	00:53:27,167	00:53:29,983	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	And did some rewriting on it and kind of worked with Milius on it
EDL	00:53:31,007	00:53:33,055	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	You know Justin's up being
EDL	00:53:33,055	00:53:35,103	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	Like one of most iconic monologues
EDL	00:53:35,103	00:53:41,503	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	Movie history for sure it is so good and it's so naturally moves from one scene to this car comparing to the other
EDL	00:53:41,503	00:53:42,783	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	Weather and
EDL	00:53:43,807	00:53:46,879	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	In the fact that I've thought about this a lot it's like
EDL	00:53:46,879	00:53:50,463	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	Because it's get called out because they're comparing scars and Brody says
EDL	00:53:50,463	00:53:51,743	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	What's that on your arm
EDL	00:53:52,255	00:53:53,535	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	And it's at its
EDL	00:53:53,535	00:53:57,887	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	The removal of the tattoo of the Union Indianapolis right and
EDL	00:53:57,887	00:54:00,191	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	And I think about that all the time like
EDL	00:54:00,959	00:54:07,359	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	Remove it and like what is going on in his head that he would remove it instead of keep it there
EDL	00:54:07,359	00:54:08,127	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	And
EDL	00:54:08,127	00:54:11,455	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	With every part of his character that you get in other ways
EDL	00:54:12,735	00:54:15,551	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	That seems like this extreme moment in his life
EDL	00:54:15,551	00:54:19,391	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	That you have no knowledge of it just have this little tiny peek into
EDL	00:54:19,903	00:54:21,695	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	And I love that part of it too
EDL	00:54:22,463	00:54:23,487	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	I never thought about that
EDL	00:54:23,999	00:54:25,535	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	That is super interesting that you would

EDL	00:54:29,375	00:54:32,959	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	Yeah yeah exactly to like that the level of
EDL	00:54:33,471	00:54:37,567	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	Trauma or whatever he was trying to get away from or whatever it was like it was
EDL	00:54:38,079	00:54:40,127	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	Clearly something that haunted him
EDL	00:54:40,127	00:54:42,431	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	In a way like it was not an adventure story to him
EDL	00:54:42,431	00:54:43,711	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	Yeah what what happened
EDL	00:54:44,223	00:54:44,991	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	And
EDL	00:54:44,991	00:54:50,879	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	This is something else I guess you don't really know it's an incomplete narrative but I've tried to fill that
EDL	00:54:51,391	00:54:55,231	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	In my head lots of times and I never come up with like what I think is the answer
EDL	00:54:55,743	00:54:56,767	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	But it
EDL	00:54:56,767	00:54:58,303	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	They may have to do with it
EDL	00:54:58,303	00:54:59,839	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	I'm trying to get away from it end
EDL	00:55:00,351	00:55:02,911	| 286_A_700_Foot_Mountain_of_Whipped_Cream_part_01 |	Vim willingness his willingness to talk about it that moment
