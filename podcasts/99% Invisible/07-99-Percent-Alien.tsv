EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,784	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Yep that's the one
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:05,184	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	They stuck with what they knew that spending time up there or in zero gravity people just intuitively designed it
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,976	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Like a room on Earth there would be
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:13,376	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Control panel and then there were little chairs ever seats that you would sit and it was makes no sense and you can't sit you would have to

EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:21,312	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	We are humans when we have a room we have a floor-to-ceiling we have chairs and tables and that's
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:24,896	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	What we do and that's how it was designed but getting stuff into space is expense
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:26,688	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	There's always a grand effort
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:27,712	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	To minimize weight

EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:37,440	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	So then they went to the Other Extreme get rid of it all because in space
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:42,816	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	The walls becoming your table if you have a table and you put something down on the table the table
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:45,888	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Doesn't act like a table it doesn't hold it they just floats off
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:48,960	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	A drawer isn't very good you open the door everything flies out
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:51,520	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	So what you have is pieces of elastic
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:55,616	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	On the wall like you know you pulled the elastic back and you stick your clipboard in there
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,920	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	And everything has been savell curse of the wall
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,200	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Become
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:02:59,968	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	The table

EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,320	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	So that became the game
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:06,112	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	No furniture in a ceiling
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:06,880	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	4

EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:19,168	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	You can put the bathroom on the wall but this is where the human
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:22,752	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	The capsule became over design
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,264	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	For the 02
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:24,544	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Condition
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,056	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	And it became

EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,920	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	The one thing
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:34,016	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	That the crews decided that they were not okay with we're getting rid of it
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,552	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Kitchen table like a dining table
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,064	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	My place
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:38,368	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	To gather around at the end of the day you don't have
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:41,440	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Sit down or pretend to sit down
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:44,512	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	And talk about what you did over the day eat
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,792	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Show me where humans
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,840	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Human beings want to sit around the table
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:50,656	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	I'm gossip and talk about stuff and eat and drink
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:52,704	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	And the table came back
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:56,800	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Small table and there's little pieces of elastic and velcro and they all
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:57,312	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Hover
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:58,336	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Around the table
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,616	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	So despite that
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:02,176	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Horrifying scene in Alien

EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:24,191	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	It was always so that you know what the accepted orientation is
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,983	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Can helps in the constant War
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:26,495	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Emotions
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:29,311	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	And having everyone in the same orientation
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:30,335	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	It also helps the crew talk
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:34,687	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	I interviewed this astronaut Lee Morin about how
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:36,991	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Troubling it is to try to have a conversation
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,807	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	With somebody who is upside down when you were right side up
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:41,855	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Sort of lip reading all the time without
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:43,135	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Realizing it and he said
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:45,695	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	When you go beyond a 45 degree angle
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,999	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	The other person starts to have trouble reading your lips
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,559	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Is considered impolite to carry on a conversation
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,607	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	With someone when you are upside down
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,655	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	When you are differently oriented
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:59,519	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	I love these examples in the fundamentals of Otherworldly
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,799	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Space design because
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:05,407	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	If you were to recreate that exercise right here and then gravity-based habitat in start

EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,055	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Text would make a comeback
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,847	| 07-99-Percent-Alien |	Because it might just be
