EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:48,800	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	It just like any other quite European city

EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:56,736	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	It's all fake
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:59,808	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	It just a replica of what once was
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:06,208	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Like so many European cities during the second world war Warsaw was destroyed it had to be rebuilt
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:10,816	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Now when you walk around the reconstructed historic part of Warsaw

EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:26,688	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	I study the painting and then I studied the building above
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:29,760	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	And just like I was set up to I thought
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:31,808	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Wow they did an amazing job rebuilding it
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:35,904	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	But then later our reporter Amy just us Cafe found out
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:37,696	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	It's not quite like that
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:40,512	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	You're entering something which is effectively

EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:45,376	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	And I miss fear of a sudden.
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:46,912	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	But you're on your way over there

EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:57,664	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	He told me about the incredible process of putting the city back together again
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:01,760	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	It's a challenge a lot of European cities were facing after the war
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:05,088	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Warsaw's massive rebuilding of its entire medieval Old Town
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:09,696	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Was lauded as one of the most impressive rebuilding post-war projects on the continent
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:12,000	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	They made it look to everyone
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,792	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Like they reclaimed what was lost
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:20,704	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	But here's the thing Warsaw historic old town is not a replica of the real thing
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:23,008	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	And historic City
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,288	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	It never really was
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,872	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	So it's back up for the mystery
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:31,712	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Sure Warsaw was damaged during the war as what other cities
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:35,808	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	That really worse off occupied by Nazi forces

EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:42,976	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Practically the whole city was destroyed
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:47,840	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	People quibble about the exact statistics but most agree it was something like over 80
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:49,376	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Percent of the core part of Warsaw
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,424	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Really most of the city
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:53,472	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Especially the part supposed considered important

EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,031	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Cuz actually it was different
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:51,871	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	It was never supposed to be exactly the same as it was
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:52,895	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	So
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:59,551	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Visit this weird disjunction between this incredible and fishes and with intensity old bricks being reused and

EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:07,999	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	But at the same time there was a very clearly stated
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:11,583	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Idea that the Old Town shouldn't be the same old town

EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,447	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	So it should be a more perfect

EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:18,239	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	It existed before the war
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,311	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Before the war ironically

EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,015	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	It was a slum it was more or less
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:34,111	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	It didn't have proper storage facilities I didn't have proper draining
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:36,159	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	It was basically lived in by very poor and Appleton
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	With a few kind of judges in and none of another see the cathedral was in

EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:55,871	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	But after the war reeling from loss piled upon loss

EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:08,415	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Set of the Communist way of thinking
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:10,207	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	The Old Town needed to be rebuilt
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,999	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	So that it could be
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,767	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	Forgotten
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:18,655	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	The cynical argument is that the old town was rebuilt as assertive ideological camouflage so
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,679	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	In order to master

EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:21,119	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	And they can go about their business of overhauling the cut
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:24,447	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	So that's why they decided to rebuild the Old Town
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:28,287	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	But they didn't touch a way to keep their core ideals intact
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,847	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	And this is where it gets really weird
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:35,967	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	When city planners were looking for inspiration and had a better rebuild Warsaw
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:37,247	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	They went back further
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:40,575	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	And just before the war when the old town was far from its heyday

EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,159	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	It was improper
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:18,975	| 99pi-0072-newoldtown-1 |	And so it was rebuilt effectively in the image of how it would have looked
