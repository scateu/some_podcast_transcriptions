EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,128	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	In the middle of the island
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:59,296	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	It looks a lot like a monument you'd see in a city park except it's on a forested island in the middle of a river
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:01,856	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	It is enormous
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:04,160	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	It's 30 ft tall

EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:54,848	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Are here
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,640	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	I got another man
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:58,944	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Yeah not a lot of detail there
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:01,248	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Honestly the whole island was strange to me
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:03,552	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Kind of creepy actually
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:08,416	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Not very well kept up this enormous imposing statue with the Erie plaque
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:09,952	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	The scouts
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:16,864	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	What's crazy is this statue was erected in 1874 making it the oldest Monument dedicated
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,632	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	12 woman
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,656	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	In the US
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:22,752	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	So you think someone would come out here and at least over the grass
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:28,384	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Well what I learned is that plaque does tell a story though not an obvious one
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:31,968	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	And I learned there's a good reason why the grounds are neglected
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:35,296	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	In fact what to do with this Historic Site
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:37,088	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Has become a bit of a problem
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:39,904	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	And it all has to do with the woman in the monument
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:40,928	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	And what she did
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:51,168	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	The story starts about 50 miles south of the monument in a town called Haverhill Massachusetts
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:54,752	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	I went down there and met up with a local historian named Tom spitaleri
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,800	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	In the parking lot of a Dunkin Donuts

EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:25,471	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Particularly from Colonial times and to the time of Hannah.
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:30,847	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	What time will Royal in what some historians

EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:37,247	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	What King Philip's King George's in the Seven Years War
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,039	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	In the 1600s
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:45,439	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	New England was a war zone between the French the British and the Native Americans by the end of that Century disease
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:48,767	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	These and War would wipe out most Native Americans in the Northeast

EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,119	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	I mean
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,143	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	It sounds funny
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:58,239	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Putting in today's contents that's what it was we were the album
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,519	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	There was nothing north of us
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:04,895	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	There was nothing but Wilderness around making it an easy target for attacks by Native Americans
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:10,015	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Bands of Native Americans had shifting alliances with the British and the French
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:14,879	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	The French paid Abenaki used to abduct Brits and bring them 2K back
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:17,439	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Then the French would sell these captives back to the British
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,975	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	It was a slave trade
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:21,279	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Xiaomi this area was
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:21,791	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Constantly
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:23,839	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Constantly
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:30,495	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	In 1697 a woman named Hannah Dustin was recovering from delivering her 8th
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,263	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Child
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:33,055	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	What happened to Aki's rated Haverhill
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:39,455	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	They killed and captured dozens of colonists and burned buildings that's what the word faggets on the monument refers to
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:42,783	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	A faggot was a bundle of sticks used to fuel the fire
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:47,135	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	During the raid Hannah duston husband was outside with seven of their kids
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:49,439	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Defending the homestead and his children
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:55,327	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	But Abenaki is entered the house and abducted Hannah her newborn baby girl that her nurse Mary Neff
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:06:01,983	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	The captives were marched North to the Wilderness and shortly after leaving April when Hannah's baby wouldn't stop crying
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:05,055	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	One of the Abenaki smashed it against a tree
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:07,871	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	That's where you get the word infanticide
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,151	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	From The Monuments plaque
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:10,943	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	They kept walking North
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,991	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Most likely they were heading to the Outpost
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,295	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	That's up in Quebec
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:20,927	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	At some point the war party handed Hannah Dustin and Mary Neff to another group of Abenaki
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:22,975	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	A group made up of a couple families
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,999	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	She was sold
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,535	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	To those Native Americans
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:31,679	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	So the group of Abenaki that ended up with Hannah was made up of two fathers to mothers
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,703	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	A grandmother
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,471	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	A bunch of children
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:38,079	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	And I already had a white boy with them a kid named Samuel leonardson

EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,687	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Is it that makes three white captives
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:43,455	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	12 Abenaki
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:48,575	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	The whole crew across the Merrimack River to the island the one that now is the money man on it
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,367	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	And they set up camp for the night
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,927	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	In the middle of the night
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,463	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Hannah Dustin made a decision
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:58,815	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	She rallied Marion Samuel and led them around the sleeping Evan Aki's
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,607	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	One at a time
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:03,167	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	They brought a hatchet down on the abenakis head
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,727	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	They killed 10 in total

EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,591	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Feel offensive
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:57,247	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	In fact all the Hannah duston stuff and Hannah Dustin the landmarks are a problem for some people who know the whole story
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,551	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	But the whole story
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,599	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	That's a tricky thing to pin down
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,647	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	You gotta understand something with two handed
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:05,695	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Is a lot of inter
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:07,999	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	And it's a lot of New England
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:14,399	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Canada Sims kidnapping and Escape happen more than 300 years ago
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:17,471	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	And the story has been told and retold a lot
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:20,287	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	And actually the reason we know anything about it today
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,567	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Has to do with the fact
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,103	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	That she scalped her victim
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:26,687	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	After Hannah came home her husband took her
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:29,247	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Sea scallops down to Boston
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,015	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	To sell them
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:36,159	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Now if you like me when you heard she had Scouts her victims you may have thought she had some kind of bloodlust
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	I thought scalping with something tribes did to wipe
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,535	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	People not the other way around
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:43,583	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Turns out I was very
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,607	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Very wrong
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:49,983	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Colonial governments paid cash for Native American scalps heads and even hands
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:53,311	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	They would pay most for a man less for women
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,335	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	At least for a child
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	They would even pay Native Americans for the body parts of other Native Americans depending on who was Warren with whom at the
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:05,087	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	So Dustin had Financial incentive for scalping her victims
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:07,903	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	But if you're the reason we still know the story
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:11,743	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	When Hannah was in Boston selling her Scout she sat down with Cotton Mather
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,791	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	And he wrote her story down
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:16,095	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	His name might ring a bell
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,887	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Cotton Mather was head of
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:19,167	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	The Protestant Church in New England

EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:40,671	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	As a heroine
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:45,023	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Well I think the Hannah duston story has endured for so long
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:48,095	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Because it's not just a story about
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,655	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	A woman who
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,679	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Kill people
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,959	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	It actually
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:58,079	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Has become a story about The American Nation at different points of time
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:02,431	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	This is Barbara Carter historian and professor at the University of Northern Iowa

EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:20,351	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	In more recent years
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:22,143	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	It has been used as
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:23,423	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	A story
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:29,567	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Domestically about culture wars really Qatar has researched how and why the Hannah Dustin monuments were built
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:34,943	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	And she said it really hit home just how far the story had traveled when I
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:37,247	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Happened across a Salt Lake City
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:40,063	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Mormon woman's newspaper
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:43,903	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	In the 1890s that started off by saying
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:45,439	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Who has not heard of Hannah.
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:49,023	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	I mean Hannah Dustin was from Massachusetts
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:52,607	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	After her captivity Hannah Dustin lived in colonial obscurity

EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,703	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	And died at age 84
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:59,263	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	No one talked about her through the 1700s

EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:01,567	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Until
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:02,335	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	In

EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:08,479	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	And a lot of
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:09,759	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Intellectuals
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:12,319	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	At that point in time we're trying to create
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,599	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	A distinctly American
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,367	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Can culture
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:17,183	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	And so they started telling American story
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:20,767	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	And trying to uncover American heroes and heroines
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:25,631	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	So the country's literary Elite Doug around for some good ole American stories

EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:34,847	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Well the first place you might likely come across her
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:39,711	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Would be when you opened your American history textbook in the school
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:40,991	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	You

EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:30,463	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	Something like that yes Cedric is the vice-president and formerly the president of the Dustin family associate

EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:13,727	| 99pi-0113-monumentaldilemma-1 |	But he is disappointed the statue in the island are in disrepair
