EDL	00:00:06,144	00:00:10,240	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	On this so we tell stories about what we make and what it says about
EDL	00:00:10,240	00:00:11,008	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Does human
EDL	00:00:11,008	00:00:14,080	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But we never write those things on a 5-star scale
EDL	00:00:14,592	00:00:17,664	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The anthropocene reviewed is here to correct that oversight
EDL	00:00:17,664	00:00:19,200	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I love the show
EDL	00:00:19,200	00:00:24,576	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	By John Green he's the author of best-selling books like the Fault in Our Stars and Turtles all the way down
EDL	00:00:24,576	00:00:30,976	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Kelso make some of the best stuff on YouTube with his brother Hank today we're going to be sure two of my favorite episodes of his new
EDL	00:00:30,976	00:00:33,536	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Podcast that I think will be of particular interest
EDL	00:00:33,536	00:00:38,144	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To an IPI listener have an interview with John about a lot of things like

EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:43,008	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I think you're really going to like it
EDL	00:00:43,008	00:00:47,360	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	After I got done talking with John I just felt good all day about life
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:47,872	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is great
EDL	00:00:48,896	00:00:49,664	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But first
EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:50,432	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Here's an episode
EDL	00:00:50,944	00:00:52,224	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The anthropocene reviewed
EDL	00:00:56,320	00:00:59,136	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Hello and welcome to the anthropocene reviewed
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:01,440	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	A podcast where we review different facets
EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:03,744	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To be human centered planet on a five-star scale
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:07,328	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Today I'll be reviewing a 17000 year old painting
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,376	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And the Taco Bell breakfast menu
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:15,008	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Let's start with the painting
EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:21,408	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	So if you've ever been or had a child you will likely already be familiar with handstand
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:24,736	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Cancel the first figurative art made by both our kids
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:27,808	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Somewhere between the ages of two and three
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:31,392	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Play children spread the fingers of one hand out across a piece
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:32,160	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Paper
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:34,208	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And then with the help of a parent
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:35,488	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Trace their five finger
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:41,632	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I remember my son's face as he lifted his hand and looked absolutely shocked
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:43,680	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To see the shape of his hand
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:45,216	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Still on the paper
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:47,520	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	A semi permanent record
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:48,032	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Himself
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:52,384	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I am extremely happy that my children are no longer three
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:56,224	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And yet to look at their little hands from those early artworks
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:58,528	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is to be inundated with a strange
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:01:59,808	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Soul splitting Joy
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,344	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Those pictures
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:03,392	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Remind me that they are not just growing up
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:05,696	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But also growing away from me
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:08,256	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Running toward their own lives
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:13,376	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But of course that's meaning I am applying to their hand stencils
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:16,192	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Complicated relationship between art
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:17,472	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And its viewers
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:20,288	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is never more fraught than when we are looking deeply into the
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:28,224	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In September of 1940 and 18 year old mechanic named Marcel Ravi. Was walking his dog robe
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,784	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In the countryside of Southwestern France
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:33,088	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	When the dog disappeared down a hole
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:39,744	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Robot eventually returned but the next day Robbie. Went to the spot with three friends to explore the whole
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:42,304	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And after quite a bit of digging they discovered
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,072	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Cave
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:45,120	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	With walls covered with paintings
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:48,704	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Including over 900 paintings of animals
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:51,520	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Horses Stags bison
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:53,568	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It also species that are now extinct
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:55,104	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Including a woolly rhinoceros
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:58,688	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The paintings were astonishingly detailed and Vivid
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,224	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	With red yellow and
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:03,296	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Black paint made from pulverized mineral pigments
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:05,600	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That were usually blown through a narrow
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:07,904	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Tube possibly a hollowed bone
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,696	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Onto the walls of the cave
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,744	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But eventually be a stamp
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,024	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	These artworks
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:15,584	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	At least 17000 years old
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:19,168	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To the boys who visited the cave that day
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:22,240	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	We're so profoundly moved by the art they saw
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:24,544	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That they camped outside the cave
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:25,568	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Protected
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,360	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	For over a year
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,920	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	After World War II
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:31,968	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The French government took over protection of the science
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:35,040	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And the cave was open to the public in 1948
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,880	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	When Picasso Celtic cave paintings on a visit that year
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:39,904	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	He reportedly said
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,696	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	We have invented nothing
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,768	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	There are many Mysteries at let's go
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:47,328	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Why for instance are there no paintings of reindeer
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:51,168	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which we know where the primary source of food for the Paleolithic
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:51,936	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Humans who lived
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:53,216	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Cave
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:56,032	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Why would they so much more focused on painting animals
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,824	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Spin painting human forms
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:04,224	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Why are certain areas of the cave filled with images including pictures on the ceiling that required the building
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:04,992	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Scaffolding
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:05,760	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	How to create
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,552	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	What other areas have only a few faint
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:12,160	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And with the painting spiritual here are sacred animals
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,696	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Or were they practical
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:16,768	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Here is a guide to some of the animals that might kill you
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:23,167	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Aside from the animals there are nearly a thousand abstract signs and shapes we cannot in
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:23,935	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Interpret
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:26,751	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And also several negative hand stencil
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,799	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	As they are known by Art historians
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:31,615	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	These are the paintings that most interests me
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:36,735	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	They were created by pressing one hand with fingers splayed against the wall
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:37,503	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The cave
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,527	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And then blowing Pig
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,855	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Leaving the area around the hand-painted
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:46,207	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Similar hand stencils have been found in caves around the world
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:49,023	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	From Indonesia to Spain to us
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,071	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Australia to the Americas
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:53,887	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To Africa we have found these memories
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,935	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Of hands from 15
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:57,471	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Or 30 or even
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:59,007	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	40000 years ago
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:04,383	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	These hands pencils remind us of how different life was in the distant past
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:10,783	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Amputations likely from frostbite are common in Europe and so you often C- hand stencils with three
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:11,807	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Eeyore for fingers
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,855	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And life was short and difficult
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:17,439	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	As many as 1/4 of women died in childbirth
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:21,279	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Around 50% of children died before the age of
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:21,791	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Define
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:26,399	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But they also remind us that the humans of the past whereas human
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,423	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	As we are
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,703	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Their hands
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:30,239	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Indistinguishable
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,263	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	From hours
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:36,639	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	These communities hunted and gathered and there were no large caloric surpluses
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:42,015	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	So every healthy person would have had to contribute to the acquisition of food and water
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:44,063	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And yet somehow
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:46,623	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	They still made time to create art
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,927	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Almost as if art
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,695	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Isn't optional
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:50,719	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	For humans
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:56,607	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	We see all kinds of hand stenciled on Cave walls children and adults
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:59,423	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But almost always the fingers are spread
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,191	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like my kids
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:07,871	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But it's fascinating and a little strange that so many Paleolithic humans
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:10,943	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You couldn't possibly have had any contact with each other
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:13,759	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Created the same paintings the same way

EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:23,231	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But then again what the lascaux art means to me is likely very different from what it meant to the
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:24,255	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	People who made it
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:28,607	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Some academics theorized that the hand stencils were part of Hunting Ridge
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:34,751	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Then there's always the possibility that the hand was just a convenient model situated at the end of the wrist
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:36,799	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To me though

EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:47,807	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And because they are negative prints surrounded by Red pigment
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:51,647	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	They also look to me like something out of a horror movie
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,439	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like ghostly hands

EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,015	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I guess
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:21,599	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But tourists can still visit an imitation cave

EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:44,639	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I actually find it overwhelmingly hopeful

EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,919	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	This is not the thing itself
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,711	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But a shadow of it
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:21,759	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	This is a handprint
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,807	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But not a hand

EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:33,023	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Very much like the past it represent
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:36,351	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I get the hand print stencils at Glasgow

EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:53,503	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Good idea
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:57,343	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Albeit one that would require me to eat a fair bit at Taco Bell
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:02,463	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which is a fast food restaurant chain with over 7,000 restaurants around the world

EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:13,983	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	After serving in World War II he returned to his native Southern California
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:16,287	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To seek his fortune in the burger business

EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:25,247	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But across the street
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:28,575	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	A family-owned Mexican restaurant called the mitla cafe
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,599	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Whistling
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,903	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Lots of tacos
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:34,463	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Including its famous hard shell tacos
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:41,375	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Bellwood off and eat at the mitla cafe and then go back to his Hamburger Stand and try to reverse-engineer those
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,143	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Popular tacos
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:44,447	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But you can never figure it out
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:48,543	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	So eventually he became friends with the family that owned the mitla
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,079	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And they showed him the recipe
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:53,151	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Bell started making tacos soon thereafter
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:10:00,063	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Side note the mitla cafe was the setting for an important moment in American history in the early 1940s public
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:03,391	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Pools and other services were segregated in San Bernardino
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:05,439	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Latinos couldn't swim at the pool
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:07,999	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Or sit in certain sections of movie theaters
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:10,815	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Some businesses had whites only signs
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,351	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And many schools were segregated
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:15,423	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In a series of meetings held at the mitla cafe
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:20,031	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Latino church and Civic leaders developed a plan to sue the city of San Bernardino
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,567	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And they won
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:27,967	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In fact the case Lopez versus II was cited by the Supreme Court and its famous Brown versus

EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:31,807	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The found segregated schools to be illegal
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:36,927	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Will return to Taco Bell momentarily but one last note about the meatball Cafe
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,463	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It's still open
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:42,303	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And today is run by the fourth generation of the family who founded it
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:49,215	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I've eaten there actually and it will not surprise you to learn that their tacos are vastly in calc
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,775	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Superior to Taco Bell tacos
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:55,871	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Taco Bell isn't really in the business of being
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:56,639	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Good
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,919	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It aims to be
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:58,431	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Good enough
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,223	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Inconsistent
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:01,503	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And inexpensive
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:08,671	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Right so of course the recipe for Taco Bell tacos was stolen by a white restaurant owner from a local Center for Latino community
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,695	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Unity and activism
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:14,559	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But the owners of the mitla cafe never publicly expressed any resentment toward Bell
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:18,399	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	One member of the family Irene Montano magnanimously set of him
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,679	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	He was a self-starter
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:21,983	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And he did push those tacos
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:27,103	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Indeed after opening the first Taco Bell in Downey California in 1962
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:31,199	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	New franchises of Taco Bell spread rapidly throughout the West Coast
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:33,759	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Back then the menu was extremely simple
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:38,623	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Tacos tostadas burritos Frijoles and chili burgers
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,647	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And everything
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:41,183	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Cost $0.19
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:43,487	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Around the box safety in today's money
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:44,767	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	People loved it
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,815	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	By 1967
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:48,863	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	They were 100 Taco Bells
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:50,911	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And they were 868
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:53,215	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	When Bell sold his company to PepsiCo
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,495	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In 1978

EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:10,367	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Bell was a lifelong model train enthusiast
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:17,279	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But the park which had no rides that weren't quarter scale model trains went bankrupt after a few years
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:18,815	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I mention all of this
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:21,119	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Because I think it's important to understand

EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:26,495	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Passionate about Mexican food
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:29,567	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	He saw an opportunity in the marketplace
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:30,847	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And he filled it
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:37,759	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I'm not trying to bash Taco Bell I've had many enjoyable meals there in my younger and less nutrition Orient
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,527	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Today's
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,807	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And per dollar spent
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:44,415	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Taco Bell offers more caloric energy than almost any other restaurant
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,975	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	A Big Mac at McDonald's
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:50,559	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Two Rivers about 1.45 calories per Penny spent
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:53,631	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	A Taco Bell beefy Fritos burrito
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:58,239	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Offers an astonishing 4.26 calories per penny
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:05,151	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Also I recently ate a Taco Bell beefy Fritos burrito under the guise of research for this review and
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:07,199	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	For about 5 minutes after eating it
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,503	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I felt almost euphoric
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:12,575	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It was flavorful and intoxicating mix
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:14,623	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Crunchy and chewy
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,159	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And strangely sweet
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:23,071	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The beef was stringing the tortilla suboptimal and I suspect I would be horrified by a thorough accounting of the in
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:25,631	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Environmental and socio-political costs of the
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:27,167	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The beefy Fritos burrito
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:29,727	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But still for those five minutes
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,263	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I felt pleasantly
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,543	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And entirely
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:33,055	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Satiate
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:38,431	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	10 minutes after that of course I began to feel extremely unwell but
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:40,991	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That might be down to my generally weak Constitution
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:43,039	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Institution rather than any fault of
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:43,807	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The food itself
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:47,647	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	All I'm saying is the Taco Bell is not
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,159	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:50,719	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	A mission-driven Institution
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:53,023	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It seeks to turn a profit
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:59,423	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And that's why I find it so fascinating the Taco Bell didn't serve breakfast until 2012
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:03,775	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Burger King served its first breakfast in 1979
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:07,871	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	McDonald's introduce the Egg McMuffin way back in 1972
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:10,943	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Maybe Taco Bell was late to breakfast
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,735	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Because they didn't want to recreate
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,783	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Actual Mexican breakfast food
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:18,623	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which is excellent but there's very little resemblance to the hash
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:21,183	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Browns and cinnamon flavored donut holes
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:24,255	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The Taco Bell eventually released as part of their breakfasts
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,023	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Just menu
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:31,423	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	All of which goes to show again that Taco Bell as a company is not and never has been in
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,959	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Twisted in Mexican food
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:35,007	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Except for what could be
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,799	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Efficiently appropriated from it
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:42,687	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which is why the taste profile of its breakfast menu more closely resembles that have Burger King
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,479	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Did anything at the mitla cafe
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:46,783	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I thought the donut holes were good
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,831	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But it's hard to mess up fried dough
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:52,159	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I found a grilled breakfast burrito Fiesta potato
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:52,927	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To be
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:55,231	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like its name a bit overcomplicated
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,535	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The stand out to me was the breakfast
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,047	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	French rap
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:02,911	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which wraps hash browns bacon eggs and cheese into a grilled tortilla
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:04,703	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And that wasn't bad but
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:11,103	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Mostly my Taco Bell breakfast was what Taco Bell's frantic and Relentless marketing campaign
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:12,639	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Seem to fear the most
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:13,919	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It was boring
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:19,039	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I find it revealing that while there are Taco Bell's in Romania
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,319	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And Australia
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,087	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And Brazil
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:23,391	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You won't find one in Mexico
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:27,487	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Detroit twice in 1992 and 2007
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:32,863	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But both times the restaurants face the same fate as Glenn Bells railroad Adventureland
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:36,703	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You can add a valve to the end of every menu item
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:39,519	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And you can make your catchphrase yo quiero Taco Bell
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:42,335	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But if you can't sell your tacos in Mexico
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:43,871	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Bank Mexican
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:46,431	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I get to Taco Bell breakfast menu
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:47,455	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	2 Stars
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:16:00,255	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Chanel ears my interview with the creator of the anthropocene reviewed

EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,887	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	When someone asks you what you do
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:07,423	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	What in the world do you say
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:11,519	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I usually say that I work in educational video so that they don't
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:13,567	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Ask more questions
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,871	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But if I'm
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:17,663	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Feeling
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:20,991	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	A little more talkative I usually say that I'm a writer and a Utah
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:25,087	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But I guess now I'm also a podcaster so I don't know what I do
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,903	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	How do you describe the anthropocene reviewed
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:30,719	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Beatrice interviewed is show
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,743	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Where I
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,023	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Look at
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:33,791	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Different
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:38,143	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Facets of the human centered planet and then review them on a 5-star scale
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,935	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It started out as
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,959	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I'd like a bit
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:43,263	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It started out as a joke I had with my brother
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:44,287	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Because of Yelp
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:48,383	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And Amazon reviews and Goodreads that
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:54,783	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Everything now is reviewed on a five-star scale and everything gets a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down a wreck
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:55,807	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Commander it don't recommend
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,343	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:17:00,159	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	What if we applied that reviewing
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,695	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Framework
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,719	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	2
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,999	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like traffic cones
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:07,839	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And that was the initial joke that I made with him or like argyle socks
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,119	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And it goes like
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,399	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It's good it's a funny bit
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:13,471	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And so I think he ended up making a video
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,519	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Where he use the bit
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,055	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And then
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,335	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I ended up
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:21,663	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Writing an essay about diet dr. pepper and
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,687	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Canada geese
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,735	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And at the end of writing is essays I was like
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:27,807	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You know this isn't very funny and I kind of thought that
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,855	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It was going to be a funny
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,135	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Bing
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,671	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But I like it
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:36,511	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And it interests me and because I started out my career as a book reviewer
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:37,535	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It felt
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:41,375	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Kind of like going home to me in a way even though like
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,143	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It is
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,167	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Obviously
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:46,495	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	A little sticky to be reviewing
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,263	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	For instance
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:49,567	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Colorado on a five-star scale
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:54,943	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	There is something about the value judgment thing that's inherent to reviewing
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,455	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That interest me
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:59,807	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is it a healthy thing that we are reviewing everything and if I start scale
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:00,319	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In the world
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:04,159	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Yeah probably give it to Stars
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:10,047	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I definitely understand the urge to make simple qualitative judgments
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:11,327	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	About
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,095	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Experian
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:13,887	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:18,751	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	If you read one-star Yelp reviews or you read one star Goodreads reviews
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:21,311	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I make a lot of times there's
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:25,407	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Some missing of nuance to put it generously
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:28,735	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But also if you read a lot of 5-star Amazon reviews
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:30,527	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	There's a lot of missing of nuance
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:33,087	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Yeah you know sometimes I read reviews of
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:33,855	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Of my own book
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:36,159	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I love you like
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,695	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	We both know it's not that good
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:39,487	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Play
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:45,119	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I wish it were I wish it were the book that you're describing and I'm so grateful that like
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:51,519	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The book ended up in the hands of a reader so generous that they were able to make the book much better than the one I wrote
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,287	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:59,455	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I do feel like it kind of oversimplifies human experience and it also gives us this constant urge to review Ave
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:00,479	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Everything we do
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:03,039	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like now it's difficult to have a meal
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,831	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And not think about it in the
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:05,343	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The context
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:06,879	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Of
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,671	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	A recommend don't recommend
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:09,439	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Spectrum
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:11,743	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And I don't know that I did that
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:12,767	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Before the age
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:14,303	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Good night
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:17,375	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	So when I was talking to
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:22,751	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	My producer and editor on the show is news crispr Rubio is dude we were talking about which
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:26,079	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Stories to do highlight of the anthropocene reviewed
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:27,359	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I said
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,407	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I think I want to do to
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,967	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	NOK paintings in
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:32,991	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Taco Bell breakfast menu
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:35,039	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And pennies and Piggly Wiggly
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:36,319	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Coso4
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,111	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I was like no no no those are two
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:42,719	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	So is that how you view them
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:47,071	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Yeah I try to pair them in ways that make sense
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:47,839	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Tumi
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:53,215	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	So for instance when I was writing about the cave paintings at lascaux
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:58,335	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I wanted to also right about the Taco Bell breakfast menu in part because it seems
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:01,919	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	So different it seems like a huge contrast
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:03,711	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But also
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,223	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Because
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:07,295	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Really fascinated by the way that
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,319	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	People
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:09,855	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Try
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,623	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	2
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,903	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Make an impact
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:14,463	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	On the world or they try to leave
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:19,583	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	A trace of themselves and I was fascinated by the way that Glenn Bell
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:24,191	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The founder of Taco Bell tried to do that and by the way that the
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:27,263	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	People who were painting the cave paintings at lascaux tried
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:28,543	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To do that
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:32,895	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I'm especially curious about the combination of Hawaiian pizza and viral meningitis
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:35,967	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	What made you choose this
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:40,319	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Well some would argue that they're both forms of suffering
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,647	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I read the viral meningitis
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:46,207	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Essay before I wrote the Hawaiian pizza essay
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:49,023	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And at the end of the viral meningitis essay
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,559	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I was thinking about
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:51,583	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Pal
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,631	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	There are all these
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:59,519	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Phenomena in human life that are really resistant to language I think physical pain is the one that's
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:01,567	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Perhaps most dramatically resistant
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,079	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	2 language
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:04,639	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But for me there's also something about
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:06,431	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Taste that's resistant to language
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:07,711	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:11,295	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	One of the reasons we fight I think about Hawaiian pizza
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:12,063	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:15,903	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Because we almost cannot describe to each other how it taste
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,184	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To us
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:18,720	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And so
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:21,024	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I think some people say well Hawaiian pizza
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:22,560	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is amazing and your
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:29,216	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You know obviously wrong to hate it and then the people who hated are like no no no no no you don't understand
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:31,008	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	How'd it taste
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:31,776	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Tumi
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:35,872	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And indeed we don't is it between May one of my pet peeves with
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,920	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	No basis whatsoever so it's not like
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:40,992	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You know like I know I'm not necessarily right is I hate
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:44,320	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	When people use food words to describe other things
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:46,880	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like I hate it when somebody says that
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:49,952	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Prose is delicious or something like that
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:53,280	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	All kind of makes me want to die
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:58,400	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	So goes the other way too like you can't use food words for other things you can use them only for food and there's not enough of them
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:01,984	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Yeah well and even the food words that do exist
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,800	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I don't know what they mean to someone else
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:08,128	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like I don't really know what Sumptuous means
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:11,456	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Anyone who says that Hawaiian pizza is delicious
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:13,504	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	My definition of delicious
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:18,624	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Doesn't include Hawaiian pizza and so I'm already I'm already lost
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:22,208	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I have no way in and they can say oh it's a wonderful mix of
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,000	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Sweet and sour
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:27,072	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And I understand what sweet and sour taste like
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:29,120	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But that is not a wonderful mix of
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:36,032	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To me until it's that personalization of experience and then the urge to share experience like we we all deaths
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:36,544	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Desperately wanting
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,336	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Other people
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:40,896	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To hear us and to hear our stories
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:42,432	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Listen to know what our feelings feel like
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:43,456	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And they can't
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:47,296	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The temperature to show is literally everything on Earth
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,576	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Kind of centered around
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,112	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	When humans
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:51,136	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Orthodontist
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,160	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Species on Earth
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:52,672	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Yeah kinda
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,464	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,512	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	How do you then choose things to talk about
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:59,584	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I choose what to write about partly based
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,352	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	On
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,376	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Wisner suggestions
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:02,656	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,936	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Wizards can write in
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:09,056	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And a lot of times they have a really interesting ideas or ideas about why something is in
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:10,336	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Everything that I hadn't thought about
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:10,848	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	4
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:16,736	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The Taco Bell breakfast menu is actually an example of that I've never thought about the Taco Bell breakfast menu until somebody wrote
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:19,040	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To ask me to review it and then
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:22,112	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I was like this isn't that interesting and
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:28,256	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But then I fell way down the Glen Bell rabbit hole and ended up reading Glen Bells like self-published
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,304	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Commissioned biography
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:31,584	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,608	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	At the end of that I was
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,376	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Totally
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:35,424	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Fascinated by y Taco Bell
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:37,472	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Didn't have a breakfast menu for so long
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:39,520	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But I also have a running list
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,568	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Topics that
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:42,336	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,616	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Care about and I
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:46,432	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Interested in and that I think I have a way into
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:49,504	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Whether it's a story I want to tell about my life
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:50,272	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Or
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:52,320	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Just a story I find really fascinating
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:54,368	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like the cave paintings at lascaux
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:55,904	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I learned about those
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:58,208	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In my twenties
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:02,048	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And I just spent a lot of time thinking about them and reading about them
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:04,608	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And so I felt ready to write that
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:07,424	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I mean each of these reviews
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:11,008	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It becomes a small Memoir was that always your intention
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:15,360	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Initially my idea for the show
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,384	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Was that
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:17,664	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I was going to be
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:19,968	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Separate from the reviews
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:23,296	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I would be like an authority on everything
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:28,928	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I was going to be an authority on Canada geese and diet dr. pepper and cave painting
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:30,976	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And the Taco Bell breakfast menu
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:33,280	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And who I was didn't matter because I was
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:33,792	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The authority
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:37,376	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And my wife read the first couple of essays
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:38,656	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And she said
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:40,960	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You know I don't buy you
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:42,240	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	As
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:46,080	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Authoritative expert in the taste of dr. pepper
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:50,176	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I just don't think I don't think you're a chemical engineer I don't think
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:52,736	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That you're a professional taster
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:53,760	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:56,320	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I'm more interested in what your relationship is
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:59,904	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That's when it became more memory
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,184	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:04,768	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I do write about myself and I do write really personal things about myself
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:07,328	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But I'm very careful
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,352	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To protect
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:11,680	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The parts of me that I need to protect
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:12,704	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	If that makes sense
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:15,264	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Because I wasn't always careful
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,032	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	About that
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:17,568	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,848	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And now I feel like I have
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:23,712	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	When I was younger I wanted so badly
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,736	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To be
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:26,272	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	No no
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:29,088	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I think what I wanted was to have
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:29,856	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	People like me
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:34,208	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	For some reason I wanted especially for people who didn't know me well
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:35,232	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To like me
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:42,144	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And it just didn't seem like that was such an incredibly desirable outcome
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,168	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To have
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,704	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Strangers
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:45,728	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like you
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:50,080	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	When versions of that started to happen to me I almost immediately
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:51,872	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Recognized
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:52,384	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:53,920	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	What I
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:55,456	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Thought it would give me
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:26:00,064	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Was not what it was giving me because I never felt and I still don't feel
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,344	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Likes
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,880	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Strangers Like Me
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:04,160	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I feel like they
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,184	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:06,464	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	A
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:09,792	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Construction that is only tangentially related to me
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:13,120	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I'm obsessed with this thing Keanu Reeves said once
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:15,680	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	He said I love Keanu Reeves a lot
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:19,264	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Someday I might someday I might write it Keanu Reeves and
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:20,032	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	La piscine review
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:20,544	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Review
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:23,872	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That one time Keanu Reeves in an interview said
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:25,152	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I'm Mickey Mouse
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:27,968	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	They don't know who's inside the suit
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:29,248	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:32,320	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	When my work started to become more publicly known
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:34,112	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That's how I felt
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:36,416	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I didn't really feel like people like me I feel like they like Mickey Mouse
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,464	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I was inside the suit
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:42,816	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But I think the difference between Keanu Reeves in me is that Keanu Reeves
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,840	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Knew who he was
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:46,656	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	He knew who is inside of the suit but I kind of didn't
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:51,264	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Do you find it when you
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:53,568	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Because you listen to a lot of podcasts and I assume
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:55,104	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Before that or maybe
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:27:01,504	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Listen to a lot of public radio and stuff when you find like a little tidbit of personal knowledge like when Terry Gross Road
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:03,296	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Feels something to little about herself
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:06,624	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Does it fill you with delight the way it fills me with delight
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:13,792	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It does it does especially when Terry Gross does it
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:17,632	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Because I've been listening to Terry Gross for like 25 years so
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:19,424	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Winter growth
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:23,520	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Shares even the smallest detail about her life I am completely
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:26,848	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Oh I love it it's such a good feeling I just like I hope
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,616	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Oh
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,128	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Well that
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:31,712	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That's always what I think to myself
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:34,784	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Describe the piles of CDs on something like oh my God
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:38,112	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Chest hours navigating yes
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:40,672	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Now I could picture the entire home
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:41,696	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Are we one of these
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:43,744	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Learn about you overtime
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,024	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And when I think they
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:47,072	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Fun is
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:51,936	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And I don't know if I would anticipated this app from reading your books and
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:53,216	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Other things in from Blood Brothers
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,008	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But you love sports
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:28:02,176	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Or certain Sports I mean my growing-up experience was that the people who love sports were the people who
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:02,688	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Who hated me
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:08,832	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Ipf the same that these are not linked
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:12,416	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Traits that you've decoupled them for me in these ways that I found really
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,952	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Profound and so
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:16,000	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You talk about penalty shootouts work
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:16,768	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I know your
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:20,864	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Love of AFC Wimbledon and in an Indy 500
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:22,656	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Could afford me as a subject
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:24,192	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The fact that you love
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,728	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Indianapolis 500
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:28,288	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I think that you could assemble the parts
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:29,824	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Of your character
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:30,592	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:32,384	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I could construct a version of you
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:33,408	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That would hate the internet
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:34,432	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	500
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:39,808	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Well yeah and it passed me did hate the Indy 500 in Panda past me did hates
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:44,160	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Sports there's a lot of my first novel Looking for Alaska that something like I hate
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:45,696	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Sports and I hate people
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:46,976	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Two players
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:53,376	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Support or participate in any way in the sports industrial complex and that was taken right
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:55,936	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Get out of my high school self
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:29:01,568	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I I would watch people care about sports and I would just think to myself
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:02,592	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	This is
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:03,616	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Actually
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:05,152	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The dumbest thing
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:09,248	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That you can do with what Mary Oliver called your one Wild
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:11,552	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Precious life like this is the worst
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:13,088	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Possible
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:13,856	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Way
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:14,880	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	For you to use
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:15,648	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Use your resources
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:20,256	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I've heard anything in adulthood if not to judge anyone else
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:23,840	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	West you become them
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:32,544	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In the fullness of time you will become all of the people that you claim to revile
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:34,848	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I think what I love about
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:37,152	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Sports is actually the same thing I love about going to
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:38,432	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Church which is
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:39,456	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Not
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:44,064	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Much to do with the extensible topic at hand buttons
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:44,832	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Instead
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:47,648	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The pleasure and joy that comes from
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:52,000	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	A bunch of people who otherwise might not have a lot in common orienting
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,792	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	There's love in the same direction
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:56,864	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And I think there is a lot of value in that
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:57,888	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:01,728	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I think what I like about sports's is the community aspect of it
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:03,008	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which is
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:05,568	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Why I enjoy the Indy 500 so much
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,080	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Much because it's
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:07,104	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Huge
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:08,640	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Gathering
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:10,944	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	All kinds
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:12,736	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Of human being
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:14,784	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:18,112	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The sport to say that its secondary would be an over stay
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:19,392	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I mean there's no place
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:21,696	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In the Indianapolis 500
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:23,232	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Seating
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:29,632	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Where you can see all of the Indianapolis 500 so it can't possibly be about the sport because you live
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:30,912	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Literally can't see the sport
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,704	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	From inside the stadium
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:36,544	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It has to be about something else and I think what it's about is
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:39,872	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Tradition and shared experience
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:40,640	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And being
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:42,176	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In a community
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:45,248	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I think really like in the end sports are about being
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:46,272	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Sing together
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,576	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I found in my life and I
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:50,368	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I sent this in your life is that
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,392	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You spent
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:52,416	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	A good section
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:55,232	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Commune your life being defined by the things you hated
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:31:00,352	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And then you took a hard pivot enjoying being to find more by the things you loved
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:04,960	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Do you know why and how that happened in both you and I
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:06,752	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I do not
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,264	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	No
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:10,848	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	When I was a teenager
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:14,944	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	If you'd asked me to say like 10 things about myself
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:18,272	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I would have told you 10 things that I hate it
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:20,064	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I would have told you about
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:21,344	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	What I was supposed to
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:24,416	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I would have told you about what I thought was
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:28,512	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Stupid and embarrassing and ridiculous
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:31,072	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	About The Human Experience I would have told you like
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:34,400	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	How deeply I reviled the Spice Girls
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:35,936	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Who by the way
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:39,520	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Need good pop music
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:43,360	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I think I got fed up with it I got fed up with irony I got
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,640	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Fed up with sarcasm
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:48,480	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I got fed up with this urge to create distance between
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:50,016	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Myself and emotion
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:54,112	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I wanted to be cool and I thought that to be cool was to
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:54,880	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To be distant
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:56,928	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And then I stopped wanting to be cool
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:58,464	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Because
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:00,768	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To be cool this to be a form of cold
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:05,376	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And I don't want to be distant from emotional experience
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:08,448	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I think the risk of that is that it
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:11,520	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	They make you into a sentimentalist it may make you
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:14,336	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Intuit some sort of like cheesy
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:16,384	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Version of yourself
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:18,944	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	For me if that's the cost
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:21,760	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Having
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:23,552	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Tyrannize

EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:26,368	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It's worth
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:26,880	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The cost
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:30,720	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It took me a long time to like be okay with
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:32,768	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That urge
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,048	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Within Me
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:35,840	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I just think that
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:37,632	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Ironic
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:38,656	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Detachment
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:39,168	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:40,704	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The single most
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:41,984	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Overrated

EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:54,528	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And I like to be able to ask big questions without
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:56,320	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Creating a lot of distance
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:57,600	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It's between myself and the question
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:04,512	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	If you were to review other things near life the science Sports in the Spice Girls what are some of the things that

EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:19,104	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which was

EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:28,576	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Love being married
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:32,928	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That guy was crazy I really really
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:35,232	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Really love being married
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:38,816	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I think the institution of marriage has gotten a lot better since I was
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:40,864	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It's gotten a lot more inclusive

EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:42,912	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Gone
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:45,472	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	All the way to where it needs to be throughout the world but
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:46,240	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I think that's one

EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:53,152	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Pop music I was very dismissive of pop music when I was younger and
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:58,528	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Now I listen to a lot of pop songs like you know that song Old Town Road by Lil Nas X
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:02,880	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It's been mentioned a few times but I actually haven't heard it but I I've heard good things
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:07,744	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I genuinely recommend that you listen to it it's a good song is it good enough
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:14,144	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Tab my kids play at 40 or 50 times a day everyday no but it's very good I've also gone

EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:22,080	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like mystery novels romance novels
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:23,616	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I love a good romance
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:25,920	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I used to think that
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:30,272	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	If they all end the same way and they're so cheesy and they're just wish fulfilling

EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:35,392	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Shut up like what's wrong with wish fulfillment
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:38,976	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like what when did we become opposed to fulfilling wishes

EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:50,496	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	If anything I got I probably know too critical of my high school self because that means it like in the next 10
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:55,360	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	10 years I'm going to become my high school self again so that the so that I have to like cease being critical toward him
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:59,456	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The thing about my high school self and I don't know if you were like this
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,480	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	This is that I was very
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:01,760	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Dismissive
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:05,344	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Pop culture looks like large swath

EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:28,128	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I wrote a paper that I still have
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:31,968	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In which I called The Great Gatsby a bunch of Rich Yankees with Yankee

EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,624	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like the lack of understanding
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:41,184	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In that characterization of The Great Gatsby
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:44,000	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is a reminder that like
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:47,840	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	One-star Goodreads reviews are not necessarily
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:50,400	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Reflective of the quality of a
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:56,288	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Also like I'm so glad that my high school self did not have access to

EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:02,176	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	If he had like I would still be living with that and people would be like
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:04,224	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Yeah this guy hates The Great Gatsby
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,784	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And thank you
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:08,832	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Making me born in nineteen
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:13,184	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	When you see
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:17,792	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The things you make interacting with the world and the image I have in my mind is

EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:25,984	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	What are the moment of delight for me
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:30,080	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But when you see your things that you make
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:33,152	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Interacting with the culture of the world how does it make you feel
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,968	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	When it's things like
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:38,784	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Ant Man reading the Fault in Our Stars
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:39,552	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It's
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:42,368	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Just like a wonderful delightful unexpected MoMA
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:43,648	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:45,952	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That one in particular was fun because I was
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:46,976	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	With my son
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:48,000	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In the movie theater
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:53,376	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And he likes it out loud add that's your book and I was like I don't know
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:57,216	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Did you know that was going to happen and I was like no how could I have known as.
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:59,520	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You know called me to clear it
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:03,872	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I would have thought they called you to clear it actually
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:05,152	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	They didn't
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:07,200	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Or at least if they did they didn't call me that
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:10,272	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But to be honest it can get
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:11,296	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Overwhelming
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:13,600	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I can get a little like
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:15,136	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Scary somehow
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:16,928	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Yeah I don't know how
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:17,440	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	How to say it
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:20,768	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Scary remember right when the Fault in Our Stars movie
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:21,536	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Timeout
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:22,048	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Because it was
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:24,352	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	For a few weeks like fairly
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:25,888	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Close to the center of
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:27,424	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Us pop culture
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:30,752	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like a people were saying things about it that I thought were really
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:32,288	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Kind of unfair
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:34,592	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In the way that we always
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:35,360	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Are judging
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:36,640	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Popular
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:38,176	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Cultural
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:38,944	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Phenomena
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:45,600	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I've always felt like if something becomes very popular there must be something at least a little bit wrong with it
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:47,392	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It was weird and uncomfortable
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:48,672	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To be in that position
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:52,256	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But also things like having like a Saturday Night Live sketch or something made out of
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:53,280	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	If your works at
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:55,072	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Paradies your work I get away it
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:56,352	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It's fine and
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:58,656	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I thought the sketch that they made was very funny
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:37:59,168	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:03,776	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Yeah it was hard just not to feel really like kind of overwhelmed by it in a little like
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:05,568	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Almost an urge to shut down
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:06,336	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You know I don't think it's
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:08,896	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It's a coincidence that I didn't write a novel for like 6 years
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:09,664	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	After that book came out
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:13,504	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I've been interviewed on TV. Only a couple of times a handful of times
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:16,832	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And I've never seen any of them I just can't
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:17,856	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I don't want to know
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:20,672	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I don't want to know if I felt bad about it I don't want to know
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:26,816	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I just want to know it's hard now I mean you know obviously these are like
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:28,608	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Incredibly
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:29,888	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Rarefied
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:32,192	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Problems that I am extremely grateful to have
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:36,288	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You know like I definitely had a moment there where I could have chosen
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:37,568	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	A path
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:39,104	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That I didn't
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:39,872	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Choose
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:45,760	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like we could have moved to LA and or New York and and gotten lots of work and there were lots of opportunities in
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:47,040	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	What I
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,832	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Kind of chose to do was to
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:54,464	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Come back here to Indianapolis IN to work on making crash course our educational video series better and
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:55,744	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Winter work on
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:57,792	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The stuff that I wanted to work on
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:39:01,632	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That was supposed to lower profile but also that I had more
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:02,912	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Control over
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:05,984	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Cuz I think part of what was so disorienting about that experience
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:06,496	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Aunt was
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:09,056	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Losing some control over
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:10,592	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Both my work
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:11,872	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And on some level over
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:13,152	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Myself
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:15,968	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Service like the way that myself was being portrayed in a magic
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:17,760	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I'm really like
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:23,136	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Interested in you deciding Tesoro pull back and do crash course and stuff instead of doing punch up on
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:27,232	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Some scripture something you know it's not because
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:28,256	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Uibe
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:32,352	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The stain for those things it's just that no not at all know it's kind of like

EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:44,544	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Because like the joke
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:49,408	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is that mobs are stupid and they just go where the light is on
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:54,784	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But the other thing about the joke is that
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:56,320	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Almost all the time
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:41:00,416	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Humans also just go where the lights on
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:02,976	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And so
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:04,768	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I really love
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:11,936	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Moments where humans don't go where the light is on and I really try and my own life thinking hard about
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:16,288	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You know am I doing this because I want to do it or am I doing this because the light is on
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:22,176	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	So how would you rate our conversation on a 5-star scale
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:23,712	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I mean from my side
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:27,040	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	4 and a half stars but I'm more worried about how you would rate it now I'm nervous
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:29,344	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I could be getting in the moment but
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:30,624	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I'm thinking Solid 5 stars
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:32,416	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I don't mean to be
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:34,976	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	What are those Amazon reviews that you're skeptical of fight
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:36,256	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Wheel of Life
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:36,768	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It's been great.
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:52,895	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	After the break John Green reviews the Piggly Wiggly
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:57,503	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And he just lays into the penny honestly is the angriest I've ever heard him
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:59,295	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	More anthropocene reviewed
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:41:59,807	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	After this
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:11,839	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Here again is the anthropocene reviewed
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:13,119	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	99 percent invisible
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:16,703	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Hello and welcome to the anthropocene reviewed
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:19,007	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The podcast where we review different facets
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:21,311	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It's a human centered planet on a five-star scale
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:24,895	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	My name is John Green and today I'll be reviewing pennies
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:27,967	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Distensible form of currency here in the United States
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:30,527	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And the grocery store chain Piggly Wiggly
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:41,279	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Let's begin with the American penny
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:46,655	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which is worth 1/100 of the US dollar and is almost as old as the nation itself
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:49,983	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The first US penny was minted in 1793
EDL	00:42:50,495	00:42:52,031	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It was made of copper
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:53,055	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Wait about half an ounce
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:56,639	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And with the size of a contemporary $1 coin
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:43:00,223	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which come to think of it is a useless comparison
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:05,343	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Since nobody uses one dollar coins even though their adoption would save the United States hundred
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:07,135	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Millions of dollars per year
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:10,463	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But we're not here to review the two star $1 bill
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:11,743	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	We're here to review the penny
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:15,583	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which since 1909 has featured the profiled face
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:17,631	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Have US President Abraham Lincoln
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:22,239	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The penny was actually the first US money to be stamped with a president's face
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:28,383	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Many of the u.s. is Founders including George Washington felt it would be to Monarca Colton
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:29,919	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Coins featuring us leaders
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:36,831	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In fact the u.s. mint Act of 1792 explicitly stated that one side of copper coins
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:38,111	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Should State the denomination
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:40,415	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And the other side should have a quote
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:42,463	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Impression emblematic of Liberty
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:48,095	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Today's pennies weigh about a fifth of what the eighteenth-century ones did
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:50,655	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And while they're still coated in Copper
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:53,215	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Pennies are now over 97% zinc
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:54,751	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which is cheaper than
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:55,263	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	10 copper
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:57,055	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But even so
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:59,871	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Every $0.01 coin minted in the United States
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:03,455	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Cost 1.82 cents to create
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:06,527	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Last year the US Mint lost
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:09,087	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	69 million dollars
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:09,855	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Minting pennies
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:12,927	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That would be annoying but forgivable
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:15,231	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is penne served a purpose in our economy
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:15,999	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But they don't
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:20,863	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Money is supposed to facilitate the exchange of goods and services which
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:22,399	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Penny's manifestly
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:23,679	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Failed to do
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:27,007	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You can't use them in vending machines are parking meters
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:32,383	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And if you attempt to use them to purchase goods or services you will often be met with resistance
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:37,759	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And for good reason I mean it requires over 2 lb of pennies around a kilogram
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:40,063	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To purchase a single gallon of gasoline
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:41,855	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And yet every year
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:46,207	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The US Mint makes more pennies than all other coins combined
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:49,279	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Not because we use them so often to buy thing
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:51,327	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But because we don't use
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:57,215	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	We store them in jars or leave them in the terrifying Netherworld of our cars
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:57,983	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Center console
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:00,543	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And we throw them away by the million
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:02,335	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Because panties
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:04,127	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Do not work as
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:04,639	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Currency
EDL	00:45:05,151	00:45:10,015	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	There are many arguments in favor of the continued production of the penny
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:12,063	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I just don't find any of them convincing
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:16,927	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Some argue for instance that in a penniless World prices might go up
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:19,999	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And that those price increases would disproportionately affect
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:22,047	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The poor who are more likely to use
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:23,071	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Cash in transaction
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:27,423	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But in fact eliminating the penny would not increase prices
EDL	00:45:27,935	00:45:33,311	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	We know this because many nations have already retired their Penny equivalent without any problem
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:35,359	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	From the Netherlands to New Zealand
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:39,967	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	We would simply begin rounding prices to the nearest tenth of a dollar
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:41,759	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Instead of the nearest hundredth of a dollar
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:46,367	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Assuming we had the common sense to also eliminate are $0.05 coins
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:47,135	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Each of which cost
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:48,415	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Point to send
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:48,927	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Instrument
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:53,279	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	If anything this system would benefit those who use cash
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:55,839	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Because they would spend the same amount of money
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:45:56,863	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But no longer have
EDL	00:45:56,863	00:45:57,631	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To deal with pennies
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:46:00,703	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which are so easy to receive as change
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:02,495	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And so difficult
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:03,007	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To spend
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:09,407	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	People often resort to cashing out their small denomination coins by a coin counting machines like Coinstar
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:12,223	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which charge an astonishing 12
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:13,247	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Percent fee
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:16,063	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	For the privilege of turning your pennies and nickels
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:18,367	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In the money you can actually spend
EDL	00:46:19,647	00:46:20,415	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Other defense
EDL	00:46:20,415	00:46:25,023	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Size of the penny that it honors Lincoln or that it's somehow limits inflation
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:26,047	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Are just absurd
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:32,191	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	None of the countries that have eliminated one cent coins have seen a corresponding rise in inflation
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:38,591	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And why would Abraham Lincoln want to be the face of a coin that is worth -69 million
EDL	00:46:38,591	00:46:39,359	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Dollars per year
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:41,407	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The whole thing is ridiculous
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:43,967	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But then again
EDL	00:46:43,967	00:46:48,319	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Righteous indignation at the ongoing existence of the penny
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:49,343	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is also
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:56,255	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	69 million dollars represents a tiny fraction of the US federal budget
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:47:00,607	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like we spend about 68 million dollars on the military
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:01,375	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Per hour
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:04,703	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	We have much bigger problems than the penny
EDL	00:47:04,703	00:47:10,335	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The United States is one of the only Nations that have seen life expectancy decline in the past 2 years
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:13,663	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Despite the fact that we spend more on Healthcare than any other country
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:19,295	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Are massive economic inequality is inhibiting economic growth and limiting opportunity
EDL	00:47:19,807	00:47:20,831	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Our political system
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:24,159	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Atoms are far too profoundly influenced by moneyed interests
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:26,207	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And eliminating the penny
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:27,487	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Will fix none of them
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:31,327	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But our failure to bid farewell to the penny
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:34,911	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Seems to me indicative of a larger political fail
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:37,471	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	We cannot accomplish

EDL	00:47:59,999	00:48:02,303	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In part because it's not very important
EDL	00:48:02,815	00:48:05,119	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And in part because it's not very device

EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:32,255	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The United States was only a few years away from a civil war

EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:21,151	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is the house divided against itself with learning but it could not stand
EDL	00:49:21,919	00:49:23,711	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The United States Congress passed

EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:34,463	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To be worth minting
EDL	00:49:35,231	00:49:36,255	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	At the time
EDL	00:49:36,255	00:49:38,815	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The halfpenny was worth about $0.12
EDL	00:49:38,815	00:49:39,583	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In today's money
EDL	00:49:40,863	00:49:42,911	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Tumi the ongoing existence of
EDL	00:49:42,911	00:49:45,727	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The penny symbolizes not only our inability
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:47,007	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Need to find common ground
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:52,639	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But also our inability to acknowledge the places where Common Ground already
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:53,151	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Exists
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:54,687	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In fact
EDL	00:49:54,687	00:49:58,271	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I think the only vaguely convincing case one can make for the penny
EDL	00:49:58,783	00:50:00,319	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is that as a nation
EDL	00:50:00,319	00:50:01,087	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	We all share it
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:03,135	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	No matter where you're from

EDL	00:50:09,023	00:50:10,303	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	We can all agree
EDL	00:50:10,303	00:50:12,863	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That the continued minting of the American penny
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:15,423	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is an absolute abomination
EDL	00:50:16,447	00:50:19,007	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Maybe it's worth 69 million dollars a year
EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:21,567	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To have something that we can all dislike together
EDL	00:50:22,079	00:50:25,151	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And anywhere there is something kind of American
EDL	00:50:25,151	00:50:26,943	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	About putting our best president

EDL	00:50:28,735	00:50:30,271	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	I give the penny 1 and 1/2 Stars
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:41,023	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In 1920
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:44,607	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	My maternal grandmother's father was working at a grocery store
EDL	00:50:44,607	00:50:46,655	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In a Tiny Town in Western Tennessee
EDL	00:50:47,423	00:50:48,959	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like all us grocery stores
EDL	00:50:48,959	00:50:50,239	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is the beginning of the 20th century
EDL	00:50:50,751	00:50:51,775	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	This one was full service
EDL	00:50:52,543	00:50:54,847	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You walked in with a list of items you needed
EDL	00:50:55,359	00:50:56,639	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And then the grocer
EDL	00:50:56,639	00:50:58,175	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Perhaps my great-grandfather
EDL	00:50:58,687	00:50:59,455	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	We Gather those eyes
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:04,319	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Midway to flour or cornmeal or butter or tomatoes
EDL	00:51:04,319	00:51:06,111	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Wrap everything up for you
EDL	00:51:06,111	00:51:07,647	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And then charge it to your account
EDL	00:51:08,159	00:51:11,743	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	You'd rather wait for the clerk to finish your shopping for you
EDL	00:51:11,743	00:51:15,583	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Or for a small fee you'd have your order delivered to your house later in the day
EDL	00:51:16,351	00:51:17,887	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Like almost all grocery stores
EDL	00:51:17,887	00:51:21,215	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The time my great-grandfather store also allowed customers
EDL	00:51:21,215	00:51:22,495	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	To purchase food on credit
EDL	00:51:23,263	00:51:24,543	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which the customer would then
EDL	00:51:24,543	00:51:25,311	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Usually
EDL	00:51:25,311	00:51:26,079	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Payback over
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:26,591	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	4 time
EDL	00:51:27,615	00:51:30,431	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	That's where it was supposed to be my great-grandfather's ticket out of
EDL	00:51:30,431	00:51:31,199	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Poverty
EDL	00:51:31,199	00:51:32,735	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But it didn't work out that way
EDL	00:51:33,503	00:51:35,039	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Instead the store closed
EDL	00:51:35,551	00:51:40,415	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Thanks in part to the self-service grocery Revolution launched by Clarence Saunders

EDL	00:51:44,767	00:51:47,071	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Eventually found his way to the grocery business
EDL	00:51:47,071	00:51:48,095	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In Memphis Tennessee
EDL	00:51:49,119	00:51:52,959	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	He was 35 when he developed the concept for a grocery store
EDL	00:51:52,959	00:51:54,751	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It would have no clerks or counters
EDL	00:51:55,263	00:51:57,055	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But instead of Labyrinth of Isles
EDL	00:51:57,567	00:51:59,103	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The customers would walk themselves
EDL	00:51:59,871	00:52:01,151	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Choosing their own food
EDL	00:52:01,663	00:52:03,455	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And placing it in their own shopping.
EDL	00:52:05,247	00:52:11,647	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Prices at Saunders self-service grocery would be lower because his stores would employ fewer clerks and also because
EDL	00:52:11,647	00:52:13,439	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Is he wouldn't offer customers credit
EDL	00:52:13,439	00:52:14,463	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But instead
EDL	00:52:14,463	00:52:15,487	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Expect immediate payment
EDL	00:52:16,255	00:52:18,815	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The prices would also be clear and transparent
EDL	00:52:19,327	00:52:23,423	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	For the first time every item in a grocery store would be marked with a price
EDL	00:52:23,935	00:52:26,751	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	So customers would no longer fear being overcharged
EDL	00:52:26,751	00:52:27,775	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	By unscrupulous
EDL	00:52:27,775	00:52:28,287	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	What's Grocers
EDL	00:52:29,055	00:52:30,847	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Sandra's called his grocery store
EDL	00:52:31,359	00:52:32,127	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Piggly Wiggly
EDL	00:52:33,663	00:52:34,687	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Why
EDL	00:52:34,687	00:52:36,223	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Nobody knows
EDL	00:52:36,223	00:52:38,015	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	When asked where the name came from
EDL	00:52:38,015	00:52:39,807	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Saunders once answered that it arrived
EDL	00:52:40,319	00:52:42,367	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	From out of chaos and indirect
EDL	00:52:42,367	00:52:44,415	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Contact with an individual's mind
EDL	00:52:44,927	00:52:47,231	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which gives you a sense of the kind of guy he was
EDL	00:52:47,999	00:52:52,351	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But usually when he was asked why anyone would call a grocery store Piggly Wiggly
EDL	00:52:52,863	00:52:53,631	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	He would answer
EDL	00:52:54,143	00:52:55,935	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	So people will ask that very question
EDL	00:52:57,215	00:53:00,799	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The first Piggly Wiggly opened in Memphis in 1916
EDL	00:53:00,799	00:53:04,639	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It was so successful that the second Piggly Wiggly opened
EDL	00:53:04,639	00:53:05,919	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	3 weeks later

EDL	00:54:27,327	00:54:28,607	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which meant there was more to eat

EDL	00:54:47,295	00:54:50,623	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Brand recognition also became extremely important
EDL	00:54:50,623	00:54:53,695	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Because food companies had to appeal directly to Shoppers
EDL	00:54:54,207	00:54:59,583	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Which way to the growth of consumer-oriented food advertising on radio and the newspapers
EDL	00:55:00,095	00:55:03,679	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	A phenomenon that Saunders understood better than almost anyone
EDL	00:55:04,191	00:55:06,751	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	During the late nineteen teens and early twenties

EDL	00:55:15,199	00:55:18,271	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Also meant that many people lost their jobs
EDL	00:55:18,783	00:55:20,319	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Including my great-grandfather

EDL	00:55:29,791	00:55:34,911	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Saunders imagined a woman torn between her longtime relationship with her friendly grocer
EDL	00:55:35,423	00:55:37,727	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And the world will prices of Piggly Wiggly
EDL	00:55:38,751	00:55:43,615	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	The story concluded with Saunders appealing to a tradition even older than the full service

EDL	00:56:03,583	00:56:05,119	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And converted to Piggly Wiggly
EDL	00:56:06,143	00:56:11,007	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	By 1922 there were over a thousand Piggly Wiggly stores around the u.s.
EDL	00:56:11,007	00:56:13,823	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And shares in the company were listed on the New York Stock

EDL	00:56:23,551	00:56:25,087	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But the good times would not last
EDL	00:56:25,855	00:56:28,671	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	After a few Piggly Wiggly stores in the Northeast failed
EDL	00:56:29,183	00:56:30,975	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Investors began shorting the stock

EDL	00:56:34,047	00:56:38,655	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Saunders responded by trying to buy up all the available shares of Piggly Wiggly
EDL	00:56:38,655	00:56:39,679	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Using borrowed money
EDL	00:56:40,191	00:56:42,239	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But the Gambit failed spectacularly
EDL	00:56:42,751	00:56:44,287	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And Saunders lost control
EDL	00:56:44,287	00:56:45,311	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Piggly Wiggly
EDL	00:56:45,311	00:56:46,079	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And went bankrupt

EDL	00:57:05,535	00:57:07,583	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	After losing control of the company he wrote

EDL	00:57:12,959	00:57:15,519	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But they didn't get the man that was father to the idea
EDL	00:57:16,543	00:57:18,335	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	They have the body of Piggly Wiggly
EDL	00:57:19,103	00:57:19,871	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But they didn't get

EDL	00:57:31,135	00:57:33,183	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Basically a contemporary supermarket
EDL	00:57:33,951	00:57:35,999	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In under a year he was ready to open
EDL	00:57:36,511	00:57:39,071	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But the new owners of Piggly Wiggly took him to court

EDL	00:57:49,311	00:57:50,079	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	In response

EDL	00:57:57,759	00:58:01,087	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Perhaps the only business name worse than Piggly Wiggly

EDL	00:58:03,135	00:58:05,439	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	It succeeded tremendously
EDL	00:58:05,439	00:58:09,791	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And Saunders made a second Fortune as sole owner stores

EDL	00:58:23,871	00:58:26,687	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And the Chicago Bears in front of huge crowds in Memphis
EDL	00:58:27,199	00:58:29,247	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	And they were invited to join the NFL
EDL	00:58:30,527	00:58:32,063	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	But Saunders declined
EDL	00:58:32,063	00:58:33,855	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Because you didn't want to share Revenue
EDL	00:58:33,855	00:58:35,391	| 01_358_The_Anthropocene_Reviewed_pt01 |	Or send his team to away game
