EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:56,288	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And the stadiums themselves were these massive concrete cylinders

EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:05,248	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	From Pittsburgh to Atlanta to Milwaukee everyone had this big round Hawking concur

EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:08,576	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	It generally house both

EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:12,416	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	But these multi-purpose Stadium

EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:26,239	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	They were perfectly round to fit both a football field and a baseball diamond
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:30,335	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	But that meant that the seats were often really far away from the action or
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,127	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Tangled in weird directions
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:36,223	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	So it ended up being a shape that accommodated everything but
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:37,503	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Serve nothing well
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:41,855	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And the multi-purpose stadiums were just way too big
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,367	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	For baseball

EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:49,023	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	But these had 50000 or more
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:51,071	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Is that 8 interested in work

EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:58,495	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	So the stadiums often felt empty

EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:40,223	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	A long agonizing frustrating 2 and 1/2 months of waiting and wondering

EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:34,495	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	The Yankees in Yankee Stadium the Cubs said Wrigley Field in your Red Sox in in Fenway Park
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:41,407	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And what did they have in common they all played in a baseball only facility of facility that was the
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:42,687	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Sign for baseball
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:44,479	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And it did not
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:47,551	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Compromise architecture late for other sports
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:50,623	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Do stadiums actually have another thing in common
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	They were really old
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,951	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Some of the last
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:57,535	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Holdouts from the pre-war era of urban ballpark base
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:01,631	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And unlike the concrete Donuts the ballparks built back then
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:03,423	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Had all these architectural quora

EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:12,895	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	They're all a little bit of a different flavor of ice cream
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:15,455	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Always thought that something was lost
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:16,735	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	When baseball moved
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,527	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	From those kinds of
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,039	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Facilities
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,319	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	2
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:22,367	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Generic multi-purpose
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:23,903	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Stadiums in the 60s
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,671	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	7 days
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:27,999	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Makena wanted to break out of the multi-purpose paradigm
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:30,559	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And build a new kind of baseball only Stadium
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,095	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	One that felt
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:35,935	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	An old-fashioned traditional baseball park
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:40,287	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	With modern amenities if we use that phrase once we use the
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,823	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	10000 *
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:42,591	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	In fact
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:47,967	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Luciano became so zealous in his commitment to building a old-fashioned ballpark
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:50,015	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Betty band Orioles
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:52,063	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Employees from even using the words
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:57,183	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Stadium indeed we find people $5 if they use the S word Stadium
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:59,999	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Instead of referring to our project as a ballpark
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:03,327	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Stadium connotes something very different in terms of
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:08,703	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	A size in Monument tality did you collect on those fines
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:13,311	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Yeah we did collect a little party and I don't remember how much we got but it wasn't insubstantial
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	The Orioles struck a deal with the Maryland s word authority to build a new baseball only ballpark in
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Using mostly public money
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:26,879	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	City and state government saw it as part of an effort to revitalize downtown
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:30,719	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	The stadium Authority higher the Architecture Firm hok
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:34,815	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And the Orioles brought in their own design director Janet Marie Smith
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:37,375	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	My assignment was really tough
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:43,263	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Take those words that he used over and over again of an old-fashioned ballpark with modern amenities
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,591	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And try and make certain that we were really being
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,103	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	True that
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:49,407	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	It wasn't an easy task
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:52,735	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	I no one else had moved into a center city and said
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:55,551	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	We want to be a part of that tapestry
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Bengali Maybe
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:57,599	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	70 years
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:01,183	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	How are we going to create something that feels
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:03,231	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Like it's woven into the
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,767	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	The city of Baltimore I like it
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,047	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	It's always belonged
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:11,423	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Janet Marie Smith turns the ballparks from the early 1900's for inspiration
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:14,239	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	What made those older ballpark special
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:17,311	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Is it they were kind of wedged into a very
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,847	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Tight Urban environment
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,383	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And by wedged
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:24,479	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	She means that the urban environment actually dictated the shape of the field
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,783	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Each ballpark had different dimension
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:29,599	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Depending on the plot of land on which it
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,367	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	It was built
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:32,415	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	We can only really happen in baseball
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:35,231	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	With most sports the dimensions of the playing field
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:35,999	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Totally standardized
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:37,279	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	But not basic
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:43,167	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	The Roosevelt and feel they've got to be in our you got have 90 feet between the bases 60 feet 6 in
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,191	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	From home plate to the
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:47,519	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Pictures ma'am but there's no rule about the out
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:51,871	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And so a lot of the early American ballparks were totally a cement
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,919	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Ebbets Field built
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,711	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	In a Brooklyn neighborhood called pigtown
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Had a wildly irregular shape
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:02,367	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	The left field foul pole was over 50 ft further from home plate
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,135	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And the right-field foul
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:07,743	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	That variety means that some ballparks are better for pictures others are better
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:08,511	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Cheddar's
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:12,095	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Some ballparks give up more home runs to right-handed batters others
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:12,863	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Lefty's
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:13,631	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	So the
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,655	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	The Park at
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,423	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Self
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,703	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Really does shape
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,727	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	The outcome of the game
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:21,311	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Larry lucchino wanted in a regular playing fee
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,847	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Feel like those old-time ballpark
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:27,455	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	But he felt that the shape needed to respond to the built environment around
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:32,575	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	A site to make sure that just ballpark was integrated into its Sun neighborhood
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:36,415	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	It didn't feel like I'm flying saucer that descended and just
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:39,231	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Landed in the neighborhood
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:44,863	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	The Inner Harbor site where Camden Yards would be built had one distinct architectural feature
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,143	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	The B&O Warehouse
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:50,239	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Extremely long brick building built at the turn of the 20th century
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:52,031	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	It was abandoned
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,055	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	At the time end
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:56,127	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	A lot of people thought that the Orioles should just tear it down
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:58,175	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	To give themselves more room to build on
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,455	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	An opening up of YouTube
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:03,295	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	The water one sports editor wrote that it was a
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:06,367	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	An empty rat-infested firetrap
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,671	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And it should be done away with
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:11,487	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	But Janet Marie Smith didn't want to do that
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:17,119	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	We felt strongly that tearing down the very context that might give form
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:21,983	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	To an asymmetrical playing field and asymmetrical seating Bowl
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,519	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Was running
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:27,359	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Against the grain of what Larry wanted so they left the warehouse
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,663	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	We would eventually sit just beyond right field
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:32,223	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And design the shape of the playing field around it
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,527	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	In fact lukino says
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:40,671	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	The decision to preserve the warehouse really dictated nearly every other design decision that went into Canada
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,463	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	From the shape
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,231	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	The Stan's
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:45,791	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Down to the materials that they used in construction
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:50,143	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	It gave us a set of brick Motif that we use de in the
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:50,655	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Ballpark
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:53,983	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And it gave us the iconic symbol
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:12:00,127	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	All this small park for Baltimore and it looked a lot like Baltimore and felt a lot like Baltimore
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:06,015	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	If you go to Camden Yards today it's almost hard to tell where the stadium ends and the warehouse begins
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:09,087	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Larry luchino and Janet Marie Smith
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,879	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	We're both at Camden Yards on Oak
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:18,303	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	I could tell you that we were all anxious she no hair standing on her back like what if it's what it is you know what if it doesn't work
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:21,887	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	We know any number of things that ran counter
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:22,911	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	To the norm
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,191	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:24,703	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Sports
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:26,751	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Stadium design
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:30,335	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	That could have gone wrong and any number of things that were normal
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:34,175	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	That could have just gone wrong he know the toilets not flushing I don't know pick anything
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,711	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	But nothing went wrong
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,247	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Ticket sold out
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,015	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	Toilets

EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:51,903	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And just like Camden Yards most of these new stadiums have been built close to City centers
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,183	| 99pi-0262-inthesameballpark-1 |	And all but one of them
