EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,551	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And that there should be something better than that

EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:54,911	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And he realized
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,727	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	If you had a mass grave with
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,519	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	2000 people in it
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:03,103	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Then it's a mass grave with two thousand people in it

EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:12,831	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	More human
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,647	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	After the war
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:19,487	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Wilson advocated for a grave during the body of a single soldier
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:22,303	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	To bring the impossibly large tragedy
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,583	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Down to a human scale
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:30,495	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Soldiers anonymity without each person who came to the Grave to project whatever it was most important to them onto the mystery

EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:49,183	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Sure enough when Britain dedicated the grave of an unknown warrior in Westminster Abbey in 1920
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:51,743	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It was an overnight success

EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,743	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	There were lots of unknowns to choose from
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,047	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	At least at first

EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:36,191	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	There were something like a thousand 648

EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:55,295	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	He was actually very good at anything that he did

EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:12,191	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But then he received an appointment to the Air Force
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:15,263	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And he fell in love with flying at the Academy
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:20,639	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Flight school Michael was assigned to fly a ground attack aircraft known as the a37

EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,807	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I would love it

EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:42,655	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But I don't remember Michael
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,679	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Ever
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:46,751	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Saying anything about being afraid of it
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,543	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And so once he graduated
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:50,591	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It was off
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,103	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	2
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:58,015	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Pilot training that it from there it was off to survival training and from there it was off to be

EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,575	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And I remember
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:03,647	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Seen him get on the aircraft
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:05,183	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Is St Louis
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:10,559	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And I remember him looking back and waving to us with that beautiful smile
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,607	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And and and
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:16,447	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I just remember thinking it all over him again
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,751	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I think we all did
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:23,615	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	By 1972 and Michael blassie was
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:28,223	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	America's military presence in Southeast Asia with shrinking rapidly
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:32,575	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	There are fewer than 25000 US servicemen left in Vietnam
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:36,927	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	As opposed to over 500000 who have been deployed by the late 1960s
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:43,327	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The war was in effect winding down but it was still dangerous and they were still out of combat going on
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,095	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	This is biltong
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:47,423	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	He's a reporter who wrote about Michael blassie for the Washington Post
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:51,519	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	He says that the American servicemen remain behind were stretched thin
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,799	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	How to do a lot with a little
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:55,615	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	That Michael was going to see a lot of combo
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:11:00,223	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	He arrived in Vietnam in January of 72
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,783	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And by May of 1972
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:05,855	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	He had flown something like 130 missions
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:08,671	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	So he's been virtually almost every day
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:13,023	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	He had at least one combat sometimes to combat missions
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:17,119	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	G37 that Michael flu had a good record up to that point Vietnam
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,911	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	If you'd gotten hit
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,191	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	When they were hit
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,983	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Things could get ugly fast
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,287	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Because it could take all kinds of
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:24,799	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Fire
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:27,103	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I mean you're flying 408
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:28,639	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	In the air and you get hit
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,943	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Deductible parachute out of the plane
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,735	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	So that made it very dangerous
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:36,575	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Michael would always take off and land from a protected Airbase near Saigon
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:40,159	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Ignition Saturn flying over a lot of dangerous places
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:43,999	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	In the most dangerous was arguably a town in South Vietnam
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,023	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Called and lock
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:50,399	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	In 1972 hanlock was occupied by the South Vietnamese military
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:52,447	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Along with a handful of American advisors
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:59,359	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But it was under siege by an invading North Vietnamese Army
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:05,759	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Very very long time it went on for months and I encountered of guy who it was in and lock
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:06,783	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Chris Calhoun
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:09,855	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And she described it was like a scene out of Apocalypse Now
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:12,159	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The city of van laack was
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:14,719	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Totally leveled it look like Hiroshima
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:16,511	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	This is Chris Calhoun
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:20,351	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Eustachian to unlock an Army Ranger during the majority of the siege
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:24,959	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Often resorted to analogies as a way of explaining just how awful it was there
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:29,311	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	One point he described with their meager medical support
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:31,871	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	As looking like something out of the Civil War
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:35,455	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Unlock was completely cut off from the rest of the world
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:37,247	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	We got food and ammunition by
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,807	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Parachute drop everyday
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:41,855	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	We were under constant shellfire
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,647	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Chris's Beauty
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,183	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	List of all this chaos
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,207	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Call in airstrike
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:50,047	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It was Michael blassie Squadron that was providing the air support
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:54,143	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They were flying bombing runs over and lock nearly every day
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:57,215	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Michael and Chris never actually spoke one-on-one
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,263	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The time there didn't quite overlap
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:03,359	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Chris did get snow a lot of Michael Squadron mates really well
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:10,271	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And we would talk on the radio they read me stars and stripes Stars and Stripes at the US military's
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,551	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Finally run daily paper
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:13,855	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Why would they redo Stars and Stripes
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:16,159	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	What was my only contact with the outside world
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,463	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But in an loc they would
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:21,279	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Be over is almost 24 hours a day
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:26,399	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And they kept the North Vietnamese off our back so these were people who I owed my life to
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:31,007	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And it was on one of these bombing runs keeping the North Vietnamese off their backs
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:34,079	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	That Michael blassie flew his 132nd
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:37,919	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Final mission
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:42,527	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	We'll never know exactly what happened on May 11th 1972
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:48,927	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Witnesses recalled that day's fighting as being particularly intense and chaotic so a lot of what we do know comes from
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,207	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Flappy's commanding officer
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:57,119	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Was flying in a plane alongside black most of all
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:14:03,519	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Call was how bright everything was spelled with these planes and helicopters for Target
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:06,591	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Also Tracer rounds being fired from multiple enemy aircraft
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:13,759	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And they were taking ground fire the whole time but because they were flying into the sun they could
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:18,623	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	See where was coming from so this just added to the confusion of the battle
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:23,231	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And somewhere in the midst of the blinding sun in the chaos and confusion
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:29,631	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Michael's plane was hit by ground fire remember Michaels playing as designer flight love
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,399	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I got hit
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:35,263	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	There's no more than 500 feet above the ground he has lost control of the plane
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:38,847	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Buses playing bien streaming fuel inverted
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:41,407	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And it disappeared into the jungle below
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:43,199	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And there was no distress signal
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:46,271	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Which indicates that the pilot had probably been killed instantly
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:51,647	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I just playing the crash deep in North Vietnamese held territory
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:54,463	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Helicopter team tried to get to the crash site
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,999	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But did Heavy enemy fire
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:57,535	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I don't leave after just a few minutes
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:01,119	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Rather than think of me anyway
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:03,423	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Get the side or find out exactly what happened
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:06,495	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Michael blassie declared missing in action
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,263	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Resume.
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:12,639	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The blasi family was informed that Michaels Body would not be coming home
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:13,919	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But with
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:18,783	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I don't edit the strangest thing that when there is no
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:22,111	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Body there is no Gathering
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:27,743	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	When Michael died it wasn't the first time Patricia it had to deal with the loss of a close family member
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:30,559	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Other parents came from big families
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:32,351	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Advance and uncle's lots of funerals
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:35,167	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	End Time song passed away
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:37,983	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They processed it by gathering together at the funeral
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:38,495	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Talking
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,287	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	A person's life
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:40,799	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They were
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,615	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Bedtime
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:45,663	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Without a body to place beneath the tombstone
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:47,199	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Family Optics
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,479	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Not that material
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:51,039	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I mean there was a memorial Gathering but it was
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:53,599	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Did it still wasn't the same
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:55,647	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	We didn't talk about it we didn't
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,207	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Everyone just was
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:00,767	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They was at 3 I remember it's just like quiet
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:04,351	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And then it was just like we will go on with our lives
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:06,655	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And and try to be normal well it wasn't Norm
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:09,215	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Patricia says that Michael's death
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:11,775	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Or rather they're not talking about Michael's death
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:14,335	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Ended up putting a strain on her parents marriage
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,383	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	A leader separated
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:19,455	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Patricia join the Airforce eventually attained the rank of Colonel
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:21,759	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Life in other words went on
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:24,831	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Even at the topic of Michael sat undiscussed
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,623	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Finished
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:29,951	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It was just sort of the put on an over on a Shelf
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:32,255	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	This thing that we didn't
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,791	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Get to deal with
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:35,583	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,655	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It didn't resurrect itself until
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:40,191	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	26 years later after he
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:43,007	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Was killed we
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,543	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Realize where he was
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:49,919	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	In 1994 more than two decades after Michael have been killed
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:52,735	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Patricia and her mother received a phone call
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,271	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Complete stranger
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:57,087	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And he said I'm Ted sampley
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:59,135	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And I am a former Green Beret
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,439	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Who served in Vietnam
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:06,559	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Get that we have sent passed away but back then he was sort of this minor celebrity
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:09,375	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Champion the cause of Vietnam pows Mia
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:12,959	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Just convince the government everything is new
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:16,287	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I was calling Patricia with outlandish theories about Michael death
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:22,431	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I mean there wasn't anything in his voice that was like angry or you know he would just matter-of-fact
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,479	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But he said I started
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:29,599	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Researching who was shot down on May 11th 1972 and
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:33,951	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And you know what was found with him and would that be on a fighter aircraft
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:39,071	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Evidence was circumstantial and his logic was long-winded but he said
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:42,143	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I believe your brothers and the Tomb of the Unknown
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:48,031	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But the body from Vietnam that President Reagan in buried with Pomp and ceremony in 1984
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:51,103	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Wasn't unknown at all
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:52,127	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	That wasn't fact
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:53,663	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Michael
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:58,783	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	First Patricia didn't know what to make of any of
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:00,319	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Garcinia
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:02,367	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The body never even been recovered
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:04,927	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Remember she herself was in the Air Force
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,975	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Getting off the phone with sample
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,279	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	She caught the Air Force cattle the office
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:11,583	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Could this be true
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:14,399	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Could Michael be in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:15,679	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:20,031	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They said by no means is there anything to substantiate that your brothers in the two
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,567	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I said but you know what
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:25,663	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Thank you very much because that is the craziest story
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:29,759	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	That I could ever imagine that a known Soldier was in the time of the end
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:34,367	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I mean that's the crazy is it it's just
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,415	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It just didn't make sense
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:37,695	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I thought
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:42,047	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	This is the best example of Internet conspiracy garbage I've seen to date
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:43,583	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	This is Ben's Gonzales
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:48,191	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Through the young reporter at CBS Denver when he accidentally came across a post and family made on the internet
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:52,031	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Lattice theory that Michael blassie have been buried in the Tomb of the unknowns
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,079	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It was a 1997
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:56,127	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	3 years after the phone call with Patricia
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:59,455	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	He says yeah of course the First Tee totally dismissed
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:06,111	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And I thought I'm going to print it out I'm going to show it to college classes When I visit and say this is why we say don't believe everything you read on the internet
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:09,439	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And I did that I printed out had it on my desk at CVS
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:12,511	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And then one evening I sat down and started reading it and I thought
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,327	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Maybe I should check this out
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:20,703	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Direct evidence proving that Michael blassie was in the Tomb
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:22,495	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But that didn't make them wrong
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:27,359	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Whatever was known about the remains of the Vietnam unknown has never been repealed
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:31,967	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Was all part of the effort to make sure that the unknown could represent everyone who ever fought in the War
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:38,879	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But simply have come across some secondhand accounts suggesting that America's only set of unknown remains for
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:44,767	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	From Vietnam have been recovered from the aircraft that have been shot down in 1972
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:50,399	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And you only been able to find one missing plane that fully matched the description
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,703	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Michael blasius
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:54,751	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Still made it hard to believe you
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:57,567	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It was not supposed to bury any one of the two
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:00,127	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The chance you could be identified like this
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:02,943	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	So it's called few sources in the military
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:04,991	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Not asking any hard questions
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:06,527	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Just wondering
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:08,063	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Embarrassed
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,367	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Current government
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:13,951	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Possibly bury a known person in the Tomb of the unknowns
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,999	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Not tell anyone
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:18,047	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	One conversation in particular
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:23,423	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Told me there was an attitude with in some parts of the military that might allow something like this to happen I called up
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:28,799	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Researching The Pentagon and I tried to talk really around the issue I didn't want to let them know what I was working on
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:31,871	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I finally said what if you could figure out who this was
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:35,711	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	What if we could go in and identify this person and give them back to his family
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:37,503	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And his response was
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:38,015	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Thought I would never
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,319	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And I said but that would be the truth
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,623	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And he said well the truth doesn't matter
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,159	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	He's not a human being anymore
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:48,511	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	He's a symbol in America's most sacred military Shrine and we would never let the
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:49,023	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The happen
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:51,583	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	So I wrote down the truth doesn't matter on a post
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:54,143	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Stuck it to my computer console
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:56,191	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And I thought if there's a chance
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:59,519	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	You can figure out who this is and give him back to his family you should do
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,823	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It's began filing for Eric
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:04,639	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Try to get his hands on any government documents
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:05,919	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	About Michael blassie
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:08,479	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But there were things I wanted it only family member
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,783	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	We needed an affidavit
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,319	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	So that was when I reached out to the
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:15,135	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	In contact with Patricia
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:15,903	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Laid out of case
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,440	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Like that
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,464	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	How do I pattern
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:24,864	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And Vince and I started talking and I called my mom and I said you know what
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,888	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It's somebody
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:28,960	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And if it's Michael
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:30,752	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	You know we need to pursue it
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:34,336	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Eventually gave instantly way to file yet another foia request
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:35,616	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Special
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:38,432	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Get some documents related to Michael blassie
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:39,712	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I'm an Air Force Base in Texas
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:46,112	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Not mentioning it to him not mentioning the Unknown Soldier just asking for anything with Michael blasts his name is
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,648	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:54,048	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I got back to really thick envelope padded envelope which is more than I think I've gotten back from any other requests
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:22:00,448	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And I was actually back in Denver that point sitting in The Newsroom I opened it up and I was paging through it page after page and join
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:00,960	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:01,984	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	This is it
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:07,616	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Cuz this wasn't just some small file continued Italy or a tantalizing clue
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:10,432	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	These were military documents showing
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:13,248	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The entire Unknown Soldier selection process
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:15,552	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	When combined with his earlier research
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:18,368	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Documents in Gonzales now held in his hands
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:20,416	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Nearly complete
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:21,952	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	What the government do
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:24,256	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Regarding the identity of the Unknown Soldier
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:27,072	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Starting with something very important
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:29,376	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Then known almost from the beginning
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:33,472	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	That Michael blasius remains had been recovered in Vietnam
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:35,776	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And if they'd been recovered by Chris Calhoun
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:38,336	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The Army ranger stations in the unlock
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:41,152	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	You know I don't really know exactly what went down
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:45,504	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But I do I do know that everything pointed to me
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:48,832	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Now remember telling didn't know Blackie personally
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:51,648	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	He was friends with a bunch of the other pilots in Michael Squadron
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:54,720	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They were the guys reading the newspaper to Calhoun over the radio
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:57,536	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It was on one of those Lonely Nights
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,048	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Chatiw
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:22:59,840	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They started telling them
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:00,608	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Mount Michael
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:04,704	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The only thing I know is they asked me that one of their Squadron mates have been shot down
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:07,008	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They gave me the coordinates
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:10,592	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And they wanted to know if we could get the body back
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:16,992	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	This was in October of 1972 over 5 months since blasts he's playing and disappeared into the jungle
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:19,808	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They knew they were asking a lot
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:22,624	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	So I think if that Rapport wasn't there
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:26,720	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Then the request would have never come and I would have never acted on
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:29,536	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Christopher matter his regimental Commander
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:32,864	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Who assembled a special South Vietnamese Patrol
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:33,632	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Dressed up as the enemy
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,680	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	In North Vietnamese unit
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,728	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Uniforms with
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,032	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	North Vietnamese weapons
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,824	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And they went out
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:42,848	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	In no man's land
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,896	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And they found the wreckage
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:47,712	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And they brought back to me
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:50,784	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	What was left of the remains of Michael blassie
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,344	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	In a black
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,368	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Plastic bag
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:57,184	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It remains did not get this damn much
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,976	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Just sixbones
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,280	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But they also brought back other evidence
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:04,352	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	An inflated life raft with serial numbers
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,120	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Parachute
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:06,400	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Carmichael's flight suit
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:07,680	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Critically
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:10,496	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And that was a good shape
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:14,592	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Pictures of him pictures of his family pictures of his sister
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:16,640	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It was no question
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:18,432	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The Remains were Michaels
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:21,760	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Kristin Hannah the bag with everything in it
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:24,832	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Awesome crew chief of the week's one outgoing helicopter
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:26,112	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But he got the bag
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:28,160	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The crew chief got the bag
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:31,488	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And when you saw the remains I go in the chopper I mean
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:36,608	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	What was your girl we were we were sending him home to his fans
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:38,400	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	You know we were doing what was right
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:42,496	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And of course those South Vietnamese rooster live stick
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,336	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Get his body from the wreckage
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:48,640	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Any deserve to go home
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:55,296	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I just assumed that Michael's remains would be returning to his family
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:58,880	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But according to Vince's documents that's not what happened
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:01,952	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The Remains along with the survival gear
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:06,048	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	What eventually arrived at the Army Central identification laboratory in Hawaii
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:08,096	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But not before the wallet
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:10,656	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Continue the ID that could link the bones to blasi
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:11,680	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Went missing
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:14,240	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	You know you knew about the missing wallet
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:17,568	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Out of the lab using now outdated techniques
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:21,408	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Determined that the remains did not match Michael blasius physical description
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:22,944	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	He's dead
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:24,480	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Dedicated as
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:25,248	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Btb
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:27,040	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Believes to be
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:27,552	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Michael blassie
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:31,136	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Got a positive match to Army policy
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:34,464	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Wacky family could not even be told that any remains have been found
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:41,632	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Meanwhile pressure began to mount in the Pentagon to place a veteran from Vietnam in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:42,912	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It was politics
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,960	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	There's also patriotism
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:47,008	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Why there was a crass
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:48,544	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Political angle to do this
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:50,336	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	To make nice with the Vietnam veterans
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,384	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Are there was also a Feeling
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:55,968	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Of we need to get someone in that tomb so the nation can feel around this
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:58,528	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But by the 1980s
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:01,600	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It was only one set of unidentified remains left
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,392	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The ones labeled
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,928	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Bleed to be Michael blassie
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:07,232	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	1980
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:10,560	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Labs ordered to strip their main their Formal Connection with blassie
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:14,144	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I'm taking the anonymous designation x26
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:15,936	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	1984
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:20,032	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	With the Reagan Administration eager to put someone on the tomb before election day
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:22,080	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They were told to prepare
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:23,872	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	26 for burial
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:24,896	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And I spoke with
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:29,504	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Technicians at the Army lab later who said we gave them every answer
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:33,088	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Possible to say don't do this the technology is coming
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:35,392	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	This is not an unknown set of remains
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:39,744	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The lab technician stole the Pentagon that new dna-based technology was being developed
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:42,048	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It would allow it remains to be conclusively identified
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:44,352	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They also put into the artifact

EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:33,216	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	On May 14th 1998
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:39,360	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The Department of Defense disinterred the remains of the Vietnam veteran from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier

EDL	00:30:57,536	00:31:00,608	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Then all the sudden man walked up and said well
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:02,144	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	When we opened the tomb
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:04,704	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	To do the DNA test
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:08,544	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Michael's artifacts were in the Tomb with him
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:11,872	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And what would you like us to do with them
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:18,784	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The life raft in other items have been found at the crash in 1972 I mean the only physical evidence
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:20,320	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Aside from the missing wallet
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:22,880	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	That could have tied the remains to Michael blassie
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:26,464	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But it was to preserve the artifacts or to hide them
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:29,024	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Someone at the Army lab in Hawaii
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:31,584	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I put them where no one would ever think to look
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:33,632	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The casket with Michael
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:39,520	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I've been sitting in the two underneath the guards in the crowds in the Arlington soil
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:41,056	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	14 years
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:43,104	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They were in a box
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:47,200	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And so after we buried Michael in St Louis
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:50,016	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	There was a reception and then once everyone laugh
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:54,112	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	We sit around the table and my brother George
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:56,160	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Opened up the box and started
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:57,952	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Pulling out the life raft
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:00,000	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Portions of his
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:03,328	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Parachute portions of his flight suit
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:07,424	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And I have them with me today I I keep it with me
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:12,032	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I was really glad I'm really glad to have them
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:19,200	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Today there is nobody representing Vietnam at the Tomb of the unknowns
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:21,248	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And thanks to improved forensics
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:25,088	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It will likely never be an unknown from Iraq
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:26,368	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Or Afghanistan
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:27,904	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Or any future War
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:35,072	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Military is now in the process of using the DNA from the families of missing veterans to identify / 604
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:37,632	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	He sets of unknown remains from the Korean War
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:42,496	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It's conceivable that they could use the same techniques on the Korean unknown inside the tomb
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:45,568	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Guns from World War 1 and World War II
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:46,336	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Safe

EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:05,280	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Datura still take pictures on their phones and the guard still make their rounds in perfect silent precision

EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:40,352	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	In order to
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,912	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Have an unknown

EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:15,168	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It means that she's got to know some of the guards
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:18,240	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	One of them lights holder that their mission

EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:56,896	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	After this
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:03,808	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Between the beeps bongs and chatter of our devices
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:07,136	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:19,584	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	When I was a little boy
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:21,376	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	My parents and
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,656	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I think my grandparents
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:24,704	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Live just outside of Washington DC
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:29,056	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They took me to Arlington Cemetery to see the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:32,896	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And I've seen a reason I remember it so well
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:34,432	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And the reason
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:36,992	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I became interested in the Tomb again more recently
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:41,600	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Is not the mysterious soldier in the Tomb projecting
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:46,464	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Whatever you want on to his anonymity exactly the gar
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:50,560	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And it's not so scaredy of the Guard keeping vigil like
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:53,376	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Solemn Duty as much as it is what the guard is
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:54,400	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Physically doing
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:59,264	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And what they're doing most of the time it's just taking 21 steps to the left
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:36:59,776	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Turning
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:01,824	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Stopping for 21 seconds
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:04,384	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And turning and stopping for another 21
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:07,456	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Been taking 21 steps to the right
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:10,528	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Stopping again turning again stopping again stepping again
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:12,832	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Over and over and over
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:16,160	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Until there's a guard change every 30 minutes to an hour
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,952	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	That's something very
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:19,232	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Very precise

EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:05,568	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Annies
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:11,968	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Even more so he's like the innards of a Swiss clock the way that they move together and then they move in time
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:12,736	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Stunning

EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:24,256	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	This way of
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:25,536	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Magnifying the silence
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:29,120	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Around it is it kind of weird silence
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:30,400	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	To it
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:31,936	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And apparently
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:34,496	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	To get this right they train and practice for months
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:36,544	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Facility
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:39,360	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Chinese it's almost meditative like you said like
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:43,200	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Inside of the silence we hear the clicking of their shoes in there
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:44,224	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Heels together
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:47,808	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	You do get this space that's created inside of it that's
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:48,320	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Derry Medical
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:51,648	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The word that just instantly came to mind is like Zen
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:53,696	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	You watch the market marching back and forth
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:55,488	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And the guards
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:57,536	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	When you doing it they don't seem a lot
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:38:58,048	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	In the performance
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:38:59,072	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Instead
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:00,608	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	At every step
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:01,632	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They are totally present
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:03,936	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They're completely aware of their surroundings
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:06,496	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They're truly doing nothing
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:07,520	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But this
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:09,568	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Unless

EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:35,488	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The way it is now is not the way it always was it evolve into all of this kind of
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:37,024	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Pomp and ceremony at home
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:40,864	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	When it was first married in 1921
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:45,984	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	With a big moment I think it was the first like Nationwide radio dress that the president
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:49,568	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Ever gave was from the commemoration the Tomb of the Unknown
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:52,384	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But it was just kind of a slow stones
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:53,663	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Slab
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:55,967	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	End
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:59,295	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Between a second-rate monument for a while
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:01,343	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But people would picnic fare
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:05,183	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And photographers would like cuz it has a great view of
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:07,743	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Yeah I love both of them to surrounding area cuz it's fun
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:11,583	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Is hell and photographers would actually kind of set up shop there and people would like
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:15,423	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Who's on the 2
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:20,031	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And people but apparently like veterans caught on to this and started complaining about it cuz
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:20,799	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They saw that kind of
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:21,311	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Keyboard
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:23,103	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Treating it yeah like
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:27,199	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Cigarettes on it
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:31,295	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And so they kind of complaint about the Congress and eventually
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:33,343	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The government has money to it to post
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:34,111	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Guard
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:36,927	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And then starting the 1937 the guard was
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:38,207	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	24/7
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:40,255	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And I think a painting
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:43,839	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Records on this one some say night since 1937 other say since 1948
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:45,119	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The guard has
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:45,631	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Never left
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:48,703	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	State Fair
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:51,519	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And then nothing happened during that time is that
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:53,567	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	They always intended for there to be like Amour
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:43:00,479	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Updated fancy tune but it just took them forever to get around to getting the funding and spit events that they did
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:02,783	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And so they built the kind of the giant sarcophagus
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:04,063	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Annie 1931
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:07,903	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And for that date they went to this query in Colorado actually
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:09,439	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	To ensure that they got the exact
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:11,999	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Same marble as the Lincoln Memorial
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:16,863	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And it wasn't designed by these guys it was sculpted like the actual physical problems by this light
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:19,167	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Gorilla
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:21,983	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Who were the Italian brothers
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:26,591	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Who sculpted like everything is called the Lincoln Memorial and my favorite is a sculpted the two lions
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:27,615	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	In front of the
EDL	00:43:28,127	00:43:28,639	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	New York City
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:30,175	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Wow
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:31,967	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And then
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:33,759	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	In 1956 that's when we started
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:34,271	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Adding is
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:35,551	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Further
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:37,087	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	World War II
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:43,231	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Excetera hangzhou just built and built and built
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:45,279	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It has the image of
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:48,351	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	An almost Timeless tradition when you see it like this
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:50,399	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But actually kind of
EDL	00:43:50,399	00:43:51,167	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	The fact
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:51,935	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	This is
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:52,959	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Something that was
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:56,287	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	You know iterated upon and improved and
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:43:58,847	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Given a little more weight over time
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:04,735	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Aw appreciate it because I love when something iterative in the direction of honing towards austerity in LA
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:07,295	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Internet
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:09,087	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I'm feeling like clutter
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:10,367	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Getting more casual
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:11,135	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Or something
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:12,415	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It's a fascinating
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:13,439	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Place
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:14,975	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Particularly because of the
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:16,255	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Ceremony makes
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,535	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	All the more
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,047	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Special
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:22,399	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Have you ever had a chance to speak to one of the guards when you join the 40
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:24,191	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I confess
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:31,103	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Did not manage to Teresa guard in time for this coda
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:37,503	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:41,599	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	But I got the next best thing which is I found it one of the guards dude of course
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:42,111	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Ireddit
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:47,487	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And of course
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:53,887	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	What are things like when your reporter and you seen ask me anything thread you're like you go through it hoping someone's going to ask like
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:45:00,031	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Question you would ask only question I want to ask
EDL	00:45:00,543	00:45:02,591	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Just doing the long 30 minutes long hour
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:03,871	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Marching back and forth
EDL	00:45:05,151	00:45:06,687	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Meditative state right
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:08,479	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	And to finally something like that
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:10,527	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	That's right and the guard responded
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:15,903	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I wish I could say that while we were doing this job we're just meditating I wanted means to guard the unknown
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:17,695	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	We are human and we are on duty for long
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:20,255	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	It's our minds do Wonder quite a bit
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:24,863	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Was so disappointing to read
EDL	00:45:24,863	00:45:27,167	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	No but it's really human you know
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:31,263	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I know but you were here to hear the irony was like I realized like when I was doing the story
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:37,663	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Whatever they want on to the mystery of love

EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:42,783	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Repertorial and being really conceited and thinking like I'm above that
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:43,295	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	I don't fault
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:48,415	| 344_The_Known_Unknown_pt_01 |	Symbolism
