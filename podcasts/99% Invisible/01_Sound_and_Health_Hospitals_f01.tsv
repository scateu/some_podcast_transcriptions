EDL	00:00:26,112	00:00:27,904	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Sound can have serious impacts
EDL	00:00:27,904	00:00:29,696	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Our health and well-being
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:35,328	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And ever since people moved into cities we've been exposed to an unhealthy amount of noise
EDL	00:00:35,328	00:00:39,424	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Cars power lines and a constant ding of our devices
EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:42,752	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	We live in a very noisy world
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:46,592	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Most of the noises we hear aren't designed to work together
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:52,992	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	This is the second part of our special series on sound and health supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:55,296	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	We're taking a look at how I more intentional approach
EDL	00:00:55,296	00:00:58,368	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The sound can help us live better healthier lives
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:01:00,928	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And there's no better place to think about health
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:01,696	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Vet hospitals
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:08,352	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Is an anesthesiologist at Vanderbilt Medical Center
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:10,912	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	He spends a lot of his time in the operating room
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:12,960	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The operating room is an inch

EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:18,080	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Cuz we think of it it's like my cockpit if you will and anesthesiology
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:19,360	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Related a lot to Aviation
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:23,968	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	We are culture of safety we have safety checklist just like Pilots do
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:28,576	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	We think of takeoff and Landing just like putting a patient to sleep and waking them up
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:32,928	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	If I can wake someone up from anesthesia we call it land in the plane
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:36,000	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Landing the plane takes Focus
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:37,792	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Hangzhou doesn't work in silence
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:40,352	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	It might come as a surprise but in the OR
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:42,400	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	There's music playing all the time
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:48,288	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	There's great data that shows that music improve surgical efficiency which can translate to an economic benefit
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:50,592	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And music subjectively makes us feel good
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:53,408	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And if you're working long hours being difficult
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:54,688	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Court cases in the operating room
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:57,248	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	If you can improve mood certainly there's benefit
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:00,064	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Who chooses the music
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:01,600	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	It's usually the surgeon
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:05,952	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And if the surgeons excited the surgery is over and the Music Volume gets cranked up
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:10,304	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	It's really hard for us to be delicate and intentional and Artful
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,328	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Elegant
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:16,448	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Joe remembers one surgery where music was playing and then all the sudden
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:18,752	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The patient's Vital Signs started the crash
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:22,080	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Now my alarms are going off the music volume is high
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:27,712	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The surgeon and I are having to raise our voices and almost yell at each other to communicate
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:29,248	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Not because we're mad at each other
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:31,040	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	But just to understand each other
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:37,952	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	So Joan is researchers are trying to figure out how to get the benefits of Music in the OR
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:41,024	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Without the risk of hearing we built this city on rock and roll
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,816	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Well someone is having a heart attack
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:49,984	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	I'm working with another anesthesiologist on a device which is called the canary box
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,800	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The canary box has two levels of alarm
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:55,872	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Warning Zone and the danger zone
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:03:00,224	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	When the alarm is in the warning Zone
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:01,504	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	It haves
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,016	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The Music Hall
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:05,600	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And when the alarm is in the danger zone
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,880	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	It turns the music off
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:12,256	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Fixing house sounds work together in the operating room is a step in the right direction
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:14,048	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	But it's part of a bigger problem
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:16,096	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Doctors know more about the human body than ever
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,888	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And are better equipped
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:18,912	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	To save your life
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:19,680	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	But still
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,984	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Hospitals are horrible places to get bed
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:24,544	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	That sound designer Joel Beckerman
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,568	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And he's right
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:28,384	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Hospitals can be bad for your health because hospitals
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,664	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Sound
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,176	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Terrible
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:35,552	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	I think of when I walk into the neuro ICU and I hear the automatic door was open
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,064	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Closes
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:39,136	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	If people walk by it opens and closes without
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,672	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Anyone going in or out
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,464	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And as I walk in there's the
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,768	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	How about people talking
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:47,072	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And it might be clinicians in might be patient
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:47,584	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Families
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:49,376	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	I hear the
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:50,912	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Rolling of the
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:54,240	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Big metal cart that houses all the meals for the patients
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,544	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And it's the wheels rolling on the hardwood floor

EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,856	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Pretty rose
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,136	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	It goes up

EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:34,943	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And 90 decibels is as loud as a motorcycle passing by your so-called

EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,551	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Hospitals can be really loud
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:41,599	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	But volume isn't the only problem
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:44,927	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	I hear alarms coming from multiple patient rooms
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,719	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And I don't know what's wrong with the patients
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:51,583	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The alarms are difficult to localize so I'm not sure which rooms they're coming from
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,375	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And even when he knows what he's listening
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:57,215	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Joe has a hard time figuring out what device is making noise
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,775	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	It could be the IV infusion pump
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:01,055	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The epidural pump
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:04,639	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The intra-aortic balloon pump the dialysis machine with ventilator

EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:12,831	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	There is a heart monitor that makes 86
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,599	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	It's different alarms
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:16,159	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	There's no way that
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:17,951	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	That can be meaningful to anybody
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:19,743	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The scary thing is
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,279	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Most of these alarms
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,303	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Are false alarm
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:27,423	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	It could be due to a loose connection or a temporary blip in the patient's vital signs
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,983	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	But most of these alarms don't tell you anything useful
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:32,031	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Still they saturate
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:33,055	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The hospital sounds game
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,615	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	I go home at night
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:39,967	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And I still hear the beeping of alarms in the beeping of pulse oximetry in my head
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:49,183	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Clinicians are notified

EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:55,071	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	I love those alarms like I have my address but I get excited
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:59,423	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	But the high from alarms is not sustainable it's actually pretty exhausting
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,983	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The result is something called alarm fatigue
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:04,287	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The problem with alarm fatigue is
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:07,615	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	That didn't sound which caregivers and
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,895	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Learn to ignore
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:12,223	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Means that they also ignore critical alarm
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:14,271	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And patients die
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:18,111	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	This is a very very serious problem that needs to be addressed
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:24,511	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	People complain it's difficult to sleep at night

EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:34,463	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	When you think of the design of a patient monitor or any device
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:37,279	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	You think of the visual complexity of the device
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,071	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And expensive the device
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:42,655	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	But why is the sound that's generated by this
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:45,983	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Highly engineered visually attractive expensive device
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:50,079	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Usually comes out of a very cheap speaker

EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,799	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	This is him playing the piano right now
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,615	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	I've been playing the piano since I was 5 years old
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:26,431	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	So the music and medicine was part of my life
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,223	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Together for a long time
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:31,807	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Right now alarms are loud and annoying
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,087	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	But they don't have to be
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:36,159	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	They just have to be different from all the other sounds in the hospital
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,231	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Imagine that somebody down the hall where to scream
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,327	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And it's not loud but you can perceive it
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:45,631	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	We have our attention diverted
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:49,471	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Not because of the volume but because of the acoustic features of the human scream
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,287	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	There's an acoustic feature called roughness
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:54,335	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Which has enhanced sensitivity in the Invicta
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:55,871	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	So we have this
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,663	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Reflexive response
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:00,479	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	This has a surprising implication
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,247	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	4 alarm tone
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:02,783	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Alarms
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:06,367	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Can be softer than background noise and you can still perceive them
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,415	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	A lot of the alarms
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,183	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Have
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:14,047	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	What's called a flat amplitude envelope and Sophie imagine the emergency broadcast signal that you
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:14,815	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	UCare on TV
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:21,983	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	That's a flat amplitude on for a minute on natural sound and R&B
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:26,079	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The unnatural sound is effective at driving or attention
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:28,639	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	But in a hospital these unnatural sounds
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:30,175	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Layer on top of each other
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:32,991	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Creating a wall of sound that we tune out
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,527	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Elsa create a struct
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:36,575	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Harming our minds and bodies
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,367	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Pair that
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:42,207	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	With what's called a percussive amplitude envelope which has an exponential.
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:44,511	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The case I think about if you're clinking to wine glass
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:45,535	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Together
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,071	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	That's
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:50,655	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	A sharp upstroke with an exponential decay Nexus and we have in nature
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:53,471	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	By changing the amplitude envelope
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:55,007	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	To something more natural
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,031	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	You can go from this
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,079	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	To this
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,151	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	But even this sound
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,431	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Doesn't tell you a lie
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,479	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The alarms need to be more
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,247	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Informative
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:09,855	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	What we are particularly working on is how to contain information and sound
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,647	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And that is what we call auditory icon
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:14,463	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	For example having a lub dub
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:19,327	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Heartbeat type of sound in an alarm that is indicative of a cardiovascular problem
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:23,935	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The result is something that can tell you exactly what's wrong
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,727	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Before you enter the room
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,007	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And that's just the beginning
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:30,847	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	I don't want to know just when something is bad
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,639	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	I want to know when something is trending

EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:40,575	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Prices of monitor that right now I have to
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:41,599	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Baby staring at it
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:45,439	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	I want vibrotactile information that is wearable and comfortable
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,719	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And I wanted to provide

EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,583	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Or habituated to it
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,887	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And I want auditory information
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,423	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	That is directed
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:58,495	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	To me when I get auditory information
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,263	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	It's
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:03,103	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Information that can mean something in that I need to act upon it
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:06,687	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Then we can use the hospital soundscape to do even more

EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:14,623	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	You think of a patient in the ICU when they're non-communicative
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:16,159	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Or in long-term
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:16,671	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Q care
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,463	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Does patient often get neglect
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:19,999	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	But they
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:24,351	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Have ways to communicate in a non-traditional sense for example to the autonomic nerves
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:29,471	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Patients who can't speak or communicate their feelings are still expressing themselves
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:31,519	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	To their heart rate or their body temperature
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:34,847	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	So they're communicating but not in a traditional verbal sense
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:37,151	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	How can we take this physiologic
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:37,663	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Signals
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:41,759	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Turn them into sound in a way that we can start to ask your team
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:43,039	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	What these patients
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,063	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	What is people
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:44,575	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Rst
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:47,647	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The result is something called Bayou Music
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,671	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Pioneered by
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:51,487	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	A colleague of Jose at McGill University in Montreal
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:55,071	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Sensors on the patient's body to text vital signs
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:57,375	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And that makes the data into sound
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:59,167	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Heart rate controls the tempo
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:00,959	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Temperature determines the notes
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:01,983	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And skin sweat
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:02,751	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Drives the melody
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:05,311	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The result is actually kind of beautiful
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:11,199	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Bayou Music is being looked at as a way for nonverbal autistic children to express themselves
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:13,247	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Here's a calm State of Mind
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,623	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And here's the Nexus One
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:24,767	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	You don't have to be a medical specialist to hear the difference
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:26,815	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Our hope is that
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:32,703	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	We can make it easy to implement throughout the world where you don't have to be at Bay
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:38,591	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	High-powered academic institution with PSEG equipment to make this a reality
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:42,943	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Joel Beckerman believes our Hospital soundscapes can be improved
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:45,503	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	From an unhealthy and dangerous cacophony
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,783	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	To something more useful
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:51,135	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Imagine you could walk into a room
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,159	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:55,743	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Be able to sit through enormous data sets
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,535	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	By sound alone
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:59,583	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	We actually create an idealized
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,631	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Soundscape for what
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,679	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Personification of data
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:06,495	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Idea might be in
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,775	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	A hospital room of the future
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:13,919	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Cardigan
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,455	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Sounds good
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:20,575	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	You don't need to be musician you don't need to be really intensely trained for this
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:25,951	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	You can determine whether a pitch is higher than another were lower than another if they're pretty far apart
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:30,303	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	You can determine whether a sound is rising or sound is
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:30,815	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Falling
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:34,143	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	A very very short period of time we can help
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:35,423	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	People understand
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,703	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Those differences
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:37,727	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Do all different
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:40,031	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Healthcare data points
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,567	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Do understand
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:43,103	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	What a patient
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:47,455	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Needs for weather. Patient is okay and they can turn their attention elsewhere
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:56,671	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	When I was a music score
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:16:00,767	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	Piano teacher told me the more you actively listen to Jazz and you practice
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:03,327	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	You're adding colors to your palette
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:08,447	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	The more I study the more I practice the more I listen I have more colors on my palette
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:10,751	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	I can create a beautiful painting
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:14,847	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	That's another reason why we need to do this is cuz this adds colors to a pallet
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,639	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	And I think it's important
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:20,991	| 01_Sound_and_Health_Hospitals_f01 |	From the patient care perspective that we make the most beautiful painting that we can create
