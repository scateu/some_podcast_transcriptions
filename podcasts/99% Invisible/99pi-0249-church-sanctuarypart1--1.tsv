EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:19,807	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And he said

EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,575	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	But it's not always that simple

EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,351	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Depends on the individual
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:39,679	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	It depends on what they say and how they say it
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:42,239	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And if they have any backing
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:44,543	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	So basically it was my decision
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,103	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Based on my experience and
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:49,151	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	What the person said because

EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:33,055	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	They didn't want to encourage migrants to report immigration when they knew it was almost certain they be deported
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:36,895	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	So they held a series of meetings to figure out what to do
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,431	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And that's when Jim Corbett
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:39,455	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Showing up
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:43,551	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	It's hard to describe him because he was
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,575	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Unique
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,343	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Figure

EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:53,535	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And he knew a lot
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:54,559	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	It's about philosophy
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:56,607	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	He was also a Quaker
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:14:00,191	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And as the refugee crisis in Tucson continue to grow
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:03,263	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Jim's religious Faith compelled him to take action
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:06,847	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	He started letting refugees stay at his house
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:10,175	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And in some other ramshackled trailers scattered around his property
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:15,551	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Jim starts coming to meetings at Southside Presbyterian Church where they're discussing the deportations
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:17,343	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Another one of those meetings

EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:22,975	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Contention at that point
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:24,511	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	To me was
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:29,119	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	John I don't think we have any choice under the circumstances
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:29,887	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Except
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:30,911	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	2

EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:40,639	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	My response was how the hell do you figure that Jim
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,919	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And he
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,431	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Explain

EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:57,791	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And he basically said
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:15:04,191	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	We have to conclude from history that they got it right those were the folks who understood
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:04,959	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Good and got it right
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:12,383	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Dungeon pointed to the church and its failure to protect Jewish people fleeing the Holocaust in the 1930s

EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:17,503	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Many Jews were detained and deported back to Germany where they were killed
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:20,575	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Jim argued that Christians should have done more
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:23,903	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And he said they
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,671	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	They failed
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:26,463	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	They failed,
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,047	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	As people of Faith as the church
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:33,375	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And I said yeah you're right
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:36,447	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And his punchline was
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:36,959	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	John
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:41,823	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	I don't think we can allow that to happen on our border
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,103	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	In our time
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,407	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And after a couple of
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,943	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Sleepless nights
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:50,015	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	I went back to him and said yeah you're right
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:50,527	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	I
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,319	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	I

EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:56,927	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:57,695	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Not
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:58,719	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Do what you're asking
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:15:59,999	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	So
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,023	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Sign me up
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:05,119	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	At this point Jim Corbett had already done some border runs on his own
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:09,215	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Picking up migrants in Mexico and helping them cross the border into United States
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,775	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	But now Reverend Fife and a handful of others started helping him
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:15,103	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	At first they bring people across and put them up at Jim's house
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:17,663	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Play quickly became clear they needed more space
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:19,455	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	So once again
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:21,503	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Tim came to talk with Reverend V
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:23,551	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	He wanted the church to start hosting people
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:26,623	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	That was a question that the whole congregation had
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,135	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	How to deal with
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,695	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And that's not an easy choice for
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,719	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	For people to me
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,487	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	They talked
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:34,815	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And prayed and then voted to let Central American refugees stay
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,887	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Soon On Any Given night
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:40,703	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	The church would have dozens of people sleeping in the main gather
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:43,775	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Church members would provide food
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:47,871	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Close English lessons Medical Care and access to legal advice
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:51,199	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	They help the refugees strategize about what to do
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:54,527	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	It wasn't as if the migrants were entirely safe
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,063	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	We're still undocumented
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:58,111	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And face possible deportation
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:01,951	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	But they had access to resources guidance and a place
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:02,463	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Stay
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:10,399	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	The congregation at Southside was drawing along religious tradition when they decided to take the refugees into their Church
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:13,215	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	It's actually
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:15,007	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	An ancient tradition of
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:16,799	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Temples in

EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:19,871	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,919	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And sacred sites
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,711	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Of indigenous people
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:27,295	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	That goes back as far as any
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,831	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	History we know about
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:31,903	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	In Greek and Roman history people who are threatened with

EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:37,279	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	When the Roman Empire became Christian
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,815	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Churches took on the same function
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:44,959	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	The concept of sanctuary can also be found in medieval canon law and British common law

EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,023	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And as it turns out
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:12,607	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Government was keeping an eye on their growing operation
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,423	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Well what do we do under those circumstances
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:19,007	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Dances in in the only conclusion we came to was
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:21,823	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Well the only choice we have
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:22,591	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	Is
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,615	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	To go public
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,127	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	With what word
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:26,175	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	They thought maybe
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:27,199	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	By going public
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:29,503	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	The church could generate attention and Publix

EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:36,671	| 99pi-0249-church-sanctuarypart1--1 |	And in March of 1982
