EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:50,240	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	After World War II manzanar had been completely dismantled
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:53,568	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	By 1969 there were hardly any signs of it left

EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:25,312	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And ended up in a High Desert Valley
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:26,848	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	It was totally deaf
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:31,200	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	But a few miles outside of Lone Pine they found the Green Building
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:34,784	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And they turned off the highway onto a small dirt road
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:35,808	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Tumbleweeds
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,600	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	No trees

EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,464	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	In the background
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,256	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	What's the Sierra Nevada mountains
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:47,584	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Covered in snow it was a traumatic
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:49,120	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	A landscape as you could imagine
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:53,216	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The two men continued driving to the desert and then suddenly
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:55,776	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	They came across an old white pillar
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,056	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	With Japanese lettering on it
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:59,104	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Just was funny
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:01,408	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Like it was waiting there to be discovered
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:06,272	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	It was the original pillar marking the manzanar cemetery
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:09,344	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And it was surrounded by faded gravestone
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,136	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	People who had died while in the can
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,696	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	As they explored the area further
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:18,559	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Warren and Victor eventually came across a big pile of debris
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:23,167	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And we found all of these broken dishes and on the back of the dish
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,215	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Said Army

EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:30,591	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Indifferent things we found it was like an archaeological dig
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:32,127	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And reveal
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:34,943	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Historical reality kafka
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:43,391	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The two young man that found the remains of a camp in only a few decades earlier had imprisoned over 10,000 Japanese
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:44,159	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	These Americans
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:50,559	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And in the process they were helping uncover a dark chapter in US history that a lot of people at the time would have run
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:51,071	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Rather forgotten
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:55,167	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The incarceration of Japanese-Americans during World War II
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:59,263	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Wasn't even mentioned in most high school history textbooks in the 60s
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,055	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	There was no books don't stories
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:05,407	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	No information can find it in the card catalog in the library
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,455	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	So we started writing our own history
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:13,599	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And part of writing that history meant drawing attention to manzanar itself
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,903	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	When Warren and Victor found it
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:19,999	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The place had no historical designation no sign and no plaque
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,559	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	But that was all about to change
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:31,519	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Warren and Victor go back to Los Angeles but they knew they wanted to come back and bring more people with them next

EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:46,879	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Piled into cars and vans and buses
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,671	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	On a pilgrimage to manzanar
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:52,767	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Going to that part of California
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:55,071	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	At that time of year was just stupid

EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:03,007	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	But the Shivering pilgrims followed Warren and Victor's directions to the cemetery
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:08,639	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	So we cleaned up the cemetery and we brought paint and then wire brushes and
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:12,223	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Scraped everything down and repainted The Monuments

EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:17,599	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	In terms of refurbishing the area
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,879	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	We knew we were coming back
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:23,487	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Most of the people on the pilgrimage were younger Japanese-American
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,023	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	We never spend time at camp
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:28,607	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	But there were a few people there that day

EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:26,303	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	In the end after a few fiery meetings the manzanar committee convinced the state
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,839	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The plaque should read as follows

EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:16,479	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	But it didn't go over too well with some folks who lived in nearby towns

EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:35,679	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	But Sue Embry in the manzanar committee or undeterred
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,983	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The fact they were already thinking bigger
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:41,567	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	They wanted manzanar to be a National Historic Site
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:45,663	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	It's important to know that all this was a crying alongside a larger

EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:54,367	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Several Japanese American organizations had demanded an official apology from the US government and payments for the
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:56,671	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Those who have been incarcerated during the war
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,463	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And in 1988
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:00,767	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	President Reagan signed the civil liberties Act
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:06,143	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Getting $20,000 in reparations to every living person who had been sent to a camp

EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:14,591	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	So what is most important in this bill has less to do with property than With Honor
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:17,151	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Or here we admit a wrong
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:21,759	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Here we reaffirm our commitment as a nation to equal justice
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:22,527	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Under the law
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:32,255	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Sue embree was very involved in the redress movement and she wanted to keep the momentum going in the fight to get manzanar turned
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:34,047	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Into a National Historic Site
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:39,423	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	But the manzanar committee face stiff opposition from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:42,239	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The DWP actually own the land
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:43,775	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And the rights to its water
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:46,591	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	So here comes the middle-aged woman
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:52,991	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Saying know this land is really significant to us our community and to
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:55,295	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The region is south
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,343	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And we won
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:01,695	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	It to be a national park while the DWP didn't want to have any part of that
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:05,791	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The manzanar committee ended up drafting legislation for Congress
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:12,191	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And Sue Embraer flew to Washington DC to testify before the US Senate subcommittee on public lands National Park
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:12,703	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	In forest
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:15,519	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	She says democracy is a fragile concept
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:19,359	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Only as good and strong as the people who practice it
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:22,431	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Let us tell the world that we are a
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:22,943	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	People
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:24,735	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Strong
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,295	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And resolute
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:31,647	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Acknowledging the errors of our past
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,207	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	In order not to
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:35,743	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Repeat them in the future
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:40,095	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And this is the Legacy which we believe the master instructs site
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,399	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Can leave for future Generations
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,703	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The legislation passed
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,495	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And on March 3rd
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,775	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	1992
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:50,847	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Manzanar was declared a National Historic Site
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:54,175	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	But apart from the cemetery there was hardly anything there
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:59,295	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The National Park Service had to decide how they wanted to memorialize this Injustice
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:03,135	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	They formed a committee that included people who have been incarcerated at manzanar
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:09,279	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And the committee decided that they didn't just want to museum where visitors could read about what happened on placards
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:12,607	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	They wanted to rebuild portions of the camp
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:14,911	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Exactly as it had been during the war
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:17,983	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	So that visitors could feel what life had been like
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:20,031	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	C-walk in it's a
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:25,151	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Empty room although we have a cot in the stack of army blankets and a stack of mattress covers
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:27,455	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The bunch of cots up against the wall
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:31,551	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	This is Alyssa Lynch of the manzanar National Historic Site
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:33,087	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Showing me a rebuilt bearing
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:36,159	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	She says they tried hard to get it right
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:39,743	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	But it's still not as harsh as it would have been when people arrive to
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:41,535	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	You're back in 1942
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:44,095	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Give me the should be dirt blowing up to the floor
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,631	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The building should be creaking
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:48,703	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The thing is we have the option of either
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:50,239	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Don't make a mess they were
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:53,311	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	But not allowing people to walk in
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:56,127	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Because they wouldn't be safe for people to come into
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:58,431	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Or we could rebuild them
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:02,015	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	2 earthquake standards accessibility standards
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,807	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And that's what we chose to do
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,903	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Outside there's a dirt basketball court
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:12,767	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	With white metal hoops and a one-way Road tracing a long and winding circuit
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:13,791	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Through what used to be the
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:14,303	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The camp
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:18,143	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Signposts along the way show where specific buildings once stood
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:25,055	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	In some places cracked concrete foundations and the remains of Rock Gardens are still visible or have been
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:25,567	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Earth
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:29,151	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	In the distance you can see a rebuilt guardtower
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:30,687	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Is 40 ft tall
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:33,759	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	With lattice wood sides and a giant Searchlight at the
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:36,063	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The top it was very controversial
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:39,647	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Because a lot of the locals especially
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:42,207	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Did not want it to have a guard Tower because
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:46,303	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	People don't want it to reflect badly on the community
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:50,911	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The park service continue to seek guidance from folks who would actually lived at the camp
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:57,567	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Overtime people have said over and over the most important thing to show by the guard towers and the latrines
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:00,383	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	I've had people literally say you know
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:02,431	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	We're glad you have the visitor center
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,735	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	We really like to have the barracks
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:06,783	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	But no one will ever understand
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:09,087	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Until they go in and see that row a toilet
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:12,927	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Alyssa Lynch takes me to the site's newest edition
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:15,231	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	A replica of a woman's latrine
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:20,351	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	The building wasn't open to the public when I visited but she showed me inside
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,143	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	It's just an open room
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:24,703	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Does a long trough sink
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:26,239	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And a row of five toilet
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:27,775	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	With no dividers
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:28,543	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Between them
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:31,359	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	You hear over and over about the humiliation
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:33,151	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	You know I've heard women talk about
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:35,455	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Having your first period in public
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:40,319	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	You know which I think is a very personal thing to all people all women
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,111	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,159	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	There's no privacy here
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:48,511	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Lynch has spoken with hundreds of people who lived at manzanar
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:51,071	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	And they all have different perspective
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,095	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	It's on their time at camp
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:55,679	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Some people fondly remember the friendships they built here
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:21:00,031	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Others say the experience tore their family apart
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:01,567	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	Yes it had baseball teams
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:04,895	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	It also had a hundred and twenty armed soldiers
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:08,735	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	You know yes it has beautiful gardens but it also had guard towers
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:14,367	| 99pi-0253-manzanar-1 |	She just wants the site to show the full Messi history of what happened here
